        <p>The enteric bacterium <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, which is a pathogen that forms biofilms <italic>in vivo</italic>, can swarm over hard surfaces and form a variety of spatial patterns in colonies. Colony formation involves two distinct cell types: swarmer cells that dominate near the surface and the leading edge, and swimmer cells that prefer a less viscous medium, but the mechanisms underlying pattern formation are not understood. New experimental investigations reported here show that swimmer cells in the center of the colony stream inward toward the inoculation site and in the process form many complex patterns, including radial and spiral streams, in addition to previously-reported concentric rings. These new observations suggest that swimmers are motile and that indirect interactions between them are essential in the pattern formation. To explain these observations we develop a hybrid model comprising cell-based and continuum components that incorporates a chemotactic response of swimmers to a chemical they produce. The model predicts that formation of radial streams can be explained as the modulation of the local attractant concentration by the cells, and that the chirality of the spiral streams results from a swimming bias of the cells near the surface of the substrate. The spatial patterns generated from the model are in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Bacteria frequently colonize surfaces and grow as biofilm communities embedded in a gel-like polysaccharide matrix, and when this occurs on catheters, heart valves and other medical implants, it can lead to serious, hard-to-treat infections. <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> is an enteric bacterium that forms biofilms on urinary catheters, but in laboratory experiments it can swarm over hard surfaces and form a variety of spatial patterns. Understanding these patterns is a first step toward understanding biofilm formation, and here we describe new experimental results and mathematical models of pattern formation in <italic>Proteus</italic>. The experiments show that swimmer cells in the center of the colony stream inward toward the inoculation site and in the process form many complex patterns, including radial and spiral streams, in addition to concentric rings. To explain these observations we develop a model that incorporates a chemotactic response of swimmers to a chemical they produce.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A variety of spatial patterns in growing bacterial colonies are found both in nature and in the lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Budrene1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Wu1">[10]</xref>. When inoculated on semi-solid agar with succinate or other TCA cycle intermediates, motile <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells grow, divide, and self-organize into patterns ranging from outward-moving rings of high cell density to chevron patterns, depending on the initial concentration of the nutrient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Budrene1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Budrene2">[2]</xref>. When grown or simply placed in static liquids, cells quickly reorganize into networks of high cell density comprised of bands and/or aggregates, following exposure to succinate and other compounds. Chemotactic strains of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, a closely-related species, can also form concentric rings and other complex patterns in similar conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Woodward1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Berg1">[4]</xref>, and it has been shown that pattern formation in both species is driven by chemotactic interactions between the cells and a self-produced attractant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Budrene1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Woodward1">[3]</xref>. The gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> forms patterns ranging from highly branched fractal-like patterns to compact forms, depending on the agar and nutrient concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-BenJacob1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-BenJacob2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-BenJacob3">[11]</xref>. In all these systems proliferation, metabolism and movement of individual cells, as well as direct and indirect interactions between cells, are involved in the patterning process, but the mutual influences and balances between them that lead to the different types of patterns is difficult to dissect experimentally, and is best explored with a mathematical model. Understanding these balances would advance our understanding of the formation of more complex biofilms and other multicellular assemblies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Shapiro1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> is an enteric gram-negative bacterium that causes urinary tract infections, kidney stones and other diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Zunino1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Jones1">[16]</xref>. Pattern formation by <italic>Proteus</italic> was described over 100 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Hauser1">[17]</xref>, and the nature of these patterns has since been discussed in many publications. When grown in a liquid nutrient medium, the dominant phenotype of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> is a vegetative swimmer cell that is 1–2 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> long, has 1–10 flagella and moves using a “run-and-tumble strategy”, similar to that used by <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Berg1">[4]</xref>. Swimmers respond chemotactically to several amino acids, and can adapt perfectly to external signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Pearson1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>When grown on hard agar <italic>Proteus</italic> forms spectacular patterns of concentric rings or spirals. Swimmers differentiate into highly motile, hyperflagellated, multi-nucleated, non-chemotactic swarmer cells that may be as long as 50–100 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and that move coordinately as “rafts” in the slime they produce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Williams1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Fraser1">[20]</xref>. During pattern formation on hard surfaces swarmer cells are found mainly at the leading edge of the colony, while swimmers dominate in the interior of the colony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Rauprich1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Hauser1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Williams1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Douglas1">[21]</xref>. While much effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of swarming, to date little is known about how cells swarm and how cells undergo transitions between swimmers and swarmers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Williams1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Fraser1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Rather1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Wu2">[26]</xref>, but understanding these processes and how they affect colonization could lead to improved treatments of the diseases caused by <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, formation of periodic cell-density patterns in <italic>Proteus</italic> colonies has been interpreted as a result of periodic changes in the velocity of the colony's front, caused by the cyclic process of differentiation and de-differentiation of swimmers into swarmers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Rauprich1">[8]</xref>). Douglas and Bisset described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Douglas1">[21]</xref> a regime for some strains of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> in which swarmers form a continuously moving front, while concentric rings of high cell density form well behind that front. This suggests that pattern formation can occur in the absence of cycles of differentiation and de-differentiation. The similarity between this mode of pattern formation and that of <italic>Salmonella</italic> led us to ask whether the underlying mechanism for pattern formation in <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> might also be chemotactic aggregation of the actively moving swimmers behind the colony front.</p>
      <p>A number of mathematical models of colony front movement have been proposed, and in all of them swimmer cells are non-motile and swarming motility is described as a degenerate diffusion, in that swarmers only diffuse when their density exceeds a critical value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Esipov1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Ayati2">[31]</xref>. The dependence of the front propagation patterns on various parameters in one of these models is given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Czirk1">[29]</xref>, and while models can reproduce the colony front dynamics, it remains to justify treating the swarming motility as a degenerate diffusion process, since it is likely that the cell-substrate interaction is important. To replicate a periodically propagating front, Ayati showed that swarmers must de-differentiate if and only if they have a certain number of nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Ayati1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Ayati2">[31]</xref>. It was shown that this may result from diffusion limitations of intracellular chemicals, but biological evidence supporting this assumption is lacking, and further investigation is needed to understand the mechanism of front propagation.</p>
      <p>Here we report new experimental results for a continuously-expanding front and show that after a period of growth, swimmer cells in the central part of the colony begin streaming inward and form a number of complex multicellular structures, including radial and spiral streams as well as concentric rings. These observations show that swimmer cells are also motile, and that communication between them may play a crucial role in the formation of the spatial patterns. However, additional questions raised by the new findings include: (1) what induces the inward movement of swimmer cells, (2) why do they move in streams, (3) why do radial streams quickly evolve into spiral streams, and (4) quite surprisingly, why do all the spirals wind counterclockwise (CCW) when viewed from above. To address these questions we developed a hybrid model comprised of a cell-based component for cell dynamics and a continuum component for nutrients and the chemoattractant secreted by swimmer cells. The model has provided biologically-based answers to the questions above and guided new experiments. Previous models, including a continuum chemotaxis model for patterning we developed earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Xue1">[32]</xref>, have limitations discussed later that are not inherent in the hybrid model.</p>

        <title>Experimental findings</title>
        <p>Previous experimental work focused on expansion of the colony front and neglected the role of movement of swimmers in the pattern formation process in the interior of the colony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Rauprich1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Williams1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Douglas1">[21]</xref>, and the experimental results reported here represent a first step toward understanding their role. After a drop of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> culture is inoculated on a hard agar-like surface containing rich nutrient, the colony grows and expands. Under the conditions used here, the colony front expands continuously (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002332.s003">Video S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002332.s001">Figure S1</xref>) - initially as a disc of uniform density. The swarmers exist at the periphery of the colony, and the mean length of the cells decreases towards the center, as observed by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Matsuyama1">[33]</xref>. For the first 5–7 hours, swarmers migrate out the inoculation site, the slime layer gradually builds up and swarmers de-differentiate into swimmer cells behind the leading edge. Later we observe that swimmer cells in the colony stream inward, forming a number of complex patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The swimmer population first forms a radial spoke-like pattern in an annular zone on a time scale of minutes, and then cells follow these radial streams inward (1A). The radial streams soon evolve into spirals streams, with aggregates at the inner end of each arm (1B). A characteristic feature of this stage is that the spirals always wind CCW when viewed from above. Different aggregates may merge, forming more complex attracting structures such as rotating rings and traveling trains (1B, C). Eventually the motion stops and these structures freeze and form the stationary elements of the pattern (1B, C). Later, this dynamic process repeats at some distance from the first element of the pattern, and sometimes cells are recruited from that element. In this way, additional elements of the permanent pattern are laid down (1C). On a microscopic level, the transition to the aggregation phase can be recognized as transformation of a monolayer of cells into a complex multi-layered structure. Not every pattern is observable in repeated experiments, (for example, no observable rotating rings can be identified in (1D), probably due to sensitivity to noise in the system and other factors that require further investigation, variations in nutrient availability, etc., but the formation of radial and spiral streams always appear in repeated experiments.</p>

        <p>These new findings pose challenges to the existing theories of concentric ring formation in which swimmer cells are believed to be non-motile. Additional questions arise regarding the mechanism(s) underlying the formation of radial and spiral streams, rings and trains by swimmers, and what determines the chirality of the spiral streams. The macroscopic patterns are very different and more dynamic than the patterns formed in <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Budrene1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Woodward1">[3]</xref>, where cells interact indirectly via a secreted attractant, but the fact that swimmers move up the cell density gradient is quite similar. The non-equilibrium dynamics suggests intercellular communication between individual swimmer cells, and we determined that swimmer cells extracted from these patterns are chemotactic towards several amino acids, including Aspartate, Methionine and Serine (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002332-t001">Table 1</xref>). In the following we provide an explanation of the radial and spiral streams using a hybrid cell-based model, by assuming that cells secrete to a chemoattractant that they respond to.</p>

        <title>The hybrid cell-based model</title>
        <p>The spatial patterns of interest here are formed in the center of the colony where cells are primarily swimmers, while the role of swarmers is mainly to advance the front and to affect the swimmer population by differentiation and de-differentiation. Thus we first focus on modeling the dynamics in the patterning zone in the colony center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and later we incorporate the colony front as a source of swimmers. This enables us to avoid unnecessary assumptions on the poorly-understood biology of swarming and the transition between the two phenotypes. As noted earlier, swimmer cells are chemotactic to certain factors in the medium, and we assume that they communicate via a chemoattractant that they secrete, and to which they respond. Therefore the minimal mathematical model involves equations for the signal transduction and movement of individual cells, and for the spatio-temporal evolution of the extracellular attractant and the nutrient in the domain shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. We first focus on understanding the radial and spiral stream formation, which occurs rapidly, and during which the nutrient is not depleted and cells grow exponentially. During this period the nutrient equation is uncoupled from the cell equations and can be ignored. In the radial and spiral streams, cell density is relatively low and cells are still well separated, so we ignore the mechanical interactions between cells.</p>

        <p>It has been known for many years that the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway in <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> is very similar to that of <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Lux1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Bourret1">[36]</xref>. Recently all the chemotaxis-related genes of <italic>E. coli</italic> have been found in the <italic>Proteus</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Pearson1">[18]</xref>, and in view of the genetic similarity between <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, we describe motility and signal transduction in the former using the key ideas from the latter.</p>
        <p><italic>E. coli</italic> cells swim using a run-and-tumble strategy, which consists of more-or-less straight runs punctuated by random turns. In the absence of an attractant gradient the result is an unbiased random walk, with mean run time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>1 s and mean tumble time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.1 s. In the presence of an attractant gradient, runs in a favorable direction are prolonged, and by ignoring the tumbling time, which is much shorter than the run time, the movement of each cell can be treated as an independent velocity jump process with a random turning kernel and a turning rate determined by intracellular variables that evolve in response to extracellular signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Erban1">[37]</xref>. The signal transduction pathway for chemotaxis is complex and has been studied extensively both experimentally and mathematically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Lux1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Bourret1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Spiro1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Rao1">[40]</xref>. However the main processes are relatively simple, and consist of fast excitation in response to signal changes, followed by adaptation that subtracts out the background signal. These major processes are embedded in the following description of cell behavior.</p>

We further assume that the flux of the attractant at the interface of the two layers is linear in the difference of its concentration between the two layers. Thus the loss of attractant due to diffusion to the agar can be modeled as a linear degradation, and the degradation constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in (4) reflects the intrinsic degradation rate and the flux to the substrate.</p>

        <title>Radial streams result from an instability of the uniform cell distribution</title>
        <p>Before the emergence of radial streams, the colony expands with a continuous moving front (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002332.s003">Video S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002332.s001">Figure S1</xref>) due to the movement of swarmers, and the cell density is uniform except at the inoculation site, where cells may become non-motile or dormant.

Thus by the end of this period, the attractant concentration can be approximated by a cone-like profile centered at the inoculation site, with a uniform lawn of swimmers laid down. Here we show that starting from this initial condition, the mechanism introduced above can explain radial stream formation on the correct time scale, which is 5–15 minutes.

        <p>One can understand the breakup into streams as follows. By hypothesis, cells modulate their run lengths in response to the local concentration and the changes they measure via the perceived Lagrangian derivative of attractant along their trajectory, whether or not there is a macroscopic attractant gradient. Small local variations in cell density then lead to local variations in attractant to which the cells respond, and in the absence of a macroscopic gradient, an initially-uniform cell density evolves into a high cell density network, which in turn breaks into aggregates that may then merge (not shown). This has also been found both theoretically and experimentally in <italic>E. coli</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Budrene1">[1]</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g004">Figure 4.4</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Xue1">[32]</xref>). If we describe the cell motion by a 1-D velocity jump process, a linear stability analysis of the corresponding continuum equations predicts that the uniform distribution is unstable, and breaks up into a well-defined spatial pattern (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g004">Figure 4.2, 4.3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Xue1">[32]</xref>). Numerical solutions of the nonlinear equations confirm this, and experiments in which the grid size is varied show that the results are independent of the grid, given that it is fine enough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Xue1">[32]</xref>.</p>

        <p>In the presence of a macroscopic gradient a similar analysis, taken along a 1D circular cross-section of the 2D aggregation field, predicts the breakup of the uniform distribution, but in this situation the 2D pattern of local aggregations is aligned in the direction of the macroscopic gradient. This is demonstrated in a numerical experiment in which cells are placed on a cylindrical surface with constant attractant gradient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002332.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus the experimentally-observed radial streams shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g001">Figure 1</xref> and the theoretically-predicted ones shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g003">Figure 3</xref> can be understood as the result of (i) a linear instability of the uniform cell density, and (ii) the nonlinear evolution of the growing mode, with growth oriented by the initial macroscopic gradient of attractant.</p>

        <title>Spiral streams result from a surface-induced swimming bias</title>
        <p>In most experiments the radial streams that arise initially rapidly evolve into spiral streams, and importantly, these spirals always wind CCW when viewed from above. The invariance of the chirality of these spirals indicates that there are other forces that act either on individual cells or on the fluid in the slime layer, and that initial conditions play no significant role. One possible explanation, which we show later can account for the observed chirality, stems from observations of the swimming behavior of <italic>E. coli</italic> in bulk solution and near surfaces. When far from the boundary of a container, <italic>E. coli</italic> executes the standard run and tumble sequence, with more or less straight runs interrupted by a tumbling phase in which a new, essentially random direction is chosen. (There is a slight tendency to continue in the previous direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Berg2">[41]</xref>). However, observations of cell tracks near a surface show that cells exhibit a persistent tendency to swim clockwise (CW) when viewed from above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Frymier1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Lauga1">[47]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Since the cells are small the Reynolds number based on the cell length is very small (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>)), inertial effects are negligible, and the motion of a cell is both force- and torque-free. Since the flagellar bundle rotates CCW during a run, when viewed from behind, the cell body must rotate CW. When a cell is swimming near a surface, the part of the cell body closer to the surface experiences a greater drag force due to the interaction of the boundary layer surrounding the cell with that at the immobile substrate surface. Suppose that the Cartesian frame has the x and y axes in the substrate plane and that z measures distance into the fluid. When a cell runs parallel to the surface in the y direction and the cell body rotates CW, the cell body experiences a net force in the x direction due to the asymmetry in the drag force. Since the flagellar bundle rotates CCW, a net force with the opposite direction acts on the flagella, and these two forces form a couple that produces the swimming bias of the cell. (Since the entire cell is also torque-free, there is a counteracting viscous couple that opposes the rotation, and there is no angular acceleration.) The closer the cell is to the surface, the smaller is the radius of curvature of its trajectory and the slower the cell speed. Because of the bias, cells that are once near the surface tend to remain near the surface, which increases the possibility of attachment. (In the case of <italic>Proteus</italic> this may facilitate the swimmer-to-swarmer transition, but this is not established.) Resistive force theory has been used to derive quantitative approximations for the radius of curvature as a function of the distance of the cell from the surface and other cell-level dimensions, treating the cell body as a sphere and the flagellar bundle as a single rigid helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Lauga1">[47]</xref>. Cell speed has been shown to first increase and then decrease with increasing viscosity of linear-polymer solutions when cells are far from a surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Magariyama1">[48]</xref>, but how viscosity changes the bias close to a surface is not known.</p>
        <p>The question we investigate here is whether the microscopic swimming bias of single bacteria can produce the macroscopic spiral stream formation with the correct chirality. We cannot apply the above theory rigorously, since that would involve solving the Stokes problem for each cell, using variable heights from the surface. Instead, we introduce a constant bias of each cell during the runs, <italic>i.e.</italic>,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the normal vector to the surface, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> measures the magnitude of the bias in the direction of swimming.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows the evolution of the cell density using a bias of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is chosen so that a cell traverses a complete circle in 50 secs. The simulations show that the initially-uniform cell density evolves into spiral streams after a few minutes and by 12 minutes the majority of the cells have joined one of the spiral arms. The spiral streams persist for some time and eventually break into necklaces of aggregates which actively move towards the center of the domain.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows the positions, at 30 second intervals, of 10 randomly chosen cells, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g005">Figure 5B</xref> illustrates how to understand the macroscopic chirality based on the swimming bias of individual cells. At <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the blue cell detects a signal gradient (red arrow) roughly in the 1 o'clock direction, and on average it swims up the gradient longer than down the gradient. Because of the CW swimming bias, the average drift is in the direction of the blue arrow. At <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> it arrives at the place and ‘realizes’ that the signal gradient is roughly in the 12 o'clock direction, and a similar argument leads to the average net velocity at that spot. As a result of these competing influences, the cell gradually make its way to the source of attractant (the red dot) along a CCW trajectory. Certainly the pitch of the spirals is related to the swimming bias, but we have not determined the precise relationship. The spiral movement has also been explained mathematically for a continuum description of cell dynamics in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Xue1">[32]</xref>, where the macroscopic chemotaxis equation is derived from the hybrid model in the presence of an external force, under the assumption that the gradient of attractant is shallow. When the swimming bias is constant, the analysis shows that this bias leads to an additional taxis-like flux orthogonal to the signal gradient. However, we show later that the continuum description is not valid for the later stages of patterning in <italic>Proteus</italic>, since attractant gradients become too large.</p>

        <p>According to the foregoing explanation, one expects spirals in the opposite direction when experiments are performed with the petri plate upside-down and patterns are viewed from the top, since in this case the relative position of the matrix and slime is inverted and cells are swimming under the surface. This prediction has been confirmed experimentally, and the conclusion is that the interaction between the cell and the liquid-gel surface is the crucial factor that determines the genesis and structure of the spirals.</p>

        <title>Pattern formation on a growing disk</title>
        <p>From the foregoing simulations we conclude that when the swimming bias is incorporated, the hybrid model correctly predicts the emergence of streams and their evolution into spirals of the correct chirality for experimentally-reasonable initial cell densities and attractant concentration. Next we make a further step toward a complete model by incorporating growth of the patterning domain. The simulation starts when the colony begins to expand. As we indicated earlier, the biology of swimmer/swarmer differentiation and the biophysics of movement at the leading edge are poorly understood. Consequently, we here regard the advancing front as a source of swimmer cells and prescribe a constant expansion rate. Since we simulate from the very beginning of colony expansion, with no attractant in the petri dish, we take <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be zero everywhere as an initial condition. The results of one computational experiment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g006">Figure 6</xref>, in which the colony expands outward at a speed of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as observed in experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002332.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and the cells added in this process are swimmer cells. One sees that the early dynamics when the disk is small are similar to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g004">Figure 4</xref> on a fixed disk, but as the disk continues to grow the inner structure develops into numerous isolated islands, while the structure near the boundary exhibits the spirals.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>New experimental results reported here show that swimmer cells in the center of the colony stream inward toward the inoculation site, and form a number of complex patterns, including radial and spiral streams in an early stage, and rings and traveling trains in later stages. These experiments suggest that intercellular communication is involved in the spatial pattern formation. The experiments raise many questions, including what induces the inward movement of swimmer cells, why they move in streams, why radial streams quickly evolve into spiral streams, and finally, why all the spirals wind CCW. To address these we developed a hybrid cell-based model in which we describe the chemotactic movement of each cell individually by an independent velocity jump process. We couple this cell-based model of chemotactic movement with reaction-diffusion equations for the nutrient and attractant. To numerically solve the governing equations, a Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the velocity jump process of each cell, and an ADI method is used to solve the reaction-diffusion equations for the extracellular chemicals. The hybrid cell-based model has yielded biologically-based answers to the questions raised by the experimental observations. Starting with an estimate of the attractant level before the onset of the radial streaming as the initial value, we predicted the formation of radial streams as a result of the modulation of the local attractant concentration by the cells. It is observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> that ‘runs’ of single cells curve to the right when cells swim near a surface, and we incorporated this swimming bias by adding a constant angular velocity during runs of each cell. This leads to spiral streams with the same chirality as is observed experimentally. Finally, by incorporating growth of the patterning domain we were able to capture some of the salient features of the global patterns observed.</p>
      <p>The streams and spirals reported here share similarities with those formed in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, where cells migrate towards a pacemaker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Alcantara1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Dallon1">[52]</xref>, but there are significant differences. Firstly, the mechanism leading to aggregation is similar, in that in both cases the cells react chemotactically and secrete the attractant. However, since bacteria are small, they do a ‘bakery search’ in deciding how to move - detecting the signal while moving, and constantly modulating their run time in response to changes in the signal. In contrast, <italic>D. discoideum</italic> is large enough that it can measure gradients across it's length and orient and move accordingly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Parent1">[53]</xref>. Thus bacteria measure temporal gradients whereas amoeboid cells such as <italic>D. discoideum</italic> measure spatial gradients. In either case the cells respond locally by forming streams and migrate up the gradient of an attractant. However, spirals are less ubiquitous in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, and when they form they can be of either handedness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Siegert1">[54]</xref>, whereas in <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, only spirals wound CCW when viewed from above have been observed, which emphasizes the importance of the influence of the cell-substrate interaction when cells swim close to the surface. Experiments in which the patterning occurs in an inverted petri dish lead to spirals with an opposite handedness when viewed from above, which further support our explanation. Our results imply that the spatial patterns observed in <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> can be explained by the chemotactic behavior of swimmer cells, and suggest that differentiation and de-differentiation of the cells at the leading edge does not play a critical role in patterning, but rather serves to expand the colony under appropriate conditions. A future objective is to incorporate a better description of the dynamics at the leading edge when more biological information is available.</p>
      <p>The spatial patterns reported here are also different from those observed in other bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. In the latter, fractal bacterial patterns have been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-BenJacob1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-BenJacob2">[6]</xref>, and these patterns form primarily at the leading edge of the growing colony. There cell motility plays a lesser role and the limited diffusion of nutrient plays an important role in the pattern formation. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-BenJacob3">[11]</xref>, chiral growth patterns have been observed to form at the leading edge of <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> colonies with chirality depending on the concentration of agar in the medium. Those patterns were explained by introducing a phenomenological rotation to the tumbling of cells at the leading edge. However, the spiral streams we presented here form in the center of a growing colony, and the CCW chirality results from the physical property of bacterial swimming when they move close to a surface, namely, a CW individual swimming bias when observed from above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Frymier1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Lauga1">[47]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Further experimental work is needed to validate our primary assumptions and to set the stage for incorporation of more detail into the model. A first step would be to definitively identify the primary attractant and the receptors for it, and to determine whether the primary attractant is also secreted by cells, as assumed here. If several are equally important the mathematical model for individual cells and the equations for the evolution of the attractants would have to be modified, but this poses no new mathematical or conceptual difficulties. Of course if several are involved there are entirely new ways in which the patterns can be influenced by manipulating the attractants. A second set of experiments would be needed to elucidate the behavior of individual cells and determine whether the run-and-tumble description must be modified. This has been done in detail and at great expense for <italic>E. coli</italic>, and would have to be repeated for <italic>Proteus</italic>. The third crucial assumption concerns the mechanism that leads to spirals of fixed chirality. The analysis that leads to our hypothesis for a rotational bias when swimming near a surface relies on the fact that the motion is at low Reynolds number, and therefore, that viscous effects dominate the motion. Accordingly, experiments in which the viscosity is manipulated would shed light on the validity of this assumption, since decreasing the viscosity will decrease the bias and reduce the curvature of the spirals, and conversely for increases in viscosity.</p>
      <p>Of course the experimental reality is more complicated than that which our model describes, and this can lead a set of significantly more complex experiments. For instance, the nutrient composition is very complex and nutrient depletion may occur at a later stage, such as during train formation. Further, cells may become non-motile for various reasons, and these factors may play a role in the stabilization of the ring patterns. Another important issue is the hydrodynamic interaction of the swimmer cells with fluid in the slime layer. When cell density is low and cells are well separated we can approximate their movement by independent velocity jump processes plus a swimming bias, but when the cell density is high the cell movement is correlated through the hydrodynamic interactions and this must be taken into account. This hydrodynamic interaction may be an important factor in the formation of the trains observed in experiments.</p>
      <p>In previous work the individual cell behavior, including the swimming bias, has been embedded in a continuum chemotaxis equation derived by analyzing the diffusion limit of a transport equation based on the velocity jump process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Xue1">[32]</xref>. The resulting equation is based on the assumption that the signal gradient is shallow and the predicted macroscopic velocity in this regime is linear in the signal gradient. A novel feature of the result is that the swimming bias at the individual cell level gives rise to an additional taxis term orthogonal to the signal gradient in this equation. However in the simulations of the patterns presented here we observe steep signal gradients near the core of the patterns and within the streams, and therefore in these regimes the assumptions underlying the continuum chemotaxis model are not valid.</p>
      <p>To illustrate the significance of this, we use the function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a measure of the signal gradient detected by a cell, and for each fixed spatial distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we stochastically simulated the trajectory of 5000 cells with the same initial position and random initial velocity. We found, using least-squares fitting, that the mean, variance, and covariance of the displacement parallel and perpendicular to the gradient can be fit very well by a linear function, and we used these statistics to obtain the macroscopic drift and diffusion rate for each signal gradient <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> chosen. In the simulations we assumed, without loss of generality, that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is in the direction of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-axis, and took the initial positions to be <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Then we computed the macroscopic drift as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and the diffusion matrix<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g008">Figure 8</xref> compares the statistical results predicted by the cell-based model described above with the formula given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Xue1">[32]</xref>, both in the absence of a swimming bias and when there is a bias <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g006">6</xref>. We see that the continuum description given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Xue1">[32]</xref> gives a good approximation for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> very small (the shallow gradient assumption), but not for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> large. The statistical analysis of results from the cell-based model reveals saturation in the macroscopic velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g008">Figure 8B, E</xref>) and gradient-dependent diffusion coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g008">Figure 8A, D</xref>).

In contrast with this, if there is a swimming bias, the diffusion coefficients <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> first increase and then decrease before converging to a constant, while <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is small but nonzero for intermediate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002332.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). These results are very different from the prediction of the continuum model shown in red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g008">Figure 8</xref>, where the predicted macroscopic velocity exceeds the cell speed in the presence of large signal gradients, and the diffusion of cells is isotropic with a constant coefficient. In addition, statistical analysis of the cell-based model also shows that when there is a swimming bias, the angle between the macroscopic velocity and the signal gradient depends nonlinearly on the magnitude of the signal gradient, in contrast to the prediction from the PDE in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002332-Xue1">[32]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002332-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). Thus the hybrid model developed herein successfully describes pattern formation in the presence of large gradients, whereas current continuum descriptions of cell motion do not. Further work is needed to connect the two descriptions in this regime.</p>

Positive chemotaxis toward each of the common 20 amino acids was tested using the drop assay.

The plates were point inoculated and placed in a humid chamber at room temperature for at least 20 hrs.
