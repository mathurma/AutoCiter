      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Interleukin-26 (IL-26), a member of the IL-10 cytokine family, induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines by epithelial cells. IL-26 has been also reported overexpressed in Crohn's disease, suggesting that it may be involved in the physiopathology of chronic inflammatory disorders. Here, we have analyzed the expression and role of IL-26 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by joint synovial inflammation. We report that the concentrations of IL-26 are higher in the serums of RA patients than of healthy subjects and dramatically elevated in RA synovial fluids compared to RA serums. Immunohistochemistry reveals that synoviolin<sup>+</sup> fibroblast-like synoviocytes and CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophage-like synoviocytes are the main IL-26-producing cells in RA joints. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes from RA patients constitutively produce IL-26 and this production is upregulated by IL-1-beta and IL-17A. We have therefore investigated the role of IL-26 in the inflammatory process. Results show that IL-26 induces the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1-beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by human monocytes and also upregulates the expression of numerous chemokines (mainly CCL20). Interestingly, IL-26-stimulated monocytes selectively promote the generation of RORgamma t<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells, through IL-1-beta secretion by monocytes. More precisely, IL-26-stimulated monocytes switch non-Th17 committed (IL-23R<sup>−</sup> or CCR6<sup>−</sup> CD161<sup>−</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells into Th17 cells. Finally, synovial fluids from RA patients also induce Th17 cell generation and this effect is reduced after IL-26 depletion. These findings show that IL-26 is constitutively produced by RA synoviocytes, induces proinflammatory cytokine secretion by myeloid cells, and favors Th17 cell generation. IL-26 thereby appears as a novel proinflammatory cytokine, located upstream of the proinflammatory cascade, that may constitute a promising target to treat RA and chronic inflammatory disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common form of chronic inflammatory arthritis, is characterized by persistent synovial inflammation, systemic inflammation, and autoantibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Scott1">[1]</xref>. The multiple proinflammatory cascades described in RA lead to persistent synovitis, resulting in articular cartilage and bone damages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Scott1">[1]</xref>. The proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleudin (IL)-1-beta, and IL-6, produced by synovial cells and infiltrating cells, actively participate to synovitis and joint destruction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Scott1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Brennan1">[2]</xref>. Although RA has been first considered as a Th1-mediated disease, the proinflammatory Th17 cells (the major source of IL-17A; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Korn1">[3]</xref>) have been recently reported in RA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Lubberts1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Zizzo1">[6]</xref>, mainly in early and non-treated RA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Cascao1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Yamada1">[9]</xref>. IL-17A induces proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion by synovial fibroblasts, macrophages, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts, and participates in tissue remodeling by inducing the production of growth factors, matrix metalloproteinases, and RANK ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Peck1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Kato1">[10]</xref>. In vivo, the severity of collagen- or adjuvant-induced arthritis is reduced with IL-17A deficiency or blockade (using antibodies or a receptor antagonist) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Lubberts1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-vandenBerg1">[11]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Besides disease-modifying antirheumatic and anti-inflammatory drugs, TNF-alpha inhibitors have been proven to be effective in RA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Scott1">[1]</xref>. However, some patients fail to respond to TNF-alpha inhibitors, present short-term responses or adverse effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Scott1">[1]</xref>. Currently, an increasing number of cytokine inhibitors, such as anti-IL-17A antibodies, are under investigation in RA treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Brennan1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Kato1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-vandenBerg1">[11]</xref>. As early treatment preserves joint function, factors involved in the early phase of the inflammatory cascade and/or in Th17 cell generation constitute preferred therapeutic targets.</p>
      <p>IL-26, also known as AK155, is a member of the IL-10 cytokine family that includes IL-10, interferon (IFN)-λs (IL-28A/B and IL-29), and the IL-20 subfamily (IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Ouyang1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Sabat1">[13]</xref>.

      <p>We have investigated in this study the expression and role of IL-26 in RA. We report that RA patients exhibit high concentrations of IL-26 in serums and synovial fluids (SFs) and that RA synoviocytes constitutively produce IL-26. We also show that IL-26 triggers the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes that induce non-Th17 memory T cell differentiation into Th17 cells. IL-26 may therefore represent a novel therapeutic target in RA and chronic inflammatory disorders.</p>

        <title>IL-26 Upregulates Proinflammatory Cytokine Expression by Myeloid Cells</title>
        <p>As myeloid cells control the inflammatory process and the polarization of T cells, we investigated their sensitivity to IL-26. CD14<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells isolated from RA SF and monocytes isolated from the blood of healthy subjects were incubated with homodimeric IL-26 (hereafter referred to as IL-26) in serum-free medium. IL-26 induced IL-1-beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha production by monocytes from healthy subjects and upregulated their secretion by myeloid cells from RA SF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001395-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). This effect was dose- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001395-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and time-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001395-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), and associated to an increase of expression of the corresponding mRNA (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001395-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Among the IL-20 cytokine subfamily members (IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, and IL-24), IL-26 was the only that induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion by monocytes (unpublished data). Monocyte-derived macrophages (MΦ), peripheral blood myeloid BDCA1<sup>+</sup> DC (mDC), and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) were also sensitive to IL-26, as evidenced by an increase of IL-6 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001395-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). IL-26 also upregulated the expression of the mRNA encoding IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 by monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001395-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), three members of the IL-10 family of which the expression is upregulated in RA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Ouyang1">[12]</xref>.

As monocytes are highly sensitive to endotoxin, we excluded a potential role of contaminating endotoxin. First, endotoxin concentrations in monomeric and dimeric recombinant IL-26 were &lt;1.0 EU per µg of protein using the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay (data from manufacturers) and &lt;10 pg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) per µg of protein using an in vitro cell-based LPS detection assay (Cayla-Invivogen) (unpublished data).

        <p>We also evaluated whether some cytokines may modulate IL-26-induced monocyte activation.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>RA is characterized by persistent synovial inflammation that leads to adjacent cartilage and bone destruction. TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1-beta inhibitors are currently used to treat active RA, as these proinflammatory cytokines have a major role in the pathophysiology of RA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Scott1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Brennan1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Quartier1">[36]</xref>. However, to date, the factors that trigger proinflammatory cytokine production in RA remain unknown. We report here that IL-26 is overexpressed in RA and constitutively produced by synoviocytes in inflamed RA joints. IL-26 induces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1-beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and chemokines (such as CCL20) by myeloid cells and favors the generation and local recruitment of Th17 cells. IL-26 thereby appears as a pivotal cytokine, located upstream of the local proinflammatory cascade, that may constitute a promising therapeutic target.</p>
      <p>Through the secretion of IL-17A and proinflammatory cytokines, Th17 cells are critical players in the pathophysiology of RA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Lubberts1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Zizzo1">[6]</xref> and other inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and allograft rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Korn1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Romagnani1">[31]</xref>. The identification of the factors involved in Th17 cell generation is thus crucial to design future therapeutic strategies to reduce IL-17A expression. We demonstrate here that IL-26 favors the generation of Th17 cells mainly through the induction of IL-1-beta production by monocytes. In addition to IL-1-beta, IL-21 plus TGF-beta have also been reported to induce human Th17 cell generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-AcostaRodriguez1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Yang1">[33]</xref>. In our experiments, we have excluded the involvement of IL-21 and/or TGF-beta, on the basis of the following observations: (i) IL-26 does not induce IL-21 and TGF-beta expression by monocytes and T cells; (ii) a neutralizing anti-IL-21 mAb did not modulate IL-17A secretion by T cells cultured with IL-26-treated monocytes; and (iii) TGF-beta inhibited the IL-26-induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion by monocytes. Moreover, the generation of Th17 cells induced by IL-26 was not dependent on IL-23. IL-26 also induced the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha by monocytes. However, and in agreement with others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-deJong1">[32]</xref>, we excluded a major role of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in human Th17 cell generation. In accordance with our results, IL-1-beta, in the presence of TNF-alpha and IL-6, has been shown to give rise to Th22 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Duhen1">[37]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We observed that IL-26-stimulated monocytes induced the differentiation of non-Th17 committed (CCR6<sup>−</sup> CD161<sup>−</sup> and IL-23R<sup>−</sup>) memory T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Romagnani1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Cosmi1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Liu1">[35]</xref>. In contrast, IL-26 did not induce the polarization of naive T cells into Th17 cells. In agreement with this observation, only naive CD161<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells present in post-natal thymus and umbilical cord blood have been reported to differentiate into Th17 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Romagnani1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Cosmi1">[34]</xref>.

      <p>Interestingly, we observed that (i) IL-26 is expressed in the sublining layer of synovium and in T cell-rich areas, (ii) that myeloid cells infiltrating RA joints are sensitive to IL-26, and (iii) that IL-26 in RA fluids is biologically active and in sufficient concentrations to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes and of IL-17A by memory T cells. These results suggest that memory T cells, present in inflamed RA joints, could locally differentiate into Th17 cells, in the presence of IL-26 and infiltrating myeloid cells (as schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001395-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Through an upregulation of the expression of proinflammatory chemokines, and especially CCL20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Hirota1">[39]</xref>, IL-26-exposed myeloid cells may also favor the local recruitment of activation of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001395-g009">Figure 9</xref>).

In a model of RA in SCID mice, RA FLS can migrate from an affected site into a distant healthy site, resulting in the subsequent cartilage invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Neumann1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Lefevre1">[41]</xref>. The unabated secretion of IL-26 by RA synoviocytes may contribute to explain how they establish a proinflammatory microenvironment after migration into unaffected joints. Numerous proinflammatory factors (e.g., IL-1-beta and IL-17A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Noss1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Hot1">[28]</xref> and some members of the IL-20 subfamily (such as IL-20 and IL-22) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Hsu1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Ikeuchi1">[43]</xref> activate RA FLS. Interestingly, we report that IL-17A and IL-1-beta upregulate IL-26 secretion by RA FLS. This observation, added to the ability of IL-26 to upregulate IL-1-beta and IL-17A secretion by monocytes and T cells, respectively, evidence an amplification loop that may contribute to sustain the inflammatory process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001395-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Supporting observations in the intestinal lesions in Crohn's disease patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Dambacher1">[21]</xref>, we observed that some infiltrating T cells, including Th17 cells, express IL-26 in RA joints. It has been reported that IL-26 expression by Th17 cells depends on the stage of Th17 cell differentiation and on the local microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Korn1">[3]</xref>. This study may contribute to explain why IL-26 expression was detected only in some Th17 cells.</p>
      <p>Despite the expression of the IL-26 heterodimeric receptor IL-10R2/IL-20R1 by RA (but not healthy) FLS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Sakurai1">[44]</xref>, we failed in detecting an effect of IL-26 on RA and healthy FLS. Although the mechanisms responsible for the absence of cell sensitivity to IL-26 remain unknown, we could speculate that the constitutive production of IL-26 by RA FLS may promote the saturation/desensitization of the IL-26 receptor. Previous studies have also reported that primary epidermal keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Sa1">[45]</xref> and HaCaT cells, after prolonged cultivation, express IL-10R2/IL-20R1 but do not respond to IL-26 (personal observations and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Hor1">[16]</xref>).</p>
      <p>IL-26 was initially described as a cytokine that activates non-hematopoietic cells via the heterodimeric receptor IL-10R2/IL-20R1, inducing STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Donnelly1">[14]</xref>. We report that monocytes are sensitive to IL-26, in the absence of IL-20R1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Wolk1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Wolk2">[20]</xref> and personal observation). IL-26-induced monocyte activation (i) is reduced by a neutralizing anti-IL-10R2 mAb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001395.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) and (ii) is associated to IL-10R2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001395.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), but not to STAT1 or STAT3 phosphorylation (personal observation). These results demonstrate that IL-26-induced signaling in monocytes involves IL-10R2, but not IL-20R1. Converging arguments support the expression by monocytes of an IL-26 receptor distinct from the heterodimeric receptor IL-10R2/IL-20R1, described on epithelial cells. First, supporting a model of IL-26/IL-20R1/IL-10R2 ternary complex structure described for monomeric IL-26 that does not apply for dimeric IL-26 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Donnelly1">[14]</xref>, we observed that monomeric and dimeric IL-26 differ in their ability to activate epithelial cells and monocytes. While Colo205 cells are more sensitive to monomeric than dimeric IL-26 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001395.s004">Figure S4</xref>), monocytes are mainly sensitive to dimeric IL-26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001395-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). In independent experiments, we observed that activated T and NK cells produce the dimeric form of IL-26 (personal observation). Second, although heparin interacts with IL-26 and abrogates IL-26-induced Colo205 activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001395.s005">Figure S5A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Hor1">[16]</xref>, it dramatically potentiates monocyte activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001395.s005">Figure S5B and S5C</xref>). Third, human B cells have been reported to respond to IL-26, in the absence of IL-20R1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Hummelshoj1">[46]</xref>. Finally, IL-19, another member of the IL-20 cytokine subfamily that signals via IL-20R1/IL-20R2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Sabat1">[13]</xref>, stimulates monocytes and T cells, despite the absence of IL-20R1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Liao1">[47]</xref>. Currently, the nature of the IL-26 receptor expressed by human myeloid cells is under characterization.</p>
      <p>The expression of IL-26 has been previously reported in the inflamed colonic lesions of patients with Crohn's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Dambacher1">[21]</xref> and in skin lesions of patients with psoriasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Wilson1">[22]</xref>. A role of IL-26 in local inflammation has also been suspected in a genome-wide association studies showing that SNP within the <italic>il-26</italic> gene region are susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease with a high prevalence of articular involvement (i.e., RA, spondyloarthritis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Wang1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Silverberg1">[49]</xref>. More recently, a meta-analysis identified the <italic>il-26</italic> gene-containing region as an ulcerative colitis risk locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Anderson1">[50]</xref>. In this study, we show that IL-26 is also overexpressed in RA patients and present at high concentrations in RA joints. These observations, added to the capacity of IL-26 to trigger inflammatory cytokine production by epithelial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Dambacher1">[21]</xref> and myeloid cells and to promote Th17 cell generation, suggest that IL-26 play an active role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. In support, high levels of IL-26 are detected in arthritis other than RA, including osteoarthritis crystalline arthritis (personal observation). As IL-26 induces the secretion of active IL-1-beta (without affecting IL-1RA and IL-10 production), its involvement in sterile auto-inflammatory disorders (such as type II diabetes) should be investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001395-Dinarello1">[51]</xref>. Finally, the beneficial interest of combining IL-26 blockade with IL-1-beta and/or TNF-alpha neutralization should be evaluated. In conclusion, the location of IL-26 upstream of the proinflammatory cascade highlights IL-26 as a novel and promising therapeutic target in RA and other chronic inflammatory disorders.</p>

IFN-gamma and IL-17A were quantified in the 7-d supernatants by ELISA. Results are expressed as concentrations or as percentages of inhibition of IL-17A production determined as follows: (A−B)/(A) * 100 were A and B correspond to the levels of IL-17A produced in the presence of IL-26 plus a control molecule and in the presence of IL-26 plus a neutralizing molecule, respectively. T cells were also cultured for one additional week with 20 ng/ml IL-23 (R&amp;D Systems) and the frequency of IL-17A- and IFN-gamma producing T cells was determined by intracellular cytokine staining. In order to determine the role of T cell-monocyte contacts in the activation of T cells, 5×10<sup>5</sup> memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and 2.5×10<sup>4</sup> monocytes were cultured separately using 0.4-µm pore size Transwell insert (Corning Costar) in the presence of an anti-CD3 mAb, or 10<sup>5</sup> T cells were cultured with 5×10<sup>3</sup> monocytes in the absence of an anti-CD3 mAb.

Bound anti-IL-26 mAb and unlabeled mAbs were detected with Alexa Fluor 555-Streptavidin (Invitrogen) and FITC-labeled swine anti-rabbit IgG Ab (Dako), respectively. Slides were mounted in ProLongGold AntiFading reagent (Invitrogen) and imaged with a Nikon A1 R Si microscope (Nikon). The anti-IL-26 mAb does not cross react with other IL-10 family members, as assessed by Western-blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001395.s006">Figure S6B</xref>).</p>
