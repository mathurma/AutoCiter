        <p>There are many well-known examples of proteins with low sequence similarity, adopting the same structural fold. This aspect of sequence-structure relationship has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically, however with limited success. Most of the studies consider remote homology or “sequence conservation” as the basis for their understanding. Recently “interaction energy” based network formalism (Protein Energy Networks (PENs)) was developed to understand the determinants of protein structures. In this paper we have used these PENs to investigate the common non-covalent interactions and their collective features which stabilize the TIM barrel fold. We have also developed a method of aligning PENs in order to understand the spatial conservation of interactions in the fold. We have identified key common interactions responsible for the conservation of the TIM fold, despite high sequence dissimilarity. For instance, the central beta barrel of the TIM fold is stabilized by long-range high energy electrostatic interactions and low-energy contiguous vdW interactions in certain families. The other interfaces like the helix-sheet or the helix-helix seem to be devoid of any high energy conserved interactions. Conserved interactions in the loop regions around the catalytic site of the TIM fold have also been identified, pointing out their significance in both structural and functional evolution. Based on these investigations, we have developed a novel network based phylogenetic analysis for remote homologues, which can perform better than sequence based phylogeny. Such an analysis is more meaningful from both structural and functional evolutionary perspective. We believe that the information obtained through the “interaction conservation” viewpoint and the subsequently developed method of structure network alignment, can shed new light in the fields of fold organization and <italic>de novo</italic> computational protein design.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Proteins are polymers of amino-acids that fold into unique three-dimensional structures to perform cellular functions. This structure formation has been shown to depend on the amino-acid sequences. But examples of proteins with diverse sequences retaining a similar structural fold are quite substantial that we can no longer consider such phenomenon as exceptions. Therefore, this non-canonical relationship has been studied extensively mostly by studying the remote sequence similarities between proteins. Here we have attempted to address the above-mentioned problem by analyzing the similarities in the spatial interactions among amino-acids. Since the protein structure is a resultant of different interactions, we have considered the proteins as networks of interacting amino-acids to derive the common interactions within a popular structural fold called the TIM barrel fold. We were able to find common interactions among different families of the TIM fold and generalize the patterns of interactions by which the fold is being maintained despite sequence diversity. The results substantiate our hypothesis that interaction conservation might by a driving factor in fold formation and this new outlook can be used extensively in engineering proteins with better biophysical characteristics.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Proteins are amino–acid polymers capable of folding into unique three–dimensional functional states. The information for the structure formation is contained within their amino–acid sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Anfinsen1">[1]</xref>. With an enormous amount of data available on genomic sequences in organisms and the structures of the proteins they encode, it has become evident that despite the large sequence space, the structure space is rather limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Grant1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Finkelstein1">[4]</xref>. It has been predicted that merely a few thousand protein folds are needed to generate the entire repertoire of the multimillion strong protein universe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Chothia1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Wolf1">[6]</xref>. The limited number of folds has been explained as a result of optimization of backbone packing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Hoang1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Banavar1">[8]</xref>. A recent analysis of the fold space showed that the atomic interaction network in the solvent–unexposed core of protein domains are fold–conserved, and that the network is significantly distinguishable across different folds, providing a “signature” of a native fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Soundararajan1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As a common rule, homologous sequences generally take up similar folds and the sequence divergences are concomitantly accompanied by structural variations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Chothia2">[10]</xref>. However, increasing number of identified sequences and folds show a significant departure from this rule, i.e the same fold is able to house highly dissimilar protein sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Dokholyan1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Dokholyan2">[14]</xref>. Folds like the TIM (Triosephosphate Isomerase) barrel, Rossmann, αβ–plait, and all β–immunoglobins are taken up by divergent sequences thereby underscoring the availability of limited fold space. These folds with their simple and symmetric architectures seem to be favorable folds for a large number of non–homologous sequences. Such folds are of special interest since their investigation would provide profound insights into the principles governing protein folding and stability. Although functional variations are related to structural variations, it has been established that proteins with disparate structures may retain their function during the course of their evolution as long as the local active site geometry is maintained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Chothia2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Russell1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Triosephosphate Isomerase (TIM) Barrel is one the ancient folds with considerable sequence diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Grant1">[2]</xref>. It is also one of the ubiquitously occurring enzymatic folds and hosts the most diverse enzymatic reactions catalyzing five of the six classes of biochemical reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Nagano1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Anantharaman1">[17]</xref>. Thus TIM barrel, possessing both structural and functional diversity, has appealed both structural biologists and biochemists equally over the years. Factors responsible for its structural maintenance and functional diversity have been investigated in detail since its first structural discovery in 1975 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Nagano1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Sterner1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Wierenga1">[24]</xref>. The fold consists of an alternating helix–loop–strand secondary structure motif, where the strands assemble into the core β–barrel. This β–barrel is therefore formed by parallel strands, which is a rarity in fold space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Wierenga1">[24]</xref>. The outer rim of the barrel is maintained by helix–sheet and helix–helix interactions. Evolutionary studies suggest that there are evidences for both divergent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Lesk1">[23]</xref> and convergent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Farber1">[20]</xref> evolution of the TIM barrel proteins, and hence, its evolution is being highly debated. A large number of computational studies have been carried on this fold, focusing mainly on their prevalence in the enzymes of various organisms catalyzing different functions, their structural and evolutionary properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Nagano1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Nagano2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Si1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study we have explored the factors responsible for the stability of TIM fold taken up by dissimilar sequences. Unlike earlier studies that focus on residue conservation, we have focused on interaction conservation as the basis of understanding the underlying structural determinants of the TIM fold. Although this is a novel method, several concepts related to protein sequence-structure-function relationship have been explored and quantitative results have been presented in the literature. For instance, evolutionary concepts were implemented in identifying pair-wise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Lockless1">[27]</xref> and sets of residues, called as a “sectors”, that have undergone correlated mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Halabi1">[28]</xref> in the protein sequences. At the structure-dynamics level, coarse-grained network models have shown that proteins with similar architecture exhibit similar large-scale dynamic behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Keskin1">[29]</xref> and the differences usually occur in regions where specific functions are localized. Energetic coupling between residues has been investigated both experimentally by mutation followed by biochemical measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Chi1">[30]</xref> and from computational methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Kong1">[31]</xref>. The classical problem of studying the structure-function relationship in allostery has been addressed from protein structure network point of view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Bhattacharyya1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Ghosh1">[36]</xref>. In essence the protein sequence-structure relationship and the structural changes accommodating their biological function have been investigated by a variety of methods.</p>
      <p>Here, we have made the preliminary attempt to study the role of conserved interactions in stabilizing a fold by (a) analyzing residue–residue interactions obtained from atomistic force fields; (b) investigating the interactions and their threshold energy values at a global level by constructing Protein Energy Networks (PEN); (c) obtaining a common PEN for a family of proteins (<italic>f–</italic>PEN) by structure based alignment followed by the construction of a common energy–weighted interaction matrix; (d) using the <italic>f–</italic>PENs to study the conserved interactions responsible maintaining the fold and (e) exploiting the conservation of interactions (obtained from <italic>f–</italic>PENs) to deduce phylogenetic relationship (trees) as opposed to the commonly practiced sequence based methods.</p>
      <p>PENs are structure networks where the constituent amino–acids are the nodes and the edges represent the non–covalent interactions among them. By representing the interactions as interaction energies (obtained from molecular mechanics force fields), both the chemistry and the geometry of the amino–acids are better represented than other contact–based structure networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Vijayabaskar1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Vijayabaskar2">[38]</xref>. We have used structural similarities between the remote homologues of TIM barrel fold to align their PENs to obtain information on the extent of interaction conservation among them.</p>
      <p>The analysis of <italic>f–</italic>PENs has provided us a wealth of information in terms of the strength of interactions and their conservation (at pair–wise as well as at the level of a collection of multiple interactions). We have been able to identify the factors responsible for the stability of the different secondary structural interfaces in the TIM fold. In general we have observed that the residues involved in high–energy interactions to have more conservation than the residues forming low–energy vdW dominated interactions. We have seen that high–energy conserved interactions are present in the central β–barrel stabilizing it and in the catalytic loop regions helping in the functioning of the protein. The interface between helices and sheets are dominated exclusively by low–energy interactions between non–conserved residues, thus contributing much to the sequence diversity. We also observed that interaction conservation based phylogeny represents the structural and functional evolution better than those derived from sequence conservation. The new outlook from “interaction conservation” has shed more light on the factors behind the fold organization of TIM fold by sequentially diverse homologues. Such observations are unique and we believe that this method will pave an alternate way for understanding the basis of organization of other folds as well. Furthermore, the information on interaction conservation can enable more controlled engineering of new proteins with enhanced structural/functional properties.</p>

        <title>TIM Barrel fold</title>
        <p>The TIM fold comprises three major secondary structural interfaces: the central β–barrel, α/β and α/α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). The central β–barrel is formed by staggered parallel β sheets forming the β/β interface and makes up the core of the fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). The α/β interface flanks the barrel and is formed by the most common α–X–β motif (where X can be any secondary structure like loops and β turns or even separate motifs). The helices interact with each other to form the α/α interface facing the exterior. It has been shown that the face of the fold with the C–terminal ends of the barrel and the adjoining loops contain the active–site residues, thus forming the catalytic face of the fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Sterner1">[18]</xref>. As mentioned earlier TIM fold is rich in both sequential and functional diversity marking it a viable system for studying sequence–structure–function relationship.</p>

        <title>Protein Energy Networks of the TIM fold</title>
        <p>The analysis of the Protein Energy Networks (PENs) provides a rationale to investigate the non–covalent interactions in proteins at various levels such as the interacting pairs (edges), network of connected residues (clusters), nodes connected by a large number of interactions (hubs) as a function of interaction energy. The domains of the TIM barrel fold in the dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s008">Table S1</xref>) are represented as energy weighted structure networks (PENs), in which the constituent amino–acids are considered as nodes and the edges are weighted based on the non–covalent interaction energies among the amino–acids (Eq 3, Methods Section). Such a representation of PEN, capturing the non–covalent interaction energies at the atomic level, is capable of providing a consolidated view of the forces stabilizing the fold of the protein, yet retaining the details of individual interactions. It is to be noted that highly favorable interactions (for example, −25 kJ/mol) will be referred to as “high–energy” interactions, whereas less favorable interactions (for example, −10 kJ/mol) will be referred to as “low–energy” interactions. A range of unweighted PEN<italic><sub>e</sub></italic>s can be generated from the PEN using specific maximum energy cutoffs (<italic>e</italic>) to define the edges (Eq 4, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). It was earlier noted from the PENs of a set of globular proteins that at low energies (e&gt;−10 kJ/mol) the network is dominated by hydrophobic vdW interactions and above this value (e&lt;−10 kJ/mol), the electrostatic interactions starts dominating the edges in the PENs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Vijayabaskar2">[38]</xref>. The ljPENs are generated to focus exclusively on the vdW interactions by excluding the dominant terms of electrostatic interactions. The largest cluster (LC, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) profiles as a function of <italic>‘e’</italic> for both PENs and ljPENs are provided for the present dataset of 81 TIM barrel domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s001">Figure S1</xref>). It is clear that the domains show three distinct network behaviors as a function of <italic>‘e’</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s001">Figure S1a</xref>). In the high–energy region (e&lt;−20 kJ/mol, henceforth denoted as pre–transition region), the LC size is small with the network connected by electrostatic interactions. The size of the LC increases in the intermediate energy region (−20&lt;e&lt;−10 kJ/mol, transition region) following a sigmoidal profile by accruing low–energy vdW interactions and to encampass the whole protein in the low–energy region (e&gt;−10 kJ/mol, post–transition region), where the vdW interactions are dominant, tethering together local pockets of high–energy interactions. The LC profile of ljPENs is similar to PENs except that the mid–transition point is around −7 kJ/mol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s001">Figure S1b</xref>), due to the absence of high–energy electrostatic interactions.</p>

        <title>Family specific PENs (<italic>f–</italic>PENs)</title>
        <p>The TIM barrel domain is a common fold adopted by a large number of diverse sequences. Here we ask the question whether these domains are stabilized by similar patterns of interactions. Despite high sequence diversity we find common patterns of interactions of equivalent energies emerged when investigated at the family level. The family level classification of the TIM fold was obtained from the SCOP database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Murzin1">[39]</xref>. We constructed family specific PENs for a chosen <italic>‘e’</italic> value (<italic>f–</italic>PEN<italic><sub>e</sub></italic>s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and obtained the equivalent node/edge/network information from the multiple structural alignments of the constituent members (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Each edge in the family specific network is given a commonality coefficient (<italic>cc<sub>ij</sub></italic>) value indicating the frequency of occurrence of that edge/interaction in the <italic>f–</italic>PEN<italic><sub>e</sub></italic> (Eq 5 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g002">Figure 2f</xref>). A ‘<italic>cc</italic>’ value of one corresponds to the presence and a ‘<italic>cc</italic>’ value zero represents the absence of interaction within a spatially similar position of the fold in all the members of a TIM family. Thus various <italic>f–</italic>PEN<italic><sub>e(cc)</sub></italic> can be generated for a specific family where <italic>f–</italic>PEN<italic><sub>e(1.0)</sub></italic> represents interactions that are present in all the members of the fold and <italic>f–</italic>PEN<italic><sub>e(0.5)</sub></italic> represents interactions that are present in at least half the members of the family. In order to determine the role of an amino–acid (node) type in maintaining an interaction (edge), we have used an Entropy based Conservation score (<italic>EC</italic>) for each node in the <italic>f–</italic>PEN (see Methods Section 3.6). Generally if <italic>EC</italic> is greater than zero then there is a degree of conservation of that residue in the family, while a negative <italic>EC</italic> score shows that the residue is not conserved in that position. Therefore, <italic>cc</italic> is a measure of “interaction conservation” between two nodes and <italic>EC</italic> is a measure of “residue conservation” of the nodes.</p>

            <p>The steps are indicated with a simple example of two β–loop–β structural motifs, one structure with a short loop (structure 1) and another with a long loop (structure 2). (A) The PEN<italic><sub>e</sub></italic>s of the structures (1 and 2) are generated by connecting the residues based on their Cα–Cα distances (however the cutoff energy values (<italic>e</italic>) are chosen in the real cases to draw edges).

          <p>Apart from the backbone hydrogen bonds, the central β–barrel is stabilized by various other types of interactions like hydrophobic interactions and salt–bridges, arising from the side–chains. Our analyses of f–PENs and f–ljPENs show that there are primarily two modes of the β barrel stabilization. The first mode involves the barrel stabilization primarily due to conserved long–range electrostatic interactions, whereas the second mode involves barrel stabilization due to conserved vdW interactions, the details of which are discussed below.</p>

          <p>Alternatively the central β–barrel can be stabilized by vdW dominated hydrophobic interactions (observed from f–ljPEN<sub>–8(0.8)</sub>) among the side chains of residues from neighboring strands. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g003">Figure 3c</xref> shows such interactions from contiguous strands for the Decarboxylases (DC) where hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g003">Figure 3c</xref>) participate significantly in the stabilization of the barrel. Our use of ljPENs for this analysis ensures that the effects of the pre–dominant hydrogen bonds between neighboring strands are masked. The residues involved in such low–energy conserved interactions show both conservation and non–conservation from analysis of their EC scores. Almost all of the families have a certain fraction of very low–energy vdW interactions in the barrel due to the staggered configuration of its parallel strands. However in certain families like Type II Chitinases (c.1.8.5, T2C), Aldo–keto reductases (c.1.7.1, AKC) and Phosphoenolpyruvate mutase/Isocitrate lyase like family (c.1.12.7, PEPM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s008">Table S1</xref>, families 17–19) these conserved interactions solely stabilizes barrel as will be evident in the later sections. It can also be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g003">Figure 3a</xref> that the aliphatic atoms of the side–chains of charged residues (Lys, Asp and Glu) have packed together contributing to low–energy (vdW) contiguous stabilization of the barrel apart from the charged interactions. Hence the barrel stabilization in C1A family is contributed by both long–range high–energy charged interactions and low–energy contiguous interactions.</p>

We observed that no conserved high–energy α/β or α/α interactions are apparent in most the families, showing that this interface is dominated by low–energy vdW interactions. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s002">Figure S2</xref> shows the EC scores for residues involved in these interactions. It was evident from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s002">Figure S2</xref> that the residues involved in these conserved α/β interactions are not well conserved across the members of the family unlike the β/β interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g003">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The reason for such residue non–conservation might be because of the more canonical nature of the α/β motif which can be adopted even by non–homologous sequences across all of the α/β fold class. Therefore we believe that these interfaces might contribute considerably to the sequence diversity of the TIM fold. It has been seen from combinatorial mutagenesis studies on TIM barrels that the central barrel is more sensitive to mutations, whereas mutations at the α/β interfaces are more tolerant, supporting our conclusion that the α/β interface interactions are necessarily not conserved, while β/β interface might require conserved residues to maintain interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Silverman1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Hocker1">[40]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Conserved loop/turn interactions and their functional significance</title>
          <p>Within the TIM fold, the loops and turns principally involve themselves catalytically and contribute to its enzymatic diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Kallenbach1">[41]</xref>. It has long been recognized that the loops of the C–terminal side of the strands have significant number of charged residues and is important for functioning of the TIM fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Silverman1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Hocker1">[40]</xref>. Most of the loops that link the C–term ends of the barrel and the N–term of the adjoining helices form the catalytic face of the fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) and are involved in enzyme catalysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Silverman1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Hocker1">[40]</xref>. The loops are structurally more flexible than the helices and sheets, and hence one would expect minimal interaction/residue conservation at the level of loops from structural stability point of view. Interestingly, our analysis showed the presence of high–energy conserved interactions at these regions. We have found that the residues participating in these conserved interactions were predominantly in the catalytic face of the fold in most of the families except AKR (c.1.7.1), T2C (c.1.8.5) and HMGL (c.1.10.5) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This result highlights the importance of conserved interactions in order to maintain the structural features in the flexible loop/turn regions that determine the functionality of the TIM domain. Unlike the high–energy interactions, the low–energy conserved interactions (f–ljPEN<sub>–8(0.8)</sub>) are pervasive; present in both (C–term and the N–term regions of the barrel) the faces of the barrel showing their importance for general structure stabilization.</p>
          <p>In order to further investigate the functional significance of the conserved high–energy interactions (<italic>f–</italic>PEN<italic><sub>–20(0.8)</sub></italic>) we obtained information on the ligand binding region (catalytic site) by studying the ligand bound structures in the dataset. In the event that ligand bound structures were absent in a family, the ligands were extracted from the structures of closest sequence homologues (&gt;90%) and superimposed onto the representative members in the dataset. Our analysis shows that in families like C1A, PEPM, F1GH, PPL, BNAH, and DGDL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s008">Table S1</xref>), conserved high–energy interactions were present in and around the ligand binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s004">Figure S4</xref>). For example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g004">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g004">Figure 4b</xref> shows a representative member (ASTRAL code: d2mnra1) from D–glucarate dehydratase–like family (DGDL, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s008">Table S1</xref>) with all the ligands (extracted from its nearest sequence homologues) along with the conserved interactions in the loop region. It can be clearly seen that the ligands bind to same site in the catalytic face of the TIM barrel. The conserved interactions both high–energy (<italic>f–</italic>PEN<italic><sub>–20(0.8)</sub></italic>) and low–energy (<italic>f–</italic>ljPEN<italic><sub>–8(0.8)</sub></italic>) are clustered around the catalytic site, with the high–energy interactions oriented around the charged atoms in the ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g004">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). It is evident that these high–energy interactions are conserved so that they can hold the residues in a position to electrostatically interact with the ligands. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g004">Figure 4c</xref> shows another example where the loop based conserved interactions in a representative member, a Xylanase Inhibitor Protein (XIP1), of the family T2C. It was shown that XIP1 employs substrate mimetic interactions to inhibit two fungal xylanases GH10 and GH11 using two different Enzyme Binding Sites (EBS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Payan1">[42]</xref>. It can be readily seen that conserved loop interactions are present around the EBS of XIP1 probably aiding in the inhibition of GH10 and GH11.

It is generally expected that in globular proteins, the hydrophobic interactions that form the core is highly conserved and the polar residues that are often found in the periphery be less conserved. Interestingly we observed that the charged and polar residues (E, D, R and K) which are predominant in high–energy interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g005">Figure 5e</xref>), are found to have considerably high EC scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g005">Figure 5a</xref>).

Secondary structures that contribute to the hubs mostly come from helices followed by sheets, unlike the hubs in PEN<sub>–15</sub>.

It should be noted that the SCOP classification of families is based on sequence or structure or functional similarities. The interaction based phylogeny matches very well with the SCOP classification than the sequence based method for the same dataset. Despite low sequence identity (≤30%) we were able to find domains that exhibited as high as ∼85% interaction conservation (between d1r0ma1 and d1muca1 from DGDL family).

        <p>Lockless and Rangathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Lockless1">[27]</xref> introduced a sequence-based method to investigate statistical interactions between residues (Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA)). Later Halabi <italic>et al.</italic>, grouped these statistically correlated amino-acids into quasi-independent groups called sectors and studied their characteristics in Serine proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Halabi1">[28]</xref>. Here we have made the preliminary attempt to compare the interaction-energy based approach with the sequence based SCA approach. We selected β-glycanase family of TIM fold for this comparison. The interactions (≤−10 kJ/mol) common to this family were identified and cross verified with correlated mutations obtained from SCA. Although the correlation appeared to be weak at the pair-wise level, significant correlations are identified when the collective behavior of these correlated pairs are examined. In other words, there is a significant match between the residues of the sector from SCA and the clusters obtained from the present energy based analysis. The results have been pictorially depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002505-g007">Figure 7</xref> (details of the underlying calculations and comparison are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s009">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s010">Table S3</xref>). Interestingly, the agreement is more in the regions stabilizing the structure. The residues located more towards the function are identified by SCA and the PEN clusters encompass more of the residues required for the structural integrity. Based on this reasonable correlation of the SCA sectors and PEN clusters, we emphasize the fact that the protein structures should be viewed as a collective entity and an examination of individual residues and pair interactions in isolation may not always provide a holistic view of the structure and function of proteins. This feature was also reiterated by the coarse-grained network model studies on Rossmann-like domain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Keskin1">[29]</xref>. A weak agreement of pair-wise correlations from SCA predictions with the biochemical experiments on double mutants of PDZ domain perhaps may be attributed to this reason. Furthermore, fundamental issues like divergent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Lesk1">[23]</xref> or convergent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Farber1">[20]</xref> evolution of proteins like TIM barrel, whose sequences are so diverse, has always been debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Nagano1">[16]</xref>.

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>The sequence–structure relationship is a well–researched area, however, the factors that drive highly diverse sequences to fold into the same structure has not been well understood because of the apparent absence of consensus information from sequence similarity analyses. Here we have taken an alternative approach in which we consider “interaction conservation” and analyze whether the preservation of interactions is an essential driving force in the formation of the fold rather than sequence conservation. TIM barrel fold is one of the most popular folds that have a high sequence variability and functional diversity. In this study we have analyzed non–homologous members of different families of the TIM fold and investigated various factors that contribute to the formation of the fold.</p>
        <p>We have adapted the concept of interaction networks in order to study these protein structures from a global perspective. Also, by using interaction energies we have realistically represented the residue–residue relationships in the network. The subsequent methodology that exploits structural alignment to align the Protein Energy Networks (PENs) in a family of TIM fold has provided us with valuable information on the conservation of interactions in the family.</p>
        <p>It was evident from our analyses of conserved interactions that the central β barrel is being stabilized by (a) sequentially long–range conserved high–energy interactions and (b) low–energy vdW interactions from residues of the neighboring strands interacting in tandem, in addition to the hydrogen–bonding network in the sheet. Also, the analysis of the other interfaces like the α/β and the α/α show an absence of any high–energy conserved interactions, and being maintained exclusively by low–energy interactions. In general we found that the residues involved in high–energy interactions are better conserved than low–energy interactions. From our cluster analysis it was seen that the conserved interactions are not segregated into isolated interacting pairs but rather coalesce together to form a sub–network of interactions. Our hub analysis has shown that the charged and the conserved residues are favorable to be hubs at higher energies, while hydrophobic residues with less conservation act as hubs at lower energies. All these results suggest that (a) the β barrel formation driven by high–energy interactions (with the participating residues being conserved) seem to be an important step in the organization of the TIM barrel; (b) the formation of the other interfaces mainly by low–energy interactions (with residue conservation being immaterial) is a more canonical step in the fold formation common to all the folds of the α/β class, and can be taken up by a variety of sequences, thus contributing the high sequence diversity. These conclusions concur with several experimental observations that suggest that while the α/β interfaces in TIM are resilient to mutations the β barrel is sensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Sterner1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Hocker1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Kallenbach1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Houbrechts1">[44]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We have analyzed the structural and functional relevance of conserved interactions in the regions involving loops in various TIM barrel families. We found that loop based high–energy conserved interactions (e&lt;−20 kJ/mol) are present near the active sites of a number of TIM barrel families. This suggests that the loop based interactions are conserved during evolution to maintain the active site geometry for successful enzymatic functioning of the TIM proteins. Therefore this method can be used in functional annotation of hypothetical proteins in cases where there are structural homologues but no sequence homologues. Finally we exploited the concept of “interaction conservation” to construct a cladogram and compare it with the sequence based cladogram. The outcome of analysis reinforces our assumption that it may be interaction conservation and not necessarily sequence conservation that determines the fold organization. Our attempt to correlate our method with that of SCA suggests that there may be significant correlation between the sector residues and cluster residues. However, extensive investigation by complimentary approaches such as PEN, SCA and Elastic Network Models (ENM) should be carried out and such an analysis will be able to provide more clarity to studying such protein systems.</p>
        <p>The methodology of representing the protein structures as interaction energy based networks and using structural alignments to align these networks has provided us a very convenient handle to study structure homology among sequentially diverse proteins, from a network point of view. We were able to study the salient features that stabilize the TIM fold using this method, and also analyze how interaction conservation can play an important role in the formation of this fold. We believe that this methodology can shed valuable knowledge on the fold maintenance by remote homologues and pave way for useful <italic>de novo</italic> design and analysis of protein folds.</p>

        <p>Structure network construction requires the coordinates of the interacting amino acids (nodes) and a criterion to define the interactions (edges). A purely geometry based all-atom interaction can be deduced from the crystal structure, which we had used to describe the Protein Structure Networks (PSNs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Kannan1">[48]</xref>. Recently, we have considered the chemistry in greater detail by explicitly considering the interaction energy between residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002505-Vijayabaskar2">[38]</xref>. Although qualitative results are expected to be similar from both formalisms, PEN has the advantage of capturing subtle details of importance, whereas the PSN approach has the advantage of being simple to adopt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002505.s007">Figure S7</xref>). The interaction energies can be obtained on a single structure or on an ensemble of structures of a given protein. The set of structures can be obtained from experiments (X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) under different environment or by simulations from a single starting conformation. In the case where the conformational changes are small, a set of conformations will provide a statistically relevant average structure and in the case of large conformational change, it is advantageous to study them independently to characterize the structural variations in different states of the same protein, for example to understand the effect of ligand binding. In this study we have used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain the structure ensemble for each of the TIM domains.</p>

          <p><bold>Comparison between Cα distances between residues and the corresponding interaction energies.</bold> The above scatterplot shows the distances between the Cα atoms of residues plotted as a function of their interaction energies. It can be seen that although the interaction energy decreases as the cartesian distances between the Cα atoms decreases (green arrow), a number residue pairs fail to follow this behavior (red arrow, blue arrow and the points above the green arrow). This behavior can be attributed to high energy electrostatic interactions, cation-pi interactions, pi-pi interactions etc. that behave differently from contact based vdW interactions. Therefore, although most of the topology-based networks behave very well in studying many biophysical characteristics of proteins, we believe that PENs are capable of capturing the variations in the protein structures brought about by non-vdW interactions. In other words, while contact based networks are good at representing the width of the well that describes the interactions among protein residues, the energy based networks are capable of representing the depth of the well. (It should be noted that any Cα- Cα distance greater than 20 Å is considered as 20 Å and any <italic>E<sub>ij</sub></italic> less than −30 kJ/mol is considered as −30 kJ/mol).</p>
