<abstract>
<p>The fate of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) during corticogenesis is determined by a complex interplay of genetic or epigenetic components, but the underlying mechanism is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that Suppressor of Mek null (Smek) interact with methyl-CpG–binding domain 3 (Mbd3) and the complex plays a critical role in self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of NPCs. We found that Smek promotes Mbd3 polyubiquitylation and degradation, blocking recruitment of the repressive Mbd3/nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex at the neurogenesis-associated gene loci, and, as a consequence, increasing acetyl histone H3 activity and cortical neurogenesis. Furthermore, overexpression of Mbd3 significantly blocked neuronal differentiation of NPCs, and Mbd3 depletion rescued neurogenesis defects seen in <italic>Smek1/2</italic> knockout mice. These results reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying Smek/Mbd3/NuRD axis-mediated control of NPCs’ self-renewal and neuronal differentiation during mammalian corticogenesis.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Neural progenitor cells are self-renewing, multipotent cells that generate major neural cell types, including neurons and glia. Their fate during development of the cerebral cortex is determined by a complex interplay of genetic and epigenetic components. It has been shown that Suppressor of Mek null (Smek) proteins—which are evolutionarily conserved—play a role during the asymmetric cell division of neuroblasts in invertebrates. Methyl-CpG–binding domain 3 (Mbd3) protein, a core component of the repressive nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, is an important epigenetic regulator that plays an essential role in mammalian development. In this study, we discovered that Smek interacts with Mbd3 and promotes its degradation via a posttranslational modification called polyubiquitylation. Degradation of Mb3, in turn, blocks recruitment of Mbd3/NuRD complex on target gene promoters, leading to an increase in neuronal differentiation during cortical development. This study not only elucidates a distinct mechanism for Smek-mediated neuronal differentiation but also identifies Smek as a negative regulator of the Mbd3 protein during cortical brain development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing, multipotent cells that generate major neural cell types, including neurons and glia, in the developing central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref002">2</xref>]. During neurogenesis, NSCs are derived from neuroepithelial cells (NECs), which first divide symmetrically to expand the population and then undergo a series of asymmetric cell divisions to produce neural progenitor cells (NPCs), lineage-restricted precursor cells (RPCs), and mature neural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref003">3</xref>]. NSC fate determination is tightly regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref006">6</xref>]. Recent findings suggest that neurodevelopmental and neurological anomalies, such as schizophrenia, autism, and depression, can emerge from abnormal specification, growth, and differentiation of NSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Suppressor of Mek null (Smek), an evolutionarily conserved protein family, consists of two isoforms, Smek1 (PP4R3A) and Smek2 (PP4R3B), first reported as playing a role in the formation of a functional phosphatase group with PP4c, PP4R1, and PP4R2 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref009">9</xref>]. Smek was initially identified in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> as a playing a role in cell polarity, chemotaxis, and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref010">10</xref>]. Smek also has several functions in lower eukaryotes, such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, including roles in longevity by modulating DAF-16/FOXO3a transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref011">11</xref>], DNA repair through dephosphorylation of phosphorylated H2AX (g-H2AX) during DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref012">12</xref>], and glucose metabolism by controlling cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated, transcriptional coactivator 2 (CRTC2)-dependent gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref013">13</xref>]. Notably, Smek also plays a critical role in cell-fate determination in higher eukaryotes. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, PP4R3/Falafel (Flfl), which is an orthologous of Smek and is conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution, regulates asymmetric cell division by controlling localization of Miranda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref016">16</xref>]. In mice, which express orthologous Smek 1 and 2, both Smek proteins suppress <italic>brachyury</italic> expression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and Smek1, especially, promotes NSC neuronal differentiation by negatively regulating Par3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref016">16</xref>]. Although we have shown that the Smek isoform Smek1 promotes NSC neuronal differentiation, signaling pathways required for that activity remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Methyl-CpG–binding domain protein 3 (Mbd3), a core component of the repressive nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, possesses a conserved methyl-CpG–binding domain (Mbd) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref018">18</xref>]. Unlike other family members, which recognize 5′-methyl-cytosine (5′-mC)-modified DNA, Mbd3 specifically recognizes 5′-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5′-hmC), an epigenetic marker highly enriched in NSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref020">20</xref>]. Mbd3 plays an important role in brain development. Mbd3 expression is reported to be predominant in cortical NECs of the embryonic forebrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref021">21</xref>]. Mice lacking Mbd3 die in utero before neurogenesis is completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref022">22</xref>]. Conditional knockout of Mbd3 in neural progenitor cells leads to defects of differentiation of appropriate cell types during neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref023">23</xref>]. Despite emerging evidence that Mbd3 has a critical function in the CNS, little is known about its regulatory mechanism in NSCs.</p>
<p>To understand Smek protein function during mammalian CNS neurogenesis, we screened for novel Smek-binding proteins that regulate NPC neuronal differentiation and identified Mbd3, a potent epigenetic regulator, as a Smek-interacting protein. We found that Mbd3 is highly expressed in NPC populations in the ventricular zone, and it was predominantly expressed in the nucleus. Smek interacted directly with the Mbd3’s Mbd domain, destabilizing Mbd3 protein and its interaction with NuRD components, and sequentially, preventing accumulation of the Mbd3/NuRD complex on target gene loci functioning in neurogenesis. Such dissociation of Mbd3/NuRD complex promotes NPC neuronal differentiation. Moreover, overexpression of Mbd3 significantly inhibited neuronal differentiation of <italic>wild-type</italic> NPCs, while Mbd3 depletion rescued neurogenesis defects seen in <italic>Smek</italic> knockout mice.</p>
<p>This work identifies a novel pathway of Smek and Mbd3/NuRD complex in brain development and could encourage discovery of novel epigenetic regulators governing neuronal differentiation.</p>

<title>Double knockout of <italic>Smek1/2</italic> triggers severe neurogenesis defects in vitro and in vivo</title>
<p>Recently, we reported that Smek1 promotes neurogenesis during mouse cortical development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref015">15</xref>]. To further characterize Smek function in neurogenesis, we generated Smek1 and Smek2 double knockout (dKO) mice and set out to analyze cortical development in <italic>Smek1</italic> knockout (<italic>KO</italic>) and <italic>Smek1</italic> and <italic>Smek2 dKO</italic> embryo brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). To do so, we undertook immunohistochemical analysis of the embryonic cortex derived from <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> mice and observed a decrease in the number of cells positive for Tuj1, an early neuronal marker (~15% and ~25% fewer Tuj1+ cells at E12.5 and E14.5, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We observed similar decreases in postmitotic cortical neuron marker Tbr1-positive cells (~15% and ~20% reductions at E12.5 and E14.5, respectively) and Tuj1 and Tbr1 double-positive cells (near 20% reduction in each stage) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The number of mature microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive neurons also significantly decreased by ~12% in the E12.5 cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, right and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). In <italic>Smek1/2</italic> mice, the number of Pax6-positive NPCs increased significantly (by ~23% at both E12.5 and E14.5), as did Nestin/Ki67 double-positive cells (~24% increase at E12.5) compared with <italic>wild-type</italic> (<italic>WT</italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s001">S1D–S1F Fig</xref>). As expected, neurogenesis defects in <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> embryonic brains were greater than those seen in <italic>Smek1 KO</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s011">S1 Table</xref>). These results demonstrated that in the <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> mice, the number of neurons is reduced while the number of neural stem cells is increased.</p>

<p>To assess direct effects of Smek loss on NPC differentiation capacity, we cultured <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> NPCs derived from E11.5 mouse embryo brains in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and then withdrew bFGF to induce neural differentiation.

<title>Smek1/2 interact with Mbd3 during cortical neurogenesis</title>
<p>In order to determine a detailed molecular mechanism modulating the differentiation of NPCs by Smek, we sought to identify proteins interacting with Smek protein. To identify how Smek mediates neuronal differentiation of NPCs, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening assay was performed and revealed that Smek interacts with full-length Mbd3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s012">S2 Table</xref>). An immunoprecipitation (IP) assay confirmed the interaction of Smek1 and Smek2 with Mbd3 in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>).

Furthermore, colocalization of endogenous Mbd3 and Smek2 protein was also observed in the nucleus of in vitro cultured NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Both Smek1 and Mbd3 proteins were expressed in NPCs of the ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ) in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>), and merged images reveal that Smek and Mbd3 staining was nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Mbd3 is highly enriched in the nucleus of the VZ progenitor cells and its expression in the nucleus showed a gradually decreasing pattern in the direction of the intermediate zone (IZ) and cortical plate (CP). Smek1 is expressed in the nuclear or perinuclear region of cortical progenitor cells in the VZ, but its expression and nuclear localization is significantly increased in the differentiated neurons in the IZ and CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>). The interaction of endogenous Smek and Mbd3 were further confirmed by co-IP of Smek and Mbd3 using NPC lysates.

A Smek <italic>N</italic>-terminal deletion mutant (ΔRanBD) did not interact with Mbd3 protein, shown by co-IP of Smek and Mbd3 in HEK293T cells, whereas interaction of other Smek deletion mutants with Mbd3 was comparable to the full-length protein, suggesting the RanBD domain of Smek mediates Smek’s interaction with Mbd3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). To map to the domains on Mbd3 required for Smek interaction, we generated glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion Mbd3 mutant proteins in bacteria and incubated these proteins with HEK293T cell lysates expressing Smek2. GST pull-down assays revealed that the Smek-Mbd3 interaction was disrupted in Mbd3 deletion mutants lacking the first 92 <italic>N</italic>-terminal amino acids (ΔN92), a region encompassing the Mbd domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">Fig 2G</xref>, upper panel).

<title>Smek regulates enrichment of Mbd3/NuRD complex on neuronal gene loci and consequent gene expression</title>
<p>Smek has a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and is nuclear localized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref015">15</xref>], suggesting a potential role in regulating transcription. To determine whether the Smek protein is associated with chromatin—and if so, whether it is enriched on chromatin loci of neurogenesis-associated genes—we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in NPCs using a Smek1 antibody. Genome-wide binding profiling demonstrated that Smek proteins bind to chromatin loci of genes related to organ morphogenesis, cell-fate determination, and CNS development and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s007">S7A, S7B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, Smek specifically bound proximal promoter regions and gene bodies of neuronal genes such as <italic>Dlx1</italic>, <italic>Dlx2</italic>, <italic>Tlx3</italic>, <italic>NeuroD1</italic>, <italic>Ascl1</italic>, and <italic>Lbx1</italic>, which were known to highly express in neuron or proneuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s007">S7C, S7D Fig</xref>). Unlike Smek, which lacks a known DNA-binding motif, Mbd3 exhibits the Mbd domain, which reportedly binds 5′-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5′-hmC) regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref020">20</xref>]. We therefore asked whether Smek and Mbd3 share similar genomic regions in NPCs, initially by determining whether Mbd3 binds neuronal gene promoters that Smek binds to. To do so, we undertook ChIP-qPCR with a Mbd3 antibody in <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> NPCs cultured in undifferentiation or differentiation conditions. This analysis confirmed enrichment of Mbd3 on the Smek-bound loci of genes including <italic>Dlx1</italic>, <italic>Dlx2</italic>, <italic>Tlx3</italic>, <italic>NeuroD1</italic>, <italic>Ascl1</italic>, and <italic>Lbx1</italic> in undifferentiated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g005">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). Moreover, Mbd3 enrichment on these gene loci significantly decreased under differentiation conditions in <italic>wild-type</italic> NPCs but was unchanged in <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> NPCs under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g005">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). Then we asked whether enrichment of the Smek1 protein on chromatin loci of neurogenesis-associated genes is dependent on Mbd3 protein, and we performed ChIP-qPCR with Smek1 and Mbd3 antibodies in shScramble or shMbd3 knockdown (KD) NPCs cultured in undifferentiation or differentiation conditions. These results demonstrated that occupancy of Smek1 on the promoters of <italic>Dlx1</italic>, <italic>Dlx1as</italic>, <italic>Tlx3</italic>, <italic>NeuroD1</italic>, <italic>Ascl1</italic>, and <italic>Lbx1</italic> genes, but not <italic>Gfap</italic> genes, is dependent on Mbd3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g005">Fig 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s007">S7F Fig</xref>). Mbd3 has been reported to represses transcription by recruiting the NuRD complex to target gene loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref020">20</xref>]. Co-IP experiments showed that Mbd3 interacted with MTA1, RbAP46, HDAC1, and HDAC2, which are components of NuRD complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s007">S7G Fig</xref>). We then undertook ChIP-qPCR with HDAC1, HDAC2, MTA1, and acetyl histone H3 antibodies using <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> NPCs cultured in differentiation conditions. ChIP analysis revealed that enrichments of NuRD components HDAC1, HDAC2, and MTA1 to target gene loci were significantly increased in <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> NPCs when compared with those of the <italic>wild type</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Inversely, the amount of acetyl histone H3 was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). These findings suggest that Smek inhibits enrichment of Mbd3/NuRD complex to neurogenesis-associated gene loci and increases acetyl histone H3 activity for their gene transcription during neurogenesis. These data also suggest that NuRD activity is dependent on Mbd3 ability, which can bind to target DNA, and Smek, as an upstream regulator of Mbd3/NuRD complex, promotes Mbd3 degradation, potentially allowing transcription of neuronal differentiation–associated genes by disrupting association and enrichment of Mbd3/NuRD complex on target gene loci.</p>

Full-length Mbd3 (but not mutant form) overexpression attenuated <italic>Dlx1</italic>, <italic>Tlx3</italic>, <italic>NeuroD1</italic>, <italic>Tuj1</italic>, <italic>Gad67</italic>, and <italic>NeuN</italic> gene expression, all neuronal lineage markers, but had no effect on glial cell differentiation or gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s008">S8A–S8D Fig</xref>). As noted above, Mbd3 bound specifically to the <italic>Dlx1</italic>, <italic>Tlx3</italic>, <italic>NeuroD1</italic>, <italic>Ascl1</italic>, and <italic>Lbx1</italic> gene loci, and this association decreased upon induction of differentiation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Thus, we asked whether decreased neuronal gene expression following Mbd3 overexpression paralleled increased occupancy of Mbd3 on target promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). As expected, the amount of overexpressed Mbd3 bound to gene promoters in NPCs in differentiation conditions over 2 d was similar to that seen in nondifferentiation conditions, leading to attenuate <italic>Dlx1</italic>, <italic>Tlx3</italic>, <italic>NeuroD1</italic>, <italic>Tuj1</italic>, <italic>Gad67</italic>, and <italic>NeuN</italic> gene expression, all markers of neuronal lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). In contrast, there was little or no accumulation of Mbd3 on the <italic>Gfap</italic> promoter under the differentiation condition over 2 d for NPCs after Mbd3 overexpression, suggesting that Mbd3 blocks neuronal rather than glial cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). Immunocytochemistry analysis also showed that Mbd3 overexpression prevented NPC neuronal differentiation but did not affect astrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g006">Fig 6C, 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s008">S8C, S8D Fig</xref>). Moreover, in both control and Mbd3-overexpressing NPCs, Nestin staining was comparable in staining intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). These data suggest that Mbd3 is a novel regulator for neuronal cell-fate determination of NPCs.</p>

<title>Mbd3 loss rescues neurogenesis defects and promotes neuronal differentiation</title>
<p>To further investigate whether the Smek-Mbd3 axis regulates neurogenesis, we knocked down endogenous Mbd3 using an shMbd3 lentiviral vector in cultured <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> NPCs and then induced differentiation for 2 d.

About 74% of total EGFP-positive Mbd3 knockdown cells migrated toward the IZ or CP, while only ~39% of EGFP-positive control cells showed a similar migration pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we have analyzed mouse embryos lacking functional <italic>Smek1</italic> and <italic>Smek2</italic> genes as well as cultured NPCs derived from those animals to understand <italic>Smek</italic> function during cortical development. We discovered that <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> NPCs exhibit significantly reduced capacity for neuronal differentiation and increased self-renewal activity. Furthermore, we employed a Y2H screen to search for Smek binding partners and identified Mbd3 as a novel Smek-interacting protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s012">S2 Table</xref>). Importantly, we observed that Smek promotes Mbd3 protein degradation and reduces Mbd3 occupancy of neural differentiation–associated gene promoters, likely increasing transcription of those genes via inhibiting recruitment of the repressive NuRD complex.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the developing CNS, increased Mbd3 instability had an effect only on neuronal differentiation, with little or no effect on glial cell fate (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s007">S7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s008">S8B–S8D</xref> Figs). We could not determine the molecular mechanism by which the Smek-Mbd3 axis specifically regulates neuronal cell-fate determination but not glial cell fate. In our previous study, we found that protein phosphatase PP4c interacts with Smek and this complex suppressed Par3 activity for differentiation of NPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref015">15</xref>]. PP4c is known to regulate neuronal cell-fate determination and organization of early cortical progenitors in the ventricular zone of the embryo brain by modulating spindle orientation during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref024">24</xref>], and we could confirm the role of PP4c in neuronal differentiation of NPC by a PP4c loss-of-function study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of PP4c significantly abolished neuronal cell as well as glial cell differentiation of NPCs, similar to Smek loss of function, and this finding suggests that Smek/PP4c/Par3 might have a different biological function from Smek/Mbd3 in at least regulating glial cell gene expression of NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). Moreover, Par3 regulation of Smek/PP4c during neurogenesis exclusively occurs in a cytosolic fraction but not in the nucleus of NPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref015">15</xref>]. However, Smek and Mbd3 expression and transcriptional repression of Mbd3/NuRD complex mainly occurs in the nucleus of NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Our preliminary investigation of the relationship between Smek-PP4c complex and Mbd3 protein stability also reveals that loss of PP4c could not affect Smek-mediated Mbd3 polyubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). In addition, ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR data show that Smek and Mbd3 are not significantly enriched at <italic>Gfap</italic> gene loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s007">S7F Fig</xref>). Thus, overall data suggest that the Smek-Mbd3 axis likely functions independently of the Smek-PP4c-Par3 axis, at least in regulation of <italic>Gfap</italic> gene expression, and that the Smek-Mbd3 interaction plays a crucial role in neuronal cell-fate determination in NPCs.</p>
<p>So far, five vertebrate MBD proteins have been identified as members of the MBD protein family: Mbd1, Mbd2, Mbd3, Mbd4, and MECP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref026">26</xref>], and these members are more highly expressed in the brain than in other tissues, leading investigators to hypothesize that they may play a critical role in normal brain development and in behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref028">28</xref>]. Our data indicate that Mbd3 represses neurogenesis and likely functions differently from other family members. For example, Mbd2 and Mbd3 are closely related and share a highly conserved methyl-CpG–binding domain, but mouse studies indicate that the two proteins are not functionally redundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref024">24</xref>], possibly because Mbd3 specifically recognizes methylated DNA, especially, 5′-hydroxymethylcytosine (5′-hmC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref019">19</xref>]. Deletion of Mbd3 gene in neural progenitor cells leads to generation of neurons expressing both deep- and upper-layer markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref023">23</xref>], suggesting that Mbd3 is required to maintain appropriate transcription in progenitor and neurons during neural development. A recent study suggests that Mbd3 may fine-tune expression of both active and silent genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref029">29</xref>]. Other studies suggest that conversion of 5′-mC to 5′-hmC coincides with increased transcriptional activity by excluding Mbd proteins from target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref030">30</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, we found that Mbd3 is specifically bound to neuronal gene loci, and our findings suggest that it is likely released from these loci by Smek during NPC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Mbd3 is a subunit of the NuRD complex, which has nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref018">18</xref>] and thus regulates gene expression. The molecular function of this complex has been extensively studied in the context of tumorigenesis, stem cell pluripotency, and brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref034">34</xref>]. Mbd3 mutation or abnormal expression may function in tumorigenesis by perturbing gene expression. Like Mbd3, other Mbd proteins, especially Mbd2 and Mbd4, are associated with progression of cancer such as colorectal cancer, albeit by different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref036">36</xref>]. Furthermore, Mbd3 knockdown during somatic cell reprogramming significantly increases reprogramming efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref033">33</xref>]. Although Mbd3 activity is likely relevant to pathologies seen in cancer, neurological disease, and developmental defects, mechanisms underlying its regulation remain unclear. We propose a novel function in which Mbd3 protein levels, depending on Smek activity, decrease during neurogenesis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g002">2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g003">3A–3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s004">S4C and S4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s005">S5A and S5B</xref> Figs). <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> NPCs or the embryonic cortex show aberrantly high Mbd3 levels that may repress neuronal gene expression and underlie developmental defects seen in the latter. In accordance, we report that Smek promotes ubiquitylation and degradation of Mbd3 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g003">3A–3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g004">4A–4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s005">S5A–S5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s006">S6A</xref> Figs). Our data also indicate that Smek regulation of Mbd3 is not transcriptional, based on the lack of significant change in Mbd3 mRNA levels over NPC differentiation. Conversely, Mbd3 protein levels decreased during neuronal differentiation in the embryonic cortex starting at E12.5 in mice. In addition, decreased Mbd3 levels seen in cultured NPCs are blocked by MG132 treatment concomitant with accumulation of polyubiquitylated Mbd3. These results overall indicate that Mbd3 activity is regulated at the level of protein stability and that Smek likely governs this process. Changes in protein stability often constitute a more rapid means of regulating protein activity than does modulation of transcription. Therefore, regulation of Mbd3 protein stability might function epigenetically to recruit the NuRD complex to 5′-hmC–modified gene promoters. To our knowledge, this is the first report of regulation of an Mbd family protein by stability changes.</p>
<p>We also examined potential factors or complexes that might function in Smek-dependent Mbd3 degradation. To do so, we sought potential E3 ligase proteins that might catalyze Mbd3 ubiquitylation by using Biograph software and identified the E3 ligase TRIpartite Motif protein 33 (TRIM33) protein, which has an <italic>N</italic>-terminal Really Interesting New Gene (RING)-domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). TRIM33 specifically targets phosphorylated nuclear proteins for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref037">37</xref>]. Interestingly, we have previously identified protein kinase C (PKC) lambda/iota (λ/ι), a serine/threonine kinase, as a binding partner of Smek1 from a mass spectrometry analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref015">15</xref>]. PKC isoforms contain an NLS and contribute diverse cellular physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref040">40</xref>]. Smek1/2 also have NLS sequences and are localized exclusively in the nucleus in interphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref015">15</xref>]. To further investigate the involvement of PKCλ/ι in the molecular mechanism for Mbd3 protein stability, we performed prediction of putative kinases for phosphorylation of Mbd3 protein by GPS (group-based prediction system) software 3.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gps.biocuckoo.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://gps.biocuckoo.org/</ext-link>). (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s013">S3 Table</xref>). Interestingly, we predicted PKCλ/ι as putative kinases for Mbd3 phosphorylation. Although it still remains unclear how Smek1/2 promotes ubiquitylation and stability of Mbd3, accumulating data and predictions suggest that nuclear-localized Smek1/2-PKCλ/ι complex with TRIM33 may function in Mbd3 ubiquitylation and degradation. Alternatively, Aurora-A protein, a serine/threonine kinase, reportedly physically associates with Mbd3 at centrosomes in early M phase in vivo and phosphorylates Mbd3 protein in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref041">41</xref>]. These findings suggest that Aurora-A may also be involved in the regulation of Mbd3 protein stability as a different mechanism from Smek-PKCλ/ι complex. This topic will be addressed in future studies.</p>
<p>Smek orthologues in <italic>Drosophila</italic> play a critical role in neuroblast mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref016">16</xref>]. In Smek-deficit neuroblasts, cell-fate determinants, such as Prospero and Miranda, are no longer localized to the cell cortex; instead, they are distributed in the cytoplasm of dividing neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref016">16</xref>]. As a result, asymmetric cell division and neurogenesis are defective. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system, another class of asymmetric cell division regulators are epigenetic modulators. However, it is not clear if Smek functions through epigenetic modulators. Our studies suggest that Smek and Mbd3 have the opposite function in the NPCs’ differentiation in vertebrate systems. Although these studies do not address asymmetric cell division, our research may shed light on asymmetric cell division and neurogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals.</p>
<p>Our findings also highlight the importance of Smek/Mbd3 interaction in regulating NPC differentiation. Other studies suggest that Smek and Mbd3 may have overlapping functions or activities in brain development, stem cell activity, and regulation of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref042">42</xref>]. Our studies support a functional relationship of Smek and Mbd3 in NPCs. Our mapping analysis shows that Smek/Mbd3 interaction is mediated by the Mbd domain of Mbd3. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed close proximity of these proteins in the NPC nucleus, and we have observed coincident expression of Smek and Mbd3 in the mouse embryonic brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001220.ref021">21</xref>]. Finally, we found that Smek and Mbd3 target the same neuronal gene loci for regulating transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Further analysis suggests a model in which Smek regulates target gene transcription by regulating Mbd3 protein stability, interaction with NuRD components, and recruitment of Mbd3/NuRD complex to the promoters of target genes. <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> exhibits reduced neuronal differentiation and decreased expression of <italic>Dlx1</italic>, <italic>Dlx2</italic>, <italic>NeuroD1</italic>, <italic>Tuj1</italic>, <italic>Gad67</italic>, <italic>NeuN</italic>, and stabilizing Mbd3 protein, while Mbd3 overexpression attenuated Smek-mediated neuronal differentiation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g001">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g003">3A–3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001220.g006">6A, 6C and 6D</xref>). Thus, this study is significant not only for demonstrating Smek-mediated Mbd3 protein degradation but also in providing evidence that Smek/Mbd3 interaction regulates neuronal gene expression and neuronal differentiation during cortical development. In conclusion, we report functional interaction of Smek with Mbd3 in neuronal differentiation of NPCs.</p>

<p><italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> mice were generated using gene trap mutant ES cells obtained from the Gene Trapping Consortium. Gene trap vectors were targeted between exons 3 and 4 of the <italic>Smek1</italic> gene and between exons 10 and 11 of the <italic>Smek2</italic> gene, respectively. <italic>Smek1</italic> and <italic>Smek2</italic> mutant ES cells (E14) were injected into mouse blastocysts and chimeric mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice. <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> mice were generated by crossing C57BL6J-<italic>Smek1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> with <italic>Smek2</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice. After six generations, mice were used for analysis. Although <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> mice can die at later stages of embryonic development, we were able to obtain <italic>dKO</italic> embryos as late as E14.5 with a normal Mendelian distribution. Thus, we have conducted functional analysis of <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> embryos at E11.5, E12.5, and E14.5. Embryos and pups of <italic>wild-type</italic> and heterozygous <italic>KO</italic> mice were collected from timed-mated pregnant females.</p>

<title>In utero electroporation</title>
<p>All procedures followed guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the National Institutes of Health. A total of 2.5% (w/v) avertin (1 g/ml solution of 2, 2, 2-Tribromoethanol, 97% in tert-amylalcohol [99%]; Aldrich, catalog numbers T4,840–2 and 24,048–6, respectively) in 0.9% saline was injected i.p. (15 μl/g of body weight) to anesthetize pregnant mice (E13.5). A laparotomy was performed, and the uterus with embryos was exposed. A total of ~2–5 μl of plasmid DNA (approximately 2 μg/ μl, dissolved in water) was injected into the lateral ventricle using a fine-glass microcapillary and a PV830 pneumatic PicoPump. Electroporation was performed using a Nepagene CUY21SC electroporator (amplitude, 50 V [E13.5]; duration, 50 ms; intervals, 150 ms). To deliver electrical pulses, tweezer-type circular electrodes (7-mm diameter) were used with the positive side directed to the medial wall of the ventricle into which DNA was injected. Uterine horns were repositioned in the abdominal cavity, and the abdominal wall and skin were sewed with surgical sutures. Mice were kept on a warm plate (37°C) for recovery. Two to three days later, embryos were taken from mothers and fixed with 4% (w/v) PFA (Sigma) in PBS (pH 7.4). After a 24 h fixation at 4°C, embryo brains were transferred to a 30% (w/v) sucrose solution in 4% PFA.

<title>Effect of PP4c knockdown on neurogenesis and Smek-mediated Mbd3 protein stability, and effect of NuRD components inhibition on neurogenesis of NPCs.</title>
<p>(A) <italic>Wild-type</italic> NPCs were transfected with either control siRNA or siPP4c and grown for 2 days in N2 medium with bFGF. qPCR analysis was performed to detect indicated mRNAs. (B) HEK293 cell lines stably overexpressing Smek1 were transfected with indicated constructs, treated with MG132 for 6 hours, and immunoprecipitated with myc-conjugated beads. Mbd3 ubiquitylation was detected by immunoblot with anti-HA antibody. Smek1, PP4c, and a-tubulin in lysates were detected by immunoblotting (n = 3). (C) <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> NPCs were transfected with indicated siRNAs and grown for 2 days in N2 medium with bFGF. Indicated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Relative (Rel.) Tuj1/a-tubulin was quantified by the Image J quantification software (n = 2). (D-F) <italic>Smek1/2 dKO</italic> NPCs were treated with indicated HDAC inhibitors and grown for 2 days in N2 medium with bFGF. (D) Indicated proteins in lysates were detected by immunoblotting and (E-F) qPCR analysis was performed to detect indicated mRNAs. The underlying all individual quantification data for panels A, E, and F can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001220.s018">S2 Data</xref> File.</p>
