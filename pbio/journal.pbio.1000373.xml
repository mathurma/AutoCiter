<p>Forced expression of single defined transcription factors can selectively and stably convert cultured astroglia into synapse-forming excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro to generate neurons following forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors, thus opening new avenues towards a potential use of endogenous astroglia for brain repair. However, in previous attempts astroglia-derived neurons failed to establish functional synapses, a severe limitation towards functional neurogenesis. It remained therefore also unknown whether neurons derived from reprogrammed astroglia could be directed towards distinct neuronal subtype identities by selective expression of distinct neurogenic fate determinants. Here we show that strong and persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants driven by silencing-resistant retroviral vectors instructs astroglia from the postnatal cortex in vitro to mature into fully functional, synapse-forming neurons. Importantly, the neurotransmitter fate choice of astroglia-derived neurons can be controlled by selective expression of distinct neurogenic transcription factors: forced expression of the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) directs cortical astroglia to generate synapse-forming glutamatergic neurons; in contrast, the ventral telencephalic fate determinant Dlx2 induces a GABAergic identity, although the overall efficiency of Dlx2-mediated neuronal reprogramming is much lower compared to Neurog2, suggesting that cortical astroglia possess a higher competence to respond to the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant. Interestingly, however, reprogramming of astroglia towards the generation of GABAergic neurons was greatly facilitated when the astroglial cells were first expanded as neurosphere cells prior to transduction with Dlx2. Importantly, this approach of expansion under neurosphere conditions and subsequent reprogramming with distinct neurogenic transcription factors can also be extended to reactive astroglia isolated from the adult injured cerebral cortex, allowing for the selective generation of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These data provide evidence that cortical astroglia can undergo a conversion across cell lineages by forced expression of a single neurogenic transcription factor, stably generating fully differentiated neurons. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming of astroglia is not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from terminally differentiated astroglia of the adult cerebral cortex following injury-induced reactivation.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The brain consists of two major cell types: neurons, which transmit information, and glial cells, which support and protect neurons. Interestingly, evidence suggests that some glial cells, including astroglia, can be directly converted into neurons by specific proteins, a transformation that may aid in the functional repair of damaged brain tissue. However, in order for the repaired brain areas to function properly, it is important that astroglia be directed into appropriate neuronal subclasses. In this study, we show that non-neurogenic astroglia from the cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro using just a single transcription factor to yield fully functional excitatory or inhibitory neurons. We achieved this result through forced expression of the same transcription factors that instruct the genesis of these distinct neuronal subtypes during embryonic forebrain development. Moreover we demonstrate that reactive astroglia isolated from the adult cortex after local injury can be reprogrammed into synapse-forming excitatory or inhibitory neurons following a similar strategy. Our findings provide evidence that endogenous glial cells may prove a promising strategy for replacing neurons that have degenerated due to trauma or disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While exerting diverse functions within the brain parenchyma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Wang1">[1]</xref>, astroglia are remarkable in that they also function as neural stem or progenitor cells in specific regions of the postnatal and adult brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Doetsch1">[2]</xref>, such as the ventricular subependymal zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Doetsch2">[3]</xref> and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Seri1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Seri2">[5]</xref>. This raises the possibility that even astroglia from non-neurogenic regions such as the cerebral cortex may be reprogrammed towards neurogenesis when provided with the appropriate transcriptional cues. Indeed, we could previously show that astroglia from the early postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro towards the generation of neurons capable of action potential (AP) firing by a single transcription factor, such as Pax6 or its target, the pro-neural transcription factor neurogenin-2 (Neurog2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Heins1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>. These findings may open interesting avenues towards the potential activation of endogenous astroglia for neuronal repair of injured brain tissue.</p>
<p>However, several major obstacles remained to be overcome to fully exploit the potential of reprogrammed astroglia as an endogenous cellular source for neuronal repair. Firstly, reprogramming of astroglia towards neurons remained incomplete as the astroglia-derived neurons failed to establish a functional presynaptic output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>, an obvious hurdle towards functional repair that requires participation in a neural network. Secondly, given the lack of functional presynaptic output, we could not determine the neuronal subtype generated by the reprogrammed astroglial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>. This raises the conceptual concern of whether neurons derived from astroglial cells in a given brain region may be restricted towards the generation of a respective neuronal subtype. During development of the forebrain in rodents, stem/progenitor cells in the dorsal telencephalon generate exclusively excitatory glutamatergic neurons, directed by Pax6 and Neurog1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Schuurmans1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Guillemot2">[10]</xref>, while stem/progenitor cells in the ventral telencephalon give rise primarily to inhibitory GABAergic neurons, governed by the fate determinants mammalian achaete-schute homolog 1 (Mash1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Casarosa1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Parras1">[12]</xref> and Dlx1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Petryniak1">[13]</xref>. Region-specific fate restriction also seems to apply for adult neural stem cells that are intrinsically specified towards the generation of distinct neuronal subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Merkle1">[14]</xref>. This implies that despite their multipotent nature in regard to generating different glial cell types and neurons, the subtype identity of the neurons generated from these stem cells is predetermined (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Simon1">[15]</xref>) and is not altered following transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Merkle1">[14]</xref>. This raises the important question of whether neuronal reprogramming of astroglia derived from the cerebral cortex, a region derived from the dorsal telencephalon, may be restricted towards the generation of glutamatergic neurons, or whether this region-specific bias could be overcome by forced expression of the appropriate neurogenic fate determinants. Such an ability to generate both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons from astroglia may be a crucial step towards restoring a damaged or imbalanced neuronal network.</p>
<p>Towards this end, we first aimed at a more potent neuronal reprogramming by inducing higher and more persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants in astroglial cells. This allowed us not only to obtain fully functional neurons that also establish synapses from astroglial cells in vitro but also to demonstrate that distinct neurogenic transcription factors, such as on the one hand Neurog2 and on the other Dlx2 alone or in combination with Mash1, can indeed instruct the selective generation of different neuronal subtypes, such as glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively. Moreover, we found that the reprogramming efficiency of postnatal cortical astroglia towards GABAergic neurons by Dlx2 could be enhanced by first expanding the astroglial cells under neurosphere conditions prior to forced expression of Dlx2. Given that following brain injury reactive astroglia from the adult cerebral cortex de-differentiate, resume proliferation, and can give rise to self-renewing neurospheres in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Buffo1">[16]</xref>, we finally show that neuronal reprogramming and subtype specification are not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from adult cortical astroglia responding to injury.</p>

<title>Postnatal Cortical Astroglia Reprogrammed by Forced Expression of Neurog2 Give Rise to Synapse-Forming Glutamatergic Neurons</title>
<p>Failure to establish a functional presynaptic compartment by astroglia-derived neurons may be due to an incomplete reprogramming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>. Here, we hypothesized that stronger and more persistent expression of neurogenic fate determinants may be a prerequisite for a more complete reprogramming of astroglia towards synapse-forming neurons. We have previously shown that expression levels from LTR (long terminal repeat)-driven MMLV (Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus)-derived retroviral constructs, which we employed in previous studies, are only about 2–3-fold of the endogenous expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Heins1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Heins2">[17]</xref>. Moreover, these viral vectors are prone to silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Gaiano1">[18]</xref> and we observed a severe decrease in Neurog2 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter expression already 7–14 d after transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger2">[19]</xref>. Thus, in order to overcome the limitations in synaptogenesis of neurons derived from reprogrammed astroglia, we examined the effect of stronger and more persistent expression of Neurog2 on neuronal reprogramming of astroglia from the cerebral cortex. We therefore subcloned Neurog2 into a self-inactivating retroviral vector driving gene expression under the control of a chicken beta-actin promoter (pCAG) optimized for long-term expression over months in the adult mouse brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Zhao1">[20]</xref>. Astroglia cultures were prepared from postnatal day 5–7 (P5–P7) cerebral cortex as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref> and 1 wk later cells were passaged and subsequently transduced with a retroviral vector encoding Neurog2 and DsRed (pCAG-Neurog2-IRES-DsRed) or with a control virus encoding DsRed only (pCAG-IRES-DsRed). Consistent with a stronger and more persistent expression driven by the pCAG promoter, high levels of Neurog2 and DsRed protein were still detected at 5–6 wk following retroviral transduction of cortical astroglia (unpublished data).</p>
<p>In agreement with our previous observation on the high efficiency of neurogenesis from astroglia following forced Neurog2 expression, the vast majority of Neurog2-transduced astroglia had differentiated into βIII tubulin-positive, GFAP-negative neurons after 10 d in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s001">Figure S1A and S1A</xref>'; 70.2%±6.3% at 9.8±3.1 days post-infection (DPI), 5 independent experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 1,022 DsRed-positive cells counted), in contrast to control retrovirus transduced cells (1.8%±1.8% of βIII tubulin-positive cells at 7.3±1.0 DPI, 3 independent experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 3,235 DsRed-positive cells counted). Time-lapse video microscopy revealed that the initial conversion of astroglia into neurons requires approximately 4 d, confirming previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>, and can occur at high efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s007">Video S1</xref>). By 2–3 wk post-transduction, neurons derived from Neurog2-transduced astroglia had acquired MAP2 immunoreactivity, indicative for dendritic maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Most strikingly, immunostaining for the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), present in synaptic vesicles within presynaptic terminals of glutamatergic neurons, revealed that the vast majority of astroglia-derived neurons exhibited a dense labelling with vGluT1-positive puncta outlining their soma and their MAP2-positive processes 4 wk post-infection with Neurog2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>, 85.4%±5.0% of DsRed-positive neurons at 26.3±2.2 DPI, <italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 170 DsRed-positive neurons counted). This was in pronounced contrast to the virtual absence of such staining upon transduction with the LTR-driven construct (pCLIG-Neurog2) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref> and also no vGluT1 immunoreactivity could be detected in astroglial cultures transduced with the control vector (unpublished data). Thus, these data suggest that astroglia reprogrammed with the pCAG-Neurog2-containing retroviral vector acquire a glutamatergic phenotype forming presynaptic specializations.</p>

<p>As vGluT1 immunoreactivity does however not allow to ascertain the neurotransmitter identity of an individual labelled neuron, as the vGluT1-positive puncta may arise from other neurons in the next set of experiments we assessed with single and pair electrophysiological recordings whether astroglial cells reprogrammed by Neurog2 indeed give rise to functional glutamatergic autapses or synapses after a period of 14–32 DPI. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, suprathreshold step-depolarisation of a DsRed-positive neuron (i.e. presynaptic neuron, black asterisk, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) resulted in an autaptic response in the stimulated neuron and an inward current in a nearby DsRed-positive neuron with a short delay typical of a monosynaptic connection (i.e. postsynaptic neuron, red asterisk, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, the AMPA/kainate glutamate receptor antagonist CNQX completely abolished both the autaptic and the synaptic current, demonstrating the glutamatergic nature of the presynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Among all the Neurog2-transduced astroglia-derived neurons recorded (<italic>n</italic> = 36, average age of cells: 24.6±0.9 DPI), 58.3% exhibited either glutamatergic autaptic connections onto themselves or glutamatergic synapses onto nearby neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). In none of the recordings from neurons derived from Neurog2-transduced astroglia was a GABAergic connection observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). In accordance, cultures transduced with Neurog2 encoding retrovirus were devoid of any vesicular GABA transporter (vGaT) immunoreactivity (unpublished data). Thus, these data provide evidence that Neurog2 does not only induce a generic neuronal fate in postnatal astroglia but selectively elicits differentiation along the glutamatergic lineage, in exclusion of GABAergic neurogenesis. Consistent with the specification of postnatal astroglia towards a glutamatergic identity, forced expression of Neurog2 resulted in the induction of the T-box transcription factors Tbr2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s001">Figure S1B and S1B</xref>') in 20.7%±1.9% of the DsRed-positive cells at 4 DPI (<italic>n</italic> = 4 coverslips, <italic>n</italic> = 634 DsRed-positive cells counted) and Tbr1 (48.2% of DsRed-positive neurons at 7 DPI, <italic>n</italic> = 112 DsRed/βIII tubulin-double positive cells counted; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s001">Figure S1C and S1C</xref>') as shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>, hence of two well characterised hallmarks of glutamatergic neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Hevner1">[21]</xref>. Moreover, by 4 wk of forced Neurog2 expression, astroglia-derived neurons expressed high levels of the forebrain glutamatergic neuron specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin dependent kinase subunit IIα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Liu1">[22]</xref>, accumulating at dendritic spine-like structures which were typically in opposition of vGluT1-positive presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g001">Figure 1E–1F</xref>').</p>
<p>Consistent with the development of excitatory networks in Neurog2-reprogrammed astroglia cultures, we also observed the emergence of self-driven synaptic activity, resulting eventually in the occurrence of barrages of synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To monitor such self-driven activity, we performed calcium imaging experiments of neurons derived from Neurog2-reprogrammed astroglia. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g002">Figure 2B</xref> illustrates two neurons that exhibited spontaneous, recurrent, and synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g002">Figure 2B–2B</xref>”).

<title>Genetic Fate Mapping Demonstrates Reprogramming of Postnatal Cortical Astroglia into Glutamatergic Neurons</title>
<p>In order to ascertain the astroglial nature of the cells that gave rise to functional glutamatergic synapses following reprogramming by Neurog2, we took advantage of a transgenic mouse line in which GFP expression can be induced in astroglia and is maintained in their progeny. Heterozygous mice in which the expression of a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase is driven by the astroglia specific L-glutamate/L-aspartate transporter promoter (GLAST::CreERT2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Mori1">[23]</xref> were crossed to a reporter mouse line (Z/EG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Novak1">[24]</xref> to generate double heterozygous mutants (GLAST::CreERT2/Z/EG) that were used in the present study. Cre-mediated recombination of the reporter locus was induced via tamoxifen administration from postnatal day 2 (P2) until sacrifice (P5–P7). Astroglia cultures were prepared as described above and, 1 wk later, cells were passaged onto glass coverslips. The vast majority of GFP reporter-positive cells were immunoreactive for GFAP (98.7%±0.7%) at 1 d after plating, with few cells being positive for the oligodendroglial markers NG2/O4 (1.2%±0.7%) and none (0.1%±0.1%) for the neuronal marker βIII tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 1,560 GFP-positive cells counted). These data indicate that, under our culture conditions, most reporter-positive cells at the time of transduction possess an astroglial identity. These cells largely remain within their astroglial lineage (86.9%±12.7% of GFP-positive cells expressing GFAP) when analysed at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g003">Figure 3A</xref>'; <italic>n</italic> = 4 independent experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 1,363 GFP-positive cells counted; 9–21 d following plating). We noted, however, a slight increase in the number of NG2/O4-positive cells (13.0%±12.8%), likely due to the expansion of few reporter-positive clones of oligodendrocyte precursors. Also at later stages reporter-positive cells did not give rise to βIII tubulin-positive neurons (0.1%±0.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g003">Figure 3A</xref>').</p>

<p>To determine the identity of fate-mapped astroglial cells following retroviral transduction, we performed immunostaining for GFP (identifying cells of astroglial origin), DsRed (identifying transduced cells), and either βIII tubulin, MAP2, or GFAP (identifying neuronal and astroglial cells, respectively). Notably, the stochastic infection of the subset of genetically recombined cells results in a limited number of double-targeted cells. When cultures of adherent astroglia were transduced with the control retrovirus encoding DsRed only, fate-mapped astroglial cells co-expressing GFP and DsRed remained in the glial lineage, as revealed by their astroglial morphology and GFAP expression 1 mo after transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g003">Figure 3B–3B</xref>”). In sharp contrast, when cultures of tamoxifen-induced astroglia were transduced with the new retrovirus encoding Neurog2 and DsRed, most GFP/DsRed-double-positive fate-mapped astroglia were reprogrammed into neurons expressing the neuronal markers βIII tubulin and MAP2 (67.3%±12.7% among GFP/DsRed-double positive cells at 8.0±1.0 DPI, <italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 217 double-positive cells counted; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g003">Figure 3C–3C</xref>”).

Step-depolarisation of GFP/DsRed-double-positive neurons at 0.05 Hz evoked a sequence of both autaptic and polysynaptic components (2 out of 8 cells recorded) consistent with the excitatory nature of the recorded neurons (average age of the cells: 18.1±2.2 DPI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g004">Figure 4D–4I</xref>, insets), while at higher stimulation frequency (1 Hz) the autaptic component with a short decay time typical of glutamatergic synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Schinder1">[25]</xref> could be observed in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g004">Figure 4F and 4I</xref>).

<title>Cell Division Is Not a Sine Qua Non Condition for Reprogramming of Astroglia by Neurog2</title>
<p>Given that our reprogramming strategy is based on retrovirally mediated expression of neurogenic fate determinants, only cells undergoing cell division will be targeted. In order to examine whether cell division is required for fate conversion to occur, we assessed whether neuronal reprogramming can be also achieved when the Neurog2 and DsRed encoding plasmid is delivered to the postnatal astroglia by transfection, i.e. a gene transfer strategy which does not select for dividing cells, and tracked single transfected cells by time-lapse video microscopy. Transfection with the Neurog2 encoding plasmid resulted in a similar degree of reprogramming after 4 d (14 cells out of 17, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g005">Figure 5</xref>) as obtained after retroviral transduction. Of note, in four cases neurons were generated directly from single astrocytes without a prior cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s009">Video S3</xref>).

<title>Dlx2 Directs Postnatal Cortical Astroglia towards Acquiring a GABAergic Identity</title>
<p>Based on our finding that forced expression of Neurog2 can selectively drive cortical astroglia towards the generation of functional and synaptically integrated glutamatergic neurons, we next asked whether cortical astroglia may also be directed towards distinct neuronal subtypes. In particular, we asked whether neuronal fate determinants known to instruct the genesis of GABAergic neurons during embryonic development may be sufficient to exert a similar effect on postnatal astroglia. As the homeobox transcription factor Dlx2 is one of the key factors involved in GABAergic neuron specification in the developing ventral telencephalon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Petryniak1">[13]</xref> and in adult neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Brill1">[26]</xref>, we examined whether forced expression of Dlx2 is also sufficient to induce a neuronal and possibly a GABAergic fate in cortical astroglia. To test this, astroglia cultures from P5–P7 cortex of C57BL/6J or GLAST::CreERT2/Z/EG mice were transduced with the same high-expressing retrovirus encoding in this case Dlx2 and DsRed (pCAG-Dlx2-IRES-DsRed), and cells were immunostained for GFP (to identify cells of astroglial origin), DsRed (to identify Dlx2-transduced cells), and the neuronal markers βIII tubulin or MAP2 after various differentiation time periods in culture.</p>
<p>Upon forced expression of Dlx2, a substantial number of postnatal cortical astroglia were redirected towards a neuronal identity as revealed by βIII tubulin or MAP2 expression (35.9%±13.0% at 10.7±2.0 DPI, <italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 392 DsRed-positive cells counted). Notably, however, the efficacy of neurogenesis elicited by Dlx2 was significantly lower than the one elicited by Neurog2 (see above). Fate-mapping analysis confirmed the astroglial nature of the cells reprogrammed by forced expression of Dlx2 as observed 22 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g006">Figure 6A–6A</xref>”). Next, to confirm the neuronal identity of the astroglia-derived cells, we performed patch clamp recordings. All the cells expressing Dlx2 and exhibiting a neuronal morphology, that we recorded, were capable of AP firing in response to step current injection (<italic>n</italic> = 33). In particular, this also held true for GFP-positive neurons originating from fate-mapped astroglia that had been reprogrammed by Dlx2 (<italic>n</italic> = 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g007">Figure 7A–7C</xref>”). Notably, neurons derived from Dlx2-transduced astroglia exhibited distinct firing patterns, with most of them revealing immature characteristics (single to few spikes, 22 out of 30 cells recorded) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g007">Figure 7A</xref>” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

<p>The predominant appearance of immature firing patterns, however, suggests an overall hampered maturation of Dlx2-reprogrammed astroglia. Accordingly, astroglia-derived neurons reprogrammed by Dlx2 exhibited much higher input resistance values than Neurog2-derived neurons after the same time in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s002">Figure S2B and S2C</xref>; 2,319.2±187.9 MΩ at 26.0±1.4 DPI (<italic>n</italic> = 26) versus 1,111.8±211.1 MΩ at 23.7±1.5 DPI (<italic>n</italic> = 20), Dlx2 versus Neurog2, respectively). Surprisingly, the high input resistance of Dlx2-expressing neurons did not decrease but even slightly increased with time in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s002">Figure S2B</xref>; 2,786.4±440.3 MΩ at 35.9±1.2 DPI (<italic>n</italic> = 7)), while in the case of Neurog2-reprogrammed astroglia input resistance decreased over time (608.6±125.0 MΩ at 26.8±1.2 DPI; <italic>n</italic> = 14; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Taken together, these data show that some postnatal cortical astroglia can be redirected by forced expression of Dlx2 towards a neuronal identity; however, in sharp contrast to the progressive maturation of Neurog2-transduced cells, most of the astroglia-derived neurons reprogrammed by Dlx2 remain in a rather immature state, suggesting a comparatively less efficient reprogramming by Dlx2.</p>
<p>Next we assessed whether some of these relatively immature neurons derived from Dlx2-reprogrammed astroglia may nevertheless establish functional autaptic or synaptic connections. We first performed immunocytochemistry for vGluT1 and for vGaT, the latter known to be expressed in synaptic vesicles located in presynaptic terminals of GABAergic neurons. In sharp contrast to reprogramming by Neurog2, astroglia-derived neurons reprogrammed by Dlx2 were devoid of vGluT1 immunoreactivity (unpublished data), but some of them (33.7%±3.6% at 22.0±0.6 DPI, <italic>n</italic> = 339 DsRed-positive neurons counted; <italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments) were found to exhibit labelling of vGaT-positive puncta outlining both their soma and their processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In addition, a small subset of DsRed-positive neurons exhibited GAD67 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g006">Figure 6B and 6B</xref>'). These findings therefore suggest that Dlx2 induces a GABAergic identity in the reprogrammed astroglia. Consistent with an interneuron phenotype, we could also record in 9 out of 33 neurons spontaneous synaptic currents exhibiting a slow decay time, characteristic of GABAergic synaptic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g007">Figure 7D and 7E</xref>). Finally, in few cases, step-depolarisation in voltage clamp evoked an autaptic response of the stimulated neuron (6.1% of the DsRed-positive neurons recorded, <italic>n</italic> = 33, age of the cells: 26.9±1.4 DPI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g007">Figures 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s002">S2A</xref>). In accordance with the above data, these autaptic responses exhibited slow decay time kinetics and were abolished by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist bicuculline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g007">Figure 7F</xref>), thus demonstrating the GABAergic nature of these autapses.</p>
<p>Taken together, these data strongly indicate that forced expression of Dlx2, in sharp contrast to Neurog2, can induce the reprogramming of astroglia from the postnatal cortex towards a GABAergic phenotype. However, whereas Neurog2 redirected the majority of astroglia towards functional glutamatergic neurons, only few astroglial cells reprogrammed by Dlx2 differentiated into fully functional, GABAergic neurons (58% versus 6%, respectively), thus indicating that Dlx2-induced reprogramming remains partial in most of the cells.</p>
<p>Since we have previously shown that Mash1, a transcription factor located up-stream of Dlx2 in the interneuron fate specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Poitras1">[30]</xref>, the direct targets of which overlap only partially with that of Mash1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Long1">[31]</xref>, can also reprogram postnatal astroglia towards neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>, we tested whether co-expression of these two transcription factors further promote neurogenesis and subsequent interneuron differentiation of reprogrammed astroglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Yun1">[32]</xref>. Consistent with previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>, 33.5%±17.8% of astroglia expressing Mash1 alone developed into βIII tubulin-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 226 DsRed-positive cells counted at 10.7±2.0 DPI). In contrast, co-expression of Mash1 and Dlx2 significantly augmented neurogenesis from postnatal astroglia (93.0%±3.1% of βIII tubulin-positive neurons amongst DsRed-positive cells, <italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 548 DsRed-positive cells counted at 10.7±2.0 DPI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), indicating that these two factors indeed act synergistically.

<title>Expansion of Postnatal Cortical Astroglia under Neurosphere Conditions Increases the Efficiency of Reprogramming towards a GABAergic Neuronal Subtype</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether a complete and more efficient reprogramming of astroglia towards synapse-forming functional GABAergic neurons may be achieved by first expanding astroglial cells as neurospheres in presence of mitogens that on the one hand promote de-differentiation of astroglia and on the other hand up-regulate fate determinants normally involved in the generation of GABAergic neurons in the telencephalon, such as Mash1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Gabay1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Yung1">[35]</xref>. We therefore cultured postnatal astroglial cells as neurospheres before transducing the astroglia-derived neurosphere cells with Dlx2. It has been previously shown that early postnatal cortical astroglial cells can give rise to neurospheres until P11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Laywell1">[36]</xref>. Cortical tissue from P5–P7 C57BL/6J, GLAST::CreERT2/Z/EG, or hGFAP-GFP mice was cultured as neurospheres under non-adherent conditions in serum-free medium and in the presence of EGF/FGF2, and 1 wk later, astroglia-derived neurosphere cells were passaged and subsequently transduced with retrovirus encoding either Dlx2-DsRed or Neurog2-DsRed, and were allowed for differentiation. The astroglial origin of the neurosphere founder cells was confirmed by culturing single GFP-positive cells derived from the postnatal cortex of hGFAP-GFP mice which gave rise to neurospheres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s003">S3D</xref>). Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that during expansion in EGF/FGF2 neurosphere cells expressed mRNAs for different astroglial markers, such as the specific pan-astrocyte marker Aldh1L1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Cahoy1">[37]</xref>, at similarly high levels as adherent astroglia after 1 wk in culture, and the mRNA encoding GFAP at even higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g010">Figure 10A–10E</xref>). In contrast, no βIII tubulin mRNA could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g010">Figure 10F</xref>). Likewise, similar to adherent astroglia neurosphere cells did not express detectable levels of endogenous Neurog2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g010">Figure 10G</xref>). These data support the notion that during the expansion in EGF/FGF2, neurosphere cells have an astroglial character.</p>

Strikingly, even at younger stages in culture (20.1±1.9 DPI), Dlx2-expressing neurons derived from neurosphere cells exhibited substantially lower input resistances (1,266.4±294.3 MΩ, <italic>n</italic> = 7) compared to Dlx2-reprogrammed adherent astroglia recorded at 4 wk in culture (2,319.2±187.9 MΩ at 26.0±1.4 DPI, <italic>n</italic> = 26; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), indicative of a more advanced neuronal maturation. Immunostaining for vGaT revealed a dense labelling of vGaT-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g011">Figure 11A and 11B</xref>), thus suggesting that astroglia-derived neurosphere cells transduced with Dlx2 had acquired a GABAergic identity.

Consistent with the widespread vGaT expression, Dlx2-expressing neurons received spontaneous synaptic activity displaying slow decay time kinetics characteristic of GABAergic currents (9 out of 10 cells recorded, unpublished data). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g011">Figure 11E</xref>, step-depolarisation of a GFP-positive, Dlx2-expressing neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g011">Figure 11C and 11D</xref>, black asterisk) evoked an autaptic response of the stimulated neuron that was blocked by bicuculline.

<p>Interestingly, astroglia cultured as neurosphere cells could still be reprogrammed by Neurog2 towards a glutamatergic neuronal phenotype.

What may be the molecular changes underlying the increased plasticity of neurosphere cells compared to adherent astroglia given their common astroglial origin?

<title>Neurosphere Cells Derived from the Adult Injured Cerebral Cortex Can Be Reprogrammed into Synapse-Forming Functional Neurons</title>
<p>The above finding that Neurog2 or Dlx2 overexpression can induce with high efficiency the generation of functional neurons from postnatal astroglia-derived neurosphere cells prompted us to examine whether reactive astroglia from the adult cortex following injury can also be reprogrammed to generate functional neurons after prior expansion as neurospheres. Indeed, previous work of our laboratory has shown that following a local injury such as a stab wound lesion, reactive astroglia isolated from the adult cerebral cortex de-differentiate, resume proliferation, and have the capacity to give rise to self-renewing neurospheres in vitro, in contrast to the intact contralateral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Buffo1">[16]</xref>. To examine the reprogramming potential of reactive astroglia isolated from the adult injured cerebral cortex, we performed local stab wound lesions in the right cortical hemisphere of adult C57BL/6J mice and dissociated both the control and injured cortical hemispheres 3 d later for subsequent neurosphere cultures. While control cortical tissue did not generate neurospheres, the injured hemisphere gave rise to neurospheres as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Buffo1">[16]</xref>. Confirming previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Buffo1">[16]</xref>, neurospheres could also be obtained from single GFP reporter-positive cells derived from either GLAST::CreERT2/Z/EG mice (unpublished data) or hGFAP-GFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g014">Figure 14A–14A</xref>”).

Consistent with vGluT1 expression, immunostaining for the presynaptic protein synapsin also revealed a dense labelling of synapsin-positive puncta, thus suggesting the development of synaptic contacts between adult lesioned cortex-derived neurosphere cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g015">Figure 15D</xref>). Furthermore electrophysiological recordings revealed the emergence of CNQX-sensitive spontaneous synaptic currents in these neurons in accordance with vGluT1 and synapsin expression (8 out of 30 cells recorded at 22.5±0.9 DPI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g015">Figure 15E–15F</xref>”). These data indicate that adult astroglia-derived neurosphere cells transduced with Neurog2 mature into functional glutamatergic neurons.</p>

<p>To examine the extent of plasticity of glial cells derived from the adult lesioned cortex we also tested as a proof-of-principle experiment whether adult lesioned cortex-derived neurosphere cells could also be directed by forced expression of Dlx2 towards MAP2-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s006">Figure S6A and S6A</xref>'). However, Dlx2 reprogrammed neurons were rather few and fragile due to their rather small soma size, thus hampering extensive electrophysiological analysis.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study provides four major findings: firstly, it provides new independent experimental evidence based on genetic fate-mapping that astroglia from the postnatal cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed by a single transcription factor into functional neurons; secondly, we have succeeded in overcoming the previous limitations in synaptogenesis of neurons derived from postnatal cortical astroglia by the use of retroviral vectors conveying higher and more persistent levels of neurogenic fate determinants' expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>; thirdly, based on the transcription factor used for reprogramming, postnatal astroglia can be directed towards the generation of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, providing proof-of-principle evidence that selective subtypes can be generated from the same cells of origin; fourthly, reprogramming efficiency is further enhanced by prior de-differentiation of the astroglia as provided by the expansion under neurosphere conditions. Importantly, using the latter procedure we even succeeded in reprogramming reactive astroglia after adult brain injury. Thus, reprogramming of astroglia towards functional neurons with a single transcription factor is not restricted to postnatal stages but can also be achieved from astroglia of the adult cerebral cortex following injury-induced reactivation.</p>

<title>Neuronal Reprogramming of Cells Restricted to the Astroglial Lineage</title>
<p>We have previously shown that postnatal astroglia can be reprogrammed into neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Heins1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>. However, as the astroglial origin of the reprogrammed cells is a very important issue, here we sought to provide new experimental evidence via genetic fate-mapping of astroglia by using the GLAST::CreERT2/Z/EG mouse line developed in our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Mori1">[23]</xref>. To ensure the specificity of this mouse model we showed that virtually all fate-mapped, i.e. GFP-reporter positive, cells remain in the glial lineage under our culture conditions, with the vast majority being identified as astrocytes based on GFAP expression as well as GLAST (unpublished data) and a minor population as oligodendroglial cells, while none of the fate-mapped cells spontaneously gave rise to neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g003">Figure 3A and 3A</xref>'). These data support the notion that the cells cultured under these conditions do not possess an intrinsic neurogenic potential. This is consistent with the finding of virtually absent endogenous Neurog2 expression compared to cortical precursors isolated at the embryonic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g010">Figure 10G</xref>) and in agreement with the epigenetic silencing of the neurogenin-1 and -2 loci at the transition between neurogenic and astrogliogenic precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Hirabayashi1">[40]</xref>. These data do not rule out the possibility that in vivo a small subset of astroglial cells can still give rise to neurons as suggested by hGFAP::CreERT2-mediated fate mapping showing that neurons can be generated at early postnatal stages from genetically marked cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Ganat1">[41]</xref>. However, so far it could not be experimentally distinguished whether the postnatal generated neurons indeed had been derived from astroglia local to the cerebral cortex or would be derived from astroglial stem cells in the subependymal zone that had subsequently immigrated into the cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Fagel1">[42]</xref>. In any case our cultures do not sustain conditions for the genesis of neurons from astroglia (even in the presence of EGF/FGF2) without forced expression of neurogenic fate determinants.</p>
<p>Yet despite generating only glia when adherently grown in serum containing medium, postnatal astroglia exhibit a remarkable degree of plasticity as indicated by the fact that at least some can give rise to self-renewing, multipotent neurospheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Laywell1">[36]</xref> and present study). The latter fact could be taken as evidence that early postnatal astroglia possess stem cell character, particularly in the light of the notion that cells from the postnatal cerebral cortex may contribute to the pool of radial/astroglial stem cells within the dorsal adult subependymal zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Merkle1">[14]</xref> (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Kriegstein1">[43]</xref>). However, several lines of evidence argue against a stem cell character of the astroglial cells studied here. Firstly, neither wild-type nor genetically fate-mapped astroglia spontaneously give rise to neurons, which is inconsistent with the stem cell defining hallmark of multipotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g003">Figure 3A–3B</xref>”). Moreover, the large number of neurons generated following forced expression of Neurog2 argues against the possibility that the successfully reprogrammed cells derive from rare stem cells within this culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s007">Video S1</xref>). Secondly, while Dlx2 very efficiently directs adult neural stem cells in vitro towards neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Brill1">[26]</xref>, the responsiveness of adherent astroglia is much more limited, suggesting a reduced susceptibility to Dlx2 transcriptional activity. The third line of evidence is based on the striking difference in Sox2 mRNA levels following expansion of the postnatal astroglia as neurosphere cells. Sox2 is a transcription factor well known to play a key role in neural stem cell self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Suh1">[39]</xref>; thus the massive up-regulation of Sox2 following exposure of astroglia to neurosphere culture conditions suggests that these cells undergo de-differentiation eventually acquiring indeed stem cell properties, while the comparatively lower levels of Sox2 in the adherent cultures would be in agreement with their non-stem cell character. Consistent with the higher degree of plasticity characterizing neural stem cells, the efficiency of reprogramming of astroglia-derived neurosphere cells by Dlx2 was found to reach levels comparable to bona fide neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000373.s004">Figure S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Brill1">[26]</xref>). Intriguingly, exposure of non-stem cell astroglia to EGF/FGF2 in the absence of serum factors may thus mimic similar extrinsic signals encountered by astroglial cells during postnatal development that later give rise to the stem cell compartment in the adult subependymal zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Ahn1">[44]</xref>. In fact the conversion of quiescent astrocytes from the adult cerebral cortex into stem cell-like cells following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Buffo1">[16]</xref> and present study) clearly demonstrates that cells apparently devoid of stem cell properties can acquire stem cell hallmarks such as self-renewal and multipotency when exposed to the appropriate environment.</p>

<title>Direct Conversion of Postnatal Astroglia into Synapse-Forming Functional Neurons by a Single Transcription Factor</title>
<p>While our previous findings of eliciting neurogenesis by a single transcription factor from postnatal astroglial cells demonstrated the potency of these neurogenic fate determinants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Heins1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>, a major obstacle towards reprogramming into fully functional neurons was encountered in the failure of the astroglia-derived neurons to provide functional presynaptic output to other neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger1">[7]</xref>. In our previous study neuronal reprogramming was achieved by transcription factor-encoding retroviral vectors that exhibit relatively low levels of overexpression and are subject to substantial silencing in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Gaiano1">[18]</xref>. Of note, long-term expression of an exogenous transcription factor appears to be required for maintaining a new phenotype following cellular reprogramming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Hochedlinger1">[45]</xref>. For instance, it has been shown that reprogramming of fibroblasts into macrophage-like cells remains unstable, resulting in the loss of macrophage markers, following silencing of retrovirally expressed PU.1 and C/EBPα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Feng1">[46]</xref>. Here we demonstrated that stronger and more prolonged expression of neurogenic fate determinants from retroviral constructs more resistant to silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Zhao1">[20]</xref> indeed permits more complete reprogramming of postnatal cortical astroglia towards synapse-forming neurons. In support of our hypothesis, we found that Dlx2 expression driven from a weaker and silencing-prone retroviral vector (pMXIG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Brill1">[26]</xref> resulted in nearly negligible neurogenesis in postnatal astroglia cultures (unpublished data), while the same fate determinant encoded by the pCAG vector induced substantial neurogenesis. Consistent with a more efficient reprogramming via a strong and silencing-resistant retroviral expression system, we found that forced expression of Neurog2 or Dlx2 endowed astroglia-derived neurons not only with the ability to receive synaptic input but also to form functional presynaptic output onto other astroglia-derived neurons to such degree as generating networks of spontaneously active neurons. Thus, one of the major obstacles that may impair incorporation of astroglia-derived neurons into a neuronal network, namely the inability to give rise to functional presynaptic output, can be overcome by appropriate expression of neurogenic fate determinants. Interestingly, neuronal reprogramming of astroglia by Neurog2 towards mature neurons appears to involve similar developmental steps as in newborn neurons during embryonic and adult neurogenesis. For instance, while GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter onto mature astroglia-derived neurons reprogrammed by Neurog2, at a more immature stage these neurons respond with a rise in free intracellular calcium (Blum et al., submitted), very similar to immature embryonic- or adult-generated neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Berninger3">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Ge1">[48]</xref> and such a differential response may be required for proper maturation to proceed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Ge2">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>Of note, despite its continued expression, Neurog2, a transcription factor normally expressed in progenitors and only transiently maintained in postmitotic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Hand1">[50]</xref>, does not seem to interfere with a surprisingly normal maturation of the reprogrammed cells. Firstly, input resistances of Neurog2-expressing neurons reach levels that correspond well to values observed for neurons recorded in slices from postnatal mice of roughly matching age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Zhu1">[51]</xref>. Secondly, as a sign of proper morphological maturation dendrites of Neurog2-expressing neurons were covered with spines after 1 mo in culture, in agreement with progressive formation of excitatory synapses. Finally, astroglia-derived neurons reprogrammed by Neurog2 exhibit prominent expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα subunit, which in vivo is exclusively expressed in excitatory neurons starting from the first postnatal week <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Liu1">[22]</xref>. Moreover, expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα is a pre-requisite for the occurrence of changes in synaptic efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Silva1">[52]</xref>, suggesting that Neurog2-reprogrammed cells potentially also acquire the ability to undergo synaptic modification.</p>
<p>The fact that cells committed to the astroglial lineage can be reprogrammed into fully functional synapse-forming neurons also sheds some light on the more general question of whether the conversion across cell lineages induced by a single transcription factor can generate fully differentiated and stable cell fates that closely mirror cell types found in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Hochedlinger1">[45]</xref>. Our study provides definitive positive evidence that such a cell lineage conversion is indeed possible and does not require passing through a pluripotent ground state. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that even mouse embryonic or perinatal fibroblasts, i.e. cells of the mesodermal lineage, can be converted by combined forced expression of three defined factors (Mash1, Brn2, Myt1l) into functional neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Vierbuchen1">[53]</xref>. Unexpectedly this combination seems to favour the generation of glutamatergic neurons, while the possibility to generate neurons of other phenotypes remains to be explored. Our study indeed reveals for the first time the feasibility of direct conversion of a somatic cell type into distinct neuronal subtypes by selective expression of transcription factors. Moreover, the efficiency of fibroblast conversion into neurons remains markedly lower (∼20%) despite the joint use of three transcription factors. Conversely, we demonstrate here that cells of closer lineage-relationship to ectoderm-derived neurons, namely the astroglia, require only a single transcription factor (Neurog2) to be converted towards fully functional neurons with 60% efficiency. This does not only confirm the notion that lineage reprogramming is achieved with best results by using the closest related cells but is also of profound relevance in regard to the eventual translational potential towards regenerative medicine. Activation of endogenous brain cells towards neuronal repair may be feasible if only one factor needs to be activated, e.g. by transvascular delivery of small molecules and RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Kumar1">[54]</xref>. In addition, the regional specification of astroglial cells characterized by distinct transcription factor profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Hochstim1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-DenisDonini1">[56]</xref> may create a specific bias towards the generation of the type of neurons normally residing within the respective brain region and hence favour the fate conversion into the appropriate neuronal subtypes. Our results therefore further pave the way towards neuronal reprogramming from endogenous cells residing within the brain, circumventing the complications associated with transplantation.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, although the majority of astroglial cells undergoing reprogramming by Neurog2 also undergo cell cycle division, single cell tracking demonstrated that astroglia can give rise to neurons without dividing. These data show that cell division is not a sine qua non condition for successful reprogramming, providing additional evidence for a direct fate conversion by-passing a proliferative state. Future studies will have to reveal whether even adult quiescent astrocytes could be reprogrammed into neurons without the requirement of entering the cell division cycle.</p>

<title>Subtype Specification of Astroglia-Derived Neurons</title>
<p>Notably, given that expression of neurogenic fate determinants allows for the generation of synapse-forming neurons, we could assess whether distinct transcription factors promote neuronal subtype specification of the reprogrammed cells. Indeed, our immunocytochemical and electrophysiological analysis demonstrated that astroglia derived from the cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed not only towards the generation of glutamatergic neurons by Neurog2, a fate determinant that regulates glutamatergic neuron generation in the developing dorsal telencephalon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Schuurmans1">[8]</xref>, but also towards the generation of synapse-forming GABAergic neurons by Dlx2. Of note, glutamatergic neurogenesis from cortical astroglia following reprogramming by Neurog2 was accompanied by the (transient) up-regulation of Tbr2 and Tbr1, T-box transcription factors that characterize the genesis of glutamatergic neurons throughout the forebrain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Hevner1">[21]</xref>. Moreover, Neurog2 induced the expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα, which is selectively expressed in glutamatergic neurons of the forebrain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Liu1">[22]</xref>. The fact that Neurog2-reprogrammed astroglia derived from the cerebral cortex generate glutamatergic neurons rather than other neuronal subtypes which also require Neurog2 expression for their specification, such as spinal cord cholinergic motoneurons, is consistent with the notion that astroglial cells retain region-specific identity characterized by distinct transcription factor profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Hochstim1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-DenisDonini1">[56]</xref>, in this case dorsal telencephalic cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Ma2">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast to Neurog2, Dlx2 is normally expressed in progenitor cells derived from the ventral telencephalon and has been shown to play a crucial role in the genesis of GABAergic neurons during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Petryniak1">[13]</xref> and in adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Brill1">[26]</xref> in this region. Yet the fact that astroglial cells of dorsal telencephalic origin can be forced to adopt a “ventral” fate is consistent with previous findings that ventral transcription factors can instruct a GABAergic fate in dorsally derived progenitors including induction of endogenous Dlx gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Parras1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Stuhmer1">[58]</xref>. Of note, however, this cellular competence to respond appropriately to “wrong” regional transcriptional cues is not restricted to relatively unspecified precursors but can be even observed in cells committed to the astroglial lineage.</p>
<p>However, the ability of Dlx2 to induce neuronal reprogramming from cortical astroglia is limited. In contrast to reprogramming induced by Neurog2 that occurred with very high efficiency, only a third of all Dlx2-transduced astroglia differentiated into neurons and most of these exhibited high input resistances typical of immature neurons even after prolonged periods of culturing. Moreover, the apparent impairment of maturation resulted in an even lower number of Dlx2-expressing neurons forming functional GABAergic synapses. Also only a minority of the neurons obtained from Dlx2-reprogrammed astroglia displayed more mature interneuronal firing patterns, with the majority of neurons often responding with one or few spikes to prolonged current injection. Intriguingly, however, among those neurons acquiring mature firing properties we could clearly discern distinct types of patterns which have been classified as regular spiking, stuttering, and low-threshold burst spiking. These data indicate that Dlx2-reprogrammed astroglia can eventually mature into specific interneuron subtypes. Consistent with this we found that a small subset of the reprogrammed cells expressed the calcium binding protein calretinin, which is normally expressed within the cortex in subpopulations of regular or low-threshold burst spiking interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Wonders1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>The apparent limitations of Dlx2-mediated astroglia-to-neuron fate conversion could be due to inaccessibility of some downstream targets of Dlx2 in cortex-derived astroglia or to an overall lower potency of Dlx2 compared to Neurog2 in reprogramming and/or the need for additional co-factors missing in cortical astroglia. Along these lines we examined whether co-expression of Mash1 with Dlx2 may further promote the maturation and specification of astroglia into synapse-forming interneurons. Mash1 is a ventral telencephalic transcription factor upstream of Dlx2 in the cascade of interneuron specification during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Casarosa1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Parras1">[12]</xref>. Importantly, while being upstream of Dlx2, which is a direct transcriptional target of Mash1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Poitras1">[30]</xref>, the latter factor is also known to activate targets that are not shared with Dlx2, suggesting that complete interneuron specification may require the activity of both factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Long1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Yun1">[32]</xref>. In agreement with this, we found that co-expression of Mash1 and Dlx2 promoted neurogenesis from astroglia in a synergistic manner to levels similar to Neurog2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Moreover, input resistances were lower compared to those of Dlx2 only expressing neurons. Finally, the relative proportion of neurons exhibiting more mature interneuronal firing patterns was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g008">Figure 8</xref>). However, there was no apparent enhancement of synapse formation following co-expression. This may point to the possibility that full interneuronal maturation requires extrinsic signals provided by their target cells, i.e. excitatory neurons, which are absent in cultures from Dlx2-reprogrammed astroglia. Alternatively, additional transcription factors such as Dlx5/Dlx6 may be required for complete maturation to occur.</p>
<p>Given that different subtypes of GABAergic neurons are generated in the telencephalon ranging from medium spiny projection neurons of the striatum to various types of aspiny interneurons throughout the telencephalon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Wonders1">[29]</xref>, it will be of great interest to develop strategies to further refine the subtype specification of GABAergic neurons generated upon forced Dlx2 or Mash1/Dlx2 expression, by using additional transcriptional cues in order to generate the full spectrum of GABAergic interneurons. Such directing of astroglia towards specific interneuron phenotypes may allow for the development of alternative approaches for the treatment of pharmaco-resistant epileptic disorders, particularly during early childhood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Cross1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Richardson1">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, culturing astroglial cells prior to transduction under neurosphere conditions improved the efficiency of reprogramming towards GABAergic neurons quite dramatically. Indeed, the synapse-forming capacity of Dlx2-expressing astroglia-derived neurosphere cells exceeded that of adherent astroglia-derived neurons expressing Dlx2 by a factor of seven. In addition, neurons derived from Dlx2-expressing neurosphere cells exhibited significantly lower input resistances consistent with a more mature state.</p>
<p>These findings are not only of great importance in regard to eliciting the generation of neurons of different subtypes but may also support the concept that culturing cells under neurosphere conditions (in serum-free medium containing high levels of EGF and FGF2) induces the erasure of region-specific transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Gabay1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Hack1">[34]</xref>. Indeed culturing neural cells of different origins under neurosphere conditions has been shown to induce a partial loss of region-specific transcription factor expression while resulting in the up-regulation of Olig2 and Mash1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Hack1">[34]</xref>, providing a more permissive transcriptional environment that favours reprogramming towards distinct neuronal subtypes. However, we found no striking differences in the expression of the mRNAs encoding the cortical patterning factors Emx1 and Emx2 between cortical astroglia cultured adherently or expanded under neurosphere condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g010">Figure 10H and 10I</xref>). In contrast, the two populations differed drastically in their expression levels of Sox2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000373-g010">Figure 10J</xref>), which may indicate a more stem cell-like status of the astroglia under neurosphere conditions and which may be the molecular correlate for their higher degree of plasticity.</p>

<title>Reprogramming of Adult Injured Cortex-Derived Neurosphere Cells into Functional Synapse-Forming Neurons</title>
<p>The successful reprogramming of astroglia following expansion under neurosphere conditions also encouraged us to investigate whether neurosphere cells derived from the adult cerebral cortex after injury can be similarly directed towards neurogenesis. Thus, we assessed here whether adult cortex-derived neurosphere cells also can be driven towards fully functional neurons following forced expression of Neurog2 or Dlx2. Indeed, virtually all the cells expressing Neurog2 acquired a neuronal identity as revealed by MAP2 staining and their ability to fire APs. Moreover, we also provide evidence by vGluT1 immunoreactivity that the neurons derived from these lesion cortex-derived neurosphere cells undergo a subtype specification similar to reprogrammed postnatal astroglia and differentiate into glutamatergic neurons. Consistent with the development of functional synapses by Neurog2-reprogrammed adult cortex-derived neurosphere cells, we could record spontaneous glutamatergic events in these cultures. Conversely, following forced expression of Dlx2, we could observe the generation of functional GABAergic neurons from adult cortex-derived neurosphere cells, indicating that the same dichotomy of subtype specification observed in postnatal astroglia also holds true for adult cortex-derived neurosphere cells following injury. While this first demonstration that functional neurons of different subtypes even undergoing synaptic connectivity can be derived in vitro from adult glial cells isolated from the injured cortex is an exciting step forward to utilize endogenous glial cells for repair of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Buffo2">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Magavi1">[63]</xref>, it will still be a major challenge to translate these in vitro findings into the context of the injured brain.</p>

For culturing neurosphere cells from postnatal cerebral cortex we followed the protocol described by Johansson et al. (1999) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Johansson1">[66]</xref>. After removal of the meninges, grey matter tissue from P5–P7 cerebral cortex of C57BL/6J or GLAST::CreERT2/Z/EG mice was enzymatically dissociated in 0.7 mg/mL hyaluronic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and 1.33 mg/mL trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) with 2 mM glucose and buffered with HEPES (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 30 min. Trypsinization was stopped by adding an equal volume of an ice cold medium consisting of 4% bovine serum albumine (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS, Invitrogen), buffered with 20 mM HEPES (Invitrogen). The cells were then centrifuged at 1,300 rpm for 5 min, re-suspended in ice cold medium consisting of 0.9 M sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5× HBSS, and centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 rpm. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 2 mL ice cold medium consisting of 4% BSA in EBSS buffered with 20 mM HEPES, and the cell suspension was placed on top of 12 mL of the same medium and centrifuged for 7 min at 1,500 rpm. The cell pellet was finally re-suspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/F12 (DMEM/F12, Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 2 mM glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 units/mL penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen), buffered with 8 mM HEPES, and the cells were placed in uncoated tissue culture flasks (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium) at a density of 5,000 cells/mL. To induce neurosphere formation, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF; Chemicon, Eagle Close, United Kingdom) and 10 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2; Invitrogen) were added to the culture medium at the beginning and every other day. After 5–7 d in culture, neurosphere cells were enzymatically dissociated with trypsin (Invitrogen) and plated on poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) coated coverslips at a density of 10×10<sup>4</sup> cells per coverslip (in 24-well plates, BD Biosciences) in a medium consisting of DMEM/F12 supplemented with B27, EGF, FGF2, penicillin/streptomycin, and buffered with HEPES (i.e. neurosphere medium).</p>
<p>In some experiments, tissue from P5–P7 cerebral cortex from hGFAP-GFP mice was dissected as described above. Cells were serially diluted and plated as single cell in Terasaki plates (60 wells) in 20 µL of neurosphere medium per well. Immediately after plating, wells were carefully analyzed using an inverted epifluorescence microscope. Wells containing only one single GFP-positive cell were selected for further analysis, whereas wells containing either GFP-negative cells or more than one cell were discarded. EGF and FGF2 were added every other day to the selected wells and neurosphere formation from the selected GFP-positive cells was followed over 1 wk.

<title>Retroviral Transduction</title>
<p>Retroviral transduction of astroglia cultured as adherent astroglia or expanded as neurosphere cells was performed 2–3 h after plating on coverslips, using VSV-G (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein)-pseudotyped retroviruses encoding neurogenic fate determinants. Neurog2 or Dlx2 were expressed under control of an internal chicken β-actin promoter with cytomegalovirus enhancer (pCAG) together with DsRed located behind an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Zhao1">[20]</xref>.

<p>Twenty-four hours after transduction, the medium of astroglia cultured as adherent astroglia was completely replaced by a differentiation medium consisting of DMEM/F12, 3.5 mM glucose, penicillin/streptomycin, and B27 supplement, and the cells were allowed for differentiation for different time periods. Similarly, the medium of astroglia-derived neurosphere cells was replaced by a differentiation medium consisting of DMEM/F12, 3.5 mM glucose, penicillin/streptomycin, supplemented with B27, and buffered with HEPES. As it has been found that Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is required for robust synapse formation of neurons derived from neural stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Song1">[69]</xref>, 20 ng/mL of BDNF (Calbiochem) were added to the cultures every fourth day during the differentiation period. Cells were cultured at a CO2 concentration of 9%, resulting in a pH of the differentiation medium of ∼7.2. After 7–41 d following transduction, cells were used either for immunocytochemistry, electrophysiology, or calcium imaging experiments.

Micropipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (Garner, Claremont, CA, USA). Pipettes were tip-filled with internal solution and back-filled with internal solution containing 200 µg/mL amphotericin-B. The electrodes had resistances of 2–2.5 MΩ. The internal solution contained 136.5 mM K-gluconate, 17.5 mM KCl, 9 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and 0.2 mM EGTA (pH 7.4) at an osmolarity of 300 mOsm. The external solution contained 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and 5 mM glucose (pH 7.4) at an osmolarity of 310 mOsm. The recording chamber was continuously perfused with external solution at a rate of 0.5 mL/min.</p>
<p>Cells were visualized with an epifluorescence microscope (Axioskop2, Carl Zeiss) equipped with the appropriate filter sets. For patch clamp recordings, virally transduced cells were selected on the basis of their DsRed immunoreactivity. In addition, to ascertain the astroglial origin of the recorded neurons, DsRed- and GFP-expressing cells from GLAST::CreERT2/Z/EG animals were also selected for patch clamp recordings. Digital pictures of the recorded cells were acquired using a digital camera (AxioCam, Carl Zeiss).</p>
<p>Signals were sampled at 10 kHz with Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA), filtered at 5 kHz and analyzed with Clampfit 9.2 software (Axon Instruments). For assessing a cell's ability to fire APs, cells received depolarizing step-current injections. AP amplitudes were measured by subtracting the threshold voltage of the AP from the AP maximum amplitude. For determining input resistance, hyperpolarizing currents of small amplitudes were injected into the cells under current clamp condition at a holding potential of −70 mV and input resistances were calculated from the corresponding voltage deviation.</p>
<p>To examine spontaneous synaptic input into a given neuron, cells were kept in voltage clamp at a holding potential of −70 mV and synaptic events were recorded throughout a period of 1 to 5 min. In order to assess autaptic connections, single cells were step-depolarized in voltage clamp for 1 ms from −70 to +30 mV at a frequency of 0.05 Hz and responses were recorded in the same cell. Responses were considered to be autaptic when they occurred within 3 ms after the step-depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000373-Fitzsimonds1">[75]</xref>. Synaptic connectivity was investigated by means of pair recordings in voltage clamp mode. One neuron was stimulated at low frequency (0.05–0.1 Hz) by a 1 ms step-depolarization from −70 to +30 mV and the response was recorded from the other neuron, and vice versa. To determine the nature of the autaptic or synaptic responses, neurons were step-depolarized as described above and we assessed whether responses could be abolished in the presence of either the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist bicuculline (10 µM) or the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (5 µM). Finally, the recovery of the autaptic or synaptic response was assessed following washout of the pharmacological drugs.</p>

<p><bold>Type of synaptic responses and input resistances of postnatal astroglia-derived neurons reprogrammed by Neurog2 or Dlx2.</bold> (A) Summary of the type of autaptic/synaptic responses that could be evoked from astroglia reprogrammed by forced expression of Neurog2, Dlx2, or Mash1 in combination with Dlx2, following culturing under adherent (Astro) or neurosphere conditions (NS). The number of neurons exhibiting autaptic/synaptic connections is expressed as percentage of recorded neurons. Note that astroglia-derived neurons reprogrammed by Neurog2 or Dlx2 in adherent astroglia cultures were recorded at 24.6±0.9 DPI or 26.9±1.4 DPI, respectively. Astroglia-derived neurosphere cells transduced with Neurog2 or Dlx2 were recorded at 14.2±0.7 DPI or 20.1±1.6 DPI, respectively.

The cell is subsequently followed using bright field images. At the point when DsRed fluorescence is detectable, a GFP fluorescence image is shown to demonstrate the co-expression of DsRed and GFP in the same cell. Subsequently DsRed fluorescence images (grey scale) monitor the division of the transduced cell and the gradual metamorphosis of the two daughter cells into neurons.
