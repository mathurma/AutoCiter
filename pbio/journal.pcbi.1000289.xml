                <p>Structure and dynamics of voltage-gated ion channels, in particular the motion of
                    the S4 helix, is a highly interesting and hotly debated topic in current
                    membrane protein research. It has critical implications for insertion and
                    stabilization of membrane proteins as well as for finding how transitions occur
                    in membrane proteins—not to mention numerous applications in drug
                    design. Here, we present a full 1 µs atomic-detail molecular dynamics
                    simulation of an integral Kv1.2 ion channel, comprising 120,000 atoms. By
                    applying 0.052 V/nm of hyperpolarization, we observe structural rearrangements,
                    including up to 120° rotation of the S4 segment, changes in
                    hydrogen-bonding patterns, but only low amounts of translation. A smaller
                    rotation (∼35°) of the extracellular end of all S4 segments is
                    present also in a reference 0.5 µs simulation without applied field,
                    which indicates that the crystal structure might be slightly different from the
                    natural state of the voltage sensor. The conformation change upon
                    hyperpolarization is closely coupled to an increase in 3<sub>10</sub> helix
                    contents in S4, starting from the intracellular side. This could support a model
                    for transition from the crystal structure where the hyperpolarization
                    destabilizes S4–lipid hydrogen bonds, which leads to the helix
                    rotating to keep the arginine side chains away from the hydrophobic phase, and
                    the driving force for final relaxation by downward translation is partly
                    entropic, which would explain the slow process. The coordinates of the
                    transmembrane part of the simulated channel actually stay closer to the recently
                    determined higher-resolution Kv1.2 chimera channel than the starting structure
                    for the entire second half of the simulation (0.5–1 µs).
                    Together with lipids binding in matching positions and significant thinning of
                    the membrane also observed in experiments, this provides additional support for
                    the predictive power of microsecond-scale membrane protein simulations.</p>

                <p>Proteins that transport ions across the cellular membrane are essential for
                    cellular life. The proteins conducting positively charged potassium ions are key
                    players in heart beat and nerve impulse generation because they are regulating
                    the electrical excitability of the cell (together with proteins transporting
                    other ions). These particular ion channels open and close in response to voltage
                    changes across cellular membranes, but the details of this process are still not
                    fully understood. It is, however, known that the main protein element
                    responsible is a helical section containing several charges. Through new
                    computer simulation methods, we have been able to run unprecedentedly long
                    atomic simulations of an entire potassium channel embedded within a patch of
                    membrane to help to shed new light on this gating process. Upon changing the
                    voltage across the membrane, we observe a change in structure of this helical
                    protein segment that appears to be an early sign of transition from the open to
                    the closed state of the channel. This has also been previously proposed to be
                    critical for the gating process. Understanding these structural changes on an
                    atomic level is essential for both advancing basic science and enabling drug
                    design targeting of voltage-regulated ion channels.</p>

            <p>Potassium channels are the single most common type of ion channels in nature. The
                subclass of voltage-dependent potassium channels enable controlled ion transport
                over the cell membrane and are hence pivotal for a wide range of functions such as
                nerve impulse action potentials, our heart beats, insulin secretion upon low ATP,
                and many diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Xu1">[1]</xref>. The first X-ray structure to be determined was the
                bacterial tetrameric KcsA K<sup>+</sup> channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Doyle1">[2]</xref>, which is pH-modulated
                with an opening mechanism likely controlled by protonation and salt bridges/hydrogen
                bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Thompson1">[3]</xref>. Recently determined structures of voltage-modulated
                potassium channels such as KvAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Jiang1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Lee1">[5]</xref> and Kv1.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref> in the open state share
                the same central pore domain (PD), but for these the actual voltage-sensitivity is
                introduced by adjacent 4-helix voltage sensor domains (VSDs) in each monomer. The PD
                is formed by eight transmembrane helices (and their connecting loops), two from each
                subunit, and it contains an ion-conducting channel connecting the inside and the
                outside of the cell. This water-filled pore consists of a rather large intracellular
                cavity leading into a narrow ion-selectivity filter at the extracellular end.</p>
            <p>The access to the intracellular cavity, and hence to the ion-conducting pore, is
                controlled by a gate that is opened in response to the membrane potential. It is
                well established that the gating within the PD is regulated by conformational
                changes in the VSDs in response to the varying membrane potential. In particular,
                the gating is caused by the voltage sensor S4 helix of the VSD which contains
                several positively charged amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Yang1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Seoh1">[10]</xref>. When the
                charged S4 helix moves it creates an experimentally measurable current called the
                gating current, which is distinct from the so called
                <italic>α</italic>-current caused by ions passing over the membrane through
                the protein channel. The actual opening of the channel pore domain and initiation of
                the <italic>α</italic>-current has experimentally been shown to occur in the
                millisecond range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Hille1">[11]</xref>, but Sigg et al. have reported an early component
                of the gating current with a time constant as short as 12 µs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Sigg1">[12]</xref>.</p>
            <p>When the cell is at rest, the membrane is hyperpolarized (negative potential on
                intracellular side) and the gates of the voltage-sensitive potassium channels are
                closed, their S4 helices located near the intracellular membrane border, referred to
                as the down or “resting” (R) state in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000289-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Upon depolarization of the membrane,
                channel opening is thought to occur in a stepwise fashion where each voltage-sensing
                domain first activates independently, by transferring some of the positive charges
                within the voltage sensor helix from the intracellular side in the down state to the
                extracellular side of the membrane, the up state. In this transient activated state
                of the protein, the ion-conducting pathway is still obstructed by the gate formed by
                the intracellular ends of the four pore-lining S6 helices of the PD. Subsequently,
                the channel gate is opened by an additional cooperative motion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Pathak1">[13]</xref>, yielding the
                open-activated state (A) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000289-g001">Figure
                1</xref>. For long periods of depolarization, the channel is believed to undergo
                slow inactivation caused by conformational changes around the selectivity filter
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Yellen1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-CorderoMorales1">[17]</xref>, making it
                impermeable for ions even though the gate is open (the open-inactivated state, AL).
                Going from R over A to AL, i.e., opening and eventually inactivating the protein
                after long depolarization, is referred to the forward direction in literature.
                However, since the experimental structure corresponds to the AL (or possibly A)
                state, the current simulations aim to assess the conformational changes in the
                backward direction, both due to hyperpolarization and equilibration in a more fluid
                bilayer.</p>

                        and protein is not conducting. Upon depolarization it transfers to an
                        activated (A) state, likely due to S4 voltage-dependent motion and coupled
                        to the channel opening. This state is transient and converts into a more
                        stable relaxed state (AL) at prolonged depolarization (non-conducting).
                        Crystal structures likely correspond to this open-inactivated state.</p>

            <p>Several experimental studies have shown that the gating involves displacement of just
                over three charges per subunit across the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Aggarwal1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Seoh1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Schoppa1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Lecar1">[19]</xref>. Although the exact
                nature of the gating process is not yet fully understood, several ideas have been
                proposed, for instance S4 rotation combined with crevice reshaping to effectively
                move charges between inside/outside (transporter model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Bezanilla1">[20]</xref>), larger rotation
                and translation of S4 inside a rigid environment (helical screw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Catterall1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Ahern1">[22]</xref>) or S3b/S4 helices moving as a hairpin (paddle
                model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Jiang1">[4]</xref>).
                These models have mostly converged at smaller necessary S4 displacements combined
                with rotation/tilt, but there are still important differences, for instance whether
                S4 moves independently of S3b or not, whether the charged arginine residues at some
                point are facing the membrane or not, and in which order the motion events occur
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Tombola1">[23]</xref>.
                Note that small S4 displacements still could explain the effective charge
                displacement due to significant water depressions in the VSDs that cause local
                focusing of the electric field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Islas1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Jogini1">[26]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Additional interesting conformational changes upon gating have recently been
                proposed. In the new Kv1.2 crystal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref>, the intracellular end of
                the S4 helix adopts a 3<sub>10</sub> conformation leading the authors to propose
                that this secondary structure alteration is relevant for the gating. This is also
                supported by recent data from Villalba-Galea et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-VillalbaGalea1">[27]</xref> suggesting that
                the R to A transition of the voltage sensor takes place as 3<sub>10</sub> helix
                whereas the A to AL transition changes the voltage sensor conformation to
                    <italic>α</italic>-helix.</p>
            <p>The experimental structures in combination with theoretical models of the closed
                state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-YarovYarovoy1">[28]</xref> has led to considerable interest in understanding
                these structural transitions. Simulations of isolated voltage sensors have confirmed
                water-filled VSD crevices (on both intracellular and extracellular sides), S4
                stabilization and field focusing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Freites1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Sands1">[30]</xref>. Treptow et al. used short (9 ns) simulations of
                an integral Kv1.2 channel to show how the S4 gating charges can be stabilized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Treptow1">[31]</xref>, and
                Jogini/Roux have reported on structural flexibility and arginine side chain dynamics
                in the voltage sensors from 20 ns-simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Jogini1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Sigworth1">[32]</xref>. Coarse-grained
                representations of Kv1.2 systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Treptow2">[33]</xref> have been used to reach 350 ns of simulation,
                although the pore in this case collapsed to an apparently closed state even without
                any applied field. Recently, Nishizawa et al. reported on S4 motion in an isolated
                VSD when running at elevated temperatures applying strong fields of 0.15 V/nm and
                position-restraining adjacent helices. While interesting, it is unclear how
                realistic this is since the position restraints will prevent side chains in adjacent
                helices from stabilizing S4, and near-instantaneous membrane rupture was observed at
                0.2 V/nm (in our longer simulations, fields exceeding 0.1 V/nm lead to electrostatic
                breakdown in 100 ns) and no significant S4 motion occurred in 30–40 ns
                simulations at lower voltages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Nishizawa1">[34]</xref>. While all these studies provide new insights
                into Kv1.2 dynamics, they are all partly limited, either by short timescales or
                other approximations; VSDs might for instance behave differently than integral ion
                channels, and any charged elements will move if the voltage applied is high enough
                and the rest of the structure is restrained. Ideally, one would want to simulate an
                entire ion channel system for long times at low field strengths, which previously
                has not been possible.</p>
            <p>Here, we present a full atomic detail microsecond simulation of an integral Kv1.2
                system comprising 120,000 atoms, with an applied field of 0.052 V/nm, corresponding
                to approximately 500 mV of potential drop over the membrane (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000289.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The
                seed for this project was our recent development of new parallelization techniques
                in the GROMACS molecular simulation code <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Berk1">[35]</xref> that have enabled us to
                reach a microsecond with high-accuracy simulation settings in just a month of runs
                (roughly 125,000 CPU-hours). Analysis of the S4 helix structure, dynamics and
                interactions in applied fields is of course of particular interest. Another
                challenge is to compare and contrast results to the new high-resolution chimera
                Kv1.2/Kv2.1 structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref> that appeared during the project, and where the
                intracellular part of S4 assumes 3<sub>10</sub> helix conformation. The primary
                questions we wanted to address are whether previously observed motions in short ion
                channel and VSD simulations do represent the early stages of transition towards the
                resting state or merely short-time fluctuations? To what extent can molecular
                simulations started from lower-resolution structures predict native conformations
                and/or lipid-protein interactions, and can we use it to better understand channel
                opening/closing?</p>

                <p>The initial ion channel conformation used in this study was constructed from the
                    X-ray structure of the Kv1.2 channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long1">[6]</xref>, PDB accession ID
                    2A79. The monomer coordinates were assembled into a tetramer channel which
                    kindly was provided directly from MacKinnon's laboratory. To reduce the
                    system size the T1 domain was excluded. The parts used were chains B, from
                    residue T219 (inclusive), C from UNK33 corresponding to A162 in Kv1.2, and chain
                    D. Since parts of the transmembrane helices were of limited X-ray resolution it
                    was necessary to complement it with side chain and loop modeling to arrive at a
                    model suitable for simulations. The voltage sensor domains together with the
                    pore domain helices from the separate chains were structurally aligned to the
                    corresponding part in the ROSETTA model of the open state of the Kv1.2 channel
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-YarovYarovoy1">[28]</xref>, using the program STRUCTAL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Subbiah1">[36]</xref>.
                    Subsequently, the missing parts of the crystal structure (i.e., residues denoted
                    UNK, missing side chains and loops) were copied from the ROSETTA model
                    structure. This essentially resulted in a model using the experimental data for
                    the backbone and most side chains, with the remaining side chains and missing
                    loops from the ROSETTA model. The ion channel structure was immersed in a lipid
                    membrane by using the Membrane package of VMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Humphrey1">[37]</xref>. Starting from a
                    pure POPC bilayer, the head group of every fourth lipid was randomly (in each
                    monolayer) exchanged for the negatively charged PG head group. The ion channel
                    was subsequently inserted and overlapping lipids deleted, after which 313 POPC
                    and 111 POPG lipids remained in the membrane. Although somewhat similar to a
                    prokaryotic membrane, this mixture was used to better mimic conditions used in
                    the crystallization protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref> and it has previously also been used in VSD
                    simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Sands2">[38]</xref>. The negative head groups in particular could
                    have important interactions with arginine, and PG force field parameters are
                    better tested than PS. The bilayer was first melted with MD at 300 K, while the
                    protein was kept frozen and the z-coordinates of the lipid chain methyl groups
                    position restrained

                    the protein for 1 ns. The system was subsequently solvated with 26,632 SPC
                    waters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Berendsen1">[39]</xref>, of which 127 were replaced with potassium
                    ions to neutralize the net system charge, followed by another 1 ns of
                    equilibration with only the protein frozen. The final assembly reached 119,913

                    Due to the slightly worse scaling properties of PME (3D Fourier transforms) it
                    proved efficient to move interactions to direct space by using longer cutoffs of

                <p>The assembled system was equilibrated in three steps with gradually weaker
                    position restraints on the protein (1000 kJ/mol/nm<sup>2</sup> for 1 ns, 100

                    runs were performed without restraints; an initial 50 ns without applied

                    of 0.052 V/nm along the z system axis, with lower potential on the intracellular
                    side. With a box length of ca 10 nm in the z direction, this corresponds to a
                    potential drop of ∼500 mV, which is due to depolarization at water/lipid
                    interface and will occur mostly over the membrane part (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000289.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

                <p>As additional tests, the non-polarized simulation was extended to 0.5

                <title>Microsecond-Scale Dynamics of the Kv1.2 Channel</title>
                <p>In terms of structural stability there are two obvious factors that could affect
                    the integrity of the ion channel negatively in extended simulations; the
                    significant number of rebuilt side chains and the complete removal of the
                    non-membrane-spanning T1 domain believed to be partly responsible for
                    tetramerization/stabilization of the Kv1.2 chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long1">[6]</xref>. Microsecond scales
                    are still quite hard to reach even for small globular proteins without the
                    complex long-range electrostatics critical in membrane and ion channel systems,
                    and to our best knowledge it has not previously been performed for systems of
                    this size. This is particularly critical since the slow lipid diffusion and
                    reorientation slows down all motion in the membrane, so full stabilization (or
                    unfolding) of a structure should be expected to take at least hundreds of
                    nanoseconds for a membrane protein.</p>
                <p>We directly observe distortion of the membrane close to the protein with
                    significant local bending, lipids pointing in toward polar groups and deep water
                    depressions (though not full transmembrane pores) forming in all voltage sensor
                    domains, just as previously observed in shorter simulations both of isolated
                    voltage sensor domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Freites1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Sands2">[38]</xref> and complete ion

                    helices relative to the (2.9 Å resolution) crystal structure rapidly
                    increases during the initial 50 ns of free equilibration, but levels off around
                    2 Å. When the hyperpolarization field is applied it very slowly (0.25
                    µs) continues to grow to 2.6 Å, where it is stable for the
                    remainder of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000289-g003">Figure
                        3A</xref>). The central pore-lining helices are even more rigid, although
                    they are actually part of four different chains. For the first 0.2 µs
                    they are roughly within 1 Å of the crystal structure, after which it
                    increases just slightly to 1.2 Å as a consequence of the other
                    structural changes in the rest of the structure. Since this was achieved
                        <italic>without</italic> the tetramerization domain attached this suggests
                    the extra domain might actually not be critical to maintain the Kv1.2 structure,
                    at least on microsecond scales. The structural flexibility of the voltage
                    sensors has previously been reported by Jogini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Jogini1">[26]</xref> and is quite
                    striking; one possible explanation is that it could be necessary to enable the
                    structural transitions required for the channel function.</p>

                <p>Since the starting model was derived from the Kv1.2 crystal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long1">[6]</xref> in
                    combination with the ROSETTA open model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-YarovYarovoy1">[28]</xref> it is quite
                    illustrating to compare the RMSD of corresponding parts of the transmembrane
                    (TM) helices to the newer 2.4 Å chimera structure, PDB accession ID
                    2R9R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref>. As the simulation proceeds beyond 0.3
                    µs the RMSD of the transmembrane part shows that the protein becomes
                    less similar to the starting model, leveling out at about 2.6 Å,
                    compared to the new crystal structure to which the RMSD is 2.2–2.3
                    Å. Thus, even when starting from imperfect coordinates, the simulation
                    ensemble is closer to the new high-resolution chimera structure. However, as
                    recently addressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-VillalbaGalea1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Lewis1">[53]</xref>, it is not trivial
                    to interpret the crystal data: the current structures of Kv1.2 might not have
                    captured the protein in its open-activated state but rather in the
                    open-inactivated state due to prolonged depolarization.</p>
                <p>To separate inherent flexibility from simple drift/unfolding of the different
                    Kv1.2 domains the C<italic>

                    </italic> root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) around the average structure of
                    each chain from the 1 µs-simulation were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000289-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). All four subunits
                    exhibit virtually identical patterns, with the two largest peaks in the curve
                    correspond to the large flexible extracellular loops. Experiments have shown
                    that these two loops can be omitted and the resulting protein remains functional
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref>.
                    At least the endpoints of the S3&amp;S4 helices are more mobile than the
                    S1&amp;S2 helices, and the pore helices are quite rigid. Interestingly, the
                    protein regions located “behind” the selectivity filter in
                    the three-dimensional structure (the C-terminal part of the S5 helix and the
                    P-loop in residues 361–373, together with the selectivity filter
                    itself in residues 374–378) proved remarkably stable throughout the
                    simulation. This is consistent with experimental data; residues in the P-loop in
                    the highly homologous pore domain of the KcsA potassium channel have been shown
                    to be involved in filter-stabilizing interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-CorderoMorales1">[17]</xref>. Two
                    potassium ions were located within the selectivity filter throughout the
                    simulations and no events of ion transfer through the filter were recorded.</p>
                <p>While stable, the ion channel is still quite a sensitive system, which became
                    obvious for the high-temperature/field (343 K&amp;0.1 V/nm) simulation. The
                    membrane stayed more or less intact over 500 ns, but the RMSD of the TM part
                    gradually increased to 5 Å (<italic>data not shown</italic>). This was
                    coupled with very large distortions of the VSDs and even partial unfolding of
                    alpha helices. In our opinion, the system is simply unfolding under these
                    conditions. Fields higher than 0.1 V/nm consistently lead to electrostatic
                    breakdown on scales of 100 ns in test simulations. As recently reported by
                    Böckmann et al. there appears to be an exponential dependence of pore
                    formation time vs. applied field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Bckmann1">[51]</xref>, and we therefore
                    decided to limit the analysis to the simulations closer to long-time stable
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>Perhaps surprisingly, we only observed a couple of Ångström of
                    S4 helix translation along the bilayer normal towards the intracellular side and
                    no effect on the pore radius was observed. Since the transition between open and
                    closed conformations of the channel is a process of one or a few milliseconds
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Hille1">[11]</xref>, it is not expected to occur completely in
                    µs-scale simulation. There is however a small but significant
                    component of the gating movement, the fast gating component, which appears to
                    occur on µs timescales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Sigg1">[12]</xref> and it is consequently feasible that initial
                    stages of channel structural transitions could be captured by the current
                    simulation. The fact that the crystal structure might not be in the
                    open-activated state (A) but rather the open-inactivated state (AL) is also
                    important since even when hyperpolarization is applied the structure might have
                    to go through the A state before being able to access resting conformations, a
                    process not expected to be coupled to any significant charge transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-VillalbaGalea1">[27]</xref>.</p>

                <title>S4 Motion and Stabilization</title>
                <p>To characterize the behavior of the key charged residues in the S4 helix, the
                    movement along the z-axis (parallel to the membrane normal) was tracked. This is
                    non-trivial since the protein position fluctuates a lot over a microsecond due
                    to membrane undulations. It was thus calculated as the difference in the
                    z-coordinate of the C<italic>

                <p>In general, fluctuations of 5–10 Å were seen over hundreds of
                    nanoseconds, suggesting that it is quite difficult or impossible to draw
                    conclusions from shorter simulations. However, it is quite striking that there
                    is really only one case—subunit C—where we see significant
                    changes due to the applied field (for reference: simulations had identical
                    starting conditions). The net movement towards the intracellular side is quite
                    low in all cases (with and without applied field), up to ∼3 Å
                    for R300 in subunit C, which really is the same order of magnitude as the
                    fluctuations on microsecond scale. R303 and K306 also moved marginally in the
                    same direction while R294 adopted a more extracellular position hence extending
                    the N-terminal part of the helix. A visually more appealing way to represent
                    this is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000289-g005">Figure
                    5</xref>. It shows that the S4 helix in this subunit is less bent due to
                    straightening of the extracellular portion of the helix (see next section). It
                    has the effect that the mass center of the S4 helix backbone is shifted towards
                    the intracellular side, especially the N-terminal half, explaining the relative
                    downward movement of R300 but also the lack of corresponding movement in R294
                    and R297 which both end up on a more extracellular phase of the helix (due to
                    rotation) compared to the reference structure.</p>

                    an electronegative atom (nitrogen). R294 and R297 formed strong hydrogen bonds
                    with oxygens in the lipid head groups in the extracellular leaflet and water
                    molecules in the extracellular VSD crevice but they also interacted transiently
                    with residues in the neighboring S5 helix of the pore domain (D352 and E353).
                    R300 and R303 on the other hand, mostly formed stable salt-bridges with
                    negatively charged residues within the VSD, in particular E183 in S1 and E226 in
                    S2, something that also has been shown in the crystal structures of Kv1.2 and in
                    other modeling/simulation attempts of the open <italic>Shaker</italic> channel
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Jogini1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-YarovYarovoy1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long3">[54]</xref>, and
                    with water (in the extracellular crevice). For subunit C, where we did see clear
                    differences with/without hyperpolarization, the formation of new hydrogen bonds
                    with the protein and water in the extracellular VSD crevice instead of
                    interaction with lipids (for example in R297 in subunit A and similar events in
                    the other subunits, B and D) was highly correlated with a large rotation around
                    the helical axis (see next section). As the rotation in the extracellular half
                    of the S4 helix took place in subunit C under hyperpolarization, the total
                    number of hydrogen bonds formed between lipids and R294 and R297 decreased as
                    these side chains gradually reduced their exposure to the lipid environment. The
                    lysine residue, K306, formed hydrogen bonds with protein, first with E236 in S2
                    (except in subunit C) and later with D259 in S3 (interactions confirmed by
                    experimental findings in Shaker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-TiwariWoodruff1">[55]</xref>), and water
                    molecules in the intracellular VSD crevice. Interestingly, the formation of the
                    hydrogen bond between K306 and D259 in subunit C at 0.3 µs is highly
                    correlated to onset of 3<sub>10</sub> helix growth in S4 of subunit C.</p>
                <p>The charge movement in S4 towards the intracellular side upon channel
                    open-to-closed gating is thought to be associated with hydrogen-bonding pattern
                    changes. The two most extracellular arginine residues should, as they move down
                    in response to the hyperpolarization, start competing for the hydrogen bonds
                    formed between the following two arginine residues (R300 and R303) and the
                    anionic residues in the VSD center (E183 and E226). As they do, these latter two
                    arginine residues become accessible to the water in the intracellular crevice
                    and/or other polar/charged residues residing there <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Larsson1">[56]</xref>. It is likely that
                    these changes in hydrogen-bonding within the VSD contribute to the free energy
                    barrier between the intermediate states of gating. Curiously, no systematic
                    change in this hydrogen-bonding pattern was observed, with the exception of R300
                    in subunit C under hyperpolarization, where we see a complete loss of its
                    hydrogen bonds to protein.</p>
                <p>This could of course be due to the fact that this process is much slower compared
                    to the simulation timescale, as might be possible if this really is the main
                    free energy barrier of structural transformations between the open and closed
                    states. To investigate this further we attempted to selectively exclude the
                    interactions between the residues participating in these hydrogen bonds in the
                    open state of the channel. After 50 ns of such a simulation (continuing from the
                    last frame of the normal hyperpolarization simulation at 1 µs) we
                    still did not see any of these structural and binding rearrangements. This
                    indicates that the free energy barrier could rather be attributed to the
                    hydrophobic area surrounding S4 in the central part of the VSD, formed by
                    isoleucine residues in S1 and S2 (corresponding to the Kv1.2 residues I177 and
                    I230 respectively) as proposed by Campos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Campos1">[57]</xref> and/or by
                    phenylalanine (F233) as proposed by Long <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref>, separating the
                    extracellular and intracellular water crevices. To fully close the channel, the
                    S4 helix must be translated towards the intracellular side according to all
                    current models. It will force its arginine residues to cross this hydrophobic
                    area devoid of possible hydrogen-bond acceptors, and hence the hydrogen bonds
                    between the arginine residues and the anionic residues located extracellularly
                    of the hydrophobic area (E183 and E226 in particular) are almost certain to
                    break as the former move across the barrier without stabilizing hydrogen bonds,
                    which would lead to a kinetic free energy barrier for this transition. Once the
                    side chains have crossed the hydrophobic area, they can again form hydrogen
                    bonds with other polar residues of the protein or with water in the
                    intracellular crevice of the VSD.</p>

                <p>In addition to the small but clear rotation of the S4 helix present in all
                    chains, the extracellular half of the helix in subunit C also exhibited a
                    significantly larger but slow rotation in the 0.3–0.7 µs
                    timeframe when the hyperpolarization field was applied. R294 and R297 rotated
                    about −80 to −120° (peak values as much as
                    −150°), whereas the minimal rotation of R300 and R303 was
                    kept. This had the consequence that the helix became longer as the pitch angle
                    between helix turns increased and the positively charged residues in the helix
                    aligned on the same phase, all pointing toward the VSD interior, forming a
                    significant stretch of 3<sub>10</sub> helix. The C<italic>
                        <sub>α</sub>
                    </italic> rotation is again closely correlated with side chains (the backbone
                    might even precede the sidechains). Together with the rearrangement taking 0.4
                    µs to complete, it indicates a predominantly entropy-limited process.</p>
                <p>To double-check that the <italic>α</italic> helix vs. 3<sub>10</sub>
                    helix states are correctly modeled, the energies for an ACE-Ala<sub>20</sub>-NME
                    peptide in the two secondary structures were calculated, confirming that the
                        <italic>α</italic> helix enthalpy is lower by roughly 5 kJ/mol per
                    residue. This agrees well with earlier studies using both OPLS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-TiradoRives1">[58]</xref> and other parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Zhang1">[59]</xref> that also calculated
                    an entropic contribution to oppose roughly 1/3 of this. The final free energy is
                    thus roughly 3–4 kJ/mol lower per Alanine residue for an alpha helix
                    in solvent, with a low barrier around 1 kJ/mol (from 3<sub>10</sub> to
                        <italic>α</italic> helix) in earlier OPLS studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-TiradoRives1">[58]</xref>. In addition, the force field employed here has
                    also been succesful at reproducing the free energy landscape for the
                    3<sub>10</sub> helix-containing Trp-cage protein to within 1.5 Å <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Zhou1">[60]</xref>, so
                    we do not expect the transition to be an artifact from parameters.</p>
                <p>The larger rotation was a progressive event, not associated with single
                    hydrogen-bonding formation/breakage as in the abrupt R297 side chain rotation in
                    subunit A. Note that no corresponding rotation occurred in any of the subunits
                    in the simulation without external field. The 3<sub>10</sub> helix extension
                    (which even starts from the intracellular side) was associated with formation of
                    a new hydrogen bond between K306 and D259. S3b motion was clearly coupled with
                    S4 in fluctuation motions and initially even rotates slightly counter-clockwise
                    around S4 to maintain interaction surfaces. However, at least in the present
                    simulations, these interactions were broken when S4 rotated &gt;70°
                    degrees, and the extracellular part of S4 turned almost a third of a turn
                    relative to S3b. Hydrogen-bonding to lipids decreased in R294 and R297 after
                    approximately 470 ns (in favor of hydrogen bonds to water and to some extent
                    protein residues in the case of R297), but most of the rotation had already
                    taken place at that point. Consequently, the lipids involved in hydrogen-bonding
                    with these two arginine residues were dragged in towards the VSD/PD interface as
                    the field-driven subunit C rotation took place.</p>

                <p>The rotation of the extracellular half of the S4 helix in subunit C caused this
                    part of the helix to be more tightly wound and somewhat elongated because the
                    pitch angle between following helix turns increased. The secondary structure in
                    this region accordingly underwent a change from <italic>α</italic>-helix
                    to 3<sub>10</sub>-helix. In fact, the handful most C-terminal residues of the S4
                    helix in all subunits adopt 3<sub>10</sub> secondary structure already early in
                    the simulation. However, the significant 3<sub>10</sub>-helix growth in S4 of
                    subunit C starts after some 200 ns and continued for 250–300 ns,
                    perfectly correlated with the rotation of the extracellular end of this helix.
                    After the rotation, the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix consistently encompassed a full 17
                    residues in S4 (residues 293–309), including the two most
                    extracellular arginine residues R294 and R297. No corresponding
                    3<sub>10</sub>-helix growth was seen in any of the subunits in the simulation
                    without the applied electric field.</p>
                <p>Our model was derived from the original crystal structure of the Kv1.2 channel
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long1">[6]</xref>
                    but it has very interesting similarities to the new fully-resolved Kv1.2 chimera
                    crystal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref>. In particular, the new structure features
                        3<sub>10</sub>-helices C-terminally of the second arginine in S4 (R297). One
                    idea put forward by MacKinnon and coworkers is that the 3<sub>10</sub> portion
                    of the secondary structure of the S4 helix could be important for the function
                    of the protein by turning the arginine residues away from the lipid membrane as
                    they start the motion towards the intracellular side in response to the
                    hyperpolarization of the membrane. The easy solution would be if the side chains
                    are simply pulled down by the hyperpolarizing field, essentially dragging the
                    helix into 3<sub>10</sub> helix. However, this would not explain why the
                    transition <italic>in vivo</italic> can take up to milliseconds, or why there
                    are separate open-active and open-inactive states. In the hyperpolarization
                    simulations, the backbone and side chain rotation appears to be quite correlated
                    and slow, and the 3<sub>10</sub> helix is even growing from the intracellular
                    side. As mentioned above, this rather points to an entropic effect of packing S4
                    to the remaining VSD helices, somewhat akin to finding a keyhole in the
                    dark—it takes time, and pushing harder will not help. It also supports
                    an overall ‘screwing’ motion of S4, but in particular a
                    model where S4 first might have to transition to 3<sub>10</sub> helix (AL to A)
                    for the actual closing motion (A to R) to be possible, as recently also
                    suggested by Villalba-Galea et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-VillalbaGalea1">[27]</xref>.</p>

                <p>The lipid bilayer thickness was studied by calculating time-averaged bilayer
                    thickness between sn-2 carbons in the glycerol group (the carbon at the
                    branching point between the two acyl chains and the head group) on a grid in the
                    plane of the membrane (the xy-plane). The result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000289-g008">Figure 8</xref>. Membrane proteins
                    have been shown to induce large distortions in the surrounding bilayer in some
                    cases and that the lipid membrane can modulate protein function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Andersen1">[61]</xref>.
                    Clearly, the transmembrane protein has a large effect on the bilayer thickness;
                    in general, the thickness is obviously reduced close to the protein and in
                    particular in the grooves between neighboring VSDs (down to ∼25
                    Å) compared to the bulk thickness (40–50 Å).</p>

                <p>The Kv1.2 chimera structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref> has highly resolved lipid molecules in the
                    crystal forming a bilayer-like structure, especially in the grooves between
                    laterally protruding neighboring VSDs, indicating that these lipids are an
                    integral part of the protein structure and probably contribute to its stability.
                    This suggest strong lipid-protein interactions in those regions which in turn
                    support the data that shows that these parts of the lipid bilayer are very
                    important for lipid and lipid-soluble channel-regulators, such as drugs and
                    toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Oliver1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Swartz1">[64]</xref>. Even though the
                    number of resolved lipid molecules is rather low in the crystal structure, a
                    direct comparison to the simulations is tempting. In addition to several lipid
                    acyl chain fragments, three polar lipid head groups are resolved in the unit
                    cell (containing a single subunit); one in contact with the C-terminal part of
                    S6, the second wedged between the VSD and the S4–S5 linker, both part
                    of the intracellular leaflet, whereas the last is located close to the P-loop on
                    the extracellular side. This latter region had already been proposed to be a
                    lipid-interaction site due to lipid head group electron density in the KcsA
                    crystal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Valiyaveetil1">[65]</xref>. The lipid close to the S4–S5
                    linker in the intracellular leaflet was noted to have a considerable different
                    level of burial in the bilayer. By mapping snapshots of the simulation onto the

                <p>The lipid-exposed positively charged arginine residues in S4 perturbed the
                    membrane bilayer in their neighborhood because of their hydrogen-bonding to
                    lipid head groups. However, they <italic>never</italic> interacted directly with
                    the hydrophobic phase. On average, lipids were dragged down to be able to form
                    these interactions and the bilayer hence became thinner in this region which can
                    be seen by the mostly blue-colored regions of the membrane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000289-g008">Figure 8</xref>, close to the PD at
                    the right edges of the VSDs as viewed radially from the protein pore (region at
                    x,y-coordinates ∼(4,4.5) nm in plot, for subunit A). Such interactions
                    between the positively charged arginine residues of S4 and the negatively
                    charged lipid phosphodiester groups are crucial for the protein function, as
                    they are stabilizing the open conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Schmidt1">[66]</xref>. Moreover, this
                    significant thinning of the bilayer in the proximity of the voltage-sensing
                    arginine residues further helps the electric field focusing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Starace1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Ahern2">[67]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Other simulations have also reported on the thinning of the membrane with
                    immersed voltage-gated ion channels or VSDs. In simulations of the VSD in
                    POPC/POPG bilayer mixtures at 3∶1 molecular ratio, Sands et al. found
                    a thinning of the bilayer of ∼7 Å close to the voltage sensor
                    compared to bulk (measuring the P-P distance of opposing phospholipids) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Sands2">[38]</xref>. In
                    simulations of an isolated S4 helix (from KvAP) in a POPC bilayer, Freites et
                    al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Freites2">[68]</xref> found such a deformation of the membrane in the
                    vicinity of the peptide where the hydrophobic core was reduced to a mere 10
                    Å. In particular, they noted that one lipid in a simulation snapshot
                    spanned the entire membrane in a configuration resembling that of a monolayer.
                    Roux and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Jogini1">[26]</xref> also reported significant membrane thinning
                    at the intracellular side in their simulation of Kv1.2 due to increased
                    interactions between basic residues and (DPPC) lipid head groups. Although these
                    studies are hard to compare due to differences in methodology, lipid and protein
                    compositions, thinning of the bilayer around the VSD is present in all cases and
                    the phenomenon most likely has functional importance because it both stabilizes
                    the open state and focuses the electric field around the voltage-sensing
                    arginine residues of the S4 helix.</p>
                <p>To characterize the nature of the lipid-protein interactions, the number of POPC
                    and POPG lipids within 9 Å of the protein surface (measured from the
                    phosphor atom in the lipid head group) was analyzed and compared between the
                    first (random) and last (equilibrated) frames of the simulation, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000289-g010">Figure 10</xref>. The POPC/POPG ratio
                    at the start of the simulation is 2.61 while it decreases to 2.28 at the end,
                    compared to the overall ratio of 2.82 (313/111), clearly indicating an
                    enrichment of negatively charged POPG lipids close to the protein. A closer look
                    at the data reveals that the contribution to the POPG enrichment is mainly due
                    to increased interactions between POPG and positively charged residues on the
                    intracellular side of the protein, far away from the voltage-sensing arginine
                    residues in the open state. This might not be critical for the protein function,
                    but experimental studies have shown that the presence of the phosphodiester
                    moiety of the lipid head group is important for the stabilization of the open
                    state of the voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Schmidt1">[66]</xref>.
                    Rather, this enrichment might simply be explained by electrostatics; the charge
                    distribution of the protein differs significantly between the intracellular and
                    extracellular sides of the membrane with a clear overweight of positively
                    charged residues at the intracellular side, which hence attracts negatively
                    charged POPG lipid molecules. Biological relevance of specific interaction sites
                    of anionic lipids can not be ruled out, however, since they have been detected
                    in KcsA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Marius1">[69]</xref> and they are thought to modulate the selectivity
                    filter stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Deol1">[70]</xref>. In the same spirit, cardiolipin binding
                    sites have been reported for a number of membrane proteins such as the ADP/ATP
                    carrier, and a cardiolipin molecule has also been found in the structure of the
                    cytochrome bc1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Palsdottir1">[71]</xref>. Finally, they could be important for
                    accessibility of lipid-soluble protein functional regulators binding at or in
                    close proximity to these sites.</p>

            <p>The environment of the charged arginine residues in S4 after equilibration confirms
                previous reports that the two most extracellular arginine residues are only partly
                exposed to the lipid environment where they hydrogen bond to lipid head groups, in
                addition to transient interactions with water molecules in the extracellular VSD
                crevice and protein residues of the neighboring pore domain. The downstream two
                arginines were found to participate in stable salt-bridges with negatively charged
                residues from the neighboring S1 and S2 helices, forming a structural barrier
                separating the extracellular and intracellular water cavities within the
                voltage-sensing domains.</p>
            <p>The initial 30–40° rotation of the upper part of S4 in all subunits
                (both with and without hyperpolarization applied) indicates that the equilibrium
                state in a bilayer is likely somewhat different from the crystal structures. The
                rotation partly moves the two arginine residues within this segment away from the
                membrane-exposed surface of the VSD, towards its interior. Recently, Lewis et al.
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Lewis1">[53]</xref>
                presented a study that supports the notion that the voltage sensor in the crystal
                structure might not have the exact orientation expected in the open-activated state,
                based on experimentally derived distance-constraints between the most N-terminal
                arginine in S4 (R294) and residues in the S5 helix of the pore domain, but they
                should be rotated by ∼37°. Our simulations agree virtually perfectly
                with this, and enabled interactions (although transient) between R294 and relevant
                S5 residues.</p>
            <p>However, since this rotation occurs also in the simulation without external applied
                field (which should probably correspond to the AL state, if that is indeed the state
                of the crystal structure), this motion might not be representative of the AL to A
                transition, but rather an equilibration of the X-ray structure due to different
                environment (e.g., ion concentrations) in the crystal vs. the simulation. It is not
                trivial to say which one of these is closer to the native state. To focus on
                possible simulation shortcomings, one could, e.g., argue that the rotation might be
                be due to incomplete initial lipid packing around the protein, which is important
                for the stability of the S4 helices. While theoretically possible, we find this
                somewhat unlikely since the ion channel coordinates were restrained for the first 20
                ns of simulation to pack lipids efficiently around the protein, and the rotation
                subsequently took another ∼50 ns to complete. Furthermore, the membrane used
                for solvation did not have the four-fold symmetry of the ion channel, so it is
                improbable that incomplete local solvation would cause quantitatively similar
                rotation in all four VSDs.</p>
            <p>The slower, large-magnitude, rotation of S4 observed in the VSD of subunit C (roughly
                120°) is quite striking, and most likely caused by the hyperpolarization of
                the membrane since no corresponding rotation is observed in the simulation without
                the applied electrical field. Equally important—this rotation is closely
                coupled to most of S4 forming 3<sub>10</sub> helix (17 residues), which we hence can
                attribute to the hyperpolarization with fair confidence. Together, this has the
                effect that the positively charged residues in S4 align on the same phase of the
                helix, all pointing to the VSD interior. While some caution is advised considering
                the limited amount of data, this does look like an early stage of the voltage sensor
                transitioning. This is supported by considerable axial rotation of the S4 helix (as
                much as ∼180° in recent disulfide and metal bridge experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Campos1">[57]</xref>) and a
                change of the tilt angle of the helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Pathak2">[72]</xref>.</p>
            <p>A shorter stretch (two turns) of 3<sub>10</sub> helix is also present in the new
                chimera Kv1.2/Kv2.1 structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref>, and the authors have suggested it could be
                important for gating. In a new experimental paper by Villalba-Galea et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-VillalbaGalea1">[27]</xref>
                this idea has taken further and they propose a mechanism of gating where the S4
                helix totally adopts a 3<sub>10</sub> conformation as it moves between the resting
                and activated states (R and A). Moreover, their data suggest that the slow
                inactivation of the protein (the A to AL transition) takes the S4 helix from the
                    3<sub>10</sub>-conformation to <italic>α</italic>-helical in the
                open-inactivated state. Interestingly, since the crystal structures of the
                Kv-channels are thought to be in the open-inactivated state, this seems to support
                the transition observed, which in that case would correspond to the backward
                direction from open-inactivated AL state towards the activated A state (S4 forming
                    3<sub>10</sub> helix), which later would enable the A to R transition since a
                tighter helix with aligned charges could be easier to translate vertically.</p>
            <p>Since stepwise activation of the VSDs has been observed experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Pathak1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Mannuzzu1">[73]</xref>, we
                expect similar transitions to later occur in the remaining three subunits too.
                However, since even the transition motion takes close to half a microsecond to
                complete, even these fairly long simulations are at the very lower boundary of the
                timescales required to overcome the free energy barriers involved.</p>
            <p>Since gating is a reversible process, the hyperpolarization should return the protein
                to the closed resting state. However, it is not obvious that this mechanism of
                charge transfer is strictly the reverse of activation, in particular not when
                starting from the open-inactivated state. It is for instance likely that the closing
                process too is initiated in the VSD, and conformational changes propagated to the
                channel such that the entrance to the ion-conducting pore closes. In this case, it
                is also quite possible that S4 first might have to rotate away from the lipids when
                destabilized by the hyperpolarization, and later translate down due to entropic
                packing (whether this corresponds exactly to the AL-A-R transition or not is a
                separate question). While high potential/temperature or coarse-grained models are
                extremely useful from an understanding point of view, they can also easily alter
                this order of events or produce artificial motion. In fact, based on recent
                experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-VillalbaGalea1">[27]</xref> it is doubtful that a VSD should be able to
                transition (in particular not directly from AL to R states) on 10–100
                nanosecond timescales while not changing secondary structure!</p>
            <p>So, which is the chicken and which is the egg? Does the 3<sub>10</sub> helix
                formation drive the rotation or vice versa? Unfortunately this is not easy to
                resolve even from simulations since the two appear to be extremely
                coupled—the 3<sub>10</sub> helix of subunit C extended from the C-terminal
                side of the helix with a duration directly correlated with the large rotation after
                hyperpolarization. The seed for this alteration in structure seems to have been a
                hydrogen bond forming abruptly between K306 in S4 and D259 in S3, putting a local
                strain on the S4 helical backbone which subsequently was mediated
                ‘upwards’ in the S4 helix. Prior to this, the VSD helices became
                less tightly packed transiently as reflected by a 10% increase in the
                radius of gyration around the z-axis, possibly pushing the structural flexibility
                needed to initiate the 3<sub>10</sub> formation in this otherwise tightly packed
                central part of the VSD. On the other hand, the first part of the rotation at the
                N-terminal end of S4 began directly as the positional restraints were released and
                cannot be attributed to the change in secondary structure which started after about
                0.2 µs in subunit C. Further, if the subsequent large rotation in subunit
                C was caused solely by the 3<sub>10</sub> formation, then one would expect that the
                more C-terminally located R297 would start to rotate <italic>before</italic> R294.
                In practice, we believe it is a collective entropic process of re-packing S4 against
                the adjacent helices when the field changes, which would explain both the slow
                transition and why S4 can be transiently stable as 3<sub>10</sub> helix in the
                open-active state.</p>
            <p>The interactions between lipids and the membrane protein constitute an entire chapter
                by itself. Generally speaking, the coupling between membrane protein activation and
                membrane composition has been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Niemela1">[74]</xref>, illustrating the
                importance of specific lipid-protein interactions as well as the effects of membrane
                elastic properties on protein structure and dynamics. The thinning of the bilayer in
                the grooves between neighboring VSDs is evident, and this is actually also the
                region with resolved lipids in the new crystal structure of the chimera Kv1.2
                protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Long2">[7]</xref>,
                indicating favorable interactions with the protein. There are several experimental
                reports of functionally important interactions between the voltage sensor and
                lipids, both for stabilizing the open state of the voltage-dependent
                    K<sup>+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Schmidt1">[66]</xref> and for the focusing
                of the electric field around the voltage sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Starace1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Ahern2">[67]</xref>, that are mapped to this
                area of the bilayer. Additionally, interaction sites with protein function
                regulators, such as drugs and toxins, have been shown to be located on the protein
                surface facing these lipid regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Oliver1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000289-Swartz1">[64]</xref>. Hence, the bilayer
                behavior within these grooves seems to be of a very different nature compared to the
                bulk lipid bilayer and other parts of the membrane close to the protein. Quantifying
                these differences more thoroughly is something we will focus on in a future
            project.</p>
