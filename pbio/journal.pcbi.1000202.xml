                <p>Studies of the evolution of development characterize the way in which gene
                    regulatory dynamics during ontogeny constructs and channels phenotypic
                    variation. These studies have identified a number of evolutionary regularities:
                    (1) phenotypes occupy only a small subspace of possible phenotypes, (2) the
                    influence of mutation is not uniform and is often canalized, and (3) a great
                    deal of morphological variation evolved early in the history of multicellular
                    life. An important implication of these studies is that diversity is largely the
                    outcome of the evolution of gene regulation rather than the emergence of new,
                    structural genes. Using a simple model that considers a generic property of
                    developmental maps—the interaction between multiple genetic elements
                    and the nonlinearity of gene interaction in shaping phenotypic
                    traits—we are able to recover many of these empirical regularities. We
                    show that visible phenotypes represent only a small fraction of possibilities.
                    Epistasis ensures that phenotypes are highly clustered in morphospace and that
                    the most frequent phenotypes are the most similar. We perform phylogenetic
                    analyses on an evolving, developmental model and find that species become more
                    alike through time, whereas higher-level grades have a tendency to diverge.
                    Ancestral phenotypes, produced by early developmental programs with a low level
                    of gene interaction, are found to span a significantly greater volume of the
                    total phenotypic space than derived taxa. We suggest that early and late
                    evolution have a different character that we classify into micro- and
                    macroevolutionary configurations. These findings complement the view of
                    development as a key component in the production of endless forms and highlight
                    the crucial role of development in constraining biotic diversity and
                    evolutionary trajectories.</p>

                <p>At the very end of his <italic>On the Origin of Species</italic>, Charles Darwin
                    wrote, “from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and
                    most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.” Nature truly
                    displays a bewildering variety of shapes and forms. Yet, with all its
                    magnificence, this diversity still represents only a tiny fraction of the
                    endless “space” of possibilities; research on the evolution
                    of development has revealed that observed common morphologies and body plans
                    (or, more generally, phenotypes) occupy only small, dense patches in the
                    abstract phenotypic space. In this paper, we introduce a simple model of
                    evolving gene regulation and show that these empirically identified patterns can
                    be attributed, at least in part, to interaction between genes (epistasis) in the
                    developmental network. Our model further predicts that early developmental
                    programs with low levels of interaction would span most of the variation found
                    in extant species. The theory presented in our paper complements the view of
                    development as a key component in the production of endless forms and highlights
                    the crucial role of development in constraining (as well as generating) biotic
                    diversity.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The tremendous diversity of shapes and forms observed in nature is truly remarkable
                and yet it represents only a small fraction of the ‘space’ of
                the possible. One reason for this is that the space of possible genotypes has been
                incompletely sampled over the course of the history of life on earth. If we consider
                the astronomical volume of the genotypic space, then the set of all DNA strands that
                were ever produced during earth history constitute a tiny fraction of the total
                sequence space. Moreover, the genotypes that have existed are the result of an
                evolutionary process—descent with modification from a common
                ancestor—which is a locally-delimited generative process. Phenotypic
                diversity is further constrained by another process, one intrinsic to the
                manufacture of adaptive varieties, the developmental mechanisms that determine the
                mapping of genotypes into phenotypes.</p>
            <p>Development induces a non-linear and highly degenerate mapping from gene-space to
                phenotype space, whereby many genotypes produce similar (or identical) phenotypes,
                and concomitantly, ensuring that there are many phenotypes that cannot be generated
                by any genotype. This arises from both neutral genetic properties of the
                developmental dynamic, and from the evolution of robustness mechanisms which seek to
                preserve functional phenotypes in the face of environmental and genetic variation
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-deVisser1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Borenstein1">[2]</xref>. Degeneracy has the
                effect of hiding genotypes from the selective process and rendering a large portion
                of potential phenotypes inaccessible. This is an architectural constraint that
                limits available variation and adaptive capacity, with potentially dramatic effects
                on the trajectory of the evolutionary process. Whereas evolutionary search over the
                space of frequently generated phenotypes is in strict accordance with neo-darwinian
                theory (population genetics for example), the sparse distribution of the phenotypic
                space has implications for large scale patterns of evolutionary change, and this can
                only be appreciated through the introduction into the evolutionary dynamic of a
                suitable model of development.</p>
            <p>Developmental mappings are generally extremely complex. This complexity derives from
                a combination of hierarchical regulation, multi-gene control, epistasis, and
                pleiotropy. A large body of work examines the statistical and dynamical properties
                of developmental maps in simple systems, focusing on neutrality and neutral networks
                of RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Fontana1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Huynen1">[5]</xref> and on gene regulatory
                networks in multicellular development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Carroll1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Hall1">[8]</xref>. These
                studies have generated interest among paleontologists inquiring into the origin and
                diversification of body plans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Valentine1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Valentine2">[11]</xref> and have lead to the
                suggestion that morphological variation is extensive early in the history of
                multicellular life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Valentine1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Marshall1">[12]</xref>, that phenotypes are sparsely distributed in the
                space of ‘potential’ phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Pie1">[13]</xref>, and that diversity is
                better predicted by variation in the structure of gene regulation networks than
                variation in the presence and absence of structural genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Davidson2">[14]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Here, we consider a very generic property of complex developmental maps—the
                interaction between multiple genetic elements and the non-linearity of gene
                interaction—in shaping various aspects of a phenotype. On the mechanistic
                genetic level, this is usually referred to as <italic>epistasis</italic> and
                    <italic>pleiotropy</italic>, but the same generic constraint principle might
                also apply to many other biological mappings, ranging from the physical interactions
                between amino acids in the production of protein structures, to the interactions
                between tissues and their effects on gross morphology. We wish to show that a basic
                geometric property of development provides a null model able to account for the bias
                and nonuniformity of phenotype distributions.</p>
            <p>The model is constructed as a generic representation, capturing the way multiple
                genetic inputs combinatorially interact to influence multiple phenotypic traits, and
                does not assume selection. One natural interpretation is that of cis-regulatory
                architecture and gene interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Davidson2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-deLeon1">[16]</xref>. For convenience, we
                use terms related to this interpretation throughout the paper. We use the model to
                examine a number of statistical regularities of the developmental map that it
                induces. In particular, we derive the fraction of visible phenotypes generated
                during development and the dependence of this fraction on the level of interaction
                between genetic elements. We characterize the distances among visible and frequently
                occurring phenotypes and the influence of development on phylogenetic relationships.
                We demonstrate that many of the empirical, developmental and paleontological
                regularities summarized above can be recovered using this null model.</p>

                <p>Genotypes and phenotypes are represented as binary vectors of lengths
                    <italic>r</italic> and <italic>k</italic>. Generally speaking, genotypes
                    represent the presence/absence of <italic>r</italic> genetic elements (e.g.,
                    genes, alleles, etc.), and phenotypes represent the presence/absence of
                        <italic>k</italic> phenotypic traits. An interpretation in terms of
                    cis-regulatory dynamics posits that genotypes represent the expression pattern
                    of a set of <italic>r</italic> transcription factors (TFs) and that phenotypes
                    denote the expression pattern of <italic>k</italic> target genes regulated by
                    these TFs. In this sense, genotypes and phenotypes in our model may be viewed as
                    representing certain aspects of the cell transcriptional state. In the
                    following, we refer to <italic>r</italic> as the regulatory dimension and to
                        <italic>k</italic> as the phenotypic dimension.</p>
                <p>A developmental plan maps genotypes to phenotypes. We define a developmental plan
                    as a matrix, <italic>D</italic>, of size
                    <italic>k</italic>×<italic>r</italic>. Each entry in this matrix is
                    either +1 or −1 with equal probability (using real numbers
                    drawn from a uniform or Gaussian distribution with mean 0 does not qualitatively
                    change the results presented in this paper). Given a genotype, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the phenotype to which it maps is calculated by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>H</italic> denotes the heaviside function
                    (i.e., the unit step function centered at zero). In the regulatory
                    interpretation, <italic>D<sub>ij</sub></italic> describes properties of the
                    binding site for transcription factor <italic>j</italic> in the promoter of gene
                        <italic>i</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g001">Figure

                        <italic>recurrent</italic> model of gene regulation. In these models, the
                    resulting ‘phenotype’ (or pattern of gene expression) is fed
                    back into the regulatory plan, until the system reaches steady state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Wagner1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Siegal1">[17]</xref>. These models aim
                    to capture multilayered plans, where the output of one layer forms the input to
                    the next (these recurrent models are a simple case where the same plan is
                    applied to each layer). By contrast, the model described above employs a single
                    layer architecture. To examine the effect of such multilayered plans we extend
                    our model by allowing it to include multiple regulatory layers. Formally, we
                    define <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>t</italic> denotes the regulatory layer number

                <p>Our basic model assumes a ‘fully connected’ regulatory plan,

                    density of the regulatory plan has been shown to have important effects on the

                <p>Consider a developmental model with regulatory dimension <italic>r</italic> and
                    phenotypic dimension <italic>k</italic>. There are 2<italic>
                        <sup>r</sup>
                    </italic> genotypes which could produce a maximum of 2<italic>
                        <sup>r</sup>
                    </italic> phenotypes. However, the developmental plan maps several genotypes
                    into the same phenotype (giving rise to degeneracy), and consequently generates
                    a much smaller number of distinct phenotypes. We refer to the set of phenotypes
                    produced by a given developmental plan as <italic>visible phenotypes</italic>,
                    and examine the number of visible phenotypes and the number of potential
                    phenotypes as a function of <italic>r</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We find that while the
                        <italic>number</italic> of visible phenotypes increases with the regulatory
                    dimension, <italic>r</italic>, their fraction, out of the number of potential
                    phenotypes, rapidly declines, with around 5% of the potential
                    phenotypes remaining visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) when
                        <italic>r</italic> = <italic>k</italic>. In
                    other words, the expansion of the genotypic space, which also promotes an
                    expansion in the number of possible genotypic configurations, also brings about
                    an increased canalization, masking the expansion in the number of new visible
                    phenotypes. This is further exemplified by the marginal contribution of each
                    genetic element (e.g., each transcription factor), measured as the relative
                    increase in the number of visible phenotypes obtained by adding a new genetic
                    element. This declines from about two-fold for the first few elements, to less
                    than 1.4 as <italic>r</italic> reaches <italic>k</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). As per the mathematical analysis
                    below, this can be attributed to the effect of an unbalanced sample of
                    <italic>D</italic> entries and the multiplicative effect of the nonuniform
                    distribution of each element in the phentype. Interestingly, the function
                    describing the fraction of visible phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) is sigmoidal, with the greatest
                    change in the fraction of visible phenotypes occurring at regulatory dimensions
                    on the order of half the phenotypic dimension. Thus for smaller regulatory
                    circuits, a large fraction of potential phenotypes remain visible, whereas for
                    larger regulatory circuits, the greater fraction of the phenotypic space is
                    hidden and inaccessible to selection and evolutionary transformation.</p>

                <p>Having established that large regulatory networks lead to a small number of

                    (e.g., the number of TFs matches the number of target genes). As demonstrated
                    above, these developmental plans produce the most restricted set of visible
                    phenotypes. Unless otherwise indicated, we set
                        <italic>r</italic> = <italic>k</italic> = 14
                    to allow for the complete enumeration of all genotypes. We consider the

                            higher than 10<sup>3.5</sup>. Given that the total number of genotypes

                            distance 7 (for phenotypes of length 14). Distinct visible phenotypes
                            are closer to one another, with the mean distance 5.976. When weighting
                            by the frequency of the visible phenotypes, the distance is reduced,
                            with a mean distance 4.607.</p>

                <p>Are the visible phenotypes uniformly distributed across the phenotypic space or
                    clumped in a nonuniform, subspace of closely related phenotypes? To answer this
                    question, we compute the gain function of a given developmental plan. This
                    function describes the distribution of Hamming distances among phenotypes (using
                    the average pairwise dissimilarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Ciampaglio1">[21]</xref>) whose origins
                    are genotypes a certain Hamming distance apart. In other words, the gain
                    function measures how the magnitude of a perturbation in the genotype space maps
                    onto perturbations in the phenotype space. The resulting gain function suggests
                    that the developmental plan induces a significant degree of canalization; a
                    large perturbation in the genotype space (measured as the Hamming distance
                    between the original and perturbed genotypes) produces, on average, a
                    significantly smaller perturbation in the phenotype space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This canalization compresses the
                    image of the genotypes in the phenotype space, and promotes a patchy subspace.
                    This property of regulatory networks has been adduced as evidence for the

                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Here we
                    plot the frequency distributions of pair-wise Hamming distances under three
                    different conditions: (1) randomly drawn phenotypes from the space of potential
                    phenotypes, (2) randomly drawn phenotypes from the set of distinct, visible,
                    phenotypes, and (3) randomly drawn phenotypes from the set of visible phenotypes
                    including all occurrences of each phenotype. In other words, each distinct,
                    visible phenotype is sampled with a probability proportional to its frequency.
                    We find that the condition involving the visible phenotypes, tends to generate
                    phenotypes more similar than expected by chance (random phenotype distribution).
                    Moreover, when controlling for frequency (the degeneracy level) of the visible
                    phenotypes, we find that the distribution is further skewed toward smaller
                    Hamming distances. This suggests that the most frequent phenotypes span a
                    smaller subspace than the total visible phenotypes, and are located towards the
                    center of the visible phenotype set.</p>
                <p>To examine this observation in greater detail we measure the average Hamming
                    distance between visible phenotypes as a function of their frequency and
                    represent them on a frequency-rank versus distance plot. The highest ranked
                    phenotypes are presented as the lowest rank values. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, the distance
                    between the most frequent phenotypes is significantly smaller than the average
                    distance (which in this case is ∼6), and increases as more visible
                    phenotypes (with lower frequencies) are considered. Considering the case where
                    all the visible phenotypes are included in this analysis, the average distance
                    is still smaller than that expected by chance. We find that the top
                    5% most frequent phenotypes are very similar (average Hamming
                    distance is smaller than 4) yet cover approximately 50% of all the
                    visible phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g004">4A</xref> inset). An additional illustration of this patchiness can
                    be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g004">Figure 4B</xref>,
                    plotting the one mutant-neighbor network of all the visible phenotypes. Here we
                    observe that the nodes that represent the most frequent phenotypes tend to be
                    separated in most cases by a single edge.</p>

                            their frequency level. For each rank, we calculate the average Hamming
                            distance between all visible phenotypes with this or higher rank. The
                            most abundant phenotypes are very similar. This similarity decreases as
                            less frequent phenotypes are included in the analysis. We also calculate
                            which fraction of all visible phenotypes are included in these
                            phenotypes (solid line). The inset shows a zoom of the same plot,

The binary vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, selects elements of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for summation.

                    <italic>Pr</italic>(<italic>p<sub>j</sub></italic> = 1)
                    would be proportional (linearly) to the fraction of +1 elements in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, since <italic>p<sub>j</sub></italic> is determined
                    by a random subset, the consequences of a larger fraction of +1
                    elements is a combinatorial amplification. For example consider the case where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is comprised mostly of −1's with only very
                    few +1 elements. A subset of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> will typically have many more −1's than
                    +1's, as there are exponentially many more ways to choose
                    −1 elements than the +1 elements. We argue that this strong
                    dependence of the phenotypic element on the number of +1 elements in
                    the corresponding developmental matrix row is the source for the nonuniform

                <p>We next consider the entire phenotypic vector, rather than a single trait element

                    mapping a genotype to a phenotype, we use the same columns of <italic>D</italic>
                    (as defined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to construct the summed subset in each row. Let's
                    just assume that each trait element is independent which can be stated through
                    the following identity:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e026" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>k</italic> indexes the phenotypic dimension. Note
                    that the expected value of <italic>z<sub>j</sub></italic> is
                            <italic>E</italic>(<italic>z<sub>j</sub></italic>) = <italic>r</italic>/2
                    and from Equation 2 we get <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If all rows of <italic>D</italic> possess an equal number of
                    +1's and −1's we find <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000202.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for every phenotype. This generates a uniform distribution of
                    degeneracy levels (and no hidden phenotypes).</p>
                <p>Because <italic>z<sub>j</sub></italic> is sampled from a binomial distribution
                    the number of +1's in each row can diverge from
                    <italic>r</italic>/2, and consequently, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g005">Figure 5</xref>, bias the probability distribution
                    of phenotypes. Consider the case where several rows of the developmental matrix
                    have <italic>z<sub>j</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>r</italic>/2. The probability
                    of producing 0's in the phenotype elements that correspond to these
                    rows is very small (note again Equation 2 and the sigmoidal shape in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Consequently,
                    producing phenotypes with 0's in all these elements is extremely
                    unlikely (see Equation 3) and these phenotypes are expected to be hidden.</p>
                <p>This intuition can also help us to understand the similarity of high frequency
                    phenotypes and the patchiness of the visible phenotype space. Assume that
                            <italic>z<sub>j</sub></italic>≈<italic>r</italic>/2 only in the
                    first and third rows, and
                    <italic>z<sub>j</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>r</italic>/2 in all others. Since
                    the phenotypes are biased toward 1's in all elements apart from the
                    first and the third, all phenotypes of the form
                    [–,1,–,1,1,…,1] (where
                    ‘–’ denotes either 0 or 1) are likely to be highly
                    degenerate and will form a dense patch of high frequency phenotypes.</p>
                <p>We further confirm this intuition numerically (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000202.s004">Text S1</xref>).
                    We applied the mathematical formulation and drew a sample set of
                        <italic>z<sub>j</sub></italic>'s from a binomial distribution
                        <italic>B</italic>(<italic>r</italic>,0.5). We calculated the probability of
                    obtaining certain phenotypes and showed that the distribution of degeneracy
                    levels is comparable to that obtained with our model. We also demonstrated that
                    the degeneracy levels of neighboring phenotypes are strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000202.s004">Text

                <title>Multilayered Developmental Plans</title>
                <p>The model we have utilized employs a single layer architecture and might be
                    thought to limit the scope of possible regulatory schemes. Computationally this
                    is the case, as at least two-layers (input layer plus a hidden layer) are
                    required to produce a perceptron that is a universal Turing machine (or
                    universal function approximator), as proven for the Cybenko theorem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Cybenko1">[22]</xref>,
                    able to achieve linear separability of inputs as is required by, for example,
                    the XOR function. However, since we show that a single regularity layer
                    compresses the image of the genotypes in the phenotype space, introducing
                    additional layers only produces further canalization and strengthens our
                    findings. We quantify this effect by using an extended multilayered
                    developmental model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Models</xref>) and record the number of unique visible
                    phenotypes and the phenotype distribution obtained after each iteration.</p>
                <p>First we consider the simple, recurrent, or recursive model, where

                    for every <italic>t</italic>, and examine the effect of introducing up to 50
                    regulatory layers. For this recursive scheme, at each additional layer there is
                    a reduction in the number of visible phenotypes and an increase in canalization
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover,
                    the number of visible phenotype reaches an (extremely low) asymptotic value,
                    which is not influences by additional regulatory layers, suggesting that a
                    steady state has been reached.</p>

                            as a function of the number of regulatory layers. The regulatory
                            dimension, <italic>r</italic>, and the phenotypic dimension,
                            <italic>k</italic>, are both set to 14. For a single regulatory layer,
                            the visible phenotypes already constitute only 8.2% of the
                                2<sup>14</sup> potential phenotypes, in accordance with our results
                            for the basic model. Introducing additional recurrent layers
                            dramatically decreases the number of visible phenotypes (note the
                            logarithmic scale), reaching 0.06% (approximately 10
                            phenotypes) with 50 layers. Furthermore, if each regulatory layer
                            incorporates a different developmental plan, the reduction in the number
                            of visible phenotypes as a function of the number of layers is even more
                            extreme. (B) The distribution of the number of unique phenotypes that

                <p>In order to examine these findings in detail we allow the developmental process
                    to iterate indefinitely until a steady state is reached. This extended model is
                    also strictly comparable with the recurrent models introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Wagner1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Siegal1">[17]</xref>. As we consider the
                    entire set of possible initial genotypes (rather than a single, predefines,
                    initial phenotype), we apply a slightly more stringent condition for
                    ascertaining the steady state, and require that the set of unique, visible
                    phenotypes does not change (note that this condition also accommodates limit
                    cycle equilibria). Considering 10,000 different developmental plans, we find
                    that on average the number of visible phenotypes at steady state is only
                    10.3±7 (0.063% of all possible phenotypes), and that this
                    steady state is reached after 17.7±7 layers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g006">Figure 6B</xref> further illustrates the
                    distribution for the number of unique visible phenotypes at steady state.</p>
                <p>We now examine the behavior of a more general, developmental model, where each
                    regulatory layer can incorporate a different developmental plan. This is closer
                    to natural regulation where we observe multiple layers of post-transcriptional
                    control. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g006">Figure
                        6A</xref>, this model yields a more complete reduction in the number of
                    visible phenotypes (as a function of the number of layers). It is enough to note
                    that the ‘all zeros’ phenotype always maps onto itself, and
                    that each layer can map some fraction of the remaining visible phenotypes to
                    this zero-class. This establishes why this model is asymptotically destined to
                    reach a steady state with a single, ‘all zeros’, visible
                    phenotype. This raises an intriguing question as to the optimum number of
                    regulatory layers. Two or more layers offer greater computational power, but at
                    a cost of reduced phenotypic variability.</p>
                <p>Finally, we observe a change in the distribution of degeneracy levels as more
                    regulatory layers are introduced. The reduction in the number of visible
                    phenotypes is accompanied by an increase in the probability of highly degenerate
                    phenotypes, and by an overall increase in the extent of degeneracy in the system
                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000202.s001">Figure
                    S1</xref>). This abundance of highly canalized phenotypes further strengthens
                    the conclusions obtained for the original model.</p>

                <title>Developmental Plans with Variable Connectivity Density</title>
                <p>The fully connected model analyzed above represents, to some extent, a worst-case
                    scenario in terms of gene interactions, pleiotropy, and epistasis. Here, we
                    examine whether the regulatory bias observed in our model holds when the
                    regulatory plan is less dense, and how the density of the plan influences this
                    bias. There are two competing possibilities to be considered. On the one hand,
                    if the developmental matrix is very parse, there may be entries in the phenotype
                    vector that are never activated. This would further reduce the number of visible
                    phenotypes. On the other hand, for sparse matrices, each phenotypic element is
                    influenced by only a few genes (low epistatsis), making the contribution of each
                    gene to the state of the phenotypic elements higher. Changing one gene in the
                    genotype could change a corresponding element in the phenotype (inducing a
                    steeper gain function - see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g003">Figure
                        3B</xref>). In the extreme case of the unit matrix, every change in the
                    genotype induces a change in the phenotype. This would decrease the level of
                    neutrality (degeneracy) of the genotype-phenotype map and consequently produce
                    more visible phenotypes.</p>
                <p>We find that sparse matrices generate a smaller fraction of visible phenotypes
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). For
                    example, in comparison to the 8.2% visible phenotypes obtained for a
                    fully connected plan (<italic>c</italic> = 1),
                    only 3.4% of the phenotypes are visible for a matrix with
                    <italic>c</italic> = 0.25 and only
                    0.6% are visible for
                    <italic>c</italic> = 0.1 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Models</xref>). It also
                    appears that the maximum number of visible phenotypes (which is still only
                    8.7% of the total number of potential phenotypes) is produced for an
                    intermediate value of <italic>c</italic>≈0.85. This could be the outcome
                    of a trade-off between the two competing effects discussed above. We note,
                    however, that the influence of an increase in matrix density on the fraction of
                    visible phenotypes diminishes for <italic>c</italic>&gt;0.5.</p>

                <p>To disentangle the influence of a sparse matrix density on the fraction of
                    visible phenotypes derived from varying levels of gene interactions
                    (epistatsis), from the effect of reduced phenotypic activation, we control for
                    the number of potentially activated phenotypic elements under each plan. We
                    measure the number of variable phenotypic elements (traits),
                    <italic>ν</italic>, obtained for a range of values of <italic>c</italic>
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). A variable
                    trait is defined as a phenotypic elements that can be activated (i.e., assume a
                    value of 1) in at least one of the visible phenotypes produced by a given
                    developmental matrix. As expected, sparser plans result in a lower number of
                    variable traits. If only <italic>ν</italic> traits are variable, the

                    </italic>), and it is reasonable to measure the fraction of visible phenotypes
                    in relation to this lower limit. Examining the fraction of visible phenotypes
                    out of the <italic>achievble</italic> (2<italic>
                        <sup>ν</sup>

                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Sparser
                    matrices produce a higher fraction of visible phenotypes (reaching almost
                    80% on average for very sparse plans), owing to the higher marginal
                    contribution each gene makes in determining the state of a phenotypic element.
                    Thus lower epistasis in the sparse matrix allows for a greater per locus
                    contribution to the phenotype.</p>
                <p>We further confirm that the statistical properties of the visible phenotype
                    distribution still holds for sparse matrices. We first compare the distribution
                    of degeneracy levels obtained for varying values of <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000202.s002">Figure S2</xref>).
                    Although sparse matrices (e.g.,
                    <italic>c</italic> = 0.1) produce a more
                    variable distributions, a clear power-law distribution can already be observed
                    for matrices with <italic>c</italic> = 0.25 or
                    higher. The patchiness of the visible phenotypic space is also confirmed for
                    sparse matrices by examining the distribution of pairwise hamming distances
                    among randomly selected phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Sparse matrices induce an even more pronounced patchy
                    phenotypic space, largely as a result of a reduction in the number of visible
                    phenotypes these plans produce (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>

                </fig>
                <p>In summary, we find that reducing the level of regulatory interactions in the
                    developmental plan produces two competing effects. The first effect is to reduce
                    the number of visible phenotypes and increase the patchiness of the visible
                    phenotypic space. These are the result of an increase in inactivation for a
                    number of phenotypic elements. The second effect is an increase in the number of
                    visible phenotypes. This is a result of the higher marginal contribution of each
                    gene to determining the state of each associated phenotypic element. Both these
                    effects are prominent for sparse matrices, but become negligible for density
                    values in the range <italic>c</italic>&gt;0.5. This might suggest that the
                    phenotypic bias generated by the fully connected matrix remains relevant for
                    typical, empirically derived networks, for which density values below or close
                    to 0.5 have been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Lee1">[23]</xref>.</p>

                <p>Finally, we consider the effects of the developmental map on phylogenetic
                    regularities. Since we are focusing on the evolution of development bearing on
                    phenotypic diversity and disparity, we do not consider the evolution of the
                    structural genes, but only regulatory interactions. We assume in the following
                    treatment that developmental plans evolve incrementally and neutrally by
                    addition of new genetic regulatory elements into existing regulatory networks.
                    Consider, for example, an ancestral developmental plan that possesses
                            <italic>r<sub>a</sub></italic> transcription factors, controlling
                        <italic>k</italic> target genes. Descendant developmental plans acquire
                            <italic>r<sub>b</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>r<sub>a</sub></italic>
                    transcription factors (still controlling the same <italic>k</italic> genes),
                    where all descendant plans share an identical regulatory wiring for the
                    ancestral <italic>r<sub>a</sub></italic> transcription factors, and differ in
                    the wiring of the derived factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Following findings in the previous section, we focus only
                    on the most frequent phenotypes produced by each plan as evolutionarily
                    representative of the complete, visible phenotype set. By focusing on the most
                    frequent phenotypes, we are considering those phenotypes most likely to be
                    observed. We are interested in the phylogenetic distribution of phenotypes
                    generated by the evolutionary sequence of developmental plans. We observe that
                    the phenotypes comprising a single developmental plan, become more similar
                    throughout the evolutionary process, whereas disparity among members of
                    different plans increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g010">Figure
                        10A</xref>). This process relates to an increase in the regulatory dimension
                    of the genome, and hence illustrates how regulatory evolution promotes

                            plan, and the set of the most frequent visible phenotypes produced by
                            this plan represent species. The ancestral phyla is employing a

                            regulatory element with random connectivities preserving the ancestral
                            component of the developmental plan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This branching process
                            continues until we get the 1024 most recent phyla, each employing a

                            The tree is reconstructed by computing the pairwise Hamming distance
                            matrix between all phenotypes and applying a neighbor-joining
                            algorithms. Rectangular, triangular, and circular nodes represent
                            phenotypes from the ancestral phylum, intermediate phyla, and derived
                            phyla respectively. Phyla within each phylogenetic level are illustrated
                            with different colors. The small tree on the bottom left corner
                            illustrates the phylogenetic tree of different developmental plans
                            (using the same color coding as that used in the main tree). Phenotypes
                            (or ‘species’) of different phyla differ only in the
                            developmental plan and not in genotype, but the resulting tree
                            successfully clusters the members of each phyla. Furthermore, the
                            members of intermediate phyla are correctly clustered, spanning the same
                            phylogenetic space as their descendants. Members of the ancestral phylum
                            (represented by black rectangles) span similar regions to those covered

                <p>To illustrate the similarities and relationships among phenotypes, specifically
                    between current phenotypes and ancestral phenotypes, we perform a phylogenetic
                    analysis. We follow the evolutionary process described above (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g009">Figure 9</xref>), starting with an
                    ancestral group that embodies a developmental plan with
                    <italic>r</italic> = 4 and
                    <italic>k</italic> = 14. A first branching
                    event results in two intermediate groups, each with
                    <italic>r</italic> = 9 and
                    <italic>k</italic> = 14. A second branching
                    event results in four groups, each with
                    <italic>r</italic> = 14 and
                    <italic>k</italic> = 14. We consider a
                    collection of phenotypes comprising the most frequent visible phenotypes in the
                    most derived groups, the intermediate groups, and the ancestral group, and
                    reconstruct a phylogenetic tree relating these phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). This tree is exact as we
                    preserve the complete evolutionary history of each lineage. The resulting tree
                    not only clusters the derived groups correctly, but also demonstrates that
                    intermediate and ancestral groups span the same phenotypic space as their
                    descendants. Note, in particular, that phenotypes in the ancestral group cover
                    (though, more sparsely) most of the space covered by the derived groups. A
                    similar pattern can be observed by means of a principal components analysis of
                    the phenotypic set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000202-g010">Figure

            <p>In this paper we present a schematic model of development based on a plan resembling
                a cis-regulatory architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Davidson2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Wagner1">[15]</xref>, where transcription factors bind to promoters
                leading to the expression or inhibition of downstream, structural genes. The
                parsimonious structure of this model is able to reproduce important empirical
                regularities in the evolution of development, allowing us to exclude the need to
                construct unnecessarily complicated hypothesis. We find that regulatory mechanisms
                promote genetic epistasis in gene expression, leading a large fraction of phenotypic
                space to become concealed. This dramatically limits the number of available
                phenotypes. This finding suggests that the sparseness of morphological varieties in
                nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Lewontin1">[27]</xref> can be at least partially attributed to the
                constraining properties of genetic networks, particularly those networks regulating
                the activity of downstream targets of activators. This property of an abstract
                regulatory process has been discussed by Gould, when he writes that,
                “phenotypic' similarities <italic>arise instead as a constraint
                    based on common genesis from a source that imposes limitations or sets preferred
                    channels of change from within</italic>” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Gould1">[28]</xref>. This interpretation of
                convergence is to be distinguished from any reduction in phenotypic variation
                subsequent to development arising through stabilizing selection acting against the
                deleterious effects of perturbations of complex regulatory networks.</p>
            <p>This is in the statistical sense, a null model for development, ignoring important
                properties of dynamics, pattern formation and selective feedback. All of these
                processes play a significant role in the formation of the phenotype and yet all of
                them are neglected. This follows from the assumption that a powerful null model
                seeks to account for a large percentage of variation with a minimum of functional
                assumptions. Hence the rather abstract character of the model, and its inability to
                predict particular, empirical details of development.</p>

                <p>The distribution of phenotypic degeneracy levels recalls results from the
                    genotype/phenotype map induced by RNA secondary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Schuster1">[20]</xref>, where it has
                    been shown that frequencies of planar structures are highly nonuniform
                    (following a generalized form of Zipf's law) resulting in few common
                    structures and many rare ones. There are two important differences between
                    simple genotype/phenotype maps and our results. First, whereas the RNA
                    genotype/phenotype map is the outcome of physical interactions between base
                    pairs, the mapping presented in this paper is the result of a developmental
                    scheme, representing interactions among multiple transcripts. Second, for RNA
                    secondary structure, the space of potential shapes is considerably smaller than
                    the sequence space. RNA studies focus on the distribution of visible phenotypes
                    and on the organization of the visible phenotypic neutral networks. We consider
                    the size and structure of the space <italic>not</italic> covered by neutral
                    networks.</p>
                <p>The molecular study of developmental maps in multicellular lineages has tended to
                    focus on changes over a small number of generations, typified by studies of
                    homeotic mutants. Paleontologists have become interested in the
                    macroevolutionary implications of developmental evolution, in particular, the
                    production of features associated with higher taxonomic levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Valentine2">[11]</xref>.
                    The benchmark example of what we might call ‘developmental
                    macroevolution’ is the Cambrian radiation associated with a rapid
                    proliferation of highly disparate, multicellular animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Marshall1">[12]</xref>. The putative
                    causes of this radiation include the accumulation of atmospheric oxygen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Knoll1">[10]</xref>, a
                    snowball earth scenario <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Hoffman1">[29]</xref>, as well as a variety of putative
                    developmental innovations including the emergence of <italic>Hox</italic>
                    cluster of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Carroll1">[6]</xref>, and the co-opting of regulatory networks for
                    new structures and functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Erwin1">[30]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Whatever factors might have lead to the original ‘explosion’
                    of varieties, we are able to show with a suitable model for development, that
                    simple, low dimensional ancestral regulatory networks will tend to produce a
                    higher disparity among the set of most frequent phenotypes than is the case for,
                    derived, high-dimensional networks. This is because the ancestral programs are
                    less constrained by regulatory epistasis. Moreover, developmental evolution
                    generates anisotropic phenotypic variation, towards an increasingly clustered
                    occupancy of phenotypic subspaces. These results agree with prior studies
                    showing a tendency towards a clustering of phenotypes and a deceleration of
                    diversification in abstract morphospaces that arise through branching random
                    walks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Pie1">[13]</xref> at levels above individuals, or through random
                    rates of speciation and extinction imposed on a background rate of discrete
                    anagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Gavrilets1">[31]</xref>.</p>
                <p>It has been suggested that developmental plans constitute a mechanical
                    explanation and justification for phylogenetic grades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Davidson1">[7]</xref>. These results
                    support this hypothesis, as each developmental plan represents a conserved core
                    responsible for imposing a shared pattern of expression on a lineage of
                    organisms. Critically, these organisms can share the bulk of their genes and yet
                    remains significantly different when these genes are expressed through their
                    unique developmental programs. It remains to be determined why these programs
                    remain relatively uniform through time. One possibility is that changes to these
                    programs are more deleterious than changes to the non-regulatory quotient of the
                    genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Davidson1">[7]</xref>. Another possibility, is that since selection acts
                    only indirectly on the genetic program but directly on the traits that it
                    generates, the selective pressure on the plan is weak, and when coupled to the
                    canalizing effects of the plan, severely decelerates the evolutionary process.
                    In an important sense, it is this property of variation in structural genes
                    compared to invariance of the developmental plan that allows for the emergence
                    of high level grades. If this constraint is relaxed, phenotypes are more
                    uniformly distributed, making the concept of, for example, phyla an arbitrarily
                    placed epiphenomenon of phylogenetic trees.</p>

                <title>Developmental Macroevolution</title>
                <p>The role of development in generating, or constraining, biotic diversity has been
                    one of the most active debates in evolutionary biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Amundson1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000202-Raff1">[34]</xref>. The
                    roots of this debate go back to the study of homologies and questions over
                    physico-chemical verses genetically-selected rules of growth. One merit of
                    simple developmental models is to illustrate how these two positions reflect
                    necessary, complementary properties of generic developmental programs.
                    Regulatory epistasis introduces non-linearities into development, allowing
                    similar genotypes to generate significant divergence among phenotypes, whereas
                    degeneracy tends to contract the occupancy of morphospace and bias phenotypic
                    samples. Of great interest is how these structural properties of development
                    have themselves been modified over the course of evolutionary time, potentially
                    changing the tempo and mode of the evolutionary process. One of the paradoxical
                    implications of this study has been to show how innovations in development
                    (arising through increasing regulatory dimensions) that lead to an increase in
                    the volume of accessible phenotypes, can lead to a reduction in selective
                    variance (through increasing regulatory epistasis), so whereas the potential for
                    novel phenotypes increases, the fraction of space these phenotypes occupies
                    tends to contract. Hence the evolutionary process moves from a
                    macro-configuration, sampling distant regions of space sparsely, to a micro
                    configuration, sampling local regions of space at high resolution. This is
                    analogous to an annealing process, whereby as an optimization process proceeds,
                    the solutions become more frequent and more densely localized around the
                    putative solution points.</p>

                    <p>(A) A loglog plot of the distribution of degeneracy levels among visible
                        phenotypes as obtained by the numerical analysis. Each point denotes the
                        expected number of developmental plans in which the ‘half
                        ones’ phenotype obtains a certain degeneracy level, and is
                        averaged over 1,000,000 different plans. From symmetry considerations, this
                        distribution reflects the expected distribution of degeneracy levels among
                        all visible phenotypes in a randomly generated developmental plan. Note that
                        the point associated with degeneracy level 0 (i.e., a hidden phenotype) is
                        not included. (B) The degeneracy level of the ‘almost half
                        ones’ phenotype, as a function of the degeneracy level of the
                        ‘half ones’ phenotype in the same plan, demonstrating
                        the high correlation between the degeneracy levels of neighboring
                        phenotypes. For convenience, we draw the points associated with only 1,000
                        plans.</p>
