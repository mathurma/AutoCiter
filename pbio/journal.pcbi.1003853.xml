<abstract>
<p>High-throughput bisulfite sequencing technologies have provided a comprehensive and well-fitted way to investigate DNA methylation at single-base resolution. However, there are substantial bioinformatic challenges to distinguish precisely methylcytosines from unconverted cytosines based on bisulfite sequencing data. The challenges arise, at least in part, from cell heterozygosis caused by multicellular sequencing and the still limited number of statistical methods that are available for methylcytosine calling based on bisulfite sequencing data. Here, we present an algorithm, termed Bycom, a new Bayesian model that can perform methylcytosine calling with high accuracy. Bycom considers cell heterozygosis along with sequencing errors and bisulfite conversion efficiency to improve calling accuracy. Bycom performance was compared with the performance of Lister, the method most widely used to identify methylcytosines from bisulfite sequencing data. The results showed that the performance of Bycom was better than that of Lister for data with high methylation levels. Bycom also showed higher sensitivity and specificity for low methylation level samples (&lt;1%) than Lister. A validation experiment based on reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data suggested that Bycom had a false positive rate of about 4% while maintaining an accuracy of close to 94%. This study demonstrated that Bycom had a low false calling rate at any methylation level and accurate methylcytosine calling at high methylation levels. Bycom will contribute significantly to studies aimed at recalibrating the methylation level of genomic regions based on the presence of methylcytosines.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>High-throughput bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) has advanced tremendously the study of DNA methylation and the determination of methylcytosines at single-base resolution. In BS-seq data analysis, sequencing errors, incomplete bisulfite conversion, and cell heterozygosis affect the accuracy of methylcytosine detection in quite a major way. Simple filtering methods using predefined thresholds have proved to have extremely low efficiency. The commonly used Lister uses binomial distribution to overcome the impacts of non-conversion rate and sequencing errors, but the impact of the cell heterozygosis is not considered. Here, we present Bycom, a novel algorithm based on the Bayesian inference model. To improve the accuracy of methylcytosine calling, Bycom considers sequencing errors, non-conversion rate, and cell heterozygosis integratively to identify methylcytosines from BS-seq data. We evaluated the performance of Bycom using different kinds of BS-seq data. Our results demonstrated that Bycom identified methylcytosines more accurately than Lister, especially in BS-seq data with extremely low genome-wide methylation levels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in the regulation of gene expression and plays critical roles in cellular processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Feinberg1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Liu1">[5]</xref>. Abnormalities in DNA methylation contribute to the dysregulation of gene expression and have been reported to be associated with tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Heard1">[6]</xref> and imprinting disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Li1">[7]</xref>. DNA methylation occurs on the cytosine residues in DNA and the accurate identification of methylated cytosines (methylcytosines) is essential for studying variance in methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Smallwood1">[8]</xref>. Advances in high-throughput bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Lister1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Zhong1">[11]</xref> such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), provide comprehensive and well-fitted ways to identify methylcytosines at single-base resolution. However, the large data sets generated by BS-seq pose data processing challenges for methylcytosine calling.</p>
<p>Typically, the first step of methylation analysis with BS-seq data is to map the bisulfite-converted reads to a reference genome using software such as SOAP and BSMAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Krueger1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Li2">[14]</xref>. Methylcytosines can then be identified from the reads aligned to the cytosines on the reference genome. However, besides sequencing errors, methylcytosine calling is affected by incomplete bisulfite conversion, which corresponds to the ratio of unmethylated cytosines that were not converted to thymines by the bisulfite treatment. Additionally, cell heterozygosis caused by multicellular sequencing can also influence the precision of methylcytosine detection because the methylation status of the same cytosine site in different cell is probably inconsistent owing to the coexistence of methylation and demethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Wu1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Jia1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the factors mentioned above, the false-positive rate for methylcytosines detected by simple filtering using a predefine threshold that the methylation level should be above zero, has been reported to be extremely high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Xiang1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Stevens1">[21]</xref>. In recent years, the methylation ascertainment method applied by Lister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Lister1">[9]</xref>, which is widely used in the methylation analysis software such as Bismark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Krueger2">[22]</xref> and Bisulfighter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Saito1">[23]</xref>, has been employed to determine the methylcytosines from BS-seq data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Liu1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Li3">[24]</xref> and has been shown to have a much lower false positive rate than the simple filtering method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Gao1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Lyko1">[26]</xref>. We termed the method as “Lister” hereafter. Although Lister uses binomial distribution to overcome the impacts of false-positive rate (sum of non-conversion rate and sequencing errors) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Li3">[24]</xref>, it does not consider the impact of methylation heterozygosis caused by cell heterozygosis. Besides, as amounts of cytosines, whose methylation level is low, are difficult to be distinguished from unmethylated sites, the methylation status determined by the binomial test is not reliable for samples with extremely low genome-wide methylation levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Liu1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we present a novel algorithm, Bycom that can take into account sequencing errors, non-conversion rate, and cell heterozygosis which is initially introduced as the factors to identify precisely the methylcytosines from BS-seq data. Bycom is based on the Bayesian inference model, which is not limited to certain data distribution and has been used successfully for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling in next-generation sequencing data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Li4">[27]</xref>. Bayesian inference model has also been successfully applied to methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-based studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Down1">[28]</xref>. We evaluated the performance of Bycom on simulated BS-seq data, publicly available BS-Seq data, and RRBS data and demonstrated that Bycom can identify methylcytosines more precisely than Lister. This methodology of Bycom has been packaged and available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/bycom" xlink:type="simple">https://sourceforge.net/projects/bycom</ext-link>, which is written in PERL and designed for Linux 64 platform.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The Bycom procedures used to identify methylcytosines from high-throughput BS-seq data are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g001">Figure 1</xref>. First, the raw reads generated by BS-seq were filtered using a Q20 cut-off to exclude low quality reads whose average ASCII quality values were less than the char “T” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, the filtered reads were aligned to a reference genome sequence using mapping software BSMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In this step, cytosine sites with quality values less than Q20, which indicated sequencing errors, were further excluded. Third, after filtering, the base distribution in a 1000-bp window was used to calculate the average methylation level in the region covered by the window <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Li3">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Down1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Eckhardt1">[29]</xref>. Based on the calculated average methylation level, a least square method was used to evaluate the methylation heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Using the base distribution and methylation heterozygosity information, the posterior probability of the nucleotide at the reference cytosine was calculated using a Bayesian inference formula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The cytosines that have the highest posterior probabilities (methylated probability) were selected as candidate methylcytosines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Finally, methylcytosines were determined from the candidate methylcytosines using an iterated threshold method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Meanwhile, Lister utilizes the mapping results of BSMAP to conduct the binary classification of mCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Lister1">[9]</xref>.</p>

<title>Performance of Bycom on simulated data</title>
<p>The performance of Bycom was evaluated and compared with Lister based on simulated data that were generated from chromosome 10 of the human reference genome sequence (hg18, UCSC) using the bisulfite sequencing simulator for next-generation sequencing BSSim (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://122.228.158.106/BSSim" xlink:type="simple">http://122.228.158.106/BSSim</ext-link>). Six factors that may affect the identification of methylcytosines were considered in the simulation process, namely, total methylation level of the sequenced sample, sequencing depth, bisulfite conversion rate, high quality value ratio, mismatch number, and SNP frequency. With all parameters set to their default values, we found that Bycom had a higher overall accuracy than Lister as shown by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003853.g002" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Next, we investigated the impact of each single factor on the performance of Bycom. For the total methylation level, we assumed that the number of methylcytosines in the simulated data increased steadily as the total methylation level was increased. When the methylation levels were extremely low (0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8%), the number of methylcytosines called rose slightly and the false negative rate remained stable at 2% for Bycom and at 15% for Lister. At low methylation levels (2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%), the number of methylcytosines called by the two methods increased and the false negative rate for Bycom decreased slightly to 0.3% compared with 14% for Lister. At the high methylation levels (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%), the number of true positive sites increased, while the false negative rates for both Bycom and Lister remained very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>For the impact of sequencing depth, the total number of methylcytosines called by Bycom increased when the read depth incrementally changed from 5× to 25×. The highest number of methylcytosines called was when the depth was 25×; thereafter, the number of calls remained relatively constant for depths &gt;25× (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the total number of methylcytosines called by Lister increased when the read depth went up from 5× to 55× after which the number of calls steadily decreased. The false negative rates for both Bycom and Lister reduced when the higher read depths were introduced and, in all cases, the false positive rates for Lister were higher than the false positive rates for Bycom.</p>
<p>The bisulfite conversion rate can affect the methylation level of the cytosines in a genome sequence; therefore, we evaluated the performance of Bycom using different values for this parameter. The number of methylcytosines called by Bycom and Lister remained constant when the non-conversion rate was &lt;1%. When the non-conversion rate was &gt;1%, the total number of methylcytosines called by Bycom increased slightly and the false negative decrease steadily; conversely, the total number of methylcytosines called by Lister increased sharply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The other three factors, high quality value ratio (Q20 cut-off), mismatch number, and SNP frequency made only small contributions to either the number of methylcytosines called or the false positive rate, both of which remained nearly constant. Here, for the method Lister, the influence of sequencing errors calculated by quality value were reduced as the quality cut-off went up, while for Bycom, the influence was still kept at a relatively low level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003853.s001">Figure S1B &amp; S1D</xref>). Overall, compared with the performance of Lister, Bycom generated more true positive sites and fewer false positive sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003853.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Performance of Bycom on publicly available BS-seq data with known methylcytosines</title>
<p>To further assess the ability of Bycom to identify methylcytosines, whole-genome BS-seq data of YH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Li3">[24]</xref>, silkworm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Xiang1">[19]</xref> and the ascomycetes <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Liu1">[5]</xref> were used as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Li3">[24]</xref>. The YH BS-seq data, generated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of an Asian individual, had a high methylation level of 68.4% at CpG sites and &lt;0.2% at non-CpGs sites with an overall coverage of 12.3-fold per strand. 32 methylated CpGs and 18 non-methylated CGs were selected randomly and validated by bisulfite Sanger sequencing. Because the depth of 11 validated cytosines was lower than the threshold (lowest depth was 4-fold) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Li3">[24]</xref>, only 24 methylated CpGs and 15 non-methylated CGs gave eligible validated results. The methylcytosine calling results showed that the accuracy for Bycom was 71.79% compared with the 66.67% accuracy for Lister, and both methods made no false calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>We also evaluated the performance of Bycom on a species that had a low methylation level. The BS-seq data of silkworm had overall methylation levels of 0.67% at CG, 0.21% at CHG, and 0.24% at CHH sites (where H is A, C, or T) with an average depth of 7.4-fold per strand. In the BS-seq silkworm data, 598 methylcytosines and 311 cytosines were validated (≥4×) among which 24 methylated and 101 non-methylated sites were verified by bisulfite Sanger sequencing while the others were confirmed using bisulfite-PCR followed by 454 sequencing. The distribution of the validated sites called by Bycom and Lister is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. For bisulfite Sanger sequencing, Bycom had 93.6% accuracy with a false positive rate of 0.99%, while Lister exhibited 83.2% accuracy with a false positive rate of 15.84%. For 454 sequencing, the Bycom and Lister accuracies were the same at 82.53% with false positive rates of 10.48% for Bycom and 13.81% for Lister (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we evaluated the performance of Bycom on the BS-seq data of <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, which had been reported to have a negligible level of methylation with 4-fold overall depth per strand. All the methylcytosines called by Lister on this data were regarded as false positives (≥4×). An overlapping strategy was applied between the cytosines detected by Bycom and by Lister. The results indicated that the false positive rate for Lister was at least three times the false positive rate for Bycom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003853-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Further, sites that were selected randomly from the methylcytosines called by Lister and verified by Sanger sequencing as non-methylated cytosines were not called by Bycom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we splited the validated sites of YH, silkworm and <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> into CpG and CpH (CpA, CpC, and CpT dinucleotides) context. The strategy was also performed on the validated results of Bycom and Lister in these samples. We found that true positive sites (mC) were all in CpG context and the sites in CpH context were all false positive. The results also indicated that Bycom was more precise on the detection of mCpH than Lister (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003853.s003">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Detecting methylcytosines accurately from high-throughput sequencing data is an essential step to calculate the methylation level of genomes at single-base resolution. In this study, we presented a novel computational strategy, Bycom, for identifying precisely methylcytosines from BS-seq data using the Bayes inference model. Bycom not only considers the impacts of sequencing errors and non-conversion rate, both of which are treated as the false-positive rate in the Lister method, but also introduces cell heterozygosis to identify methylcytosines in an unbiased manner.</p>
<p>The results on the simulated data showed that the non-conversion rate and total methylation level significantly affected the accuracy of the Bycom and Lister methods, while sequencing errors had limited influence after the relatively stringent quality filtration of the data. Additionally, the accuracy of methylcytosine calling was better with Bycom than with Lister. The results on the public data indicated that the false positive rate of Lister was higher than the false positive rate of Bycom in the genome-wide samples with low methylation levels. Although The validation sites of public data in CpH context were all detected as false positive sites, Bycom had a better performance on the classification of mCpH than Lister. Furthermore, the validation results on the T29 RRBS data showed that Bycom detected the vast majority of methylcytosines and maintained the false calling rate at a low level. The performance of Bycom on the public data with different genome-wide methylation levels revealed that Bycom had no bias on data with high or low methylation levels. Moreover, to further verify the accuracy of our method, we compared the accuracy of Bycom with the methylation analysis tools, Bismark and Bisulfighter, which could also be used to call methylcytosines. The results of simulated data and public data both showed that Bycom behaved better than Bismark and Bisulfighter.</p>
<p>However, we noticed that variances of the methylation level on single cytosines between the BS-seq data and the Sanger/454 sequencing data likely led to false/missing calls by both Bycom and Lister. Although the methylcytosines were still detected by Bycom, this finding suggested that the accuracy might improve further if the methylation level of the base was recalibrated depending on mass validated sequencing data. In future work, we aim to refine the model with well-recalibrated sequencing data. Besides, other functions, such as differentially methylated regions (DMRs) detection will be added in future, which will be great facilitated by the precise methylated cytosines calling. In conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate that Bycom is an effective statistical framework that is capable of identifying methylcytosines and will be very useful for genome-wide investigations of DNA methylation.</p>

<p>Total genomic DNA was extracted from the T29 cell line and converted by sodium bisulfite following an established protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003853-Grunau1">[31]</xref>. Seven batches of regions were selected randomly and amplified with nested RT-PCR primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003853.s007">Table S5</xref>). The amplified products were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA). The validation results are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003853.s005">Table S3</xref>.</p>
