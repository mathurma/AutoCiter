			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Colon cancer accounts for more than 10% of all cancer deaths annually. Our genetic evidence from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and previous in vitro studies of mammalian <italic>Atonal homolog 1</italic> (<italic>Atoh1</italic>, also called <italic>Math1</italic> or <italic>Hath1</italic>) suggest an anti-oncogenic function for the Atonal group of proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. We asked whether mouse <italic>Atoh1</italic> and human <italic>ATOH1</italic> act as tumor suppressor genes in vivo. Genetic knockouts in mouse and molecular analyses in the mouse and in human cancer cell lines support a tumor suppressor function for <italic>ATOH1. ATOH1</italic> antagonizes tumor formation and growth by regulating proliferation and apoptosis, likely via activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway. Furthermore, colorectal cancer and Merkel cell carcinoma patients show genetic and epigenetic <italic>ATOH1</italic> loss-of-function mutations. Our data indicate that <italic>ATOH1</italic> may be an early target for oncogenic mutations in tissues where it instructs cellular differentiation.</p>

          <p>Like most cancers, colon cancer displays a loss of differentiation, and the stronger this property, the more aggressive the cancer. This suggests that the loss of the capacity to differentiate may be a critical and possibly early event during the formation of these tumors. The key gene instructing secretory cell fate differentiation in the epithelium of the colon, namely <italic>Atonal homolog 1</italic> (<italic>ATOH1</italic>), is highly conserved in flies, mice, and humans. We asked whether <italic>ATOH1</italic> could be a pivotal factor in causing colon cancer in mice and humans. Our studies show that colon-specific loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> in mice is sufficient to trigger colon cancer and that the majority of human colon cancers also have an inactivated <italic>ATOH1</italic>. Reactivating <italic>ATOH1</italic> in cultured human colon cancer cells causes these cells to stop dividing and to commit suicide. Since reactivation of this epigenetically silenced gene can be achieved using small chemical compounds, studying how <italic>ATOH1</italic> acts may offer therapeutic avenues in the future.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Atonal (Ato) proneural transcription factors form a highly conserved group of key developmental regulators in multiple neural and neuroendocrine tissues. The mammalian <italic>Ato</italic> (CG7508) ortholog, <italic>ATOH1</italic> (Ensembl accession number: ENSG00000172238), is essential for cell fate commitment of mechanoreceptive Merkel cells in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b001">1</xref>] and the secretory goblet, Paneth, and enteroendocrine cells in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b003">3</xref>] in addition to multiple neuronal lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b005">5</xref>]. The functional conservation between the fly and mammalian proteins is underscored by the fact that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila ato</named-content> can fully rescue the <italic>Atoh1</italic> (Ensembl: ENSMUSG00000073043) null mutant mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b006">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Genetic analyses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b007">7</xref>] suggest that <italic>ato</italic> regulates the formation and progression of tumors in fly retina, where it acts as a master regulator of cell fate specification. In mammals, two aggressive human cancers derive from tissues where ATOH1 instructs cell fate commitment, namely Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). MCC is a rare, but very aggressive, neuroendocrine cancer of the skin with approximately 40% mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b008">8</xref>]. CRC is a highly prevalent cancer with high mortality (36%) representing 11% of all cancer deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b009">9</xref>]. Recent studies in colon cancer cell lines suggest that ATOH1 can inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b010">10</xref>]. If the anti-oncogenic function of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila ato</named-content> is conserved in its mammalian counterparts, one would predict that the loss and gain of function of <italic>ATOH1</italic> would enhance and suppress tumor formation, respectively, in MCC and CRC models. In addition, the ATOH1 should be subject to loss-of-function mutations in a significant number of human cancer patients.</p>
      <p>We tested this prediction in two different mouse models for colon cancer, as well as human MCC and CRC cell lines. In addition, we examined the status of the ATOH1 locus in primary tumor samples from human MCC and CRC patients. Our data show that loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> strongly enhances the formation and progression of tumors in mice and human cell lines. Conversely, gain of <italic>ATOH1</italic> function strongly inhibits the oncogenic phenotypes in human cell lines. Furthermore, we find genetic and epigenetic loss-of-function mutations with very high frequency in primary human tumors derived from <italic>ATOH1</italic>-dependent tissues and provide biochemical insight into how these epigenetic mutations may arise. Finally, we describe a highly conserved anti-oncogenic molecular signaling pathway that links <italic>ATOH1</italic> activity to the stress sensor Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway mediated via cell type–specific differential co-option of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).

        <title>Loss of <italic>Atoh1</italic> Promotes Tumor Formation in Two Colorectal Cancer Mouse Models</title>
        <p>In the mouse, Atoh1 is a master regulator of secretory cell fate commitment in the intestinal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b011">11</xref>]. To investigate whether Atoh1 plays a role in intestinal tumors, we analyzed the function of the mammalian <italic>ato</italic> homolog, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, in colon tumorigenesis. We assessed the tumor susceptibility of mice with an intestine-specific deletion of <italic>Atoh1</italic> (<italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b003">3</xref>] in two different established mouse models of CRC.</p>
        <p>We first treated <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> mice with azoxymethane (AOM), a chemical carcinogen that preferentially induces colon tumors. We found a significant enhancement in polyp formation in the large intestines of <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> compared to wild-type littermate mice, characterized by increased incidence (33% [4/12] vs. 100% [8/8], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), multiplicity (0.75 vs. 10.3 polyps/colon, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0008; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), and size (2.1 vs. 4.1 mm/polyp, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g001">Figure 1</xref>E) when examined under the dissecting microscope. Histological analysis of colons from AOM-treated <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> mice confirmed these findings and showed a range of histological phenotypes, from severely hyperplastic mucosa with embedded multifocal adenomas, to large, highly dysplastic adenomas, with one animal having invasive adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g002">2</xref>A′, and 2A′′). In contrast, histological examination of AOM-treated <italic>Atoh1<sup>wt</sup></italic> littermates showed none with adenomatous changes; with all polyp-like structures shown to be gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g002">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg001">S1</xref>).

We therefore examined proliferation and apoptosis in the “preneoplastic” normal-appearing epithelium within the colons of AOM-treated <italic>Atoh1<sup>wt</sup></italic> and <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> mice.

        <p>We extended our tumor analysis with an independent genetic mouse model for CRC by crossing <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> mice to <italic>APC<sup>min</sup></italic> mice (APC: ENSMUSG00000005871), in which Wnt signaling is constitutively activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b013">13</xref>]. <italic>APC<sup>min</sup></italic> mice develop spontaneous adenomas primarily in the small intestine, with only occasional polyps in the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b014">14</xref>].

Comparing the large intestines of <italic>APC<sup>min</sup>; Atoh1<sup>wt</sup></italic> mice to <italic>APC<sup>min</sup>; Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> littermates at 16 wk, we find significantly more polyps in the colons of double-mutant mice, characterized by increased incidence (52% [14/27] vs. 100% [10/10], <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), multiplicity (1.1 vs. 12.3 polyps/colon, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), and size (3.3 vs. 4.3 mm/colon, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g001">Figure 1</xref>F).

        <p>In summary, thus far, loss-of-function analysis of <italic>Atoh1</italic> in two mouse models of colon tumorigenesis supports a role for <italic>Atoh1</italic> as a key switch in tumor formation and progression. This role appears to be mediated by increased cell proliferation in the absence of <italic>Atoh1</italic>. Importantly, the mouse tumors lack the secretory cell types that depend on <italic>Atoh1</italic> for their formation. Thus, the role of <italic>Atoh1</italic> in tumor formation is likely linked to its function as a master regulator of differentiation.</p>

        <title>Loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> Expression in Primary Human CRC and MCC Tumors</title>
        <p>Given the remarkable evolutionary conservation of <italic>ato</italic>/<italic>Atoh1</italic> function in cancer development, we decided to analyze whether loss of the human ortholog, <italic>ATOH1</italic>, might be selected for during malignant transformation in human cancer. To this end, we investigated the role of <italic>ATOH1</italic> in CRC and MCC. In vitro overexpression experiments in CRC cell lines suggest that <italic>ATOH1</italic> gain of function decreases the population growth potential of CRC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b010">10</xref>]. Similarly, expression analysis in MCC cell lines suggests an inverse correlation between ATOH1 levels and the population growth of MCC cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg004">S4</xref>C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b016">16</xref>]. These observations hint at a potential role for ATOH1 in these cancers.</p>
        <p>To test this possibility in vivo in primary human tumors, we began by asking whether the expression of <italic>ATOH1</italic> is down-regulated in primary tumor samples from 42 CRC and four MCC patients. As MCC is a very rare cancer, only four samples were available for analysis. Seventy percent of the CRC samples show a significant decrease of <italic>ATOH1</italic> mRNA expression compared to tissue-matched colon samples from normal controls as analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), suggesting that loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression is a highly common feature of CRC oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figures 3</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg004">S4</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>ATOH1</italic> mRNA levels are significantly lower in adenocarcinoma samples compared to adenomas (<italic>t-</italic>test: <italic>p</italic> = 0.017), indicating progressive loss of ATOH1 expression levels with increasing tumor severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Similarly, in MCC, the two samples with lower <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression levels were derived from the two patients showing metastases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg004">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

        <title>CRC and MCC Patients Show Deletions in the <italic>ATOH1</italic> Locus</title>
        <p>One mechanism to explain loss of gene expression during oncogenesis is the deletion of the locus, which we tested for using quantitative PCR on genomic DNA in all 46 patient samples, one MCC cell line (MCC14.2), and one CRC cell line (Ht29). At least one deletion in the locus was detected in 57% of the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">3</xref>F). A second primer set yielded similar results (49% deletion rate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). One allele was also deleted in both Ht29 and MCC14.2. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b017">17</xref>] on three samples did not show a deviation of the clones flanking the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg005">Figures S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg006">S6</xref>), indicating that the deletions observed in patients are likely to be <italic>ATOH1</italic>-specific microdeletions. When only one copy is deleted, complete loss of gene function could be achieved by point mutations in the remaining allele. Sequencing of the <italic>ATOH1</italic> open reading frame of 24 samples, however, did not reveal any mutations in any of the samples (unpublished data). Together with the loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> mRNA expression in patients, these results suggest that an epigenetic silencing mechanism may be involved—a possibility we tested in further detail.</p>

        <title>The <italic>ATOH1</italic> Locus Is Methylated in CRC and MCC Patients</title>
        <p>To address a putative epigenetic transcriptional silencing mechanism, we began by asking whether transcription could, in principle, be initiated from the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus in cancer cells. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila ato</named-content> and mouse <italic>Atoh1</italic> are both known to be autoregulatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b019">19</xref>]. This provides the opportunity to test whether transcription could be activated from the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus by ATOH1 itself in normal versus cancer cells. We took advantage of expressing the mouse ortholog in human cells to distinguish the expression of endogenous <italic>ATOH1</italic> from that of <italic>Atoh1</italic>. For the tests in human cancer cell lines, we used the MCC14.2 cell line, which is derived from MCC and has strongly reduced expression of <italic>ATOH1</italic>. Surprisingly, <italic>Atoh1</italic> overexpression failed to activate endogenous human <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression in the MCC14.2 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), despite the virtually complete conservation of the two proteins. This may be due to a key difference between the two proteins, or to a possible disruption of the autoregulatory loop during oncogenesis. To test whether Atoh1 can activate <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression in normal noncancerous skin cells, we transduced normal human primary keratinocytes with an Atoh1 expression vector and tested the expression of endogenous <italic>ATOH1</italic> 40 h after lentiviral transduction. In contrast to the cancer cell lines, endogenous <italic>ATOH1</italic> is up-regulated 38-fold by Atoh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). This indicates that the expressability of the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus is inhibited during oncogenesis.</p>
        <p>Genomic database searches show that all known <italic>ATOH1</italic> orthologs, from human to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, reside in a CpG island covering at least the promoter and the transcription start site, suggesting that CpG methylation may be a mechanism of <italic>ATOH1</italic> loss of function. We therefore assayed all patient samples and both cell lines for <italic>ATOH1</italic> methylation using three independent assays: pull-down of methylated DNA, methylation-sensitive restriction digest, and methylation-specific PCR for bisulfite DNA modification. We found that up to 81% of the patients, as well as both cell lines, show methylation of the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus in both the coding sequence and the promoter sequences directly upstream of the ATG. In contrast, none of the control samples show <italic>ATOH1</italic> methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figures 3</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">3</xref>F, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg007">S7</xref>A–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg007">S7</xref>C). This suggests that methylation is likely causal to the transcriptional silencing of the locus during oncogenesis as this is accompanied by lower <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression. In a few cases, however, the correlation was not observed. In two cases (samples 27 and 30), this may be due to the presence of a putative duplication, which is yet to be methylated. Alternatively, but not exclusively, it may be due to heterogeneity of the degree of methylation in different cells comprising the tumor samples analyzed. To provide evidence that methylation silences the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus, we inhibited DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) with 5-azadeoxycytidine in the Ht29 cell line. This results in an approximately 8-fold increase in <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). Thus, the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus is methylated in cancer patients and derived cell lines, and this methylation can be reversed, resulting in the transcriptional reactivation of the locus. The autoregulatory function of <italic>ATOH1</italic> combined with the methylation of its regulatory sequences might hint to the involvement of <italic>ATOH1</italic> in the silencing of its own promoter. To gain some insight into whether this may indeed be the case, we asked whether Atoh1 can physically interact with Dnmt proteins. We tested the binding of Atoh1 to Dnmt1 (ENSG00000130816), Dnmt3a (ENSG00000119772), and Dnmt3b (ENSG00000088305) using GST pull-down assays. We find that Atoh1 binds to all three Dnmts. This is further supported by the ability of GST-Atoh1 to pull down DNA methyltransferase activity from nuclear extracts, similar to the positive control (EED: embryonic ectoderm development, ENSG00000074266) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b020">20</xref>]. Focusing on Dnmt1, the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, we confirmed this observation using coimmunoprecipitation experiments in 293T cells transfected with HA-tagged Atoh1. Lastly, mapping experiments identified several regions of Dnmt1 as mediating the association with Atoh1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg008">Figure S8</xref>A–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg008">S8</xref>D).</p>
        <p>In summary, deletions and epigenetic silencing via methylation combine to cause loss-of-function mutations of the human <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus in primary human cancers. Together with loss-of-function evidence in five independent cancer models in human cells, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mouse, these data strongly support a role for the Ato/ATOH1 transcription factors as key modulators of oncogenic transformation.</p>

Gain- and loss-of-function analyses point to <italic>Atoh1</italic>-dependent regulation of proliferation in mouse colon tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g002">Figures 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg003">S3</xref>D–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg003">S3</xref>F). Analysis of the role of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila ato</named-content> in fly retinal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b007">7</xref>] shows that this function is mediated by the JNK signaling pathway. We hypothesized that the Ato-JNK-p21 pathway may mediate the tumorigenic phenotype in our mouse models of CRC as well. If loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> were indeed an initiating event in tumor formation, we reasoned that the effects of Atoh1 function would have to be detectable in preneoplastic tissue as this is where oncogenesis begins. We therefore first examined the expression levels of <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (p21, ENSG00000124762), <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> (p27, ENSG00000111276), and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> (p57, ENSG00000129757) and the JNK target <italic>cJun</italic> (ENSG00000177606) in colon crypts isolated from <italic>Atoh1<sup>wt</sup></italic> and <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). We observe a 6.8-fold reduction in <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression and an approximately 2.8-fold reduction in expression of all three <italic>Cdkn1</italic> isoforms in colon crypts from <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> mice. We also observe a similar reduction in <italic>cJun</italic> mRNA levels. We further examined the Ato-JNK-Cdkn1 pathway by immunoblotting proteins from colon polyps and normal-appearing colon tissue from <italic>APC<sup>min/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Atoh1<sup>wt</sup></italic> and <italic>APC<sup>min/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> mice. Colon polyps show higher levels of cJun and p21<sup>waf</sup> protein compared to normal colonic tissue. Importantly, however, we find a reduction in cJun levels in <italic>APC<sup>min/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> polyps compared to <italic>APC<sup>min/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Atoh1<sup>wt</sup></italic> polyps, consistent with the mRNA analysis showing less <italic>cJun</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Importantly, we find a reduction in p27 protein and a trend toward less p21 in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-mutant colon tissues and polyps, consistent with our analysis of mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). We also find a specific reduction in pJNK1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) in <italic>APC<sup>min/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Atoh1<sup>wt</sup></italic> versus <italic>APC<sup>min/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> tissues, in agreement with earlier reports that JNK1 (MAPK8: ENSG00000107643) may have anti-oncogenic activity in the mouse intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b021">21</xref>], whereas JNK2 (MAPK9: ENSG00000050748) deficiency enhances tumorigenesis in other epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b022">22</xref>]. Finally, we examined the pattern of JNK activation in the colon of <italic>Atoh1<sup>wt</sup></italic> and <italic>Atoh1<sup>Δintestine</sup></italic> mice, and observe identical numbers of pJNK1/2-positive cells in Atoh1-null compared to control crypts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg009">Figure S9</xref>). Together with western blot analysis demonstrating selective reduction in pJNK1, but not pJNK2, our data suggest that the level of pJNK1 in individual crypt cells is decreased upon loss of Atoh1. These data are consistent with a preneoplastic function of Atoh1 in regulating proliferation, by a JNK-dependent induction of cell cycle inhibitors.</p>

        <p>Next we asked whether the molecular mechanism of <italic>ATOH1</italic> function in human cancer is similar to the mouse. We took advantage of several established MCC cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b024">24</xref>] with either high <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression (MCC1 and MCC6, derived from less aggressive tumors) or low <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression (MCC13, MCC14.2, and MCC26, derived from highly aggressive metastatic tumors; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg004">S4</xref>C). We find that the growth rate of cell lines, measured as their doubling time, correlates inversely with levels of <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B). To determine whether the reduction in ATOH1 levels might be causal to decreased doubling time, we restored ATOH1 function by creating stable cell lines expressing <italic>Atoh1</italic> using lentiviral vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g005">5</xref>B). Stable <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing cell lines (MCC14.2-Atoh1.1a, MCC14.2-Atoh1.1b, MCC14.2-Atoh1.2a, and MCC14.2-Atoh1.2b) have a significantly slower population doubling time compared to control cell lines (MCC14.2 and MCC14.2-GFP; <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). To assess whether this increase in doubling time reflects decreased malignancy, we tested these cell lines for growth in soft agar. Cell lines with high levels of <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression display a marked decrease in growth in soft agar compared to control cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The change in population doubling time could be due to a slower cell cycle, an increased apoptotic rate, or both. Although the distribution of cells in the cell cycle appears unaltered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg010">Figure S10</xref>A), the speed of the cell cycle is 25% lower in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing cells, as assayed by BrdU pulse-chase experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g005">Figure 5</xref>E, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.01).</p>

        <p>In addition to slower proliferation, we find a specific and strong increase in apoptotic cell death, as measured by annexin-V and cleaved caspase-3 (ENST00000308394), in MCC (MCC14.2 series) and CRC (Ht29) cell lines transduced or transfected with Atoh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g006">Figures 6</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g006">6</xref>B, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg010">S10</xref>B).

        <p>Data from mouse models indicate an involvement of JNK-mediated regulation of cell proliferation for the tumor suppressor effect of Atoh1. To assess whether the same mechanisms are operating in human cancer, we tested the expression levels of the caspase-3 and caspase-9, p21<sup>waf1</sup>, and p-JNK in MCC and CRC cells lines. We note a clear and specific up-regulation of p21<sup>waf1</sup> and p-JNK levels upon <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g006">Figures 6</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g006">6</xref>B, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg010">S10</xref>C–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg010">S10</xref>H). Similarly, transfection of wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ato results in the up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3, p21<sup>waf1</sup>, and p-JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g006">Figure 6</xref>C), in contrast to a null-mutant form of the protein that completely fails to bind DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b025">25</xref>], indicating the conservation and specificity of the Ato/Atoh1 effect.</p>
        <p>Next, we tested the expression of these proteins in a loss-of-function setting. We generated and expressed the transcriptional repressor form of ATOH1 by fusing it to the engrailed repressor domain (ATOH1<sup>ERD</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b026">26</xref>], which specifically inhibits the Atoh1-induced effects on MCC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). In the MCC1 cell line, which shows higher endogenous <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression compared to MCC14.2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg004">Figure S4</xref>C), expression of ATOH1<sup>ERD</sup> leads to a down-regulation of p21<sup>waf1</sup> and p-JNK as well as inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g006">Figure 6</xref>E).</p>
        <p>In summary, gain- and loss-of-function studies in mouse colon cancer models and human cancer cells support a conserved antitumor function for <italic>ATOH1</italic> mediated by JNK and p21.</p>

        <title><italic>ATOH1</italic> Activates RTK Expression in Human Cancer Cells</title>
        <p>How does <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression lead to JNK activation in cancer cells? <italic>ATOH1</italic> and its orthologs are known to exert their developmental functions by modulating Notch; Atonal orthologs inhibit Notch signaling to induce differentiation during development, whereas Notch inhibits ato expression by its target gene <italic>Hes1</italic> (ENSG00000114315) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b029">29</xref>]. Notch signaling has also been described to be upstream of JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b030">30</xref>]. However, three lines of evidence suggest that the <italic>Atoh1</italic>-mediated effects are not Notch-dependent. First, <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression levels do not influence expression of <italic>HES1</italic>, a Notch signaling target gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg011">Figure S11</xref>A). Second, we do not detect cleaved intracellular Notch in the MCC14.2 cell line, which expresses low levels of <italic>ATOH1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg011">Figure S11</xref>B). Finally, blocking of Notch activation by selective inhibition of γ-secretase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b031">31</xref>] has no effect on the growth of MCC cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg011">Figure S11</xref>C). Other known upstream activators of JNK are RTKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b032">32</xref>]. As Atoh1 is a transcription factor, we checked mRNA expression of all 90 human RTKs upon <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression in both the MCC14.2 and the Ht29 cell line compared to control cells. We observed a significant and specific <italic>Atoh1</italic>-dependent up-regulation of Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (NTRK1: ENSG00000198400), a hallmark for differentiation in Merkel cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b034">34</xref>] in MCC14.2, and of FGF receptors in Ht29 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg011">Figure S11</xref>D). The increase in NTRK1 expression in MCC14.2 seen on the mRNA level was confirmed using RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg010">Figure S10</xref>E). We also observed elevated NTRK1 levels in the endogenously <italic>ATOH1</italic>-expressing MCC1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg010">Figure S10</xref>E). This was accompanied by higher protein levels of both the NTRK1 receptor and one of its ligands, Neurotrophin-3 (NT3: ENSG00000185652; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg010">Figure S10</xref>E–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000039-sg010">S10</xref>H), also a marker for Merkel cell differentiation. Therefore, Ato gain of function results in tumor type–specific elevation of RTK levels.</p>

        <title>ATOH1 Functions by RTK-Mediated JNK Activation</title>
        <p>To test whether the RTKs may be functionally linked with ATOH1, we incubated the various MCC cell lines with K252a, a narrow-specificity RTK inhibitor (NTRK, FGFR, PDGFR, and IGFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b037">37</xref>].

In addition, the induction of apoptosis by <italic>Atoh1</italic> in the MCC14.2 and the Ht29 cell line is blocked by RTK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g007">7</xref>C). These effects are accompanied by RTK inhibitor–dependent decrease in the expression of p21<sup>waf1</sup> and p-JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g007">Figure 7</xref>D), suggesting that both p21<sup>waf1</sup> and p-JNK are downstream effectors of <italic>Atoh1</italic>-induced RTK signaling.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our data support an evolutionarily conserved tumor suppressor role for <italic>ATOH1</italic> in CRC and MCC. Loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> promotes tumor formation and progression, and mutations in the <italic>ATOH1</italic> locus are found with relatively high frequency. Given the high deletion and methylation rate of ATOH1 in human tumor samples, loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> function is likely to be an early event in these tumors. We therefore propose that <italic>ATOH1</italic> acts as a key switch regulating the transformation of pre-oncogenic epithelia to neoplastic and metastatic tumors.</p>
      <p>Genetic analysis of the function of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila ato</named-content> in fly eye tumor suggests that its anti-oncogenic function is linked to its activity as a regulator of cell fate commitment and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b007">7</xref>]. This is similar to what we observe in the different mouse models, where the adenomas and adenocarcinomas do not contain secretory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000039-g002">Figure 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b003">3</xref>]. Interestingly, this also appears to be the case in human cancer, where the majority of human CRCs do not contain differentiated secretory cells. The loss of <italic>ATOH1</italic> in most human CRC patients likely explains this observation. In addition, cell type–specific RTK differentiation genes are up-regulated upon overexpression of <italic>Atoh1</italic> in CRC and MCC cell lines. Importantly, these markers of differentiation are necessary for the anti-oncogenic effect of <italic>ato</italic>/<italic>ATOH1</italic>.</p>
      <p>It is tempting to speculate that in other tissues, similar loss of differentiation factors is involved in oncogenesis. In this sense, the loss of differentiation factors has already been implicated in late stages of tumor progression as with GATA-3 (ENSG00000107485) in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b040">40</xref>]. Although loss of GATA-3 in early tumor leads to an inhibition of tumor formation, loss of GATA-3 in later stages leads to the acquisition of metastatic potential. We, therefore, wonder whether loss of other differentiation factors, perhaps bHLH proteins, might play a role in earlier stages of breast cancer development.</p>
      <p>Tumor suppressor genes are defined by the fact that (1) loss-of-function mutations make the cells more prone to malignant transformation, (2) overexpression leads to inhibition of the malignant phenotype, and (3) spontaneous somatic mutations are found in patients with cancer. “Classical tumor suppressor genes,” such as <italic>p53</italic> (ENSG00000141510), are special in the sense that when mutated, the cell is more prone to accumulate additional mutations, and thus actively drive malignant progression as opposed to just “taking away the brakes” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b041">41</xref>]. It is notable that <italic>ato/Atoh1</italic> shows most of the hallmarks of a tumor suppressor gene. Because silencing of <italic>ato</italic>/<italic>Atoh1</italic> is not sufficient to drive oncogenesis, we suggest that <italic>ato</italic>/<italic>Atoh1</italic>, and similar genes, are important brakes on malignant transformation. Therefore, the role that differentiation factors might play as key switches in malignant transformation in different tissues is not different from the classical definition of tumor suppressor in a functionally relevant sense.</p>
      <p>The RTK and JNK signaling pathways, which are essential for <italic>Atoh1</italic>'s tumor suppressor activity, have been suggested as context-dependent oncogenes or tumor suppressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b042">42</xref>]. Our data indicate that <italic>Atoh1</italic> is important in deciding this context by the up-regulation of cell type–specific RTKs. The activation and co-option of RTK and JNK signaling by Ato/ATOH1 in this context suggests that the status of differentiation of the tumor-initiating cell may be the key determinant of the specific role of various signaling pathways in cancer. This may have important clinical implications: treatment of CRC or MCC patients with RTK or JNK inhibitors might have an adverse effect on tumors where <italic>ATOH1</italic> is still expressed.</p>
      <p>In this medical context, our data suggest that screening for <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression, deletion, and methylation may be a useful diagnostic tool for early detection and treatment decision of MCC and CRC. Similarly, treatment of CRC and MCC patients whose tumors show epigenetic silencing of <italic>ATOH1</italic> with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors might prove a powerful avenue for therapy, because it appears to be sufficient to restore <italic>ATOH1</italic> expression and induce cancer cell death. Furthermore, such treatment in combination with Notch inhibitors may enhance re-expression of the ATOH1-driven differentiation program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000039-b044">44</xref>] and synergistically inhibit cancer growth. Therefore, elucidation of the basic mechanisms of <italic>ato/ATOH1</italic> function, as well as their target genes and interacting proteins, might offer potential avenues for future therapeutic intervention.</p>
