<abstract>
<p>Spicy foods elicit a pungent or hot and painful sensation that repels almost all mammals. Here, we observe that the tree shrew (<italic>Tupaia belangeri chinensis</italic>), which possesses a close relationship with primates and can directly and actively consume spicy plants. Our genomic and functional analyses reveal that a single point mutation in the tree shrew’s transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) ion channel (tsV1) lowers its sensitivity to capsaicinoids, which enables the unique feeding behavior of tree shrews with regards to pungent plants. We show that strong selection for this residue in tsV1 might be driven by <italic>Piper boehmeriaefolium</italic>, a spicy plant that geographically overlaps with the tree shrew and produces Cap2, a capsaicin analog, in abundance. We propose that the mutation in tsV1 is a part of evolutionary adaptation that enables the tree shrew to tolerate pungency, thus widening the range of its diet for better survival.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Most mammals cannot tolerate the pungent sensation, such as that evoked by eating chili peppers. Here, we show that unexpectedly, the tree shrew, a mammal closely related to primates, can consume pungent plants. We determined that this tolerance is caused by an amino acid change in the tree shrew’s transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) ion channel, which lowers the channel’s sensitivity to capsaicinoids—the substances that make plants spicy. We attribute the strong selection for this amino acid to an adaptation to consuming <italic>Piper boehmeriaefolium</italic>, a spicy plant that geographically overlaps with the tree shrew and produces Cap2, a substance similar to capsaicin, the pungent agent found in chili peppers. Our study suggests an evolutionary and molecular mechanism adopted by the tree shrew to expand its nutritional repertoire.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many plants contain pungent chemicals that deter animals from consuming them. Particularly, the genus <italic>Capsicum</italic> encompasses 22 wild species and produces a capsaicinoid called capsaicin, which is a pungent substance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref002">2</xref>]. One of these species, the chili pepper, is a low shrub with capsaicin-containing fruits that are readily accessible to mammals and birds. However, capsaicinoids in these plants repel animals by evoking a sharp and burning sensation through activation of the nociceptor transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) ion channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref007">7</xref>]. Interestingly, birds are an exception due to two specific point mutations in their TRPV1 channels that render them insensitive to capsaicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref009">9</xref>]. This adaptation broadens the range of diet in birds and also confers an advantage to the plants, because their seeds can be widely distributed by the birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref010">10</xref>]. Humans have an acute sensitivity to spicy food, and many find it unbearable. Nonetheless, with training, some have learned to enjoy the burning sensation elicited by consuming spicy food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref001">1</xref>], which presumably also confers protection against bacterial and fungal infection in the human digestive system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref011">11</xref>]. However, whether pungency tolerance exists in other mammals remains unexplored.</p>
<p>The tree shrew (<italic>Tupaia belangeri chinensis</italic>) is a mammal closely related to primates. Genomic analysis suggests that the tree shrew has a high sequence similarity to human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref012">12</xref>]. Surprisingly, we found that tree shrews actively fed on the chili pepper when it was provided to them. To understand the molecular mechanism responsible for this capsaicin insensitivity, we employed a combination of behavioral observation, genome scans, mutational analyses, and electrophysiology studies, and we also sought a plausible cause for the behavior change that could not be brought about by a need to consume the chili pepper, a plant that was geographically isolated until recent times. We identified an amino acid change in the tree shrew TRPV1 (tsV1) at the residue that in the homologs of sensitive species forms a hydrogen bond with capsaicinoids and stabilizes the binding, and we show that this change renders tsV1 refractory to capsaicinoid-induced activation. Furthermore, we identified Cap2, a capsaicin analogue, from <italic>Piper boehmeriaefolium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref013">13</xref>], which overlaps geographically with tree shrews. We speculate that Cap2 might act as a potential environmental pressure for positive selection of the molecular change in tsV1 that confers capsaicinoid tolerance.</p>

<title>The tree shrew can tolerate the chili pepper</title>
<p>Among mammals, humans are the only known species that deliberately seeks spicy sensation from food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref001">1</xref>].

<p>To determine whether genomic changes or conditioning is responsible for capsaicin tolerance in tree shrews, we applied a genomic scan for positively selected genes (PSGs) among one-to-one orthologous genes in the tree shrew genome and 5 other phylogenetically closely related mammals: humans, chimpanzees, macaques, mice, and rats. The phylogenic relationship of these 6 species is shown in an established species tree (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). Three hundred seventy-three PSGs were retained after applying the False Discovery Rate correction to the PSGs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s010">S2 Data</xref></bold>). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis by Protein Analysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) Overrepresentation Test of the 373 PSGs identified 71 over-represented GO terms (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s007">S1 Table</xref></bold>). Interestingly, there was a clear enrichment of chemosensory behavior–related genes (GO: 0007635, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0329), including <italic>trpv1</italic>, as being over-represented by PSGs. This observation suggested that spiciness tolerance in tree shrew may be due to a positive selection of <italic>trpv1</italic> in the tree shrew.</p>

<title>TRPV1<sup>+</sup> nociceptors from tree shrews are poorly activated by capsaicin</title>
<p>We took advantage of the capsaicin tolerance to probe the effects of positive selection on the tsV1 channel protein. We first analyzed capsaicin-induced activity in dissociated mouse and tree shrew dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by calcium imaging. Consistent with observations in the behavioral tests, we found that tree shrew DRG neurons exhibited a much weaker response to capsaicin compared with mouse DRG neurons (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref></bold>). This was not caused by a paucity of tsV1 expression, because immunohistochemical and quantitative analyses of tissue sections from tongue and DRG suggested similar levels of TRPV1 protein and mRNA between mouse and the tree shrew (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref></bold>). In addition, using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, we observed that unlike in mice, capsaicin didn’t cause discernible tissue disruption in the tree shrew (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s001">S1A Fig</xref></bold>). Furthermore, capsaicin-induced acute pain behavior was absent in tree shrews, despite a high concentration of capsaicin used (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s001">S1B Fig</xref></bold>). To rule out that the absence of capsaicin-induced acute pain in tree shrews is due to any other defects in the pain sensation pathway, we investigated formalin-induced pain. In mice, local injection of formalin strongly elicited pain (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s001">S1C Fig</xref></bold>). In contrast to the tolerance to capsaicin, formalin elicited both acute and inflammatory pain in the tree shrew which is similar to mice (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s001">S1C Fig</xref></bold>). We also observed numerous inflammatory neutrophils and serious disruption of tissue structure in the formalin-injected hind paw of both mice and the tree shrew (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s001">S1D Fig</xref></bold>). These observations suggest that pain sensation is intact in the tree shrew and are consistent with the hypothesis of a reduced sensitivity of tsV1 to capsaicinoids such as capsaicin.</p>
<p>To directly measure the capsaicin sensitivity of tsV1, we expressed tsV1 in mammalian cells and performed whole-cell recording (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s002">S2A Fig</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). We observed that the concentration of capsaicin required to activate tsV1 (EC<sub>50</sub>: 5.2 ± 0.13 μM, <italic>n</italic> = 5) is much higher than the concentrations required to activate mouse TRPV1 (mV1) (EC<sub>50</sub>: 0.2 ± 0.07 μM, <italic>n</italic> = 3) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>) and other mammalian TRPV1 channels we tested (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). In contrast, tsV1 showed similar single-channel conductance and similar sensitivity to low pH and heat as the other mammalian TRPV1 channels (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s002">S2B</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s002">S2D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). Based on these results, we reasoned that capsaicin tolerance we observed was caused by the reduced tsV1 sensitivity to capsaicin.</p>

<title>A single conserved amino acid is responsible for reduced capsaicin sensitivity in tsV1</title>
<p>To understand the reduced sensitivity in tsV1, we first examined the protein sequence of the channel. Significant positive selection signal was detected in tsV1, and Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) testing identified 30 sites under positive selection (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004921.t001">Table 1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s008">S2 Table</xref></bold>). Since these 30 sites are widely distributed in different structural elements of tsV1, we constructed chimeric channels between tsV1 and mV1 to identify a region or regions in tsV1 that could cause a reduced binding affinity to capsaicin and thus result in capsaicin tolerance (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). We found that a swap of the transmembrane domain IV (S4) including S3–S4 linker had a major impact on capsaicin sensitivity, whereas changing other domains did not have a significant effect (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). Based on a homology model of tsV1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s004">S4A Fig</xref></bold>), we found that among the 30 positively selected sites, three (I561, C569, and M579) are located within the S4 domain and the S3–S4 linker, which are close to the capsaicin-binding pocket (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2D</xref></bold>), suggesting that these residues are more likely to be responsible for the reduced capsaicin sensitivity. To test the functional properties of these three sites, we replaced them with the homologous residues in mV1 and compared their sensitivity to capsaicin with wild type tsV1 by whole-cell recording. M579 in tsV1 corresponds to T551 in mV1, a site forming a hydrogen bond (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2E</xref> upper panel</bold>, dotted line in red) with capsaicin that stabilizes the binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref016">16</xref>], whereas M579 in tsV1 cannot make a hydrogen bond with capsaicin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2E</xref> lower panel</bold>). When we replaced the methionine with a threonine (M579T), which can form the hydrogen bond with capsaicin, the mutant became extremely sensitive to capsaicin with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.1 ± 0.26 μM, which is approximately 50-fold lower than the EC<sub>50</sub> of tsV1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2F</xref></bold>). Conversely, mutant mV1 with T551 replaced by a methionine or a valine which cannot form a hydrogen bond with capsaicin, capsaicin sensitivity was significantly reduced to about 10% of the wild type mV1 (mV1_T551M, EC<sub>50</sub> approximately 2.1 μM; mV1_T551V, EC<sub>50</sub> approximately 1.5 μM, and wild-type mV1, EC<sub>50</sub> approximately 0.2 μM) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2G</xref></bold>). These results suggest that the observed decrease in capsaicin sensitivity is caused by a structural change that reduces the binding affinity between tsV1 and capsaicin.</p>

<title>Tree shrews tolerate a local <italic>Piper</italic> species containing capsaicinoid similar to capsaicin</title>
<p>We next explored a plausible environmental factor that could select for the structural change in tsV1 and behavioral change in the species. By sequencing TRPV1 fragments containing the 579 site in 155 wild tree shrews from 5 populations (Genbank No. MF073026–MF073180), we found that M579 is conserved in all sequenced individuals (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s004">S4D Fig</xref></bold>), suggesting that it has been fixed at the species level. This excludes the chili pepper, which had been geographically isolated from the tree shrew until it was introduced to South Asia only approximately 300 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Piper boehmeriaefolium</italic> (Miq.) C.

<p>As the hydroxyl group on the side chain of threonine is expected to form a hydrogen bond with Cap2 to stabilize its binding to the tsV1_M579T mutant, just like its interaction with capsaicin on mV1, we next replaced M579 in tsV1 with four other amino acids, in addition to threonine, and compared the EC<sub>50</sub> of Cap2. None of the five mutants exhibited a concentration-response curve to the right of the wild-type tsV1; the two mutants—M579T and M579S—that can presumably form a hydrogen bond with capsaicin and Cap2 exhibited large shifts to the left (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g004">Fig 4E</xref></bold>). This result suggests that methionine at the 579 has been selected to maximally reduce the sensitivity to Cap2.</p>
<p>There are other chemicals that can also activate TRPV1 and elicit a spiciness sensation like capsaicin and Cap2, such as piperine (from black pepper) and gingerol and shogaol (from ginger) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref001">1</xref>]. To test whether these irritants also contribute to fixation of the M579 mutation, we investigated whether M579 is critical for the binding of these irritants. Although mutating this homologous site in both mV1 and tsV1 (mV1_T551M or tsV1_M579T) led to shifts in concentration-response curve of piperine, gingerol, and shogaol (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>), change in the EC<sub>50</sub> of Cap2 (approximately 1,000-fold, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g004">Fig 4E</xref></bold>) was much larger than other irritants (approximately 10-fold for capsaicin; approximately 2-fold for piperine; approximately 6-fold for gingerol; approximately 10-fold for shogaol). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that Cap2, instead of capsaicin and other irritants, is the main driver for the M579 mutation in tsV1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g004">Fig 4F</xref></bold>). This is also consistent with our observation that tree shrews compared to mice preferred <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boehmeriaefolium</italic> over other tested pungent plants (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>) and indicates that the chili pepper is not the driver for the M579 in tsV1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g004">Fig 4F</xref></bold>). Our observations together favor the idea that feeding adaptation to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boehmeriaefolium</italic> rich in Cap2 has positive selected for M579 in tsV1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that tree shrews can tolerate pungent plants such as the chili pepper and <italic>Piper boehmeriaefolium</italic>, which are avoided by most animals because of the pungent sensation they elicit. We show that M579 in tsV1 has been strongly and positively selected to render this tree shrew homolog of TRPV1 less sensitive to the pungent chemical Cap2 in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boehmeriaefolium</italic>, a <italic>Piper</italic> species with an overlapping geographical distribution in South Asia, and we suggest a plausible driver for the functional change in tsV1 and the dietary change in the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g004">Fig 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>The TRPV1 channel has been the molecular target for selection in evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref019">19</xref>]. For instance, in camels and squirrels, two point mutations occur in the N-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain of TRPV1 to enhance their heat tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref020">20</xref>]. In addition, avian TRPV1 with two specific point mutations shows low sensitivity to capsaicin as well, which is consistent with the observation that birds are favored as vectors for seed dispersal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref010">10</xref>]. However, it is difficult to determine the contribution of environmental pressure because of the low degrees of sequence conservation between avian and mammalian TRPV1. We show that the 579 site in tsV1 constitutes a critical molecular determinant; this site is occupied in the tree shrew by a methionine which, unlike the threonine in the TRPV1 of species intolerable to pungency, cannot form a hydrogen bond with capsaicinoid ligands (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2F</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g004">Fig 4</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Our suggestion that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boehmeriaefolium</italic>, instead of ginger, black pepper, and chili pepper, is the main environmental stress responsible for the positive selection of M579 is supported by the observation that swapping methionine with threonine or vice versa at this position (tsV1_M579T or mV1_T551M) caused significantly more change in sensitivity to Cap2 from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boehmeriaefolium</italic> (approximately 1,000-fold) than to other irritants, such as piperine, gingerol, and shogaol (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g002">Fig 2F</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g004">Fig 4A–4D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>). The feeding behavior described in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold> also supports this interpretation. Furthermore, the cultivation history of chili peppers in South Asia is only approximately 300 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004921.ref002">2</xref>], yet M579 has been fixed in the tree shrew (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004921.s004">S4D Fig</xref></bold>), which diverged from humans about 90.0 million years ago (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004921.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). Therefore, feeding adaptation to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>boehmeriaefolium</italic> is the most likely explanation to the fixation of this mutation by positive selection, which enabled an expansion of the tree shrew’s dietary repertoire.</p>
