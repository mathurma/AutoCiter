      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001077-g001"/>Currently, more than 2.7 million
                American adults are diagnosed as obese each year. Many of these people suffer from a
                disorder known as metabolic syndrome, which includes symptoms like hypertension and
                elevated blood cholesterol. They are also at risk for developing additional diseases
                such as heart disease and diabetes mellitus. In fact, obesity may be a major cause
                of all these problems … the question is, why? That's the question Kirsi H.
                Pietiläinen, Antonio Vidal-Puig, Matej Orešič, and colleagues set
                out to address in their paper published in this month's <italic>PLoS
                    Biology</italic>.</p>
      <p>One prominent theory explaining how obesity could drive advanced disease states is
                the “adipose tissue expandability” hypothesis. This theory is based on
                the idea that as excess fat is added to the body, its fat compartment (adipose
                tissue) expands as more fat-storing cells are made and existing ones increase in
                size. However, expandability of the fat compartment is finite; like a water balloon,
                the fat compartment can only expand so much before leaks develop. For the body,
                “leaks” in the fat compartment manifest as depositions of fat in tissues
                where its presence can be disruptive to normal function—as happens in morbidly
                obese individuals. But, lower levels of expansion are tolerated—possibly due
                to compensatory mechanisms—so that tissues and systems can function normally.
                So what is going on in the body when the fat compartments are expanded but not yet
                full?</p>
      <p>To explore this question in humans, the authors decided to compare adipose tissue and
                health parameters amongst several sets of monozygotic twins. In each twin pair, one
                twin was obese (but still healthy, i.e., not morbidly obese), while the other twin
                exhibited a normal body mass index. Because monozygotic twins share the same DNA and
                early upbringing, the impact of these factors on adult body mass phenotypes is
                controlled for, leaving other factors such as adult diet and lifestyle choices as
                the major remaining variables.</p>
      <p>When the authors compared dietary intake within twin sets, they found that obese
                twins had lower amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their diets than did their
                non-obese counterparts. The kinds of fats a person eats can affect what types of
                lipids are present in the body, so the authors next compared the lipid content of
                obese versus non-obese twins' adipose tissue. In fact, they found the obese
                people had higher amounts of certain types of phospholipids in their adipose tissues
                than did their non-obese co-twins.</p>
      <p>This finding is interesting because cell membranes are primarily composed of lipids,
                and different lipids can alter membranes' physical properties. For example,
                lipids with larger head groups, or longer or branched side chains are found to pack
                less tightly in membranes, making the membranes that host them more fluid. When the
                authors used computers to model the effect these different lipids have on adipose
                cell membranes, they found that the new lipids observed in obese twins' adipose
                cells balance each other in such a way that membrane fluidity overall is unaffected.
                The authors concluded that lipid content changes in obese individuals might actually
                be an adaptation that serves to preserve membrane function as the cells expand.
                However, additional analyses suggested that this adaptation can only go so far, and
                breaks down in the morbidly obese.</p>
      <p>To find out how this adaptive response is achieved, the authors conducted a
                statistical network analysis (based on clinical and genetic variables) to try to
                identify the regulatory mechanisms that underpin these changes. This analysis showed
                that the gene encoding the fatty acid elongase Elovl6 might be involved in fatty
                acid remodeling in obese people. Indeed, when the researchers reduced Elovl6
                expression in an adipocyte cell line, they found the cells could no longer maintain
                the right level of the adaptive lipids observed in obese twins.</p>
      <p>Collectively, the authors' data point to some of the mechanisms the body may use
                to adapt to excess fat. These results may also help explain why obese people are at
                risk for developing inflammatory disorders like diabetes mellitus: the kinds of
                lipids that accumulate in obese people's adipocytes are precursors for
                compounds that are known to aggravate the immune system. Of course, these findings
                need to be validated by more studies, including ones using transgenic animals.
                Nonetheless, they represent a valuable angle from which to approach the problem.</p>
