<abstract>
<p>Two central biophysical laws describe sensory responses to input signals. One is a logarithmic relationship between input and output, and the other is a power law relationship. These laws are sometimes called the Weber-Fechner law and the Stevens power law, respectively. The two laws are found in a wide variety of human sensory systems including hearing, vision, taste, and weight perception; they also occur in the responses of cells to stimuli. However the mechanistic origin of these laws is not fully understood. To address this, we consider a class of biological circuits exhibiting a property called fold-change detection (FCD). In these circuits the response dynamics depend only on the relative change in input signal and not its absolute level, a property which applies to many physiological and cellular sensory systems. We show analytically that by changing a single parameter in the FCD circuits, both logarithmic and power-law relationships emerge; these laws are modified versions of the Weber-Fechner and Stevens laws. The parameter that determines which law is found is the steepness (effective Hill coefficient) of the effect of the internal variable on the output. This finding applies to major circuit architectures found in biological systems, including the incoherent feed-forward loop and nonlinear integral feedback loops. Therefore, if one measures the response to different fold changes in input signal and observes a logarithmic or power law, the present theory can be used to rule out certain FCD mechanisms, and to predict their cooperativity parameter. We demonstrate this approach using data from eukaryotic chemotaxis signaling.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>One of the first measurements an experimentalist makes to understand a sensory system is to explore the relation between input signal and the systems response amplitude. Here, we show using mathematical models that this measurement can give important clues about the possible mechanism of sensing. We use models that incorporate the nearly-universal features of sensory systems, including hearing and vision, and the sensing pathways of individual cells. These nearly-universal features include exact adaptation-the ability to ignore prolonged input stimuli and return to basal activity, and fold-change detection- response to relative changes in input, not absolute changes. Together with information on the input-output relationship-e.g. is it a logarithmic or a power law relationship-we show that these conditions provide enough constraints to allow the researcher to reject certain circuit designs; it also predicts, if one assumes a given design, one of its key parameters. This study can thus help unify our understanding of sensory systems, and help pinpoint the possible biological circuits based on physiological measurements.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biological sensory systems have been quantitatively studied for over 150 years. In many sensory systems, the response to a step increase in signal rises, reaches a peak response, and then falls, adapting back to a baseline level, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003781-g001">Fig. 1a</xref> upper panel). Consider a step increase in input signal from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such that the relative change is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. There are two commonly observed forms for the input-output relationship in sensory systems: logarithmic and power law. In the logarithmic case, the relative peak response of the system <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is proportional not to the input level but to its logarithm <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A logarithmic scale of z versus <italic>I</italic>, namely <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is often called the Weber-Fechner law <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Ernst1">[1]</xref>, and is related but distinct from the present definition <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the case of a power-law relationship, the maximal response is proportional to a power of the input <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003781-g001">Fig. 1a</xref> lower panel) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Stanley1">[2]</xref>. In physiology this is known as the Stevens power law; the power law exponent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> varies between sensory systems, and ranges between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Stanley1">[2]</xref>. For example the human perception of brightness, apparent length and electrical shock display exponents <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> respectively.</p>

<title>Input/output relationships of sensory systems can be described by a logarithmic law or a power law.</title>
<p>a) In many sensory systems the dynamical response to a step increase in input signal, <italic>I</italic>, is a transient increase of output Z followed by adaptation to a lower steady state. The relative maximal response is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Two laws are often found. The first is a logarithmic law, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The second law is a power law, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with different exponent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each system. b) Fold change detection (FCD) describes a system whose response depends only on the relative change in input signal and not the absolute level. Therefore, for a step increase from 1 to 2 and then from 2 to 4 the system response curve is exactly the same.</p>

<p>Both logarithmic and power-law descriptions are empirical; when valid, they are typically found to be quite accurate over a range of a few decades of input signal. For example, both laws emerge in visual threshold estimation experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Thoss1">[3]</xref>. In that study, the logarithmic law was found to describe the response to strong signals and the power-law to weak ones. However the mechanistic origins of these laws, and the mechanistic parameters that lead to one law or the other, are currently unclear. Theoretical studies have suggested that these laws can be derived from optimization criteria for information processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Krueger1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Nizami1">[5]</xref>, such as accounting for scale invariance of input signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Chater1">[6]</xref>. Both laws can be found in models that describe sensory systems as excitable media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Copelli1">[7]</xref>. Other studies attempt to relate these laws to properties of specific neuronal circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Billock1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Tzur1">[9]</xref>. Here we seek a simple and general model of sensory systems which can clarify which mechanistic parameters might explain the origin of the two laws in sensory systems.</p>
<p>To address the input-output dependence of biological sensory systems, we use a recently proposed class of circuit models that show a property known as fold-change detection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Goentoro1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Shoval1">[11]</xref>. Fold change detection (FCD) means that, for a wide range of input signals, the output depends only on the relative changes in input; identical relative changes in input result in identical output dynamics, including response amplitude and timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003781-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). Thus, a step in input from level 1 to level 2 yields exactly the same temporal output curve as a step from 2 to 4, because both steps show a 2-fold change. FCD has been shown to occur in bacterial chemotaxis, first theoretically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Goentoro1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Shoval1">[11]</xref> and then by means of dynamical experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Lazova1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Masson1">[13]</xref>. FCD is thought to also occur in human sensory systems including vision and hearing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Shoval1">[11]</xref>, as well as in cellular sensory pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-CohenSaidon1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Takeda1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>FCD can be implemented by commonly occurring gene regulation circuits, such as the network motif known as the incoherent feed-forward loop (I1-FFL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Goentoro1">[10]</xref>, as well as certain types of nonlinear integral feedback loops (NLIFL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Shoval1">[11]</xref>. Recently, the response of an FCD circuit to multiple simultaneous inputs was theoretically studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Hart1">[18]</xref>. Mechanistically, FCD is based on an internal variable that stores information about the past signals, and normalizes the output signal accordingly. We find here, using analytical solutions, that simple fold-change detection circuits can show either logarithmic or power law behavior. The type of law, and the power-law exponent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, depend primarily on a single parameter: the steepness (effective Hill coefficient) of the effect of the internal variable on the output.</p>

<title>Analytical solution for the dynamics of the I1-FFL circuit in its FCD regime</title>
<p>We begin with a common gene regulation circuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Mangan1">[19]</xref> that can show FCD, the incoherent type 1 feed-forward loop (I1-FFL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Goentoro1">[10]</xref>. In transcription networks, this circuit is made of an activator that regulates a gene and also the repressor of that gene. More generally, we can consider an input X that activates the output Z, and also activates an internal variable Y that represses Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003781-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). We study a model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003781.e018">Eq. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003781.e019">2</xref>) for the I1-FFL with AND logic (that is, where X and Y act multiplicatively to regulate Z), which includes ordinary differential equations for the dynamics of the internal variable Y and the output Z <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Wang1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Levchenko1">[22]</xref>.

The maximal production rate of Y is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

We assume here that saturating signal of Y is present, so that all of Y is in its active form. The product Z which is repressed by Y and activated by X is produced at a rate that is a function of both X and Y, denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. An experimental survey of <italic>E. coli</italic> input functions suggested that many are well described by separation of variables: the two-dimensional input function separates to a product of one dimensional functions, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Kaplan1">[24]</xref>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are Hill functions (for more explanation see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). We therefore use a general form for the X dependence, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and multiply it by a repressive Hill function of Y (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003781.e019">Eq. 2</xref>), with a maximal production rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The removal rate of Z is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>This model for the I1-FFL describes the response to a step increase in input, starting from fully adapted conditions. We consider a change between an input level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to a new level <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The step is thus characterized by the fold change <italic>F</italic> equal to the ratio between the initial and final input levels, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>In order for FCD to hold, the production rate of Z must be proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), where the power law exponent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the same as the Hill coefficient that describes the steepness of the input function. In this way, the internal variable, Y, can precisely normalize out the fold change in input (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The model thus reads:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003781.e051"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e051" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1003781.e052"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e052" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>The higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the more Y is needed to repress Z. The parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> - the Hill coefficient of the input function - is important for this study, and determines the steepness of the regulation of the output Z by the internal variable Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003781-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the more steep the repression of Z by Y. The limit <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> resembles step-like regulation. Biochemical systems often have Hill coefficients in the range <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Alon1">[23]</xref>. The ratio between the removal rates, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, describes the relative time scale between Y and Z. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Y and Z have the same removal rates, and for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the output Z is much faster than Y.</p>
<p>Goentoro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Goentoro2">[15]</xref> showed, using a numerical parameter scan, that this circuit can perform FCD provided that threshold of the Z repression, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is small: that is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We therefore further analyze the limit of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, meaning strong repression of Z, where the equation for the product Z (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003781.e052">Eq. 4</xref>) becomes:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003781.e064"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e064" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>In this limit, the system exhibits fold change detection since it obeys the sufficient conditions for FCD in Shoval et al (2010) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).

Note that the pre-factor in the power law is also predicted to depend simply on the Hill coefficient for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, namely to be equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Indeed in fitting the numerical solution the best fit parameter is approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> respectively. The dependence of output amplitude on input fold-change is thus a power law, similar to Stevens power law, except for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where the output dependence is logarithmic.</p>
<p>One point to consider regarding step input functions is that realistic inputs are not infinitely fast steps; however, a gradual change in input behaves almost exactly like an infinitely rapid step, as long as the timescale of the change in input is fast compared to the timescale of the Y and Z components. To demonstrate this, we computed the response to changes in input that have a timescale parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that can be tuned to go from very slow to very fast: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003781-g005">Fig. 5a</xref>). When <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the behavior of the relative maximal amplitude of the response, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as a function of the relative change in the input signal, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is very similar to the infinitely fast step solution (less than 5% difference for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003781-g005">Fig. 5b</xref>). When the change in input is much slower than the typical timescales of the circuit, the response is very small, since the signal is perceived almost as a steady-state constant. For slow changes in input, the I1-FFL response can be shown to be approximately proportional to the logarithmic temporal derivative of the signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Hironaka1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Keller1">[30]</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study explored how two common biophysical laws, logarithmic and power-law, can stem from mechanistic models of sensing. We consider two of the best studied fold-change detection mechanisms, and find that a single model parameter controls which law is found: the steepness <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e254" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the effect of the internal variable on the output. We solved the dynamics analytically for the I1-FFL mechanism, finding that logarithmic-like input-output relations occurs when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e255" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and power-law occurs when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e256" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with power law <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e257" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and prefactor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e258" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e259" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The nonlinear integral feedback loop (NLIFL) mechanism - a second class of mechanisms to achieve FCD - can only produce a power law. Thus, if one observes logarithmic behavior, one can rule out the specific NLIFL mechanism considered here. This appears to be the case in experimental data on eukaryotic chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Takeda1">[17]</xref>, in which good agreement is found to the present results in the I1-FFL mechanism with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e260" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in both peak response and timing.</p>
<p>This theory gives a prediction about the internal mechanism for sensory systems based on the observed laws that connect input and output signals. Thus, by measuring the system response to different folds in the input signal one may infer the cooperativity of the input function and potentially rule out certain classes of mechanism. For example, if a linear dependence of amplitude on fold change is observed (power law with exponent <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e261" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), one can infer that the steepness coefficient is about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e262" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for both the specific I1-FFL and NLIFL circuits considered here, with slight modification if the timescales of variables are unequal. Such a linear detection of fold changes may occur in drosophila development of the wing imaginal disk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Wartlick1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Wartlick3">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>The problem of finding the FCD response amplitude shows a feature of technical interest for modeling biological circuits. In many modeling studies, a quasi-steady-state approximation, also called an instantaneous approximation, is used when a separation of timescales exists between processes. In this approximation, one replaces the differential equation for the fast variables by an algebraic equation, by setting the temporal derivative of the fast variable to zero. This approximation results in simpler formulae, and is often very accurate, for example in estimating Michaelis-Menten enzyme steady states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Segel1">[36]</xref>. However, as noted by Segel et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Segel1">[36]</xref>, this approximation is invalid to describe transients on the fast time scale. In the present study, we are interested in the maximal amplitude of the FCD circuits. In some input regimes, namely <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e263" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the instantaneous approximation predicts an incorrect power law. To obtain accurate estimates, the full set of equations must be solved without setting derivatives to zero.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to use the present approach to analyze experiments on other FCD systems, and to gain mechanistic understanding of sensory computations.</p>

<p>We define logarithmic response as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e373" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In contrast, traditional definition of the Weber-Fechner law (also called the Fechner law) in biophysics is (e.g. ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Thoss1">[3]</xref>) as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003781.e374" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus the present definition concerns relative change in input and output, whereas the Weber-Fechner law concerns absolute input and output. Note also that the Weber-Fechner law is distinct from Weber's law, on the just noticeable difference in sensory systems, whose relation to FCD was discussed in Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003781-Shoval1">[11]</xref>.</p>
