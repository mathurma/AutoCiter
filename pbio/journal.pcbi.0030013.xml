Here, we use a computer-driven simulation that uses data about thymocyte development to generate an integrated dynamic representation—a novel technology we have termed <italic>reactive animation</italic> (RA). RA reveals emergent properties in complex dynamic biological systems. We apply RA to thymocyte development by reproducing and extending the effects of known gene knockouts: CXCR4 and CCR9. RA simulation revealed a previously unidentified role of thymocyte competition for major histocompatability complex presentation. We now report that such competition is required for normal anatomical compartmentalization, can influence the rate of thymocyte velocities within chemokine gradients, and can account for the disproportion between single-positive CD4 and CD8 lineages developing from double-positive precursors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Biological systems are the embodiment of complexity that defies intuitive understanding. Biologists have accumulated masses of data about the molecules, cells, and discrete interactions that compose living systems, but the list of facts alone cannot explain how such systems work dynamically.

RA uses a bottom-up integration of diverse experimental data to create an integrated and dynamic representation of the system's interacting cells and molecules. RA is faithful to experimental fact, while it plays out the action in animated formats directly accessible to the eye and mind. Most importantly, RA is analytical, interactive, and allows experimentation in silico. Here, we use RA to reveal unexpected emergent properties of thymocyte development. In particular, we now report that competition between thymocytes for sites of stimulation could be important in generating the fine anatomy of the thymus, in selecting for thymocytes with a range of migration velocities, and in explaining the paradox of CD4 to CD8 T cell lineage ratios. This study highlights the explanatory power and the potential aid to experimentation offered by an animated, interactive simulation of complex sets of data.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was partially supported by the John von Neumann Minerva Center for the Development of Reactive Systems at the Weizmann Institute of Science and by the Center for the Study of Emerging Diseases, Jerusalem.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Efroni S, Harel D, Cohen IR (2007) Emergent dynamics of thymocyte development and lineage determination.

These cells—thymocytes—go through a series of anatomical subcompartments in a process termed <italic>T cell education</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b002">2</xref>]. About 97% of candidate T cells die, while the remaining 3% are essential to the continuing development of the adaptive immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b003">3</xref>]. For a recent review of thymic architecture and cell traffic, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b004">4</xref>]. For a brief schematic animation of thymic maturation, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030013-sv001">Video S1</xref>.</p><p>Extensive research in disparate disciplines has uncovered a mass of data regarding thymocyte development. Subfields of thymus research include genes, gene expression and differentiation; molecules (integrins, chemokines, cytokines, receptors, antigens, and other ligands); cells (stem cells, thymocytes, epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages); cell behavior (adhesion, migration, and anatomic localization); cell states (differentiation states, cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis); and physiology (antigen expression, positive and negative selection, lineage choice, and antigen-receptor repertoires). The technologies used to study thymopoeisis include genetics, transgenes and gene knockouts, protein chemistry, microscopy and immunohistochemistry, in vitro cell cultures and interactions, in vivo phenotypes, cell and organ transfers, immunizations, and more. A systematic integration of these data into an accurate and comprehensive representation is much needed. We address this need using reactive animation (RA) to reveal multiscalar emergent properties and to guide experimentation in thymocyte development.</p><p>RA is a computational approach to simulating complex dynamic systems. The technology of RA has been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b007">7</xref>]. Briefly, the RA simulation is built in two tiers. The first tier is built, bottom-up, from the actual cellular and molecular data, and incorporates the program, the logic, and the dynamics of the simulation. The second tier is a front-end visualization of the simulation capable of real-time interactive manipulation of the action. RA allows the experimenter to extract statistical and local information from the running simulation. Moreover, the experimenter can intervene in the simulation and observe in silico the effects of thought experiments. Our simulation was built primarily using for the first tier the language of Statecharts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b008">8</xref>], with its enhanced legibility and organizational structure. We added to Statecharts a second tier of animation. Between the two tiers, we built a set of tools to facilitate data-mining options, such as tracking cells, manipulation of surface receptors, inducement of apoptosis, tracking cell ancestry, data displays, visualization of chemokine gradients, zooming in and out across scales, streaming reports, statistical data, and more (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030013-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Demonstrations of these tools are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030013-sv002">Videos S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030013-sv004">S4</xref> and online.

Anatomic localization is critical to thymus development; thymocytes at different developmental stages migrate to specific thymic compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b002">2</xref>]. Validation of a bottom-up simulation such as RA (and of the database itself) requires that the microscale molecular data put into the model suffice to generate realistic macroscale thymocyte migration and anatomical location. Cell migration depends on thymocyte receptor profiles, chemokine gradients, epithelial cells, cell proliferation, cell survival, cell velocity, and other factors that enter the simulation. For example, a thymocyte at the double-negative (DN)1 stage expresses a profile of surface markers CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>Lselectin<sup>low</sup>CD69<sup>−</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b017">17</xref>]. Experimentally, we know that thymocytes at the DN1 stage migrate towards the chemokine CCL25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b018">18</xref>]. The thymus stroma, too, influences migratory decisions; a thymocyte's path to a chemokine may be blocked by another cell. Furthermore, the chemokine itself is involved in two dynamic processes: first, specific regions of the thymus continuously secrete the chemokine, and second, the chemokine diffuses over time and space. Thus, the migration of a thymocyte continuously changes as a function of secretion and diffusion of chemokines and the current locations of other migrating thymocytes and stationary stromal cells. This and much additional information is included in the simulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030013-g001">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that the simulated thymic lobule faithfully produces the fine anatomical relationships of real thymic structure; thousands of thymocytes, individually computed, localize, as seen in histological sections, to particular anatomical sites according to twelve distinct developmental stages—color-coded in the legend box.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030013-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the migratory path of a single thymocyte.

Thymocytes at the transition from DN to DP would normally migrate towards the chemokine CCL25 and enter the cortex, but the CCR9−/− cells cannot respond to this chemokine and are blocked. The blocked thymocytes, however, can still move randomly, and population pressure pushes them away from the SCZ, so that some of them reach their next developmental checkpoint—the cortical epithelial cells—passively. These fortunate cells can then mature into their next developmental stage and migrate towards the medulla (via a different chemokine), where they can further mature (depending on further selection events) into fully functional single-positive (SP) cells.

How selection for a range of T cell velocities might enhance defense against invaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b023">23</xref>] as well as for body maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b024">24</xref>] needs to be investigated.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030013-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030013.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Histogram of the Different Migration Velocities of Thymocytes</title><p>The faster cells are more likely to survive thymic selection by contacting the process of an epithelial cell; but slower cells also can have an advantage (see text).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030013.g007" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Competition for Niche Determines Lineage Commitment</title><p>Another prediction emerging from cell competition relates to lineage commitment. A developing thymocyte must choose whether to become an SP CD4 T cell (helper) or an SP CD8 T cell (cytotoxic). The decision-making process is obscure because mature SP CD4 and CD8 T cells evolve from precursors that are DP for both CD4 and CD8, yet CD4 cells predominate at a 2:1 ratio. Current theories of lineage commitment deal with the molecular details of the choice. The two most significant themes in the theories distinguish between an “instruction” approach and a “stochastic” approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b025">25</xref>]. The “instruction” approach proposes that the productive interaction of a T cell receptor with a particular major histocompatability complex (MHC) molecule, class I (for CD8) or class II (for CD4) as the case may be, rewards the thymocyte and induces a genetic choice to differentiate to the CD8 or CD4 phenotype. The more fitting T cell receptor–MHC interaction instructs the T cell. The “stochastic” approach proposes that SP CD4 or CD8 thymocytes are “randomly” generated, and are later selected according to their functional performance with the MHC. These theories attempt to found lineage choice on its molecular components aimed at showing where exactly, during development, the cell chooses its lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b027">27</xref>].</p><p>However, the emergence of competition between thymocytes for interaction space provides a novel solution to the CD4:CD8 2:1 paradox. If the dissociation rates of CD8 cells from epithelial cells are lower than those of CD4 cells, then the CD8 cells will remain longer at their epithelial-cell interaction stations (peptide-MHC I sites). As long as a CD8 thymocyte lingers at a peptide-MHC 1 niche, this niche is unavailable for other, competing CD8 thymocytes. CD8 thymocytes, we propose, do not compete with the CD4 thymocytes, because CD4 thymocytes compete among themselves for stimulation by interacting with peptide–MHC II stations on epithelial cells. We tested the outcome on lineage frequency of simulating different dissociation rates for interactions between epithelial cells and CD4 and CD8 thymocytes. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030013-g008">Figure 8</xref>. It can be seen that about two-thirds of thymocytes will mature into CD4 T cells and one-third into CD8 T cells (the de facto ratio) when the dissociation rate of CD8 thymocytes is 1.7 to 3.3 times slower than the dissociation rate of CD4 thymocytes. A relatively greater avidity of CD8 cells for epithelial cell niches (by 1.7–3.3) would generate the observed lineage predominance of CD4 T cells.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030013-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030013.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Influence of CD4 and CD8 Dissociation Rates on Lineage Commitment Ratio</title><p>Measuring the ratio of CD4 mature cells to CD8 mature cells, in silico, as a function of the dissociation rate, we find that to achieve the experimentally measured 2:1 ratio, the dissociation rate of CD8 cells should be anywhere between 0.38 to 0.45 that of CD4 thymocytes. The expanded insert zooms in on this zone, which produces the experimentally observed ratio of two CD4 cells for every CD8 cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030013-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows that an increase in the dissociation rate of CD8 over CD4 could result in a CD4:CD8 population equilibrium, or even to overpopulation of the thymus with CD8 cells, depending on the relative dissociation rate.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030013.g008" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>RA analysis of thymocyte development sheds new light on the dynamic relationship between molecules and cells in generating the structure and function of the thymus organ. First, we can see that the existing body of data, however discrete and piecemeal, can be integrated by RA simulation into a representation of the functional anatomy of the thymus seen in histologic sections. What we know about cells and molecules can indeed account for what we see; the macroscale organ emerges from the microscale mass of data in hand. In this regard, RA can be said to validate the database. Note, however, that classical histologic sections are two-dimensional slices of a three-dimensional organ frozen in time; RA simulation adds the dimension of time—dynamics—and so shows us the formative power of the dynamic flux of cells, molecules, and interactions that give rise to the higher-scale organ. In another project involving a different organ, we are currently extending RA simulations to accommodate the third dimension in space; hopefully, the added complexity of the representation will enhance our understanding of the biology.</p><p>Second, RA simulation offers novel explanations for the observed outcomes of experimental intervention. In our case, for example, RA simulation suggested that the lack of phenotype observed in mice with CCR9 knocked out (CCR9−/−) might be explained by dynamic compensation through population pressure. RA simulation also explains the competitive growth advantage enjoyed by wild-type cells over CCR9−/− cells. Indeed, overexpression of CCR9 on thymocytes leads to an in vivo phenotype that can be explained by RA as an untimely attraction of the thymocytes by cortical epithelial cells. RA simulation also suggests that the absence of thymic output resulting from CXCR4 inhibition can be attributed to the nonmigratory behavior of cells entering the thymus.</p><p>Third, the visualization of cell dynamics through RA provides a view of emergent physiology. Although the thymus is packed full of cells, the existence of competition among thymocytes for space and stimulation has not been a subject for experimentation or even discussion; competition is simply not seen in static histologic sections. Since competition was not recorded in the database, we did not explicitly program competition into our model. Nevertheless, cell competition emerged before our very eyes as we witnessed, via RA, the animated struggle between individual thymocytes for productive interactions with thymic epithelial cells. In silico manipulation of various parameters suggested that thymocyte competition might function as an important factor in three emergent properties of T cell maturation: the functional anatomy of the thymus, the selection of thymocytes with a range of migratory velocities, and the relative preponderance of SP CD4 T cells. Obviously, these suggestions require experimental validation<italic>.</italic> Irrespective of the outcome, however, the animation arm of RA, in providing a higher-scale view of complex emergent properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b028">28</xref>], can alert us to new questions for experimentation. Ultimately, we would like to model a complete biological system—an entire cell, organ, or organism—in a way that is sufficiently realistic so as to be able to test the role of any known fact about the system. This goal has been formulated as the ability of a model to pass a sort of Turing test, and can be viewed as taking to the utmost limit the notion of prediction, confirmation, and verification of emergent properties; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030013-b029">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4X0X1"><title>Simulation.</title><p>The RA simulation was written in C++ using the Rhapsody tool, and so RA code was generated by Rhapsody's code-generation engine, initiated by the language of Statecharts. To this automatically generated code, manually encoded objects and function were added. RA is the bridge made between the running simulation and the animation. Communication is made over a TCP/IP connection between a server implementing the Statecharts simulation and built-in animation functions in Flash. We used Matlab to analyze populations and population-level behavior.
