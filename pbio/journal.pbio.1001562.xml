      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Wnt Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway is a highly conserved regulator of cellular orientation within the plane of an epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Bayly1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Seifert1">[2]</xref>. Genetic and molecular studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicate Disheveled (Dsh), a cytoplasmic transducer of Wnt signaling; Frizzled (Fz), a seven-transmembrane receptor for Wnt ligands; and Van Gogh (Vang), a four-pass transmembrane protein, as core Wnt-PCP proteins. Intriguingly, the Wnt-PCP pathway regulates axon outgrowth rather than neuronal polarity during brain development of both vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Lyuksyutova1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Tissir1">[5]</xref>. The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is a member of a highly conserved family of type I transmembrane proteins that includes APP, APLP1, and APLP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Jacobsen1">[6]</xref> in mammals and APP-Like, or APPL, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Luo1">[7]</xref>. APP proteins show not only structural but also functional conservation, as exemplified by the ability of human APP to rescue behavioral phenotypes of APPL null flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Luo2">[8]</xref>. APP is the subject of intense research because of genetic and biochemical links to Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereby the proteolytic processing of APP generates the Amyloid Beta peptide whose accumulation in the brain is widely thought to induce neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Bayer1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Pereira1">[12]</xref>. Despite these efforts, the normal physiological function of APP in vivo in the nervous system remains elusive and highly controversial. This is due to the lack of a consensus over the neuronal phenotypes in null mutant animals and the mechanism of APP action in vivo. APP knock-out mice are viable and show developmental neuronal deficits, namely cortical migration and agenesis of the corpus callosum, at variable penetrance depending on genetic background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Muller1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-YoungPearse1">[15]</xref>. In contrast, another in vivo report, based mainly on gain of function and RNA interference experiments, suggests that APP may be required for developmental axonal degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Nikolaev1">[16]</xref>, although it is unclear whether APP knock-out mice show these phenotypes. Finally, initial findings proposed an axonal transport function for APP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Kamal1">[17]</xref> but later studies strongly questioned the presence of these defects in APP knock-out mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Lazarov1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mechanistically, there is also disagreement on whether APP acts cell autonomously or non autonomously. For example, an extensive network of molecular interactions has been described for the intracellular domain of APP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Russo1">[19]</xref>, yet a knock-in of APP lacking the intracellular domain appears to rescue physiological and learning deficits reported in APP knock-out mice, suggesting that the intracellular domain is dispensable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Ring1">[20]</xref>. Because current models based on Amyloid toxicity do not provide a complete explanation for the onset of neuronal dysfunction in AD, it has long been argued that greater attention needs to shift towards understanding the normal physiological function of APP in order to assess its potential contribution to AD pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Neve1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Selkoe1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of the in vivo physiological function of APP proteins is of paramount importance. To elucidate the function and mechanism of action of APP proteins in vivo, we first investigated <italic>Drosophila</italic> APPL, the APP homologue in the fruit fly, as a model system. We show that APPL is a novel neuronal-specific modulator of the PCP pathway required for the robustness of axonal outgrowth during the development of the Mushroom Bodies (MB), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> center for learning and memory. APPL carries out this function through facilitating the PCP-specific phosphorylation of the Wnt adaptor protein Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl) by the Abelson kinase (Abl). Furthermore, we show that APPL is part of the membrane complex formed by Wnt-PCP core proteins. Finally, biochemical and cell biological analyses show that human APP immunoprecipitates mammalian PCP proteins and that APP proteins are necessary for Dvl phosphorylation in response to the PCP ligand Wnt5a. Therefore, the APP proteins represent a novel and conserved family of neuronal modulators of Wnt-PCP signaling required for the robustness of brain wiring during development.</p>

         <p><italic>Drosophila</italic> APPL is a neuronal-specific protein expressed in most, if not all, neurons throughout development and adult life.

         <p>We began addressing the function of APPL in neuronal development by carefully examining the development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MB in <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutant flies. The MB derives from two groups of four neuroblasts, one in each hemisphere, that sequentially generate three subsets of neurons: the γ-, α′β′ and αβ neurons, where APPL is highly expressed. Each αβ neuron projects an axon that branches into a dorsal “α branch” and a medial “β branch.” The fascicles generated by each of these branches are referred to as the α lobe and β lobe. The α and β lobes can be easily visualized using the anti-FascilinII (FasII) antibody. The lobes were present and morphologically normal in 97 adult control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) examined. In contrast, 26% of <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> brains examined (<italic>n</italic> = 101) showed axonal defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Specifically, 14% of the brains show α-lobe loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), whereas 12% of the brains show β-lobe loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). These defects are developmental in origin as they can be observed during αβ lobe formation at 48 h of pupal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g001">Figure 1H–J</xref>). To ascertain whether APPL acts cell autonomously to regulate MB axonal outgrowth, we generated GFP-marked single <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cell clones using the MARCM technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Lee1">[24]</xref>. While none of the control clones showed any defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), 10% of the mutant clones showed lack of β-lobe growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s002">S2A</xref>), similar to the penetrance observed in null mutant brains. However, none of the mutant clones showed loss of α-lobe growth. Taken together, these data indicate that APPL is required for normal MB axonal outgrowth and that it is required cell-autonomously for the growth of the β-lobe and non-cell autonomously for the growth of α lobe. To verify the specificity of the <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> phenotype, we rescued the defects by restoring APPL expression in αβ neurons. Expression of full-length membrane-bound APPL, but not a secreted form or a form lacking the intracellular domain (ApplΔC), strongly suppresses the β-lobe loss phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g002">Figures 2C–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s002">S2B</xref>). These results indicate that APPL is required as a full-length, membrane-tethered protein and that the intracellular signaling downstream of APPL is necessary for normal β-lobe outgrowth. Interestingly, secreted APPL strongly reduces the loss of the α lobe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s002">Figure S2C and S2D</xref>), confirming that APPL acts non-autonomously in α-lobe outgrowth. All together, the results suggest that APPL is a robustness factor for an unknown axon growth signal whereby <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> αβ neurons are at a phenotypic threshold that causes them to fail to grow in approximately 26% of the cases.</p>

         <title>Abelson Kinase Is a Downstream Effector of APPL Required for MB Axon Outgrowth</title>
         <p>To unravel the mechanism by which APPL supports MB axon outgrowth, we chose to focus on the cell-autonomous function of APPL in the β lobe. A previous study using APPL gain of function indicates that APPL overexpression induces axonal outgrowth that is dependent on Abl kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Leyssen1">[25]</xref>. We asked whether Abl kinase also acts downstream of APPL during MB β-lobe growth. First, we tested if APPL genetically interacts with Abl. To this end we analyzed the adult MB morphology of <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup>; <italic>Abl</italic><sup>−/+</sup> flies. Loss of one copy of Abelson causes a dramatic increase (up to 51%) in complete (41%) or partial (10%) β-lobe loss, compared to <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g003">Figure 3A, 3B and 3E, 3F</xref>).

Similarly to <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants alone, the phenotypes arise at early developmental stages (Figure S3A). To further confirm that Abl is the downstream mediator of APPL signaling during β-lobe growth, we tested if overexpression of Abl specifically in MB αβ neurons rescues the <italic>Appl</italic> null phenotype. We find that wild-type Abl, but not a Kinase Dead (Abl-KD) form of Abl, rescues the <italic>Appl</italic> null phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g003">Figure 3C–F</xref>) to the same extent as MB αβ expression of APPL itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Taken together these data indicate that Abl is the effector of APPL required for the β-lobe growth. Next, we further characterized the downstream pathway involved.</p>

         <title>APPL Is a Novel Neuronal-Specific Modulator of PCP Signaling</title>
         <p>It has been recently shown that Abl phosphorylates Disheveled (Dsh), a core intracellular component of the Wnt pathway, on the Tyrosine 473.

         <p>Together, these observations prompted us to speculate that APPL acts to facilitate Wnt-PCP pathway activation during MB development by mediating Dsh phosphorylation by Abl. To verify this hypothesis we tested if the phosphorylation of Dsh on Y473 is required for MB development. We analyzed <italic>dsh<sup>1</sup></italic> flies harboring one of two genomic rescue constructs: a wild-type construct (<italic>dsh-DshGFP-wt</italic>) or a Tyrosine 473 phospho-mutant construct (<italic>dsh-DshGFP-Y473F</italic>). Whereas the restoration of wild-type Dsh fully rescues the <italic>dsh<sup>1</sup></italic> MB phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s004">S4A</xref>), Dsh<sup>Y473F</sup> completely fails to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g004">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s004">S4A</xref>). To exclude that Dsh<sup>Y473F</sup> failure to rescue the phenotype is due to a perturbation in the expression pattern resulting from the point mutation, we performed anti-GFP staining on adult brains of both transgenic lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>, both wild type and mutant Dsh are expressed in the MB lobes. These results clearly indicate that Abl phosphorylation of Dsh on Tyrosine 473 and the subsequent activation of Wnt-PCP signaling are required for the β-lobe growth.</p>
         <p>Collectively, the data suggest the exciting possibility that APPL may be a neuronal-specific component of the Wnt-PCP pathway. To address this issue, we first asked if APPL interacts genetically with core members of the Wnt-PCP pathway like the classical Wnt-PCP receptor Fz and the canonical Wnt-PCP protein Van Gogh/Strabismus (Vang/Stbm). We first analyzed the β-lobe of <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup>; <italic>Fz</italic><sup>−/+</sup> flies. Reduction of Fz in the APPL null background increases the frequency of the β lobe loss up to 21%, whereas no phenotype is observed in control siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g005">Figures 5B, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s005">S5A</xref>). This interaction is specific to the MB because expression of a dominant negative form of Fz (Fz-DN) in <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> αβ neurons yields similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g005">Figures 5C, 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s005">S5A</xref>). In both experiments described, the increase in β-lobe loss is relatively mild compared to the dramatic increase in β-lobe loss due to APPL-Abl epistasis for example, suggesting that APPL and Fz may act together for Wnt-PCP activation. To clarify this, we tested if inhibition of Fz alone is sufficient to induce the β phenotype. Overexpression of Fz-DN in αβ neurons of wild-type flies did not cause any morphological defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>). These data were further confirmed by the analysis of <italic>Fz</italic> mutant αβ clones of different sizes. None of the analyzed MB clones showed morphologically aberrant axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). To rule out compensation by Fz2, we examined Fz2 expression in the brain and found that it is not detectable in MB (unpublished data). Furthermore, MARCM clones null for Fz2 alone or Fz and Fz2 together show no aberrant morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s005">Figure S5D and S5E</xref>). Therefore, APPL function is a critical determinant of the role of PCP in the outgrowth of MB β axons. To further ascertain the interaction with the Wnt-PCP pathway, we analyzed if APPL interacts with the Wnt-PCP four-pass transmembrane protein Vang/Stbm. Reduction of Van Gogh in the <italic>Appl</italic> null background (<italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup>;<italic>vang</italic><sup>−/+</sup>) increases the frequency of the β-lobe loss phenotype to 33% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g005">Figures 5D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s005">S5A</xref>), whereas no phenotype is observed in control siblings. APPL is also expressed in the developing fly retina (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s005">Figure S5F</xref>), where the PCP pathway regulates the polarity of photoreceptor cells. However, we did not observe defects in photoreceptor polarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s005">Figure S5G</xref>–I), suggesting that the role of APPL in Wnt-PCP signaling is specific to axonal outgrowth. Together, the data above identify APPL as the first neuronal-specific modulator of the Wnt-PCP pathway's role in axonal outgrowth. Next, we analyzed if the expression pattern of Vang and APPL overlaps during MB development. For this purpose, we used a line that expresses a YFP tagged form of Vang under the control of the Actin promoter. As shown in Figure 5F, during the development of the β lobe both APPL and Vang are expressed at a high level in the growing axons. Interestingly, in adult stage, APPL expression is reduced in the rest of the brain and enriched in the αβ neurons while Vang levels are strongly reduced in these axons (Figure 5G). Moreover, in the developing fly retina, APPL and Vang do not colocalize and are found in juxtaposed domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001562.s005">Figure S5L</xref>). Taken together these results suggest that both APPL and Vang are present in developing αβ axons where their genetic interaction is required for the correct development of the β axons. On the contrary, the two proteins are expressed in different compartments in the fly retina where APPL function is not required for PCP activity.</p>

         <p>Finally, to confirm that PCP signaling is indeed positively modulated by APPL and that the activation of the signaling is required for the β-lobe growth, we performed rescue experiments with Dsh. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, overexpression of Dsh in the <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> background strongly reduces (7%) the β-lobe loss but does not fully rescue the phenotype. This result indicates that the phosphorylation of Dsh by Abelson is the limiting step in the activation of PCP signaling; increasing the amount of Dsh present in the neurons improves the phenotype, but probably the endogenous Abelson is not sufficient to phosphorylate the whole pool of Dsh. To overcome this problem we decided to enhance the activation of PCP signaling by overexpressing Wnt5 in the <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> background. Interestingly, overexpression of Wnt5 significantly rescues the β-lobe loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g005">Figure 5H</xref>), indicating that the PCP signaling activation is required for the development of the β lobe and is reduced in absence of APPL.</p>

         <title>APP Is Required for Dvl2 Phosphorylation in Response to Wnt5 and Forms Complexes with PCP Core Proteins</title>
         <p>The previously described results raise two important questions. First, is the interaction between APPL and the Wnt-PCP pathway conserved in mammalian APP proteins? Second, if so, do the genetic interactions observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reflect a biochemical association of APPL/APP with the Wnt-PCP receptors? To address these issues, we first investigated if mouse APP proteins mediate the phosphorylation of mouse Disheveled (Dvl) in response to the Wnt-PCP ligand Wnt5a. To this end, we analyzed Dvl phosphorylation in response to Wnt5a treatment in wild-type versus APP/APLP2 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast (dKO MEFs). In WT MEFs, Dvl2 phosphorylation increases dramatically upon treatment with Wnt5a. In contrast, Dvl2 in dKO MEFs completely fails to respond to Wnt5a treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The effect on the activation of Dvl2 is a direct consequence of APP loss because upon reintroduction of APP cDNA Dvl2 phosphorylation is restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Next, we tested if APPL and APP interacts with core Wnt-PCP receptor proteins. In particular, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analyses of tagged proteins expressed in HEK-293T cells.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of neurons in specific regions of the brain that correlates with progressive impairment of higher cognitive functions. A growing body of evidence identifies the APP and its metabolite the Aβ peptide as main players in the pathogenesis of AD. In particular, the accumulation of Aβ peptides in the brain seems to be the trigger of the pathological cascade that eventually results in neuronal loss and degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Tanzi1">[33]</xref>. Despite efforts to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying Aβ's toxic function, it is still not clear what triggers the accumulation of the peptide and how this is correlated with the pathogenesis of the disease and the dementia. In fact, most of the work done to unveil the pathogenesis of the disease has focused on the analysis of Aβ-peptide and the search for its receptors and downstream effectors. Even though the numerous in vitro studies performed in cell culture identified several molecules that interact with Aβ peptide, the in vivo biological relevance of these interactions remains to be clarified. The amyloid cascade hypothesis has also dominated the search for AD treatments, but the promising molecular candidates developed to modulate the Aβ peptide and reached clinical trials failed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Hardy1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Karran1">[35]</xref>. Finally, over the last few years many studies indicated that there is no linear correlation between the accumulation of the peptide and the cognitive decline, leading to a revision of the amyloidogenic hypothesis. Taken together, these observations suggest that the accumulation of the peptide is not the only cause of the pathology and that other factors are involved. Interestingly, under physiological conditions APP is mainly found in its uncleaved or α-cleaved form, suggesting that the shift towards amyloidogenic processing not only increases the production of Aβ peptide but also depletes the pool of APP that undergoes non-amyloidogenic processing, with hitherto unknown consequences. It is therefore of paramount importance to understand the physiological role of APP and how perturbing this role could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. An important contribution to the study of the function of a protein comes from the analysis of the knock-out (KO) animals. In the case of APP, several KO models have been generated and analyzed in detail both from the morphological and behavioral point of view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Muller1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Li1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Heber1">[38]</xref>. Despite these efforts, the normal physiological function of APP in vivo in the nervous system remains largely elusive and highly controversial. This is due to the lack of consensus over the neuronal phenotypes in null mutant animals and the mechanism of action in vivo. The data collected by different labs confirmed the involvement of APPs in development and function of the nervous system, but these studies do not provide an in-depth analysis of the development of the brain during the pre-natal stages or the molecular mechanism underlying APPs' putative functions. We therefore took advantage of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to further analyze the consequence of loss of APP Like (APPL) during brain development.</p>
      <p>In the present study we demonstrate that APPL is involved in brain development of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, particularly in the Mushroom Body (MB) neurons. We show that APPL is required for the development of αβ neurons. In <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> flies, MB neurons fail to project the α lobe in 14% of the cases and the β-lobe in 12% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Further analysis of the phenotype reveals that APPL is required cell-autonomously for the development of the β lobe and non-cell autonomously for the development of the α lobe. In fact, single cell <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> clones display only β-lobe loss and no α loss. The re-introduction of a full-length, membrane-tethered form of APPL, but not a soluble form, rescues β-lobe loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This is of particular interest because it confirms that, similar to mammalian APPs, the physiological role of APPL is mediated both by its full-length form, required in the neurons to achieve the correct β-lobe pattern, and by its soluble form (sAPPL) that regulates the extension of the α lobe. Moreover, the rescue data indicate that, at least in this context, the function of sAPPL is mediated not by homo-dimerization with the full-length form but by some other receptor, hitherto unknown. Further experiments are required to clarify the sAPPL non-cell autonomous effect, but we hypothesize that it might be involved in modulating signaling mediated by the cells that surround the MB axons. Taken together, the analysis of the <italic>Appl</italic><sup>−/−</sup> animals confirmed the important role of APPs during brain development but reinforced the idea that the phenotypes are present with incomplete penetrance and might be subtle. It would therefore be of interest to analyze the phenotype of the KO mice in greater detail and, in particular, to better characterize the APP's downstream pathway leading to these defects.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the results described clearly support a model of APPL as a novel, neuronal-specific positive modulator of the Wnt-PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The PCP pathway was initially described because of its role in tissue polarity establishment and, in particular, of its regulation of cell orientation in plane of an epithelium. Among the different processes regulated by PCP signaling, we are interested in axon growth and guidance. It has been described that mice null for <italic>Fzd3</italic>/<italic>Ceslr3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> genes show severe defects in several major axon tracts like thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and nigrostriatal tracts, defects of the anterior commissure, and similarly to APP KO mice, the variable loss of the corpus callosum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Tissir1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Wang1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The molecular mechanism underlying the function of PCP-signaling in regulating tissue polarity has been broadly studied. The current model suggests that, upon polarized expression of the different core proteins, Dsh is recruited to the membrane via Fz and leads to the activation of a cascade of small GTPases finally resulting in cytoskeleton rearrangements. In the case of regulation of axon growth and guidance, it is less clear how the signaling is regulated and transmitted to the cytoskeleton. A recent publication suggested that during axon growth the transmembrane PCP receptor-like Vang and Fzd are localized at the growth cone area on the tip of the fillopodia, thus suggesting that in this context the asymmetric localization is not needed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Shafer1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Dsh needs to relocalize from the cytoplasm to the membrane to ensure the proper activation of PCP signaling, and this is dependent on its phosphorylation status. Singh and colleagues showed that Abelson is one kinase responsible for this modification, but the receptor upstream of the kinase was not identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Singh1">[26]</xref>. Based on the evidence we generated, we propose that APPL is a novel regulator of Wnt-PCP pathway involved in axon growth and guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001562-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This is of interest because while the PCP core proteins are ubiquitously expressed, APPL is restricted to the nervous system, suggesting that it could be the first described tissue-specific modulator of the pathway.</p>

            <p>Schematic representation of the proposed model. APPL is a novel regulator of Wnt-PCP pathway. In the presence of Wnt signaling, Fz binds Dsh, which needs to be phosphorylated by Abelson kinase to correctly relocalize to the membrane. We propose that Appl is part of the membrane complex formed by the core PCP proteins Fz1 and Vang. In turn, Appl recruits Abelson kinase to the complex and positively modulates Dsh phosphorylation. The subsequent activation of the signaling is required for MB β-axon growth.</p>

      <p>Mechanistically, we propose that APPL-Abl complex modulates Dsh via dual protein-protein interactions. First, Abl might have an intrinsic affinity for its substrate Dsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Singh1">[26]</xref>. Secondly, this interaction is strengthened or stabilized by the inclusion of APPL in a PCP receptor complex. This dual affinity complex leads to increased PCP signaling efficiency at the developing growth cone. Both biochemical and physiological data show that this function is highly conserved in mammalian APP, suggesting that it may play a similar role in the mammalian brain. The canonical-Wnt signaling pathway has already been connected to AD pathogenesis because of its link to the tau-kinase GSK-3β. Interestingly, no clear link between the Wnt-PCP pathway and this neurodegenerative disorder has been made. Previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Srahna1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Shafer1">[28]</xref> show that, in flies and mice, Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) is the final effector of PCP in axon outgrowth and JNK was shown to be required for the effect of APP overexpression in the fly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Leyssen1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Taru1">[40]</xref>. Interestingly, JNK signaling has also been linked to the neuronal loss observed in AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001562-Kihiko1">[41]</xref>. It is therefore worth investigating whether the physiological function of APP as a neuronal PCP modulator explains the JNK-AD connection.</p>

<caption><p>APP proteins are found in core PCP complexes. (A) APP expression levels in wild-type MEFs, KO MEFs, or KO MEFs stably transfected with APP. Two clones of rescue MEFs were analyzed. Clone B shows detectable APP levels and was used for the Wnt5 stimulation assay. (B) Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) of Appl-FLAG and Vang-Myc. The tagged proteins were co-expressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Appl-FLAG can be precipitated upon IP of Vang. The Co-IP in this direction is weaker than after pull-down of Appl-Flag. (C) Co-IP of Appl-FLAG and human Vangl2-HA. Appl-FLAG can be precipitated upon IP of human Vangl2-HA. (D) Co-IP of APP (C99)-FLAG and Vangl2-HA. The tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from whole cells with anti-HA antibody. APP (C99)-FLAG can be precipitated upon IP of human Vangl2-HA. (E) Control co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed Appl-FLAG and Vangl2-HA. The proteins were separately expressed in different cells plated in two different dishes and pooled during the Co-IP procedure. The IP was performed with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibody and followed by Western blot analysis. The proteins do not co-immunoprecipitate when expressed in different populations of cells. (F) Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) of Appl-FLAG and Fz-GFP. Appl-FLAG can be precipitated upon IP of Fz.</p>
