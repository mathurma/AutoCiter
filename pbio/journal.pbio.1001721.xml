<p>Protein turnover of Patched, the Hedgehog receptor and key negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling, is controlled by the ubiquitin E3 ligase, Smurf, in a manner that depends on activation of signal transducer, Smoothened.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Hedgehog signaling plays conserved roles in controlling embryonic development; its dysregulation has been implicated in many human diseases including cancers. Hedgehog signaling has an unusual reception system consisting of two transmembrane proteins, Patched receptor and Smoothened signal transducer. Although activation of Smoothened and its downstream signal transduction have been intensively studied, less is known about how Patched receptor is regulated, and particularly how this regulation contributes to appropriate Hedgehog signal transduction. Here we identified a novel role of Smurf E3 ligase in regulating Hedgehog signaling by controlling Patched ubiquitination and turnover. Moreover, we showed that Smurf-mediated Patched ubiquitination depends on Smo activity in wing discs. Mechanistically, we found that Smo interacts with Smurf and promotes it to mediate Patched ubiquitination by targeting the K1261 site in Ptc. The further mathematic modeling analysis reveals that a bidirectional control of activation of Smo involving Smurf and Patched is important for signal-receiving cells to precisely interpret external signals, thereby maintaining Hedgehog signaling reliability. Finally, our data revealed an evolutionarily conserved role of Smurf proteins in controlling Hh signaling by targeting Ptc during development.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is a pathway renowned for its roles in controlling embryonic development and tumorigenesis. Signaling via this pathway proceeds when Hh ligands bind to the receptor Patched (Ptc), thereby preventing Ptc from inhibiting the signal transducer, Smoothened (Smo), and thus allowing Smo to accumulate on the cell surface where it becomes activated and promotes downstream signal transduction. In the absence of Hh ligands, Ptc inhibits Smo and is a key negative regulator of Hh signaling. In this study, we investigate how protein turnover of Ptc is controlled to ensure tight regulation of Hh signaling. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model system, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence to show that the E3 ligase, Smurf, directly controls Ptc protein turnover in developing wing discs. Moreover, we found that Smurf mediates Ptc degradation in a manner that depends on Smo signaling activity: activated Smo forms a complex with Smurf to preferentially promote degradation of the ligand-unbound Ptc receptor. Using mathematic modeling we reveal that the control of Smo activation by the opposing activities of Smurf and Ptc, is important for cells receiving the Hh signal to precisely interpret and relay external signals. We show that this control mechanism is also active in vertebrates with evidence that zebrafish Smurf proteins target Ptc1 protein for degradation to control late somitogenesis during zebrafish embryogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is evolutionarily conserved and is essential for patterning of organs of both invertebrates and vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Ingham1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Ingham2">[2]</xref>. Dysregulation of Hh signaling activity leads to developmental abnormalities and cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Jiang1">[3]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, genetic and biochemical evidence revealed that two multi-span transmembrane proteins, Patched (Ptc, 12-span) and Smoothened (Smo, 7-span), serve as a reception system for Hh signal transduction in Hh-receiving cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Hooper1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Alcedo1">[5]</xref>. In the absence of Hh ligands, Ptc inhibits Smo activity, thereby blocking Hh signaling transduction, while in the presence of Hh, the Hh ligands, in concert with its co-factor iHog, physically interacts with Ptc and alleviates its inhibition on Smo, resulting in Smo accumulation on the cell surface and a conformational switch of Smo to an active form that regulates the distinct downstream target genes in an Hh concentration-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Zheng1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Hooper2">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>In Hh signaling, the mechanisms by which Smo activation leads to downstream target gene expression are generally understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Ingham2">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Jiang1">[3]</xref>. However, less is known about the regulation of the Hh signaling receptor Ptc. Given that <italic>ptc</italic> is a direct target of the Hh pathway and that Ptc itself negatively regulates Hh signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Denef1">[9]</xref>, Ptc expression must be tightly controlled to ensure proper Hh signal transduction. Previous studies have also shown that endogenous Ptc protein in Hh-receiving cells exhibits both plasma membrane and punctate-distribution patterns upon Hh ligand stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Lu1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Torroja1">[14]</xref>, suggesting that Hh signal potentially promotes Ptc turnover. However, the molecular mechanism underlying Ptc degradation in response to Hh signal remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>Protein turnover mediated by ubiquitin modification plays important roles in the regulation of numerous cellular processes during development. The enzymatic reaction of protein ubiquitination is a highly ordered multi-step process involving three classes of enzymes, including ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin ligases (E3s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Bernassola1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Wilkinson1">[16]</xref>. E3 ubiquitin ligases are crucial in the ubiquitin conjugation cascade because of their roles in the recruitment of ubiquitin-loaded E2s and their selective recognition of target proteins. Generally, the E3 ubiquitin ligases are classified into three subfamilies: the really interesting new gene (RING) finger domain containing E3s, the homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) domain containing E3s, and the U box E3s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Bernassola1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Rotin1">[17]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 4 (Nedd4), one member of the C2-WW-HECT family proteins, could physically associate with the Ptc protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Lu1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Fombonne1">[18]</xref>; however, whether the Nedd4 is involved in the regulation of Hh signaling activity through its interaction with Ptc remains unknown. Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor (Smurf) proteins are other members of the C2-WW-HECT E3 family of proteins that contain typical WW and HECT domains. Smurf proteins (including Smurf1 and Smurf2 in mammals) were originally identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for the degradation of R-Smad proteins and type I receptors to negatively regulate TGFβ/BMP signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Liang1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Chen2">[25]</xref>. Recently, Smurfs have also been shown to regulate cell motility by targeting RhoA for ubiquitin-mediated degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Ogunjimi1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Wang1">[27]</xref>, and are involved in the non-canonical Wnt signaling to regulate planar cell polarity by degrading the PCP core component, Prickle1 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Narimatsu1">[28]</xref>. We recently uncovered that Smurf functions in concert with Fused, a serine/threonine kinase that regulates Hedgehog signaling, to degrade the BMP type I receptor Tkv allowing for bam expression in differentiating cystoblast cells, thereby determining the fate of <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Xia1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Xia2">[24]</xref>. These studies revealed that Smurf proteins have diverse biological functions through regulating multiple signal pathways in different cellular contexts. In this study, we identified a novel role of Smurf E3 ligase in the regulation of Hh signaling by directly controlling Ptc protein turnover. Moreover, we found that Smurf mediates Ptc degradation in a manner that depends on Smo signaling activity. These findings revealed a novel mechanism by which an Hh signaling-dependent bidirectional control mechanism involving Ptc and Smurf is important for signal-receiving cells to precisely interpret external signal, thereby maintaining the reliability of Hh signaling transduction. Finally, we provided evidence that zebrafish Smurf proteins also modulate Hh signaling by controlling Ptc1 protein degradation to regulate late somitogenesis during zebrafish embryogenesis. Thus, our data support the conclusion that Smurf proteins have an evolutionarily conserved role in controlling Hh signaling during development.</p>

<title>Identification of Ptc as a Smurf-Interacting Protein</title>
<p>To explore novel biological functions of Smurf, we searched for Smurf-interacting partners by performing a yeast two-hybrid screen using the full-length <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smurf as bait. From this screen, we found three positive clones that encode two different C-terminal fragments of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ptc protein, Ptc-B4/5 and Ptc-L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s010">Table S1</xref>), indicating that Ptc could be a potential candidate as a Smurf-interacting partner. To confirm the interaction between Ptc and Smurf proteins, we then performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and found that Flag-tagged Smurf and Myc-tagged Ptc co-immunoprecipitated with each other in transfected S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Consistent with this, endogenous Smurf protein could be co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Ptc antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), revealing that Smurf and Ptc proteins are able to form a complex together in S2 cells. In agreement with the yeast-two-hybrid assay, domain-mapping analysis of Ptc revealed that the C-terminal tail was necessary and sufficient for Ptc to interact with Smurf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g001">Figure 1E, 1G, and 1H</xref>). To further define the essential domain(s) in Smurf required for its interaction with Ptc, we employed a series of previously described truncated forms of Smurf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Xia2">[24]</xref> in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g001">Figure 1I</xref>, while the C2 and HECT domains of Smurf were dispensable for its interaction with Ptc, the WW domains were essential for Smurf to form a complex with Ptc, suggesting that Smurf interacts with Ptc through its WW domains.</p>

<title>Identification of Ptc as a Smurf-interacting protein.</title>
<p>(A) A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed that identified Ptc as a Smurf-interacting protein. The AH109 yeast strain was transformed with the indicated plasmids and plated at permissive (−Leu/−Trp) and restrictive (−Ade/−His/−Leu/−Trp) medium. Full-length <italic>smurf</italic> were cloned into the bait vector, pGBKT7, as the bait for library screen; and pACT2 is the prey vector. B4/5 (aa 1174–1286) and L1 (aa 1198–1286) were two independent Ptc clones from the screen. (B and C) S2 cells were transfected with combinations of DNA constructs as indicated. After 48 h transfection, lysates from transfected S2 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (B) or anti-Myc affinity gel (C). Western blots were performed to analyze the presence of Flag- or Myc-tagged proteins. (D) S2 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-Ptc antibody or control mouse IgG. Western blots were performed to analyze the presence of Ptc or Smurf proteins. (E and F) Schematic drawings of Ptc (E) and Smurf (F) and their deletion constructs.

<title>Smurf Promotes Ptc Ubiquitination and Degradation through Its C-Tail</title>
<p>WW domains are typical domains in C2-WW-HECT subfamily E3 ligases for substrate recognition through their interaction with a proline-rich sequence (PPXY motif) in substrate proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Bernassola1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Macias1">[29]</xref>. Given that the C-terminal region of Ptc contains a consensus PPXY motif that has been shown to be required for the Ptc interaction with Nedd4, the other member of C2-WW-HECT subfamily E3 ligases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Lu1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Fombonne1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Casali1">[30]</xref>, and that mutations of PPXY in the C-terminal region of Ptc abolished the Ptc-Smurf interaction, as indicated in the GST pull-down and yeast-two-hybrid assays (Figures S1A and S8A), we reasoned that Ptc might be a strong candidate as a substrate of Smurf and determined whether Smurf regulates Ptc stability in S2 cell cultures. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>, overexpression of Smurf apparently downregulated the full-length Ptc, but not mutant Ptc (Ptc<sup>ΔCTD</sup>) that lacks the C-tail of Ptc, which showed more stability than the full-length Ptc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Interestingly, the level of Ptc protein could be significantly increased when cells were treated with either MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, a lysosome inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>), and Smurf promotes both Ub K48-linked and Ub K63-linked ubiquitination of Ptc, as indicated by multiple co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by Western blot assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g002">Figures 2E, 2F</xref>, and S1C–S1F), suggesting the stability of Ptc is regulated through both proteasome and lysosome pathways. Consistent with this observation, the downregulation of the full-length of Ptc protein mediated by co-expression of Smurf was markedly blocked by treatments with both MG132 and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Collectively, our data argue that Smurf promotes Ptc degradation through its C-tail in cell cultures.</p>

As shown in ubiquitination assays, overexpression of the wild-type form of Smurf significantly increased the ubiquitin conjugation of full-length Ptc or the C-tail of Ptc, but the catalytic dead form of Smurf (Smurf<sup>C1029A</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Liang1">[19]</xref> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g002">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s002">S2A–S2E</xref>). We noted that overexpression of Smurf<sup>C1029A</sup> reduced ubiquitination of Ptc, suggesting its dominant negative role in regulating Ptc ubiquitination in S2 cells, likely due to the fact that Smurf<sup>C1029A</sup> interacted with Ptc in cultured cells, and thus competitively inhibited endogenous Smurf function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s002">Figure S2F</xref>). Consistent with these observations, we found that knockdown of Smurf markedly reduced the full-length Ptc ubiquitination in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g002">Figure 2I</xref>). To ask whether the C-tail of Ptc is responsible for its ubiquitination mediated by Smurf, we co-overexpressed Ptc<sup>ΔCTD</sup> and Smurf in S2 cells.

<title>Smurf Regulates Hh Signaling Pathway by Controlling Ptc Turnover <italic>In Vivo</italic></title>
<p>To determine the biological link between Smurf and Hh signaling, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs and adult wings as an assay system to assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of <italic>smurf</italic> in Hh signaling during development. In wing discs, Hh produced in the posterior compartment cells induces the anterior compartment cells adjacent to the A/P boundary to express <italic>dpp</italic> and <italic>ptc</italic>, which respond to low levels and higher levels of Hh activity, respectively. It has been documented that, while activation of Hh signaling is essential for the proper patterning of the intervein region between L3 and L4 of adult wing, downregulation of Hh signaling causes the reduction of the intervein region between L3 and L4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Mohler1">[34]</xref>. To test whether <italic>smurf</italic> is involved in the regulation of Hh signaling, we first measured the area between L3 and L4 space and the whole wing in wild type and <italic>smurf</italic> mutants. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g002">Figure 2K–2M</xref>, loss of <italic>smurf</italic> led to a slight but evident reduction (<italic>n</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) of the intervein region between L3 and L4, compared to the wild-type control, suggesting that <italic>smurf</italic> might function as a positive modulator in Hh signaling pathway. To confirm this observation, we then overexpressed Flag-tagged Smurf or Flag-tagged Smurf<sup>C1029A</sup> in the wing discs using the <italic>MS1096-gal4</italic>, a driver that has higher activity in the dorsal compartment of wing discs, and measured the expression levels of Ci and <italic>dpp-lacZ</italic>, the responsive reporter to the low level of Hh signaling.

<p>We noted that overexpression of <italic>smurf</italic> by <italic>MS1096-gal4</italic> driver markedly increased <italic>dpp-lacZ</italic> expression, but did not apparently affect the levels of both Ptc protein and <italic>ptc-lacZ</italic>, which responds to a higher level of Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g003">Figure 3G–3H′</xref>). Accordingly, knockdown of <italic>smurf</italic> did not dramatically affect the global levels of Ptc protein either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g003">Figure 3D′</xref>). One possibility could be that <italic>ptc</italic> transcripts and Ptc protein can compensate for each other, owing to the negatively regulatory role of Ptc protein in Hh signaling. To validate this issue, we blocked new Ptc protein synthesis from Ptc transcripts by pre-treatment of the discs with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), and then assessed whether Smurf controls the Ptc protein turnover. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s003">Figure S3D–S3K</xref>, after the CHX treatment, overexpression of <italic>smurf</italic> by the <italic>MS1096-gal4</italic> greatly reduced the Ptc protein expression level, whereas knockdown of <italic>smurf</italic> evidently increased Ptc levels, compared to the discs without the CHX treatment. To confirm these findings, we then expressed the Ptc by the <italic>en-gal4</italic> driver in smurf mutants. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g003">Figure 3J–3L</xref>, expression of Ptc<sup>WT</sup> led to much more severe wing phenotype in <italic>smurf</italic> mutants than that in wild-type background.

<title>Activation of Smo Promotes Smurf-Mediated Ptc Ubiquitination</title>
<p>Given that the function of Smurf that targets Ptc is restricted to the A/P boundary cells, which exhibit high levels of Hh signaling activity, we reasoned that Smurf might regulate Ptc protein turnover via responding to the high levels of Hh signaling activity. However, a recent study proposed that Ptc degradation might depend on Ptc itself, since a high level of Ptc is also present in the A/P boundary cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Casali1">[30]</xref>. To distinguish these two potential mechanisms by which Smurf mediates Ptc degradation, we employed the P{<italic>hs-ptc:gfp</italic>} transgene to overexpress Ptc:green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the wing discs by heat-shock treatment, which is independent of Hh signaling. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g004">Figure 4A–4A′ and 4B–4B′</xref>, overexpression of either the wild-type Smurf or Smurf<sup>C1029A</sup> by the <italic>ap-gal4</italic> driver did not affect the expression of Ptc:GFP induced by heat-shock treatment in the wing discs, suggesting that expression of Ptc itself is not sufficient to induce Smurf-mediated Ptc degradation. To test whether Smurf could regulate Ptc turnover in response to Hh signaling, we next established an ectopic Hh signaling activation system by overexpression of the activated forms of Smo (Smo<sup>SD12</sup> or Smo<sup>SD123</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Jia1">[11]</xref> in the A-compartment of wing discs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g004">Figure 4C–4J</xref>, overexpression of either Smo<sup>SD12</sup> or Smo<sup>SD123</sup> was sufficient to upregulate Ptc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g004">Figure 4D and 4G</xref>). In particular, the high level of Ptc in the A-compartment cells induced by Smo<sup>SD123</sup> was comparable with that in the A/P boundary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Given that Hh is absent in A-compartment cells away from A/P boundary and that activated Smo-induced Hh signaling is independent of Ptc expression, this system circumvents the compensatory feedback regulation between Ptc expression and Hh signaling in the A-compartment cells. We then probed whether Smurf degrades Ptc in the cells with ectopic Hh signaling activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g004">Figure 4E, 4F, 4H, and 4I</xref>, overexpression of Smurf but not Smurf<sup>C1029A</sup> by the <italic>MS1096-gal4</italic> significantly downregulated the levels of Ptc protein ectopically induced by the expression of Smo<sup>SD12</sup> or Smo<sup>SD123</sup> in A compartment cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g004">Figure 4D and 4H</xref>). Moreover, we found that overexpression of Smurf by the <italic>MS1096-gal4</italic> did not affect Hh signaling activity induced by the activated Smo, as indicated by the fact that the expression levels of <italic>ptc-lacZ</italic> or <italic>dpp-lacZ</italic> were not evidently changed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g004">Figure 4K–4N</xref>, although overexpression of Smurf slightly reduced Smo<sup>SD123</sup> levels (unpublished data). Thus, activation of Smo is sufficient to promote Ptc protein degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test whether the Smurf-mediated Ptc degradation is attributed to activation of Smo downstream signaling, we performed genetic assays by overexpression of constitutively activated form of Ci (Ci<sup>103</sup>) in the wing disc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Zhao1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Jia1">[11]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s004">Figure S4A–S4D</xref>, overexpression of Smurf had no detectable effect on Ptc protein stability induced by Ci<sup>103</sup> expression in wing discs. Thus, our results suggest that Smurf-mediated Ptc protein degradation largely depends on activation of Smo itself but not its downstream signaling. To gain biochemical evidence, we then performed the ubiquitination assay in S2 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>, overexpression of Smo<sup>SD123</sup> significantly increased the Ptc ubiquitination by Smurf; however, knockdown of Smurf markedly reduced Ptc ubiquitination promoted by overexpression of Smo<sup>SD123</sup>. Thus, our findings further confirm that activated Smo promotes Smurf-mediated Ptc ubiquitination and degradation.</p>

<title>Smo Interacts with Smurf and Promotes Ptc Ubiquitination in a Site-Specific Manner</title>
<p>Having seen that Smo promotes Smurf-mediated Ptc ubiquitination, we then sought to investigate whether activated Smo and Smurf act in a common pathway to regulate Ptc ubiquitination by forming a complex. As shown in co-immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g005">Figures 5C, 5D</xref>, and S4E), Smurf could be associated with Smo through the C-tail of Smo, emphasizing that activated Smo promotes Smurf-mediated Ptc ubiquitination in a Smo activation-dependent manner. Since Smurf and Smo form a complex, we then asked whether Smurf regulates ubiquitination and stability of Smo in S2 cells and wing discs. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s004">Figure S4F and S4G</xref>, knockdown of <italic>smurf</italic> did not affect Smo ubiquitination and stability in S2 cells, and knockdown of <italic>smurf</italic> in wing disc clone cells caused no apparent change of endogenous Smo protein expression, when compared to the neighbor wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s004">Figure S4H–S4H</xref>″ and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s004">S4I–S4I</xref>′″). Thus, our results suggest that Smurf regulates Hh signaling primarily through targeting Ptc, but not Smo, for ubiquitination.</p>
<p>To further understand the molecular basis of how Ptc is ubiquitinated through its C-tail, we sought to search for the specific site(s) in Ptc C-tail that respond to the Smurf E3 ligase. We thus generated a series of mutant forms of Ptc, in which the K sites in the Ptc C-tail were mutated to R individually or in combination. As shown in ubiquitination assays, both Ptc<sup>K1261R</sup> and Ptc<sup>K1211R, K1261R, K1269R</sup> mutants were evidently resistant to being ubiquitinated by Smurf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g005">Figures 5E and S5A</xref>), suggesting the K1261 site is specifically regulated by Smurf in S2 cell cultures. To determine the biological function of the K1261 site of Ptc, we generated a ubiquitin-resistant form of the Ptc transgene line, P{<italic>UAS-Ptc<sup>K1261R</sup></italic>}, in which the K1261 site was mutated to R. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g005">Figure 5F–5I</xref>, expression of Ptc<sup>K1261R</sup> by the <italic>en-gal4</italic> driver in the posterior compartment of wing disc caused extreme reductions in the intervein region between L3 and L4 veins, whereas expression of Ptc<sup>WT</sup> led to a less severe wing phenotype. In support of this idea that the greater severity of the Ptc<sup>K1261R</sup> phenotypes was attributed to the resistance of Ptc<sup>K1261R</sup> to ubiquitination by Smurf E3 ligase, expression of Ptc<sup>WT</sup> by the <italic>en-gal4</italic> driver in the <italic>smurf</italic> mutants caused much more severe intervein phenotype than that in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g003">Figures 3J–3L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g005">S5A</xref>), demonstrating the biological importance of the K1261 site of Ptc in the regulation of Hh signaling. The previous study has shown that residues (T1260, T1263, T1265) are vital for Ptc trimerization. Interestingly, the K1261 we identified is very close to these residues, and disruption of these residues resulted in a similar phenotype to that in the wing expressing Ptc<sup>K1261R</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Lu1">[13]</xref>, raising a possibility that K1261 might contribute to the Ptc trimerization.

<title>Smurf Has a Preference for Targeting Ligand-Unbound Ptc</title>

However, the molecular mechanism of how Ptc degradation is regulated remains elusive. In this study, we found that Hh ligand-independent Smo activation is sufficient to promote Smurf-mediated Ptc ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g004">Figure 4D and 4H</xref>, we noted that downregulation of Ptc by Smurf in A compartment cells appears much more effective than that in the A/P boundary. Given that the Hh molecules are highly presented in A/P boundary but absent in A-compartment cells away from the A/P boundary, our findings thus raised a possibility that Smurf might have a preference for targeting unbound Ptc in wing discs. To test this, we performed ubiquitination experiments in S2 cells. S2 cells were co-transfected with Ptc, Smurf, and SmoSD<sup>123</sup>, and then treated with Hh-conditioned or control medium. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g005">Figure 5J</xref>, the levels of Ptc ubiquitination from cells with Hh treatment were apparently lower than that from control cells, suggesting that SmoSD<sup>123</sup> promotes Smurf-mediated Ptc ubiquitination more efficiently in the absence of Hh. To further verify this data <italic>in vivo</italic>, we co-expressed Hh with or without Smurf in wing discs using <italic>MS1096-gal4</italic> driver. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g004">Figure 4O–4P′</xref>, overexpression of Hh resulted in high levels of Ptc expression in A-compartment cells, which were comparable with the A/P boundary cells. However, we found that, in contrast to the fact that Smurf overexpression significantly downregulated Smo<sup>SD</sup>-induced Ptc expression in A-compartment cells, compared with that in A/P boundary cells, overexpression of Smurf had no apparent effect on Hh ligand-induced Ptc expression in A-compartment cells, compared with that in A/P boundary cells.

<title>Dynamic Analysis of the Role of Smurf in the Hh Signaling Pathway in Wing Disc</title>
<p>How does the preferential targeting of ligand-unbound Ptc by Smurf contribute to Hh signaling transduction? The previous study proposed an elegant model by which the ratio of ligand bound to unbound Ptc protein is important in determining Hh signaling activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Casali2">[36]</xref>. Our experimental data reveal that Smurf could control the ratio of ligand bound to unbound Ptc protein through preferentially targeting ligand-unbound Ptc in wing disc, thereby precisely determining Hh signaling. Additionally, this regulation apparently depends on Hh signaling, particularly promoted by activation of Smo.</p>
<p>Given the fact that the high level of <italic>ptc</italic> expression is directly induced by Hh but negatively regulates Hh signaling, collectively, our findings imply that a bidirectional regulation mechanism is involved in Ptc and Smurf to control and balance the signaling activity when the cells respond to external Hh molecules. Our findings also raise an intriguing issue as to how the bidirectional regulation contributes to the dynamics of Hh signaling transduction. Hh signaling dynamics has been studied previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Nahmad1">[37]</xref>, however, how Ptc (or the ratio of ligand bound to unbound Ptc) is precisely regulated in the model remains elusive. In order to better understand the dynamic basis of how Smurf-mediated Ptc turnover contributes to the reliability of the Hh signaling transduction, we developed a mathematical model below based on the current simplified Hh signaling pathway network established in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). As pointed out by Nahmad and Stathopoulos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Nahmad1">[37]</xref>, the synthesis rate of Smo/Ci is regulated by the ratio [Hh_Ptc]/[Ptc] rather than [Ptc] directly since Hh-dependent gene expression depends on the ratio of liganded to unliganded Ptc.</p>

<title>Bidirectional regulation and role of activated Smurf in the Hh signaling pathway.</title>
<p>(A) A simplified Hh signaling pathway network for mathematic modeling. (B) The effects of over expression of activated Smurf on [Hh], [Ptc], [Hh_Ptc], [activated Smo/Ci]. On the left, the levels of [Hh], [Ptc], [Hh_Ptc], and [activated Smo/Ci] correspond to the low level of [activated Smurf], and, similarly, on the right, the levels of [Hh], [Ptc], [Hh_Ptc], and [activated Smo/Ci] correspond to the high level of [activated Smurf] (i.e., over expression of activated Smurf). (For the value of each parameter, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s010">Table S1</xref>.) (C) The effect of over expression of activated Smurf on the ratio [Hh_Ptc]/[Ptc]. For all three values of <italic>β<sub>Hh_Ptc</sub></italic>, the level of ratio [Hh_Ptc]/[Ptc] corresponding to the low activated Smurf is low (on the left). However, when the activated Smurf is over expressed, the level of ratio [Hh_Ptc]/[Ptc] corresponding to <italic>β<sub>Hh_Ptc</sub></italic> = 10<sup>−4</sup> is significantly high. (For the value of each parameter, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s010">Table S1</xref>.) (D) The effects of the inhibition of activated Smurf on [Ptc] and [activated Smo/Ci]. When the expression of activated Smurf is inhibited, the levels of [Ptc] and [activated Smo/Ci] decrease immediately (on the right). (For the value of each parameter, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s010">Table S1</xref>.) (E and F–F″) Wild-type control discs were immunostained with anti-Ptc antibody to show Ptc protein expression (E), and wing discs expressing Flag:Smurf driven by <italic>ap-gal4</italic> were immunostained to show the expression of Ptc (red) and GFP(green), which shows the area of Smurf expression (F–F″). (G and H–H″) Wild-type control discs were immunostained with anti-Ptc antibody to show Ptc protein expression (G), and wing discs expressing Src:Flag:Smurf driven by <italic>ap-gal4</italic> were immunostained to show the expression of Ptc (red) and Flag (green) (H–H″).</p>

<p>Basically, the stability analysis of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio.1001721.e001">Equation 1</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s011">Table S2</xref>) shows that the dynamics has a unique equilibrium and is globally asymptotically stable. We also noticed that although the change in the level of activated Smurf cannot change the dynamical properties of the system (i.e., no multi-equilibrium and periodic or chaotic solutions can exist), the levels of Ptc (or the ratio [Hh−Ptc]/[Ptc]) and activity of Smo/Ci sensitively depend on the change in the levels of activated Smurf. That is, the increase of activated Smurf will result in the decrease of Ptc (or the increase of the ratio [Hh−Ptc]/[Ptc]) and increase in the activity of activated Smo/Ci, and conversely. Numerical solutions of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio.1001721.e001">Equation 1</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g006">Figure 6B–6D</xref>, in which the effects of different activated Smurf levels on Ptc and activated Smo/Ci are considered. It appears that the theoretical and numerical analysis of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio.1001721.e001">Equation 1</xref> matches our experimental data.</p>
<p>The above dynamic analysis reveals how the bidirectional regulation of activated Smo/Ci on Ptc, namely, activated Smo/Ci directly promotes the synthesis of Ptc through transcriptional regulation, but or indirectly promotes the degradation of Ptc through promoting the activity of Smurf. This bidirectional control appears to affect the dynamical properties of the Hh signaling pathway, and this mathematic model reveals that Ptc (or the ratio of [Hh−Ptc]/[Ptc]) not only responds to the Hh signaling but also depends more sensitively on the bidirectional regulation of activated Smo/Ci. Thus, theoretically, the bidirectional regulation occurring in Ptc and Smurf should be able to ensure the reliability of Hh signaling transduction when cells respond to an external Hh signal.</p>

<title>Plasma Membrane-Tethered Smurf Enhances Its Activity to Regulate Ptc Turnover</title>
<p>The role of Smurf in targeting Ptc protein indicates the biological importance of its potential localization on plasma membrane. On the basis of our mathematic model, we predicted that an increase of Smurf concentration (or activity) on plasma membrane would accelerate the turnover of Ptc protein, and subsequently reduce the level of Ptc. To further test our model, we generated transgenic lines, P{<italic>uas-Src:Flag:smurf</italic>}, in which a membrane-tethered form of Smurf was under the control of the UAS promoter. Expression of the membrane-tethered form of Smurf <italic>(Src:Flag:smurf)</italic> appeared to accumulate Smurf on plasma membrane, compared to the wild type of Smurf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s006">Figure S6A and S6B–S6B′</xref>).

<title>Smurf Proteins Have a Conserved Role in Regulating Hh Signaling by Targeting Ptc</title>
<p>To this end, we have identified a novel role of Smurf in regulating Hh signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Given that both Smurf and the Hh signal pathway are evolutionarily conserved from fly to vertebrates, we then turned our attention to test whether Smurf proteins are also involved in regulating Hh signaling in vertebrates using zebrafish embryos as an assay system. The zebrafish genome harbors two <italic>smurf</italic> genes, <italic>smurf1</italic> and <italic>smurf2</italic>, which encode zebrafish Smurf1 and Smurf2 proteins, respectively. As shown in an <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization assay, both <italic>smurf1</italic> and <italic>smurf2</italic> mRNAs were ubiquitously present in all stages during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). To investigate the biological functions of Smurfs in zebrafish embryonic development, we performed morpholino (MO)-based knockdown experiments to inactivate <italic>smurf1</italic> or <italic>smurf2</italic> in zebrafish embryos. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, both <italic>smurf1</italic> and <italic>smurf2</italic> morphants displayed curved tails and U-shaped somite phenotypes, compared with control MO injected embryos. Injection of another splicing blocking morpholino, <italic>smurf1</italic> s1MO, which blocks the intron 3 splicing from the primary <italic>smurf1</italic> transcript, thereby causing intron 3 retention, gave similar somitic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s007">Figure S7B</xref>) (unpublished data). Whole-mount F59 immunofluorescence staining analysis clearly showed that somitic muscles in the mid-trunk region were disrupted in the <italic>smurf1</italic> or <italic>smurf2</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). These Hh-related defects were typically observed in the <italic>smo</italic> mutant or in embryos treated with cyclopamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g007">Figure 7A and 7D</xref>), which specifically blocks Hh signaling in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Taipale1">[38]</xref>, indicating a potential role of Smurf proteins in regulating Hh signaling that controls the somite development (i.e., specification of distinct muscle cell types). To validate whether these phenotypes resulting from inactivated <italic>smurfs</italic> are attributed to disruption of Hh signaling, we first examined the expression levels of several Hh responsive target genes, such as <italic>hhip</italic>, <italic>fkd4</italic>, and <italic>nkx2.2b</italic> in <italic>smurf</italic> morphants. Consistent with the phenotypic analysis, the expression levels of these Hh responsive target genes were significantly reduced in either <italic>smurf1</italic> or <italic>smurf2</italic> morphants when compared with the control morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that Hh signaling activity was indeed downregulated when either <italic>smurf1</italic> or <italic>smurf2</italic> was inactivated. Expression of Engrailed, a direct target of Hh signaling, was also reduced or absent in <italic>smurf1</italic> or <italic>smurf2</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s007">Figure S7C</xref>). We then elevated Hh signaling in <italic>smurf</italic> morphants by injection of <italic>smo</italic> mRNA. Interestingly, we found that co-injection of <italic>smo</italic> mRNA appeared to suppress the phenotypes resulting from either <italic>smurf1</italic> or <italic>smurf2</italic> MOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). To further confirm the role of Smurfs in regulating Hh signaling in zebrafish, we performed a dosage-modified genetic interaction between Smurfs and Hh by employing <italic>smo</italic> mutants. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g007">Figure 7D</xref>, both embryos injected with low doses of <italic>smurf1</italic> or <italic>smurf2</italic> MOs (2 ng/embryo) and embryos carrying heterozygous <italic>smo</italic> mutant exhibited no apparent phenotype during embryo development. However, <italic>smo</italic> heterozygous embryos showed strong Hh-related phenotypes when the embryos were injected with the same dose of <italic>smurf1</italic> or <italic>smurf2</italic> MOs.</p>

<p>To test whether Smurfs have a role in the degradation of Ptc1 in zebrafish, we made a zebrafish <italic>Ptc1c</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> fusion mRNA (<italic>Ptc1c:GFP</italic>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s004">Figure S4D</xref>, co-injection with either <italic>Smurf1 or Smurf2</italic> mRNA resulted in much weaker fluorescence, compared with <italic>Ptc1c:GFP</italic> mRNA injection alone, suggesting that <italic>Smurfs</italic> might play a conserved role in degrading Ptc protein.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have previously shown that Smurf functions in concert with Fu to degrade the BMP Tkv receptor in differentiating cystoblasts (CBs), thereby generating a steep BMP responsive gradient between germline stem cell (GSC) and CBs, and determining the GSC fate in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Xia2">[24]</xref>. Thus, our prior findings reveal an important <italic>in vivo</italic> role of Smurf E3 ligase in targeting to the membrane receptor for proper BMP signal transduction. In this study, we provide both biochemical and genetic evidence to show a novel role of Smurf in mediating Hh signal transduction by targeting to Ptc for its degradation in wing discs. Additionally, we find that, like their homologue in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the zebrafish Smurf proteins are also involved in Hh signaling via targeting to the Ptc1 protein to control late somitogenesis during zebrafish embryogenesis. Thus, our study reveals a novel and evolutionarily conserved role of Smurf proteins in controlling Hh signaling.</p>
<p>Smurf is a member of the C2-WW-HECT E3 family of proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In addition to Smurf, <italic>Drosophila</italic> also has two other members of the C2-WW-HECT family of proteins: Suppressor of deltex (Su(dx)) and Nedd4 protein. Interestingly, we found that all three of these E3 ligases could individually form a complex with the Ptc protein through the C-tail of Ptc (Figures S2H, S2I, and S8A). However, we observed that Smurf is the only member of the C2-WW-HECT family in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that plays a positive role in the regulation of Hh signaling through targeting Ptc in the wing disc system, since alteration of Nedd4 expression did not affect Hh signaling activity and the Su(dx) has a negative role in regulating the Hh signaling pathway in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s008">Figure S8B–S8K</xref>). Notably, we also found that zebrafish Nedd4 has no role in Hh signaling during early embryonic development in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001721.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Thus, our findings suggest a specific biological role for Smurf in targeting Ptc to balance Hh signaling in the tested systems in this study.</p>
<p>Morphogen-mediated signaling gradients have been proposed to regulate differential gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Ashe1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Gurdon1">[40]</xref>. However, the fundamental question of how signal-receiving cells perceive and precisely interpret the environmental cues provided by morphogens has been not well-understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Ashe1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Kutejova1">[41]</xref>. The Hh signaling pathway has an unusual signal reception system including the receptor Ptc and the signal transducer Smo. While the activation of Smo and its downstream events have been extensively studied, how the Hh receptor Ptc is regulated and whether activation of Smo also contributes to regulating the expression and/or activity of the receptor Ptc remain unknown. Given that Ptc has a negative role in the regulation of Hh signaling and that <italic>ptc</italic> itself is a responsive target of Hh signaling, the expression and/or activity of Ptc must be tightly controlled to ensure proper Hh signal transduction. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs, previous studies have proposed that Hh ligand binding and self-induced degradation of Ptc might contribute to the Ptc internalization and the regulation of Ptc expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Lu1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Casali1">[30]</xref>. In this study, we identify Smurf as a Ptc-interacting partner, and provide evidence that Smurf functions as a negative regulator to control Ptc ubiquitination and degradation. Importantly, we observe that Smo activation promotes the E3 ligase activity of Smurf to ubiquitinate Ptc protein in both wing discs and S2 cell cultures. In particular, we find that Smurf activity largely depends on the activation of Smo to regulate Ptc turnover. Previous studies have shown that plasma membrane accumulation of Smo is essential for Hh signaling transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Claret1">[42]</xref>. In this study, we show that Smurf was able to form a complex with Smo to regulate Ptc ubiquitination in a manner that depends on the specific Ptc-K1261 site. Thus, in addition to establishing functions for Hh signal transduction by controlling Ci processing, our findings identify a novel role for the Smo protein in targeting the Ptc receptor on plasma membrane for Ptc degradation.</p>
<p>Previous studies have proposed an elegant model by which the ratio of ligand bound to unbound Ptc protein is important in determining Hh signaling activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001721-Casali2">[36]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of the ratio of ligand bound to unbound Ptc remains unknown. Given that the <italic>ptc</italic> itself is a transcriptional target of the Hh signal, and that the excessive unbound Ptc induced by Hh signaling appears to potentially increase fluctuating levels of cellular Hh signaling, the question becomes how excessive Ptc is restricted within a safe range to control the appropriate ratio of ligand bound to unbound Ptc. Notably, our findings reveal that Smurf has a preference for degrading unbound Ptc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g004">Figure 4C–4J</xref>); thus, integration of Smurf-mediated Ptc degradation with Hh signaling permits us to propose a bidirectional regulatory model that maintains the robustness of cellular Hh responsive activity through controlling a precise ratio of ligand bound to unbound Ptc. In this model, in the presence of Hh molecules, Ptc is highly expressed in signal-receiving cells in response to Hh signaling activation, but negatively regulates Hh signaling through a feedback mechanism. Meanwhile, Smurf also responds to activation of Smo and forms a complex with Smo, thus accumulating on plasma membrane to target Ptc for degrading the excessive unbound Ptc protein, thereby controlling the ratio of bound to unbound Ptc protein and subsequently sustaining the precise level of Hh signaling that ensures distinct target gene activations during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001721-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The mathematic modeling analysis reveals that Ptc not only responds to the Hh signaling but also depends more sensitively on the bidirectional regulation of activated Smo/Ci, further supporting the importance of the role of Smurf in controlling the reliability of Hh signal transduction.</p>
