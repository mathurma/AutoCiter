<abstract>
<p>Stochastic noise at the cellular level has been shown to play a fundamental role in circadian oscillations, influencing how groups of cells entrain to external cues and likely serving as the mechanism by which cell-autonomous rhythms are generated. Despite this importance, few studies have investigated how clock perturbations affect stochastic noise—even as increasing numbers of high-throughput screens categorize how gene knockdowns or small molecules can change clock period and amplitude. This absence is likely due to the difficulty associated with measuring cell-autonomous stochastic noise directly, which currently requires the careful collection and processing of single-cell data. In this study, we show that the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings can serve as an accurate measure of overall stochastic noise, and one that can be applied to future and existing high-throughput circadian screens. Using cell-autonomous fibroblast data, we first show directly that higher noise at the single-cell results in faster damping at the population level. Next, we show that the damping rate of cultured cells can be changed in a dose-dependent fashion by small molecule modulators, and confirm that such a change can be explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model. We further demonstrate the insights that can be gained by applying our method to a genome-wide siRNA screen, revealing that stochastic noise is altered independently from period, amplitude, and phase. Finally, we hypothesize that the unperturbed clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, as very few gene perturbations are capable of simultaneously increasing amplitude and lowering stochastic noise. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the importance of considering the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise, particularly with regard to the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>As most organisms exist in an environment that changes predictably with a 24-hour period, highly optimized genetic circuits turn on and off the production of key regulatory proteins to anticipate the day/night cycle. In humans, the demands of a modern society have required that we deviate from this evolutionarily prescribed sleep and feeding schedule, resulting in increased long-term risks of metabolic disease. There is therefore a desire to find pharmacological treatments that would restore the normal functioning of our circadian clock despite irregular behavioral schedules. One aspect of these treatments that is often overlooked in searching for candidate drugs is how these treatments might affect the accuracy of the circadian timing system. Recording the time of each cell is possible but difficult; as a result single-cell approaches cannot be scaled up to high-throughput searches. In this paper, we show that it is possible to estimate how much the noise of a system has changed by looking only at the averaged protein production of an entire population of cells. Such an approach allows us to analyze prior data from high-throughput screens, and show that the natural clock has been highly optimized to be both accurate and high amplitude.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Circadian rhythms are daily changes in gene expression and physiology that persist even in the absence of external environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref001">1</xref>]. In mammals, such rhythms are organized in a hierarchical fashion: at the tissue-level, the brain’s suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the master pacemaker and keeps circadian oscillations in peripheral tissues in phase with the light-dark cycle. In the SCN, cell-to-cell coupling keeps individual cells in tight synchrony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref002">2</xref>], while coupling between circadian oscillations in peripheral tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> or cultured reporter cells <italic>in vitro</italic> is thought to be very weak or absent entirely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref004">4</xref>]. Within each tissue, cellular-level rhythms in gene transcription are generated by a large network of interacting gene regulatory elements, in which time-delayed transcription-translation negative feedback gives rise to sustained oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref005">5</xref>]. The robust oscillation of circadian factors has been linked to metabolic health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref006">6</xref>], since rhythms compromised by gene knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref007">7</xref>] or irregular feeding schedules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref008">8</xref>] result in an increased risk of metabolic disease. Additionally, as the amplitude of circadian transcription can be affected by lifestyle variables such as diet, age, or work schedule, there has been recent interest in developing pharmacological strategies for increasing the amplitude of circadian cycles in metabolic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>A detailed understanding of the underlying transcriptional mechanisms is essential for the development of circadian therapeutics to be successful. The functional roles of different genes in circadian regulation have traditionally been studied using behavioral-level data and genetic knockout experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref010">10</xref>]. Bioluminescence-based cellular circadian reporters offer a more direct view of the gene regulatory network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref011">11</xref>] and are amenable to high-throughput screens, allowing genome-wide exploration into factors that affect circadian rhythmicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref012">12</xref>]. Additionally, cultured circadian reporter cells allow the change in transcriptional amplitude following a  perturbation to be quantified. This additional parameter has proven useful in differentiating between perturbations with the same effect on period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref013">13</xref>] and has aided the search for small-molecule therapeutics to boost clock amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Bioluminescence rhythms at the cell culture or tissue-level are the result of the collective behavior of thousands of individual cells. Transcription at the single-cell level is strongly affected by <italic>intrinsic</italic> cellular noise, caused by the low molecular counts of the mRNA and protein species involved. As a result, bioluminescence traces of individual cells are stochastic, with significant variability in both amplitude and period length from cycle to cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition to intrinsic noise, circadian oscillations are also affected by <italic>extrinsic</italic> noise sources. Extrinsic noise results from heterogeneity between cells, such as differences in size or physical environment, leading to differences on a cell-to-cell basis in expected period and amplitude. The effects of noise in biological systems has been well-studied, and relative amounts of intrinsic and extrinsic noise can be identified through carefully designed single-cell experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref015">15</xref>]. For circadian systems, intrinsic noise has been suspected to play a larger role: a single cell’s variability in period from cycle-to-cycle is larger than the variability in mean period length between cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref002">2</xref>]. However, both sources of noise have an effect on population-level rhythms: in cell cultures that lack cell-to-cell coupling, it has been shown that stochastic noise is manifested in damped oscillations at the population-level as individual oscillators gradually drift out of phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref016">16</xref>]. This type of behavior has also been seen in other experimental systems, such as NF-κB signaling or yeast glycolytic oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref018">18</xref>]. The amount of noise in system is therefore linked to the ability of tissue-level clocks to maintain high-amplitude rhythms.</p>
<p>Despite the averaging that occurs at the population-level, cell-autonomous stochastic noise plays an important role in determining the function of the circadian oscillator. Noise in circadian rhythms has long been considered an important factor in how circadian rhythms have evolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref019">19</xref>]. A recent study showed that stochasticity is critical to the population-level response to a neuropeptide and forms the basis for how the SCN entrains to light-mediated cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref020">20</xref>]. Additional studies have suggested that the basis of single-cell rhythmicity may depend on stochastic noise, as models of deterministically damped oscillators, when simulated stochastically, capture the noise characteristics seen in single-cell fibroblast data equally well as limit-cycle oscillators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref021">21</xref>]. Despite the importance of single-cell stochasticity in circadian rhythms, measuring stochastic noise currently requires careful preparation, recording, and image processing of individual cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref022">22</xref>]. As a result, while circadian perturbations have been postulated to affect single-cell stochasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref023">23</xref>], no study has experimentally quantified changes to stochastic noise as a result of a small molecule or genetic perturbation.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that changes to stochastic noise can be reliably inferred from the changes to the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings of cultured circadian reporters. Our method assumes that oscillations in individual cells are both</p>

<p specific-use="continuation">which have been shown to hold experimentally for cultured fibroblast cells. We demonstrate the validity and usefulness of such an approach on several types of circadian data. First, we show using single-cell fibroblast data that intrinsic stochastic noise is directly related to population-level damping. Next, we show that a small-molecule modulator is able to change damping rate in a dose-dependent fashion, and verify using a mathematical model that changes to intrinsic stochastic noise is a likely mechanism. Finally, we calculate the genome-wide effects of siRNA knockdown on overall stochastic noise, and demonstrate that population-level damping rate is independent of other circadian parameters, such as period or amplitude. Using this additional information, we show that circadian rhythms have likely evolved to an optimal point of high amplitude and low stochastic noise. Our results should prove especially important in the future search for small molecule circadian therapeutics, as it allows the effect of candidate drugs on stochastic noise to be quantified in a high-throughput manner.</p>

<title>Processing single-cell bioluminescence data</title>
<p>Single-cell bioluminescence data for 79 cells was obtained from Leise <italic>et al</italic>., 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref022">22</xref>]. As was done in the original study, a discrete wavelet transform (using PyWavelets, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.pybytes.com/pywavelets">http://www.pybytes.com/pywavelets</ext-link>) was performed to detrend and remove noise. A discrete wavelet transform decomposes the signal into multiple frequency bands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref027">27</xref>]. By only considering frequency bands close to the circadian frequency, high-frequency noise and low-frequency baseline oscillations can be removed.</p>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Sorting cells by noise level</title>
<p>As in the original study, various parameters describing the average noise level of each cell were collected. Traces were denoised and detrended by keeping only the (8hr,258hr) wavelet components—resulting in rhythms that only contained oscillations with periods between 8 and 258 hours. From these smoothed trajectories, a Hilbert transform was used estimate points at which the phase crossed 0 to find period and amplitude coefficients of variation. An additional noise parameter, the standard deviation in the (1hr,8hr) wavelet components divided by the overall rhythm amplitude, was used to quantify the high-frequency noise of the system. This wavelet component was chosen as it contained only the highest-frequency noise in the signal’s spectrum. From these three noise variables, a combined noise metric was constructed by projecting the variables along their first principle component (using scikit-learn, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://scikit-learn.org/">http://scikit-learn.org/</ext-link>). Cells were ranked according to this combined noise metric, and a high-noise group and low-noise group were constructed by taking the 39 highest-noise and lowest-noise cells, respectively. The raw bioluminescence profiles were not initially synchronized, so the traces were offset to have the same starting phase in order to simulate the gradual desynchronization of a group of oscillators. This was accomplished by starting each trace at the first phase zero-crossing, found using a Hilbert transform.</p>

To ensure the difference in damping rate between groups was statistically significant, a bootstrap analysis was performed. In each of 10,000 bootstrap trials, cells were randomly assigned evenly to either the low-noise or the high-noise group (one cell was randomly omitted in each trial to ensure even group sizes). The absolute difference in damping rate between the two populations was recorded to yield a two-tailed test.

<title>Higher noise results in faster damping in population-level rhythms</title>
<p>While both intrinsic and extrinsic noise sources can contribute to population-level damping, intrinsic noise is thought to play a more significant role in circadian systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref002">2</xref>]. We therefore first sought to determine whether changes to intrinsic stochastic noise alone are sufficient to explain population-level changes in damping rate. To do this, we calculated noise characteristics from experimental data on individual PER2::LUC fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref022">22</xref>]. Cells were sorted into two groups, a low-noise group and a high-noise group, based on the relative high-frequency noise, period variability, and amplitude variability present in each trace. Example rhythms from cells in both groups are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004451.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. Because the cells were not synchronized at the start of the recording, this effect is replicated <italic>in silico</italic> by shifting each series in time to align their start phases. Population-level bioluminescence traces were then found by averaging the cellular PER2::LUC signal in each group. Both populations displayed averaged rhythms that resembled a damped sinusoid, similar to those seen in bioluminescence recordings of entire cell cultures. Fitting the averaged expression of each group with a damped sinusoid revealed that the low-noise group also had a lower damping rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004451.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The significance of this difference was confirmed via a bootstrap analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004451.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), where cells were randomly assigned in each bootstrap trial to either the low-noise or the high-noise group.</p>

<title>A small molecule causes dose-dependent changes in the population-level damping rate of cultured cells</title>
<p>We next demonstrate that perturbations to the transcriptional oscillator are capable of altering population-level damping rate.

By fitting experimental data on the population-level responses to increasing dosages of each molecule with a damped sinusoid, we show that KL001, but not longdaysin, increases damping rate in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004451.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004451.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<title>Mathematical model predicts KL001 damping rate increase comes from increased single-cell stochastic noise</title>
<p>We next test the hypothesis that the dose-dependent changes in damping rate from KL001 is due to changes in intrinsic (cell-autonomous) noise characteristics. To do this, we employed a mathematical model of circadian rhythms previously used to explain the effects of both small molecule perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref013">13</xref>], summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004451.s009">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004451.s010">S2</xref> Tables. In order to capture changes to noise characteristics, we first converted the model to a stochastic biochemical system. Population-level rhythms were generated by averaging the trajectories of 1,000 individual, noninteracting oscillators. The only free parameter in converting the existing deterministic model to a stochastic one is the cell volume, which was determined by fitting the observed population-level damping rate to that of the experimental control traces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004451.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The model was then used to predict the effects of KL001 and longdaysin administration on single-cell noise and population damping rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004451.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Reductions in parameters previously attributed to the activities of each small molecule caused dose-dependent changes in period and damping rate at the population-level that closely matched experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004451.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). As the model includes no cell-to-cell communication or heterogeneity, this difference is manifested solely by changing the noise characteristics of individual cells. This quantitative prediction by the mathematical model lends further support to the assumptions that individual cells are independent and sustained oscillators, and intrinsic noise plays the dominant role in determining population-level damping.</p>

<title>Damping rate is independent of other sinusoidal parameters</title>
<p>Since an siRNA’s effect on period length does not effectively predict its effect on amplitude or phase (and vice-versa), we hypothesized that damping rate would similarly be independently affected by siRNA perturbations. Low Pearson correlation coefficients between normalized parameter distributions defend this hypothesis, with the highest correlations among variables seen between amplitude and damping rate (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.285, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004451.t002">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, a multivariate linear regression of damping rate as a function of period, amplitude, phase, and perturbation type (control or perturbed, a categorical variable) produced an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of only 0.169 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004451.s012">S4 Table</xref>). These results reinforce the notion that the population-level damping rate describes an independent feature of the underlying oscillator.</p>

<title>The unperturbed clock lies at the Pareto frontier of high amplitude and low noise</title>
<p>The ability of a population of oscillators to maintain robust oscillations is a function both of its initial amplitude as well as its damping rate. A robust oscillator is therefore one with high initial amplitude and low stochastic noise. Scatter plots of the control and perturbed distributions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004451.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>, which indicate that few outlier points reside in the lower damping rate, higher amplitude quadrant. In order to find perturbations that confidently change robustness, we grouped the siRNA perturbations by target gene and performed a two-sample Hotelling’s <italic>T</italic><sup>2</sup> test against the control population. The resulting significant gene perturbations (75% of all genes) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004451.g006">Fig 6C</xref>. Quantifying the distribution in outliers by quadrant, it is clear that only a small minority of perturbations (3.3%) simultaneously increase amplitude and decrease stochastic noise. It therefore appears that the unperturbed clock optimizes some trade-off between high amplitude and low stochastic noise, such that it is unlikely the knockdown of a single gene will make oscillations more robust.</p>

<title>Effect of cell heterogeneity</title>
<p>In the preceding sections, we have demonstrated that changes to single-cell intrinsic noise are sufficient to explain the observed changes in population-level damping. However, experimental work has shown that cell-autonomous fibroblast cells have a distribution of mean free-running periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref022">22</xref>]. Indeed, prior to the availability of single-cell data, studies explored the possibility that differences in mean periods served as the mechanism behind population-level damping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref031">31</xref>]. While it is true that the dephasing of a group of oscillators can be caused by both variance in the mean period as well as cycle-to-cycle variability, intrinsic stochastic noise may play a more significant role. We show that there is greater variance in period on a cycle-to-cycle basis than on a cell-to-cell basis in cultured fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004451.s005">S5 Fig</xref>): individual cell period lengths have an average inner quartile range (IQR) of 3.18 hrs, while cell-to-cell average period has an IQR of 1.55 hrs. These results are independently confirmed by a previous study using Bayesian modeling, which found a standard deviation of periods within cells of 1.43 hrs, and 0.89 hrs across the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref032">32</xref>]. A similar result has also been observed in dispersed SCN neurons, suggesting that while both intrinsic and extrinsic period heterogeneity likely contribute to the dephasing kinetics, cell-to-cell differences are less severe than cell-autonomous noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>It is also possible that damping rate changes due to siRNA or small molecule perturbation could be manifested through altering the system’s extrinsic noise. Such a change could be caused by an unequal uptake of siRNA or drug on a cell-to-cell basis, as has been demonstrated by a distribution of single-cell knockdown efficiency through flow cytometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref033">33</xref>]. This effect would increase cell heterogeneity and lead to faster dephasing kinetics. While differentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic noise sources from population-level data is possible in theory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004451.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), these differences are likely not identifiable from typical population-level data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004451.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). This distinction would likely be possible with single-cell level data, as has been done in other experimental systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref015">15</xref>]. However, such an experiment would likely not be amenable to high-throughput methods. Differences in damping rates are therefore best viewed as representative of changes to overall stochastic noise from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Since both types of noise are important to determining the overall function of population-level rhythms, damping rates are still a valuable method of quantifying stochastic noise.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have shown that the damping rate of population-level circadian oscillations can be changed by genetic or pharmacological perturbations. As populations-level rhythms are determined by the coherence of many individual cells, desynchronization due to stochastic noise is a likely explanation for population-level damping. Using single-cell data, we showed that population-level damping rate is proportional to single-cell noise. Furthermore, we used a computational model to predict the changes in damping rate from two small molecules, demonstrating that changes to intrinsic stochastic noise are sufficient to explain the observed damping rate changes.</p>
<p>We have described a method by which changes to stochastic noise can be estimated from population-level circadian bioluminescence recordings. An overview of the computational steps involved in our method are outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004451.s008">S8 Fig</xref>. While the method can be applied to existing experimental data, there are also practical considerations for the design of future experiments. Because the damping rate must be inferred from the time-varying amplitude, collecting bioluminescence data for longer time periods yields more accurate results and reduces the potential impact of initial transient regions. Additionally, a sampling rate that is high enough to confidently capture the peaks and troughs of gene expression is required—in this study, the 2 hr sampling window of the siRNA screen proved sufficient. While achieving such a rate is typically not difficult for bioluminescence experiments, it may limit the method’s applicability in experiments where samples need to be analyzed at each time point. We also note that there are many available tools for detrending and regressing time-series data. While we prioritized computationally efficient methods (which could be scaled to genome-wide screens), the best methods for any particular application may vary depending on the data.</p>
<p>As high amplitude circadian oscillations are important for maintaining metabolic health, many studies have sought to find small molecule candidates that increase oscillatory amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref009">9</xref>]. In the search for circadian clock therapeutics, high-throughput methods are frequently used to screen for such drugs, often neglecting potential effects on cell-autonomous noise. While we have demonstrated a method by which the effects of small molecules on noise can be inferred from high-throughput methods, we have also shown that the potential improvement of clock robustness may be limited. Amplitudes of circadian rhythms may therefore be best increased by small molecule therapies that act transiently to synchronize peripheral oscillators. While such a method would require accurate alignment of drug administration to the correct circadian phase, a recent <italic>in silico</italic> study has demonstrated the potential effectiveness of such an approach in improving amplitudes in peripheral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004451.ref034">34</xref>]. Finally, the ability to extract an additional biologically relevant parameter from existing datasets will likely prove useful for many studies, as it allows further differentiation between perturbations that might otherwise have identical effects on bioluminescence rhythms.</p>
