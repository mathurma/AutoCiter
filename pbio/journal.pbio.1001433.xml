        <p>Zfp521 is a novel antiadipogenic transcription factor that helps to determine the identity of a mesenchymal cell as bone or fat.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>While there has been significant progress in determining the transcriptional cascade involved in terminal adipocyte differentiation, less is known about early events leading to lineage commitment and cell fate choice. It has been recently discovered that zinc finger protein 423 (Zfp423) is an early actor in adipose determination. Here, we show that a close paralog of Zfp423, Zfp521, acts as a key regulator of adipose commitment and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Zfp521 exerts its actions by binding to early B cell factor 1 (Ebf1), a transcription factor required for the generation of adipocyte progenitors, and inhibiting the expression of Zfp423. Overexpression of Zfp521 in cells greatly inhibits adipogenic potential, whereas RNAi-mediated knock-down or genetic ablation of Zfp521 enhances differentiation. In addition, <italic>Zfp521<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryos exhibit increased mass of interscapular brown adipose tissue and subcutaneous white adipocytes, a cell autonomous effect. Finally, Ebf1 participates in a negative feedback loop to repress Zfp521 as differentiation proceeds. Because Zfp521 is known to promote bone development, our results suggest that it acts as a critical switch in the commitment decision between the adipogenic and osteogenic lineages.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Adipocytes or fat cells derive from the same stem cells that give rise to bone, cartilage, and muscle. Understanding the switch between bone and fat is of particular medical importance, with implications for diseases like osteoporosis and obesity. Here, we have identified a transcription factor called Zfp521 which is integral to adipogenesis. Prior work has shown that Zfp521 is important in bone formation. Using a variety of overexpression and knockout models, we show that Zfp521 blocks fat cell formation in cultured cells and in living animals. Furthermore, we show that Zfp521 performs this function by binding to another transcription factor, early B cell factor 1 (Ebf1), and repressing the expression of Zfp423, a transcriptional regulator of preadipocyte determination. Finally, we show that Zfp521 is itself repressed by Ebf1, providing a mechanism that turns the levels of this antiadipogenic protein off once the decision to undergo fat cell development has been made. We postulate that Zfp521 regulates one of the earliest events in the lineage switch between bone and fat.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into a variety of lineages, including fat, bone, muscle, and cartilage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Pittenger1">[1]</xref>. In particular, there has been emphasis placed on understanding how commitment is determined in cells that could become bone or fat, as these processes are considered relevant to the twin epidemics of obesity and osteoporosis. Numerous studies have shown an inverse relationship between bone and fat development, such that marrow adiposity increases with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Nuttall1">[2]</xref>, while the clinical use of proadipogenic PPARγ agonists increases fracture risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Dimitri1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Schwartz1">[6]</xref>. At the molecular level, reciprocal regulation between adipogenic and osteogenic regulatory factors has been noted. Activation of PPARγ inhibits the activity of the osteoblastogenic master regulator Runx2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Khan1">[7]</xref>, while the osteogenic transcription factor Msx2 inhibits PPARγ and C/EBPα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Cheng1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Ichida1">[9]</xref>. Other transcriptional components that exert opposing effects on adipogenesis and osteogenesis include Taz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Hong1">[10]</xref>, ΔfosB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Sabatakos1">[11]</xref>, Rb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Calo1">[12]</xref>, and Maf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Nishikawa1">[13]</xref>. Together, these studies suggest that there is a molecular balance between these two lineages.</p>
      <p>Late events in adipocyte terminal differentiation have been well-studied, and a transcriptional cascade has been identified that includes PPARγ, C/EBPα, and a burgeoning network of other factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Cristancho1">[14]</xref>. Our understanding of early events in adipogenesis, however, is relatively underdeveloped. Notably, Zfp423 and Tcf7L1 have been recently proposed to facilitate early determination events in adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Gupta1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Cristancho2">[17]</xref>. Zfp423 is a large and interesting molecule, containing 30 C2H2 Krüppel-like zinc fingers. In addition to promoting adipose lineage determination, Zfp423 also regulates development in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Alcaraz1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Warming1">[19]</xref>, exerting its actions in part through physical interactions with various binding partners, including RAR/RXR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Huang1">[20]</xref>, Smads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Gupta1">[15]</xref>, and early B cell factor 1 (Ebf1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Tsai1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Hata1">[22]</xref>. Originally described as a regulator of olfactory epithelial differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Wang1">[23]</xref> and B-cell lymphopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Hagman1">[24]</xref>, Ebf1 is proadipogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Jimenez1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Akerblad1">[26]</xref> and also appears to operate early in the commitment phase of differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Festa1">[27]</xref>. Thus, <italic>Ebf1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are not only lipodystrophic but actually lack adipocyte progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Festa1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Fretz1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Zfp521, also known as Evi-3 in the mouse (ZNF521/EHZF in the human), is the only close paralog of Zfp423 in the mammalian genome; both factors contain he same array of 30 C2H2 Krüppel-like zinc fingers. Zfp521 is enriched in primitive cell types, such as neural precursor cells, immature olfactory neurons, and CD34<sup>+</sup> early hematopoietic progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Bond1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Lobo1">[31]</xref>. Interestingly, Zfp521 is also a critical regulator of osteoblast formation in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Correa1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Wu1">[33]</xref>, and in chondrocytes, Zfp521 acts downstream of parathyroid hormone-related peptide to inhibit Runx2 and increase growth plate thickness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Correa1">[32]</xref>. The tissue distributions of Ebf1 and Zfp521 are similar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Lobo1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Milatovich1">[34]</xref>, and Zfp521 opposes Ebf1 activity in B-cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Hentges1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Mega1">[36]</xref> and olfactory epithelium development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Davis1">[37]</xref>. Taken together, Zfp521 appeared to us to be an excellent candidate for a factor regulating critical early events in adipogenesis.</p>
      <p>Here, we identify such a role for Zfp521 as a negative regulator of adipose tissue development. Expression of Zfp521 is reduced during adipogenesis, and gain- and loss-of function studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that Zfp521 is a repressor of adipogenesis. We identify Zfp423 as a critical downstream target of Zfp521, and we show that the ability of Zfp521 to repress Zfp423 and adipogenesis depends upon its ability to bind to and inhibit the transcriptional activity of the proadipogenic factor Ebf1. Finally, we establish a negative feedback loop in which Ebf1 binds to an intronic enhancer of the Zfp521 gene and represses its expression. Our data establish that Zfp521 acts early in adipogenesis to negatively regulate differentiation, at least in part through direct inhibition of Ebf1 and subsequent repression of Zfp423 expression.</p>

This pattern was also seen during differentiation of 3T3-L1, 3T3-F442A, and human adipose stromal cells (ASCs) into adipocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s001">Figures S1A–S1C</xref>), and protein levels declined as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with the in vitro data, Zfp521 levels are higher in the stromal-vascular fraction (which contains preadipocytes) than in the adipocyte fraction of fat pads taken from wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To prove that Zfp521 is expressed in bona fide preadipocytes, we isolated green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ cells from the stromal-vascular fraction of transgenic mice bearing GFP inserted into the Zfp423 start site; such cells have been shown to represent the preadipocyte population of the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Gupta2">[16]</xref>. As expected, GFP+ cells had significantly higher Zfp521 expression than GFP− cells from the same fat pads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). On the basis of its expression pattern, we predicted that Zfp521 would inhibit adipogenesis. This was indeed the case, as overexpression of Zfp521 in C3H10T1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g001">Figure 1D, 1E</xref>), 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s001">Figure S1D, S1E</xref>), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s002">Figure S2F, S2G</xref>) blocked lipid accumulation and adipogenic gene expression, while shRNA-mediated knockdown of Zfp521 (sh521) had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g001">Figures 1F, 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s001">S1F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s001">S1G</xref>). This was not an off-target effect of the Zfp521 shRNA, as <italic>Zfp521<sup>−/−</sup></italic> primary MEFs and stromal-vascular cells taken from the fat pads of <italic>Zfp521<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice also showed enhanced adipogenic potential compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s001">Figures S1H–S1K</xref>). This effect was also true in human ASCs, indicating that the role of Zfp521 as an antiadipogenic factor is not confined to the rodent lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s001">Figure S1L, S1M</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of Zfp521 in C3H10T1/2 and MEFs pushed cells towards an osteoblastic fate, demonstrated by staining and gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s002">Figure S2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s002">S2D</xref>). Thus, the combined data from gain- and loss-of-function studies consistently demonstrate that Zfp521 acts as a repressor of adipogenesis and a promoter of osteogenesis in multiple systems in vitro.</p>

        <p>To determine if these effects were cell autonomous, we took advantage of the ability of 3T3-F442A cells to develop into fat pads when implanted into nude mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Green1">[38]</xref> to create a competition-based assay for adipogenic potential in vivo. 3T3-F442A cells were transduced with retrovirus expressing either sh521 or a scrambled shRNA control (shScr), and the two cell types were then mixed together at a 1∶1 ratio prior to implantation in nude mice; we reasoned that the hairpin conferring greater adipogenic potential should be overrepresented in the resulting fat pad. Hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining and protein expression of C/EBPα and FABP4 from implants show that injected cells developed into adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s003">Figures S3B, S3C</xref>). The relative amount of each hairpin was determined using quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) to measure hairpin-specific sequences normalized to hairpin-independent sequences. By first determining the relative abundance of each hairpin in mixtures of input cells at fixed ratios, we established a baseline by which we could normalize results from the harvested tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). This analysis revealed that sh521 cells accounted for approximately 78% of the adipocytes in the fat pads, significantly greater than the 50% expected if Zfp521 knockdown had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).

        <p>We next sought to determine whether Zfp521 was acting early, late, or perhaps at multiple time points in the differentiation process. As shown previously, Zfp521 sharply repressed lipid accumulation and adipocyte-specific gene expression in C3H10T1/2 cells; this effect was largely reversed by adding PPARγ or C/EBPα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s003">Figures S3E, S3F</xref>). We also assessed whether knocking down Zfp521 in cells lacking PPARγ would allow adipogenesis to proceed. While viral delivery of shZfp521 promoted adipogenesis in cells that contain PPARγ (<italic>Ppar</italic>γ<italic><sup>+/−</sup></italic>), cells lacking PPARγ entirely (<italic>Ppar</italic>γ<sup>−/−</sup>) did not undergo differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s003">Figures S3G–S3K</xref>).

        <title>Zfp521 Inhibits Preadipocyte Commitment Factor Zfp423</title>
        <p>Because Zfp521 is a transcriptional regulator, we sought to identify downstream targets in preadipocytes using Affymetrix arrays. We performed these experiments in both gain-of-function and loss-of-function contexts to enhance our ability to identify bona fide targets of Zfp521, focusing on genes that showed coordinate regulation between Zfp521 overexpression and knockdown. There were 631 genes whose expression fell below 70% of baseline when Zfp521 was targeted by RNAi, while surprisingly few targets (five) increased by more than 1.5-fold when Zfp521 was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). A total of three genes (<italic>Dusp1</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>, and <italic>Serpina3m</italic>) showed coordinate regulation, demonstrating that they are bona fide positive targets of Zfp521. Conversely, there were 347 genes whose expression increased upon treatment with sh521, and 114 that were diminished by Zfp521 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g003">Figure 3A</xref>); only seven of these genes were coordinately regulated. These seven genes include poorly annotated transcripts of uncertain function (e.g. <italic>3830408D07RIK</italic>), some of which reside in a 1.3-MB cluster on the X chromosome (<italic>OTT/LOC434863/LOC434864/LOC434865/LOC666184/LOC660260</italic>).

The final gene on the list of those coordinately regulated by Zfp521 was, however, of particular interest to us: Zfp423, the most highly paralogous gene to Zfp521 and a factor recently shown to promote adipose linage commitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Gupta1">[15]</xref>.

        <title>Zfp521 Inhibits Ebf1 Transcriptional Activity through Physical Interaction</title>
        <p>Zfp521 interacts with Ebf1 in the context of hematopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Mega1">[36]</xref>. Because we have previously shown that Ebf1 is a strong inducer of adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Jimenez1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Akerblad1">[26]</xref>, we asked whether Zfp521 interacts with Ebf1 in preadipocytes, and whether this might underlie the anti-adipogenic actions of Zfp521. Zfp521 physically interacts with co-transfected Ebf1 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), and this effect is also seen using co-immunoprecipitation of native proteins in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Zfp521 inhibits the transcriptional activity of Ebf1 on the mouse mb-1 promoter region as well as the promoters of <italic>Sncg</italic> (a highly Ebf1-responsive gene in adipocytes; MJG and EDR, unpublished data) and <italic>Cebpa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g004">Figure 4B–4D</xref>). Further, Zfp521 is recruited to the same location as Ebf1 on the <italic>Cebpa</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Jimenez1">[25]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Ebf1 shows a slight ability to promote differentiation in immortalized <italic>Zfp521<sup>+/+</sup></italic> MEFs, an effect dramatically enhanced in <italic>Zfp521<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells. Reintroduction of Zfp521 reversed the effect in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g004">Figure 4F, 4G</xref>). Zfp423 interacts with Ebf1 via its most C-terminal cluster of zinc fingers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Correa1">[32]</xref>. We therefore tested this in Zfp521 using a mutant allele missing zinc fingers 27–30 (Zfp521ΔZF27-30) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). Zfp521ΔZF27-30 is less able to interact with Ebf1 than wild-type Zfp521 in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s004">Figure S4E</xref>), and exhibits reduced ability to suppress Ebf1 transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s004">Figure S4F</xref>). We also focused on the first 13 amino acids of Zfp521 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s004">Figure S4D</xref>), which contain a motif conserved among other zinc finger transcriptional repressors like Fog-1 and Fog-2 that is required for Zfp521 to regulate erythropoiesis through physical interaction with GATA-1 and the nuclear remodeling and histone deacteylation (NuRD) complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Correa1">[32]</xref>. In contrast to the ΔZF27-30 mutant, Zfp521Δ13aa is almost fully able to suppress Ebf1 activity on the Cebpa promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s004">Figure S4F</xref>). Consistent with these results, wild-type Zfp521 and Zfp521Δ13aa, but not Zfp521ΔZF27-30, could fully repress adipogenesis in C3H10T1/2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g004">Figure 4H, 4I</xref>). Importantly, Ebf1 induces Zfp423 expression, an effect which can be blocked by WT Zfp521, but not Zfp521ΔZF27-30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g004">Figures 4J, 4K</xref>).

        <p>Given that Zfp521 and Zfp423 contain highly homologous Ebf1 binding domains, we speculated that Zfp521 might compete with Zfp423 for binding to Ebf1. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, we confirmed that both Zfp521 and Zfp423 bind readily to Ebf1, but to our surprise, the addition of either Zfp521 or Zfp423 enhances binding of the other protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s005">Figure S5A</xref>), an effect seen even in the presence of a large excess of either protein. This suggested to us that Zfp521 and Zfp423 might heterodimerize, and this is indeed the case, even in the absence of Ebf1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s005">Figures S5B, S5C</xref>). The full significance of this interaction is still unclear, but it suggests that Ebf1 binds Zfp521 and Zfp423 simultaneously, with the heterodimer showing enhanced affinity for Ebf1 relative to Zfp521 or Zfp423 monomers or homodimers. We postulate that the downstream effect of Zfp binding to Ebf1 depends upon the content of Zfp521 in the dimer. Consistent with this idea, the Zfp521/Zfp423 ratio falls dramatically almost immediately upon the induction of differentiation, and becomes even more lopsided in favor of Zfp423 as adipogenesis proceeds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Zfp521 and Ebf1 Negatively Regulate the Expression Each Other during Adipogenesis</title>
        <p>In order to determine why Zfp521 levels decline during adipogenesis, we turned to our previously published genome-wide chromatin state maps generated from 3T3-L1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Mikkelsen1">[39]</xref>, which demonstrated a single strong H3K4me3 peak at the Zfp521 promoter that diminishes as differentiation proceeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). H3K36me3, a mark of transcriptional elongation, also diminishes in a differentiation-dependent manner. Non-promoter H3K27 acetylation (H3K27Ac), which marks active regulatory sites, revealed a single cluster of peaks in the second intron of the Zfp521 gene, which was dramatically reduced in mature adipocytes, suggesting negative regulation at this locus. We have recently profiled Ebf1 binding sites in mature L1 adipocytes and have found a cluster of peaks that precisely coincide with these enhancer sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Using ChIP-PCR, we could confirm Ebf1 binding to two of these peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Zfp521 levels rise in 3T3-L1 cells after transduction of shEbf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), and are elevated in <italic>Ebf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we have identified Zfp521 as a potent repressor of adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Zfp521 acts early in the cascade of terminal adipocyte differentiation. Our group previously showed that Ebf1 promotes adipogenesis by inducing the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Jimenez1">[25]</xref> and a recent study showed that Ebf1 is required for early commitment of the adipose lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Fretz1">[28]</xref>. Gupta et al. showed that Zfp423 acts as a preadipocyte commitment factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Gupta1">[15]</xref>. Zfp521 acts upstream, to inhibit the expression of Zfp423, and also inhibits the expression and function of Ebf1 through physical interaction. As differentiation proceeds, Ebf1 represses the expression of Zfp521 via direct binding to an intronic enhancer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001433-g005">Figure 5F</xref> for a model). Therefore, our data suggest that Zfp521 participates in a feedback loop during adipose commitment and differentiation.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, although the anti-adipogenic effects of Zfp521 were demonstrated in every model we tested, these actions were consistently most dramatic in C3H10T1/2 cells. C3H10T1/2 cells are the most primitive in vitro model that we employed, with multi-lineage potential. This observation is consistent with reports that Zfp521 promotes bone and cartilage development in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Correa1">[32]</xref>. In chondrocytes, Zfp521 acts downstream of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) to inhibit Runx2 and increasing cellular proliferation and subsequent growth plate thickness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Correa1">[32]</xref>. The published data on Zfp521 in bone development have been less clear, with discordance seen between in vitro (where Zfp521 inhibits osteogenesis) and in vivo (where overexpression of Zfp521 increases bone mass) studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Wu1">[33]</xref>, and it has been proposed that inhibition of Runx2 by Zfp521 may have differential effects on bone development depending upon timing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Wu1">[33]</xref>. Our own data support a role for Zfp521 as a pro-osteogenic factor in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001433.s002">Figures S2A–D</xref>). The actions of Zfp521 on osteogenesis and adipogenesis place this factor among a group of transcription factors recently discovered to regulate the relative abundance of these two lineages. These factors, which include Rb, Maf, fosB, Taz, and Ebf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Hong1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Nishikawa1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Wu1">[33]</xref>, have been the subjects of intense inquiry given obvious links to two human diseases of great importance, osteoporosis and obesity.</p>
      <p>How does Zfp521 inhibit adipogenesis? Our data point strongly to a mechanism involving the transcriptional repression of the proadipogenic factor Zfp423, although other targets are certainly possible. Relatively few genes were concordantly regulated by knockdown and overexpression of Zfp521 in preadipocytes, and most have no obvious link to adipocyte differentiation. An exception is <italic>Dusp1</italic>, which encodes Map kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1). However, MKP-1 has been shown to promote adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Sakaue1">[40]</xref>, while we found it to be positively regulated by Zfp521. Other target genes are likely to be involved, such as <italic>Cebpa</italic>, which exhibit subthreshold levels of change on the microarray. Zfp521 may have intrinsic DNA-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Hata1">[22]</xref>, and some actions may well be mediated by direct effects on the expression of critical developmental genes, although this remains to be proven. We show, however, that binding and inhibition of Ebf1 is a major mechanism by which Zfp521 inhibits adipogenesis. A mutant allele of Zfp521 that cannot bind Ebf1 has greatly reduced ability to repress differentiation. We posited that a simple competition could exist between Zfp423 and Zfp521 for Ebf1, given the high degree of similarity in their C-terminal zinc finger domains. In fact, this proved not to be the case, with Zfp521 and Zfp423 enhancing each others' binding to Ebf1. Furthermore, Zfp521 and Zfp423 can bind directly to one another, suggesting that they form heterodimers that inhibit Ebf1 action. In this vein, we propose that Ebf1 action is contingent upon the relative amounts of Zfp521 and Zfp423 in the resulting complex, although this needs to be formally tested. Finally, this could explain the small amount of residual antiadipogenic activity seen with the Zfp521ΔZF27-30 mutant, which may bind to Zfp423 despite being unable to bind Ebf1. Zfp423 has Smad-binding properties, which have been implicated in its proadipogenic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001433-Gupta1">[15]</xref>, and binding directly to Zfp521 could attenuate this activity. We have not investigated whether additional antiadipogenic actions of Zfp521 could be due to effects on the Smad pathway.</p>
      <p>Our data thus add to our knowledge of early events in mesenchymal differentiation, and may be an exploitable angle in the battle to promote metabolic and skeletal health.</p>
