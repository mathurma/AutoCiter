			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The human pathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Candida albicans</named-content> can assume either of two distinct cell types, designated “white” and “opaque.” Each cell type is maintained for many generations; switching between them is rare and stochastic, and occurs without any known changes in the nucleotide sequence of the genome. The two cell types differ dramatically in cell shape, colony appearance, mating competence, and virulence properties. In this work, we investigate the transcriptional circuitry that specifies the two cell types and controls the switching between them. First, we identify two new transcriptional regulators of white-opaque switching, Czf1 and white-opaque regulator 2 (Wor2). Analysis of a large set of double mutants and ectopic expression strains revealed genetic relationships between <italic>CZF1, WOR2,</italic> and two previously identified regulators of white-opaque switching, <italic>WOR1</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic>. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that Wor1 binds the intergenic regions upstream of the genes encoding three additional transcriptional regulators of white-opaque switching <italic>(CZF1, EFG1,</italic> and <italic>WOR2),</italic> and also occupies the promoters of numerous white- and opaque-enriched genes. Based on these interactions, we have placed these four genes in a circuit controlling white-opaque switching whose topology is a network of positive feedback loops, with the master regulator gene <italic>WOR1</italic> occupying a central position. Our observations indicate that a key role of the interlocking feedback loop network is to stably maintain each epigenetic state through many cell divisions.</p>

          <p>The opportunistic fungal pathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Candida albicans</named-content> can switch between two heritable states—the “white” and “opaque” states. These two cell types differ in many characteristics, including cell structure, mating competence, and virulence. Recent studies of the molecular mechanism of regulating the white-opaque switch identified a master transcriptional regulator, Wor1. In this study, we identified two transcriptional regulators, Czf1 and Wor2, as new regulators of white-opaque switching. By constructing a series of single and double mutants and by examining where the master regulator Wor1 binds throughout the genome, we generated a molecular model of the bistable switch that regulates white-opaque switching. The regulatory model consists of interlocking positive feedback loops, which mutually reinforce one another and stabilize the opaque state. These results show how an organism can exist in two distinctive, heritable states without changes in the nucleotide sequence of its genome.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Transcriptional circuits are central to the regulation of many biological processes. Often the logic of the circuit, rather than the nature of its components, makes up its most critical feature. In this paper we describe an interlocking network of positive feedback loops that underlies white-opaque switching in the human fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. White-opaque switching is an epigenetic phenomenon, where genetically identical cells can exist in two distinctive cell types, white and opaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b001">1</xref>]. Each cell type is stably inherited for many generations, and switching between the two types of cells occurs stochastically and rarely—roughly one switch in 10<sup>4</sup> cell divisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b002">2</xref>]. The white form is the default cell type, and we propose that the main purpose of the network of interlocking feedback loops is, once excited, to stably maintain the opaque cell type through many cell divisions. Thus, we propose that the feedback loop network driving opaque formation is activated infrequently, but once activated, it is stably propagated through many cell generations.</p>
      <p>Despite possessing the same genome, white and opaque cells have many phenotypic differences. Approximately 400 genes are differentially expressed between the two cell types, and the cells differ in their appearance under the microscope and in the color and shape of the colonies they produce on solid media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b004">4</xref>]. They also differ in their behavior toward other <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells: opaque cells, but not white cells, are highly competent for mating; they respond to mating pheromone with polarized growth, and they can subsequently undergo cell and nuclear fusion with opaque cells of the opposite mating type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b008">8</xref>]. Finally, the two types of cells appear to interact differently with their mammalian host, with opaque cells appearing more suited for skin infections, and white cells appearing to fare better in blood stream infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b010">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Several transcriptional regulators have been identified that play key roles in maintaining the white and opaque cell types, and in controlling the switching between them. Cells of mating type <bold>a</bold>/α are blocked for white-opaque switching, with all cells remaining locked in the white phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b005">5</xref>]. This block occurs through the action of two homeodomain proteins (a1 and α2), encoded at the <italic>mating type-like a</italic> (<italic>MTLa)</italic> and <italic>MTLα</italic> loci, respectively. The a1 and α2 proteins likely act together as a heterodimer to repress transcription of <italic>WOR1,</italic> the product of which is a positive regulator of the opaque state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b013">13</xref>]. Wor1 is required for establishment and maintenance of the opaque state, and ectopically expressed <italic>WOR1</italic> drives cells into the opaque form. In <bold>a</bold> and α cells (both of which are permissive for switching), <italic>WOR1</italic> is expressed at low levels in white cells, but in opaque cells Wor1 activates its own synthesis, and <italic>WOR1</italic> expression levels rise dramatically. High levels of Wor1, produced by this positive feedback loop, are necessary to maintain the opaque state. Finally Efg1, which has been studied extensively for its role as regulator of the filamentous growth and pathogenesis in <bold>a</bold>/α (i.e., non-switching) strains of <italic>C. albicans,</italic> also plays a part in white-opaque switching: in <bold>a</bold> and α cells (but not <bold>a</bold>/α cells), cells deleted for <italic>EFG1</italic> exist almost exclusively in the opaque state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b015">15</xref>] (this work). Thus <italic>EFG1</italic> is needed to stably maintain the white state.</p>
      <p>In this paper we identify two additional transcription regulators of white-opaque switching, <italic>CZF1</italic> and <italic>white-opaque regulator 2 (WOR2)</italic>. The former has been previously studied as an important regulator of filamentous growth in <bold>a</bold>/α (non-switching) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b016">16</xref>], but a role in white-opaque switching has not been previously described. <italic>WOR2</italic> has not been previously described in any context, and we named the gene <italic>WOR2</italic> based on its key role white-opaque switching, as described in this paper.</p>
      <p>In order to understand the genetic relationships among <italic>WOR1, EFG1, CZF1,</italic> and <italic>WOR2,</italic> we constructed a large set of single and double mutants and analyzed them for white-opaque switching. We also ectopically expressed these regulators in mutant strains in various combinations and monitored their effects on switching and maintenance of the white and opaque states. Finally, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to establish direct regulatory connections between the central regulator, Wor1, and the other targets. We found that Wor1 binds upstream of: (1) all four transcriptional regulators investigated in this paper <italic>(WOR1, CZF1, WOR2, EFG1);</italic> (2) genes whose transcription is regulated by the white-opaque switch; and (3) a large number of genes that are not differentially transcribed during the white-opaque switch, suggesting an additional, previously unrecognized component of white-opaque switching, one that may require additional environmental inputs to fully reveal. Based on the combined results of these experiments, we have placed <italic>MTLa1, MTLα2, WOR1, CZF1, WOR2,</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic> into a single genetic circuit regulating the white-opaque switch. This circuit is formed from a network of interlocking positive feedback loops, and we believe that this network can account for the stability of the white and opaque states through many cell generations.</p>

        <title>Identification of New Regulators of White-Opaque Switching</title>
        <p>One of the most striking characteristics of the white-opaque switch is the large number of genes that are differentially regulated between the two types of cells. Approximately 400 genes have altered transcription; roughly half are up-regulated in the white phase, with the remaining half up-regulated in the opaque phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b004">4</xref>]. Several of these regulated genes encode transcriptional regulators, as predicted by the presence of a sequence-specific DNA-binding motif encoded in the gene. We tested a set of opaque-enriched transcription factors for possible roles in regulating the white-opaque switch.</p>
        <p>Opaque-enriched genes were previously identified through microarray analyses that compared the gene expression profiles of isogenic white and opaque cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b004">4</xref>]. Genes up-regulated in opaque cells were searched for homology to transcriptional regulatory proteins using BLAST searches (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/</ext-link>) and Pfam motif searches (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/</ext-link>). From a set of 237 opaque-enriched genes, we chose to study six genes encoding putative transcriptional regulators: <italic>CZF1, WOR2, HAP3,</italic> orf19.4972, <italic>CSR1,</italic> and <italic>PHO23</italic>. Both <italic>CZF1</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> are predicted to contain a Zn(2)-Cys(6) zinc cluster motif, a known DNA-binding domain in fungal transcriptional regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b017">17</xref>]; indeed <italic>WOR2</italic> had been provisionally named <italic>ZCF33</italic> to indicate it was the 33rd protein annotated with this zinc cluster motif. <italic>HAP3</italic> is predicted to contain a motif similar to the CCAAT-binding factor. The genes <italic>CSR1</italic> and orf19.4972 are predicted to each contain multiple C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers, a well-characterized DNA-binding domain. Because chromatin structure has been proposed to play a role in regulating the white-opaque switch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b018">18</xref>], we also chose to investigate the opaque-enriched transcript <italic>PHO23,</italic> which encodes a protein containing a PHD domain and is predicted to be a part of the <italic>RPD3</italic> histone deacetylase complex.</p>
        <p>For each of these candidate genes, we attempted to make homozygous deletion mutants in a white strain that is mating type <bold>a</bold>, and is thus permissive for switching to the opaque cell type (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> is diploid, and it is therefore necessary to knock out two copies of each gene). Multiple independent deletion mutants of each target gene were made from independent heterozygous mutants. Despite numerous attempts, we were unable to create a homozygous knockout mutant of the <italic>CSR1</italic> gene and did not study <italic>CSR1</italic> further. White-opaque switching can occur in strains that are mating type <bold>a</bold> or α but not <bold>a</bold>/α. Most of the work presented in this paper was performed in <bold>a</bold> strains, but we know that Wor1 is also required for opaque formation in α strains (unpublished data and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b013">13</xref>]), suggesting that white-opaque switching is controlled the same way in <bold>a</bold> and α strains. Consistent with this idea, a large set of microarray data indicates that the set of genes regulated by white-opaque switching is virtually identical in <bold>a</bold> and α cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b003">3</xref>].</p>
        <p>For the five remaining candidates, we performed quantitative white-to-opaque switching assays as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b005">5</xref>] on at least two independent deletion mutants for each candidate gene, and multiple experiments were performed for each mutant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t001">Table 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t001">Table 1</xref>, two mutants, the <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ and <italic>wor2</italic>Δ<italic>/wor2</italic>Δ knockouts, had a dramatic effect on white-opaque switching, forming opaque colonies much less frequently than did otherwise isogenic wild type (WT) <bold>a</bold> strains. The <italic>CZF1</italic> deletion strain formed opaque sectors and colonies ∼50-fold less frequently than WT <bold>a</bold> strains. The <italic>wor2</italic>Δ<italic>/wor2</italic>Δ mutant was never observed to form opaque colonies, representing a switching frequency at least 180-fold below that of the parent strain. Due to the key role this gene has in white-opaque switching, as described in this paper, we named the gene <italic>WOR2</italic>. These results implicate both <italic>CZF1</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> in the white-opaque switch; formally, they function as activators of the opaque state.</p>

        <p>To verify that the defects in white-opaque switching were attributable to the disrupted genes, we complemented the <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf</italic>1Δ and <italic>wor2</italic>Δ/<italic>wor2</italic>Δ deletion mutants. Ectopic expression constructs, controlled by the <italic>MET3</italic> promoter were introduced into the <italic>RP10</italic> locus, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b019">19</xref>]. Both the <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ <italic>pMET3-CZF1</italic> and <italic>wor2</italic>Δ/<italic>wor2</italic>Δ <italic>pMET3-WOR2</italic> strains were able to form opaque colonies when the <italic>MET3</italic> promoter was induced. However, when an empty vector was introduced, or the strains were grown on media that repressed the <italic>MET3</italic> promoter (and thus the only copy of <italic>CZF1</italic> or <italic>WOR2</italic>, respectively), the strains remained white. These results confirmed that the loss of <italic>CZF1</italic> or <italic>WOR2</italic> drastically reduces the ability for the strains to grow as opaque cells.</p>
        <p>The deletion mutants lacking either orf19.4972 or <italic>HAP3</italic> formed opaque colonies at frequencies comparable to WT <bold>a</bold> strains and were not studied further. The <italic>pho23</italic>Δ/<italic>pho23</italic>Δ mutant switched to the opaque phase approximately six times as frequently as the WT control. If Pho23 works with Rpd3 in <italic>C. albicans,</italic> as is predicted based on homology in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> this result is consistent with a previous finding that <italic>rpd3</italic>Δ/<italic>rpd3</italic>Δ mutants have an increased frequency of interconversion between the white and opaque phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b018">18</xref>]. We did not study Pho23 further, because of its relatively small affect on switching frequencies, and because these effects could well be indirect: in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> deletion of <italic>RPD3</italic> affects transcription levels of approximately 13% of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b020">20</xref>].</p>

        <title>Genetic Epistasis Shows that <italic>WOR1</italic> Is Downstream of <italic>CZF1</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> in the Regulation of the White-Opaque Switch</title>
        <p>Previous work on the regulation of white-opaque switching identified <italic>WOR1</italic> as a master regulator of the white-opaque switch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b013">13</xref>]. In the next set of experiments, we tested the genetic interactions between <italic>WOR1, CZF1,</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> in order to understand how they work together to regulate the switch. As is the case for <italic>CZF1</italic> and <italic>WOR2,</italic> deletion of <italic>WOR1</italic> drastically reduces the frequency of opaque formation. Like <italic>CZF1,</italic> ectopic expression of <italic>WOR1</italic> causes mass conversion to the opaque phase in otherwise WT <bold>a</bold> cells.</p>
        <p>We first expressed <italic>WOR1</italic> ectopically in a <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ or <italic>wor2</italic>Δ<italic>/wor2</italic>Δ <bold>a</bold>-cell strain and observed the effects on white-opaque switching.

Inspection of the cells from the opaque colonies revealed elongated cells, typical of opaque cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

        <p>When we expressed <italic>WOR1</italic> ectopically in a white <italic>wor2</italic>Δ<italic>/wor2</italic>Δ <bold>a</bold> strain, we observed that all of the colonies contained cells that had switched to the opaque phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g001">Figure 1</xref>), usually in the form of opaque sectors, though the opaque sectors were slightly lighter in color than those of normal opaques (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t002">Table 2</xref>). This strain was never observed to form opaque cells when grown on media that repressed expression of the ectopic <italic>WOR1</italic>. The <italic>wor2</italic>Δ<italic>/wor2</italic>Δ strain with pCaEXP, an empty expression vector, also appeared locked in the white phase, whether it was grown on the repressing or inducing media (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we tested the effects of ectopic expression of <italic>CZF1</italic> in a <italic>wor1</italic>Δ<italic>/wor1</italic>Δ <bold>a</bold> strain. We found that these strains remained locked in the white phase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t002">Table 2</xref>); they were indistinguishable from a <italic>wor1</italic>Δ<italic>/wor1</italic>Δ mutant. Finally, we tested the ectopic expression of <italic>WOR2</italic> in a <italic>wor1</italic>Δ<italic>/wor1</italic>Δ <bold>a</bold> strain, and we found no change in the switching frequency, as compared to a <italic>wor1</italic>Δ<italic>/wor1</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t002">Table 2</xref>). This result was expected, given that induction of the <italic>WOR2</italic> ectopic construct had no effect in a WT background.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these results indicate that <italic>CZF1</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> function upstream of <italic>WOR1;</italic> thus ectopic expression of <italic>WOR1</italic> suffices for opaque cell formation whether or not <italic>WOR2</italic> and <italic>CZF1</italic> are present.

        <title><italic>CZF1</italic> Contributes to Formation of the Opaque State, but Is Not Necessary for Heritability of the Opaque State</title>
        <p>Unlike <italic>wor1</italic>Δ/<italic>wor1</italic>Δ and <italic>wor2</italic>Δ/<italic>wor2</italic>Δ mutants, <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ mutants do form opaque colonies, albeit infrequently. As described above, ectopic <italic>CZF1</italic> expression can induce a switch to the opaque state. To clarify <italic>CZF1</italic>'s role in white-opaque switching, we examined switching in the reverse direction, where opaque cells switch to white cells. When opaque isolates of WT <bold>a</bold> strains were replated on repressing media, about 16% of the colonies switched back to the white form (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t001">Table 1</xref>). The rare opaque isolates of <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ <bold>a</bold> strains were nearly as stable as WT opaques; upon replating, 23% of the colonies contained white cells.</p>
        <p>Because opaque isolates in <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ strains are rare, we sought to create more opaque <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ isolates in order to test the stability of the opaque cells lacking Czf1. To do this, we used the <italic>pMET3-WOR1</italic> ectopic expression construct to drive <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ strains to the opaque state, as described above. When the <italic>pMET3-WOR1</italic> construct was subsequently repressed in the <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ opaque <bold>a</bold> strains, at least 92% of the colonies remained opaque (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t003">Table 3</xref>). Similarly, a pulse of <italic>pMET3</italic>-<italic>WOR1</italic> in WT white <bold>a</bold> cells is sufficient to generate stable opaque populations; the ectopic Wor1 expression can be repressed and the strains will largely continue to grow in the opaque phase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t003">Table 3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b011">11</xref>].

        <p>Thus far, we have only considered the role of the opaque-enriched transcription factors <italic>WOR1, CZF1,</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> in the regulation of the white-opaque switch. However, a fourth regulator, <italic>EFG1,</italic> which is up-regulated in white cells, is known to participate in white-opaque switching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b015">15</xref>]. Experiments reported by Sonneborn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b014">14</xref>] suggested that depletion of Efg1 induced the formation of opaque cells in some <bold>a</bold>/α strain backgrounds, but not in others. To clarify these results, we constructed new isogenic homozygous <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ mutants in <bold>a</bold> or <bold>a</bold>/α strains. In the mating type <bold>a</bold> strain, we found the <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ mutation caused a majority of the population to switch to the opaque phase; over 98% of the colonies contained opaque sectors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t004">Table 4</xref>), with many colonies showing multiple sectors. We also observed a small number of entirely white colonies, indicating that <italic>EFG1</italic> is not strictly necessary for growth in the white phase. We also examined the opaque-to-white switching frequency in <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ mutants; we found that they switched to the white phase ∼80 times less frequently than WT <bold>a</bold> strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t004">Table 4</xref>). Thus, deletion of <italic>EFG1</italic> dramatically increased the likelihood the cells will grow in the opaque phase, confirming previous studies in WO-1, an α strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b015">15</xref>].</p>

        <p>In contrast to the previous reports, we never observed opaque colonies or sectors in the <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ mutant in an <bold>a</bold>/α strain, despite observing over 3,200 colonies (unpublished data).

        <title>Epistasis among <italic>EFG1, CZF1,</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic></title>
        <p>To understand the genetic interplay between <italic>EFG1, CZF1,</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic>, we created strains that lacked the white-enriched regulator <italic>EFG1</italic> and each of the opaque-enriched regulators, <italic>CZF1</italic> or <italic>WOR2</italic>. These double homozygous knockouts were then tested in quantitative switching assays and monitored for the frequency of forming white, opaque, and sectored colonies. Nearly all colonies of the <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ mutant were in the opaque phase or contained opaque sectors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t004">Table 4</xref>), reflecting the phenotype of the <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ mutant. When the opaque colonies isolated from <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ were replated to test the heritability of the state, only 0.08% of the colonies returned to the white state, in comparison with the normal opaque-to-white switching frequency, where ∼16% of the colonies are white or have white sectors. Thus, the <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ opaque cells are approximately 200-fold more stable than WT opaque cells, a stability similar to that of <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ <bold>a</bold> mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050256-t004">Table 4</xref>). Thus, in both forward and reverse switching frequency, the <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ <italic>czf1</italic>Δ/<italic>czf1</italic>Δ double mutants closely resembled the <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ single mutant.</p>
        <p>We also examined the switching behavior of an <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ <italic>wor2</italic>Δ<italic>/wor2</italic>Δ mutant. In this strain, white colonies accounted for ∼99% of the total colonies seen, reflecting the phenotype of the <italic>wor2</italic>Δ<italic>/wor2</italic>Δ mutant. We also tested the stability of these rare opaque colonies that were formed by the <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ <italic>wor2</italic>Δ<italic>/wor2</italic>Δ mutant. When replated, these opaque cells proved to be highly unstable; over 98% of the colonies were white or contained white sectors. Thus, in both forward and reverse switching, the <italic>efg1</italic>Δ/<italic>efg1</italic>Δ <italic>wor2</italic>Δ<italic>/wor2</italic>Δ double mutant resembled the <italic>wor2</italic>Δ<italic>/wor2</italic>Δ mutant.</p>

        <title>Wor1 Is Bound to DNA Upstream of <italic>CZF1, WOR2,</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic></title>
        <p>The genetic epistasis data presented above places <italic>WOR1</italic> at the center of white-opaque regulation; formally, it is the most “downstream” regulator of opaque formation, as its deletion blocks white-opaque switching in all contexts tested. Moreover, ectopic <italic>WOR1</italic> expression suffices to switch white cells to opaque cells when any of the other opaque-enriched transcription factors are deleted. Previous work indicated that Wor1 expression is maintained through an auto-stimulatory positive feedback loop, mediated by Wor1 binding at its own promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b011">11</xref>]. Expression of the genes encoding Czf1, Wor2, and Efg1 are all regulated by white-opaque switching; in the opaque form, <italic>CZF1</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> are up-regulated, and <italic>EFG1</italic> is down-regulated relative to the white form. Thus, in a formal sense all three are regulated by Wor1.</p>
        <p>To test whether Wor1 directly regulates <italic>CZF1, WOR2,</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic>, we performed ChIP using an affinity purified antibody (α-Wor1<sub>Nterm</sub>), raised against a peptide near the N terminus of Wor1. These ChIPs were analyzed genome-wide using microarrays (ChIP-chip): the precipitated DNA was amplified, fluorescently labeled, and competitively hybridized against genomic DNA (input DNA) on custom DNA tiling microarrays containing 60-mer oligonucleotides tiled at 80 bp intervals across the entire <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> genome. Two microarrays were hybridized with DNA from two separate immunoprecipitations (IPs) of an opaque WT <bold>a</bold> strain; a single ChIP was performed in a <italic>wor1</italic>Δ<italic>/wor1</italic>Δ (white) <bold>a</bold> strain as a control.</p>
        <p>We examined the Wor1 ChIP data using previously published software that implements a statistical model and integrates data from several neighboring spots along chromosomes to identify IP enrichment peaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b021">21</xref>]. Using standard parameters, this procedure identified 206 peaks of Wor1 enrichment across the genome in opaque cells. These peaks of Wor1 enrichment were confirmed by visual inspection of ChIP-chip data plotted along chromosomes. Of these peaks, 25 also appeared in the ChIP-chip of a <italic>wor1</italic>Δ/<italic>wor1</italic>Δ strain, and likely represent cross reactivity or particularly “sticky” proteins; they were removed from further analysis, leaving a set of 181 peaks of Wor1 enrichment. In parallel, we performed a series of ChIP-chip experiments using a different antibody against Wor1 (raised against a peptide at the C terminus of the Wor1 protein, α-Wor1<sub>Cterm</sub>) and identified 122 peaks of Wor1 enrichment in opaque strains that were not detected in the <italic>wor1</italic>Δ/<italic>wor1</italic>Δ control strain. By comparing the sets of peaks of Wor1 enrichment identified using both antibodies, we found that 112 peaks are enriched for Wor1 in opaque cells (but not <italic>wor1</italic>Δ/<italic>wor1</italic>Δ strains) using both antibodies. Thus, 112/122 (92%) of the peaks identified using the α-Wor1<sub>Cterm</sub> were also found using the N-terminal antibody, indicating the set of peaks identified with α-Wor1<sub>Cterm</sub> is almost entirely a subset of α-Wor1<sub>Nterm</sub> ChIP-chip data. We found that 112/181 (62%) of the targets identified in using the α-Wor1<sub>Nterm</sub> antibody were also detected using the α-Wor1<sub>Cterm</sub> in opaque cells. Because the experiments using α-Wor1<sub>Nterm</sub> exhibited very little cross-reactivity in <italic>wor1</italic>Δ/<italic>wor1</italic>Δ strains and virtually encompassed the set found using α-Wor1<sub>Cterm</sub>, we chose the targets identified in the α-Wor1<sub>Nterm</sub> ChIP-chip as our set of high-confidence Wor1 targets for further analysis.</p>
        <p>With 181 peaks identified as high confidence Wor1 targets using the α-Wor1<sub>Nterm</sub> antibody, we turned to the question of identifying the genes potentially regulated by Wor1. We chose to limit the set to the 170 peaks positioned in intergenic regions upstream of at least one open reading frame (ORF); this eliminated three peaks positioned within ORFs and eight peaks positioned between convergent ORFs. Because some of the 170 peaks of Wor1 enrichment lay in the intergenic region of divergently transcribed genes, there are 221 genes potentially regulated by Wor1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050256-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>We found clear Wor1 enrichment at the intergenic regions immediately upstream of the <italic>CZF1, WOR2,</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic> coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In the ∼7.6 kb of intergenic sequence upstream of <italic>CZF1,</italic> we found segments that were enriched up to 20-fold for Wor1, as compared to a <italic>wor1</italic>Δ<italic>/wor1</italic>Δ control strain. Upstream of the <italic>WOR2</italic> coding sequence, we found segments enriched up to 11-fold. Wor1 was enriched up to ∼12-fold in the 10.1 kb upstream of <italic>EFG1</italic>. We also verified that Wor1 was found upstream of the <italic>WOR1</italic> gene using the tiling arrays, showing enrichment up to ∼80-fold in the opaque cells, as compared to the control <italic>wor1</italic>Δ/<italic>wor1</italic>Δ strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g003">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b011">11</xref>]. These results confirm that Wor1 is present at its own promoter in opaque cells, and reveal that Wor1 is also present at the promoters of <italic>CZF1, WOR2,</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic> in opaque <bold>a</bold> cells.</p>

The bottom binding profile, showing the DNA upstream of <italic>PHO23</italic>, serves as an example of the low levels of Wor1 enrichment seen throughout the majority of the genome.

        </fig>
        <p>We also compared the set of 221 genes potentially regulated directly by Wor1 to the set of genes differentially transcribed between white and opaque cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b003">3</xref>]. We found Wor1 enrichment at the intergenic regions upstream of 38 opaque-enriched genes and 20 white-enriched genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050256-st001">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that Wor1 directly controls expression of approximately 15% of the genes regulated by white-opaque switching. These results also suggest that Wor1 may function in opaque cells as both a transcriptional repressor and as an activator. Though there is some ambiguity in ascribing Wor1 regulation at divergently transcribed genes, we estimate that Wor1 also binds more than 100 genes that have not been previously identified as white- or opaque-enriched by transcriptional profiling.</p>
        <p>As described above, Wor1 protein is bound at the intergenic DNA upstream of the genes <italic>WOR1, EFG1, CZF1,</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic>. Each of these genes has a remarkably long upstream region of DNA (at least 7 kb in each case), and Wor1 appears to be bound at multiple positions along these regions. From the ChIP-chip experiments, we found that occupancy of large intergenic regions is a general characteristic of Wor1. Analysis of the intergenic regions at all 6,077 gene promoters in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> genome (excluding those at telomeres) revealed a median promoter length of 623 bp, whereas the median promoter length of the 181 gene promoters bound by Wor1 was 3,390 bp (unpublished data). This preference is especially pronounced when considering the intergenic regions over 10 kb; Wor1 enrichment was seen at 12 of 19 of these intergenic regions. Intriguingly, over half (seven of 12) of these intergenic regions lie upstream of genes encoding sequence-specific DNA binding proteins—<italic>WOR1, RFG1, TCC1, WOR2, ZCF37, EFG1,</italic> and <italic>RME1</italic>—suggesting Wor1 may exert much of its control over the white-opaque switch indirectly through other transcriptional regulators.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this paper, we have dissected the genetic circuitry controlling white-opaque switching in the fungal pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic>. White-opaque switching is an epigenetic change between two distinct types of cells, both containing the same genome. The white-opaque switch is crucial for many aspects of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> biology, including interactions with other <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> cells (pheromone sensing and mating) and interactions with the host (opportunistic pathogenesis). Our results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g005">5</xref>, where the circuitry controlling this switch is diagrammed. This network of positive feedback loops is responsible for the heritability of each state, as well as the frequency of switching between them, and we propose that the structure of this network makes an important contribution to the biology of white-opaque switching.</p>

          <p>(A) In white <bold>a</bold>/α cells, the a1-α2 heterodimer represses <italic>WOR1,</italic> keeping the Wor1-mediated feedback loops inactive. This allows <italic>EFG1</italic> expression and formation of white cells.</p>

      <p>The default state can be considered the white cell type: most clinical isolates of <italic>C. albicans</italic> are <bold>a</bold>/α cells, and they are locked in the white state through a1-α2 repression of <italic>WOR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). However, even in <bold>a</bold> and α cells, which are permissive for white-opaque switching, the white cell type still seems to be the default, in that white cells are generally more stable than opaque cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). For example, opaque cells at 24 °C are stable for many generations, but above 30 °C they become unstable and rapidly switch back en masse to the white form, which is stable under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b002">2</xref>]. There are no known environmental conditions that comparably destabilize the white form. In our model, the opaque form is generated when the series of positive feedback loops shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g004">Figure 4</xref> become excited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Thus, in opaque cells, <italic>WOR1</italic> likely directly induces <italic>CZF1</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> expression, and in turn, <italic>CZF1</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> both activate <italic>WOR1</italic>. <italic>CZF1</italic> does this by repressing a repressor of the opaque state (<italic>EFG1</italic>), the net effect being a positive feedback loop.</p>
      <p>The multiple feedback loops observed in the opaque state are reminiscent of those seen in differentiated animal cells, such as those of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b022">22</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b023">23</xref>]) and the mammalian myoblast ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b024">24</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b025">25</xref>]). A series of such feedback loops (as opposed to a single loop) buffers the circuit against transient fluctuations in any single regulatory protein and therefore provides additional stability to the excited form of the circuit. In addition, the nature of the circuit probably defines the switching frequency. For example, deletion of <italic>CZF1</italic> decreases the white-to-opaque switching frequency by approximately 10-fold, but has little effect on the backward switching rate. Thus, the primary role of <italic>CZF1</italic> seems to be in modulating the switching frequency; in contrast, <italic>WOR1</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> are both required to maintain the opaque state; thus their roles are more integral to the switch itself.</p>
      <p>Although the overall logic of the circuit shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g004">Figure 4</xref> can explain many features of white-opaque switching, there appear to be several unusual features of the circuit components themselves that likely also play important roles in white-opaque switching. For example, our ChIP-chip experiments revealed that Wor1 binding shows a bias toward genes with unusually long upstream intergenic regions—as defined by the distance from the 5′ end of the ORF to the next annotated coding region. This observation suggests that these genes bound by Wor1, which include the four encoding transcriptional regulators that form the interlocking feedback loops (<italic>WOR1</italic>, <italic>EFG1</italic>, <italic>CZF1</italic>, and <italic>WOR2</italic>) are also controlled by a number of other transcriptional regulators. It is known that the frequency of white-opaque switching can be influenced by environmental cues (e.g., temperature and oxidative stress) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b026">26</xref>], and it seems plausible that different rates of switching could be “set” by individually adjusting the levels of the regulatory proteins that make up the circuit. For example, since deletion of <italic>CZF1</italic> reduces the frequency of white-to-opaque switching 10-fold, regulation of the level of Czf1 by environmental signals could directly control the “forward” switching rate. Another unusual feature of the circuit concerns the wide distribution of Wor1 over much of the upstream regions of <italic>WOR1, EFG1, CZF1,</italic> and <italic>WOR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050256-g003">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting a highly cooperative transcriptional response to the intracellular levels of <italic>WOR1</italic>. This, combined with the interlocking positive feedback loops, could be responsible for the switch-like behavior of the system, specifically the failure to readily observe a cell type intermediate between white and opaque in wild-type switching strains.</p>
      <p>The switch from the white to the opaque form growth alters transcription of approximately 400 genes. We know that the master regulator Wor1 ultimately controls all of these genes, since deletion of <italic>WOR1</italic> locks cells in the white form, and ectopic expression of <italic>WOR1</italic> converts white cells en masse to opaque cells. Our ChIP-chip analysis revealed that Wor1 directly regulates approximately 15% of this gene set (20 white-enriched genes and 38 opaque-enriched genes). Since Wor1 is also bound upstream of <italic>CZF1, EFG1, WOR2,</italic> and 20 additional transcriptional regulators (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050256-st001">Table S1</xref>), it seems likely that much of white-opaque switching program is regulated indirectly by Wor1 through its effects on other transcriptional regulators.</p>
      <p>An unexpected outcome of the Wor1 ChIP-chip experiments was the presence of Wor1 at a large number of genes that were not identified as white- or opaque-enriched in previous microarray analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b003">3</xref>]. There are several explanations for this observation. First, Wor1 could control these genes in both white and opaque cells, with their transcription being unaffected by the white-to-opaque transition. We think this explanation is unlikely because Wor1 is up-regulated 45-fold in opaque cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b003">3</xref>], and it seems improbable that this change could have no impact on expression of target genes. To test this idea directly, we performed a Wor1 ChIP-chip experiment in white <bold>a</bold> cells, and found that Wor1 is not bound at any of these target genes (unpublished data). A second possibility, one that we favor, is that Wor1 may occupy the promoters of these 100 genes in opaque cells, preparing their expression to respond to unknown environmental signals, perhaps those generated by the host. According to this idea, the standard laboratory conditions used for transcriptional profiling would not have included the necessary environmental stimuli, and thus these genes would not have been identified as regulated by the white-opaque switch. This idea suggests there are additional aspects to white-opaque switching which have not been previously recognized.</p>
      <p>Finally we note that white-opaque switching does not appear to be a general feature of fungi, even those that are closely related to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content>. Indeed it may have arisen during the long association of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> with its warm-blooded hosts. The evolution of a complex circuit composed of interlocking feedback loops is relatively simple to imagine, as it could occur stepwise simply through the acquisitions of cis-acting sequences in genes for transcriptional regulators used for other purposes in the cell. We note that Czf1 also relieves Efg1-mediated repression of hyphal growth under embedded conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050256-b027">27</xref>], and this genetic relationship has been maintained in the regulation of the white-opaque switch. Thus <italic>EFG1</italic> and <italic>CZF1</italic> have other key functions in the cell—even in cells that are genetically blocked for white-opaque switching—and their involvement in white-opaque switching could well be a recent adaptation, functioning to modulate the stability of the two states and the frequency of switching between them. The independent evolution of interlocking transcriptional feedback loops in a variety of distinct biological contexts (white-opaque switching in <italic>C. albicans,</italic> eye development in flies, and muscle development in mammals, for example) suggests they are particularly effective ways of providing, from the same genome, distinctive cell types that can be stably propagated for many generations.</p>

Cell pellets were resuspended in 39 ml of Buffer Z (1 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.4]), 28 μl of β-ME was added (14.3 M, final concentration 10 mM), and cells were vortexed. 20 μl of lyticase (Sigma, MO, United States) solution (2 mg/ml in Buffer Z) was added, and cell suspensions were incubated 15 min at 30 °C.

      <p>We thank Joachim Ernst (Institut fur Mikrobiologie, Germany) for providing the <italic>EFG1</italic> mutant strains SS4 and HLC52. We also thank Hana El-Samad, David Pincus, and members of the Johnson Lab for many helpful discussions and reagents.</p>
      <p><bold>Author</bold> <bold>contributions.</bold> REZ and MGM constructed strains, performed switching assays, and designed and tested genetic models for white-opaque switching. DJG performed the full genome chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. BBT designed the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. albicans</named-content> tiling microarrays used to analyze the chromatin immunoprecipitation studies. ADJ oversaw the work.</p>
