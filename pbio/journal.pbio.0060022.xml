        <p>CpG islands (CGIs) are dense clusters of CpG sequences that punctuate the CpG-deficient human genome and associate with many gene promoters. As CGIs also differ from bulk chromosomal DNA by their frequent lack of cytosine methylation, we devised a CGI enrichment method based on nonmethylated CpG affinity chromatography. The resulting library was sequenced to define a novel human blood CGI set that includes many that are not detected by current algorithms. Approximately half of CGIs were associated with annotated gene transcription start sites, the remainder being intra- or intergenic. Using an array representing over 17,000 CGIs, we established that 6%–8% of CGIs are methylated in genomic DNA of human blood, brain, muscle, and spleen. Inter- and intragenic CGIs are preferentially susceptible to methylation. CGIs showing tissue-specific methylation were overrepresented at numerous genetic loci that are essential for development, including <italic>HOX</italic> and <italic>PAX</italic> family members. The findings enable a comprehensive analysis of the roles played by CGI methylation in normal and diseased human tissues.</p>

          <p>The human genome contains about 22,000 genes, each encoding one of the proteins required for human life. A particular cell type (e.g., blood, skin, etc.) expresses a specific subset of protein genes and silences the remainder. To shed light on the mechanisms that cause genes to be activated or shut down, we studied DNA sequences called “CpG islands” (CGIs). These sequences are found at over half of all human genes and can exist in either the active or silent state depending on the presence or absence of methyl groups on the DNA. We devised a method for purifying all CGIs and showed that, unexpectedly, only half occur at the beginning of genes near the promoter, the rest occurring within or between genes. Notably, methylation of CGIs causes stable gene silencing. We tested 17,000 CGIs in four human tissues and found that 6%–8% were methylated in each. Genes whose protein products play an essential role during embryonic development were preferentially methylated, suggesting that gene expression during development could be regulated by CGI methylation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>DNA methylation in the mammalian genome arises due to covalent addition of a methyl group to the 5′ position of cytosine in the context of the palindromic dinucleotide, CpG. This modification is established and maintained by a family of DNA methyltransferases that are essential for development and viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b002">2</xref>]. The pattern of CpG methylation in the human genome distinguishes two fractions with distinct properties: a major fraction (∼98%), in which CpGs are relatively infrequent (on average 1 per 100 bp) but highly methylated (approximately 80% of all CpG sites), and a minor fraction (&lt;2%) that comprises short stretches of DNA (∼1,000 bp) in which CpG is frequent (∼1 per 10 bp) and methylation-free. The latter are known as CpG islands (CGIs) and they frequently colocalise with the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b004">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although CGIs are often free of methylation, there are circumstances in which they become heavily methylated, and this invariably correlates with silencing of any promoter within the CGI. Artificial methylation of CGI promoters has long been known to extinguish transcription when the constructs are introduced into living cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b005">5</xref>]. Moreover, demethylation of endogenous methylated CGIs using DNA methytransferase inhibitors can restore expression of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b006">6</xref>]. These findings demonstrate that dense CpG methylation prevents expression of CGI promoters. Because of this biological consequence, it is important to know the extent of CGI methylation in both normal and diseased tissue states. The classical example is X chromosome inactivation in placental mammals, during which hundreds of CGI promoters become methylated and contribute to the stability of gene inactivation on this chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b008">8</xref>]. Genomic imprinting can also depend upon differential CGI methylation between maternal and paternal alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b009">9</xref>]. Certain “testis-specific antigen” genes possess CGIs that are methylated in all somatic tissues, but not in testis, where the genes are expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b010">10</xref>]. Several additional candidates for CGI methylation in normal tissues have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b012">12</xref>], and the number of cases has recently grown due to large-scale bisulfite sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b013">13</xref>] and analysis of promoter methylation using microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b014">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the cases of X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting, the biological processes were described initially, and CpG methylation was subsequently implicated through mechanistic studies. To uncover new biological roles for CGI methylation in hitherto undiscovered biological processes, it would be advantageous to comprehensively screen genomic DNA for methylated CGIs in normal or diseased cell types. A persistent limitation affecting this kind of approach has been uncertainty concerning CGI identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b015">15</xref>]. The criteria for designating a sequence as CGI-like are currently exclusively bioinformatic in nature, relying on the differences in the base composition and CpG frequencies (observed/expected) between bulk genomic DNA and CGIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b017">17</xref>]. In an attempt to address this limitation and create a resource for future analysis, we developed a method for CGI identification and purification based on their lack of CpG methylation in an otherwise highly methylated genome.</p>
      <p>Our method utilised a protein domain with a specific affinity for clustered nonmethylated CpG sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b019">19</xref>]. Using this reagent we physically purified DNA sequences that contain clusters of nonmethylated CpG-rich DNA from human blood DNA. Large-scale sequencing of the fraction identified a CGI set that was annotated on the ENSEMBL database. We found that many CGIs in the set were not associated with promoters of annotated genes, but were either within transcription units or between genes. By arraying the intact CGI sequences, we were able to interrogate genomic DNA fractions from several human tissues in order to identify methylated CGIs. The results revealed large numbers of CGIs that are methylated in normal human tissues, many of which showed tissue-specific methylation.</p>

        <title>A Novel Technique for Purification of CpG Islands</title>
        <p>To enrich for nonmethylated CpG-rich DNA (CpG islands), we developed the technique of CXXC affinity purification (CAP). This uses the cysteine-rich CXXC3 domain that has a high affinity for nonmethylated CpG sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b019">19</xref>]. A recombinant CXXC domain from mouse Mbd1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b019">19</xref>] was expressed in bacteria, and its binding specificity for nonmethylated CpG sites was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The CXXC domain had no detectable affinity for DNA containing only methylated CpGs or for DNA lacking CpGs altogether. We linked the CXXC domain to a sepharose matrix and confirmed that this fractionated DNA fragments according to CpG density and methylation status (unpublished data). All DNA bound to the column at 0.1 M salt. Methylated DNA and CpG-poor DNA eluted at ∼0.4 M NaCl, whereas elution of nonmethylated CpG-rich DNA required 0.6–1.0 M NaCl. To test the behaviour of CGIs on the column, human genomic DNA was digested with MseI (TTAA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b020">20</xref>] and fractionated over the CXXC column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The reasoning behind use of Mse1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b020">20</xref>] was to cut AT-rich bulk genomic DNA into small fragments (predicted average = 123 bp), but to leave CGIs relatively intact (predicted average = 625 bp). As bulk genomic DNA has a CpG on average every 100 bp, most Mse1 fragments will have too few CpGs to be retained by the CXXC matrix. CGIs on the other hand, with 1 CpG per ∼10 bp, will give rise to long fragments with many CpGs. Eluted fractions were interrogated by PCR using primers specific for a range of known CGIs and non-CGI sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). For example, the nonmethylated CGI of the <italic>P48</italic> gene eluted at high salt. The X-linked monoamine oxidase (<italic>MAO</italic>) gene eluted as a single high salt peak from male genomic DNA (where it is nonmethylated), but as two separate peaks at high and low salt when female DNA (with one methylated and one nonmethylated allele) was fractionated. The CGI associated with the <italic>NYESO</italic> testis-specific antigen gene (methylated in somatic tissues) eluted from the CXXC column by low salt as predicted. The data confirm that CAP may be used to purify a CGI fraction from human genomic DNA.</p>

        <p>Most or all CGIs are in a nonmethylated state in sperm, but in addition repetitive elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b021">21</xref>] and telomere-proximal sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b022">22</xref>], both of which are moderately CpG-rich, are hypomethylated in sperm DNA. To avoid contamination of the CGI fraction with sequences that are nonmethylated, specifically in germ cells, whole human blood was used as a source of CGI fragments. Pooled whole blood DNA from three males was fractionated using the CXXC column. High salt fractions were pooled, diluted, and re-chromatographed before cloning in plasmids. The resulting blood CGI library was analysed by 221,860 sequence reads representing 119,487 genomic templates. These compiled to give 28,013 unique MseI fragments. Plots of DNA insert length versus either G+C content or observed/expected CpG frequency (CpG[o/e]) showed that the great majority of clones exhibited a higher G+C content (average = 62%) and CpG[o/e] (average = 0.71) than bulk genomic DNA (G+C = 41% and CpG[o/e] = 0.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">2</xref>B). A fraction of small fragments with sequence characteristics resembling bulk genomic DNA was detected by these plots. As these probably represent contamination, we filtered out fragments shorter than 512 bp that had a GC content less than 50% and/or a CpG[o/e] less than 0.6 (see grey dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">2</xref>B). The resulting final sequenced set corresponds to 17,387 CGIs and is annotated on the ENSEMBL genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ensembl.org/index.html</ext-link>. DAS sources: “CPG island clones”). The great majority have classical CGI properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Due to their high average GC content, the sequence pass rate was 69%. Assuming that the unsequenced clones reflect the same proportion of CGIs as those that were sequenced, we estimate the total number of CGIs in the library as 25,200. It is likely that a higher proportion of sequence failures affect bona fide CGIs, as GC-richness is known to interfere with sequencing. If so, we estimate that the number of human genomic CGIs may be closer to 30,000.</p>

        <p>CGIs are identified bioinformatically as DNA sequences with a base composition greater than 50% G+C and a CpG[o/e] of more than 0.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b023">23</xref>]. The DNA length over which this condition applies is critical. Initially the threshold most often used was 200 bp, whereas 500 bp is now more commonly applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b017">17</xref>]. These two criteria are formalised as “NCBI-relaxed” and “NCBI-strict,” respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/static/humansearch.html#cpg" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/static/humansearch.html#cpg</ext-link>). The relaxed algorithm predicts 307,193 CGIs in the human genome, which includes many repeated sequences and gene exons. Over 90% of NCBI-relaxed CGIs are not represented in either our library or the set predicted by the NCBI-strict. This and other arguments suggest that the great majority (&gt;90%) are false positives. On the other hand, 77% of clones in the CGI library match CGIs predicted by the “NCBI-strict” algorithm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060022-t001">Table 1</xref>). Examples of the coincidence of NCBI-strict predicted CGIs and sequenced CGI clones are illustrated for the three typical regions of the human genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).</p>

        <p>Altogether, NCBI-strict identifies 24,163 CGIs in the human genome, which accords with the adjusted CGI library estimate of 25,200. The coincidence of these numbers masks significant differences, however, as 23% of CGIs in the library are not detected by the NCBI-strict algorithm (4,082 out of 17,387; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060022-t001">Table 1</xref>). Four randomly selected examples of library CGIs not detected by NCBI-strict (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">2</xref>E, numbered) gave CpG maps resembling CGIs; three of these coincided with the promoters of annotated protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">2</xref>E). The presence of bioinformatically predicted CGIs that are missing from the CGI library is most probably due to sequence failure of ∼31% of library inserts. Analysis of the CGIs missed by the NCBI-strict algorithm shows them to be, as expected, significantly weaker with respect to CpG and G+C content than the total set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060022-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). It was not obvious, however, that the algorithm could be easily improved based on this information. Relaxation of the sequence parameters reduces the number of false negatives, but leads to increased numbers of false positives. We suggest that CAP identifies islands that fail the NCBI criteria, but reduces the false discovery rate by excluding spurious methylated CpG-rich sequences. Like the majority of CGIs, most NCBI-missed islands are gene-associated, although with an increased incidence of intragenic islands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060022-st001">Table S1</xref>). The CGI library therefore includes a significant fraction of bona fide CGIs that are missed by one of the best available algorithms.</p>
        <p>CAP defines a set of CGIs that is coherent with respect to clustering of nonmethylated CpG sites. The genomic distribution of these CGI sequences correlates strongly with gene density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). For example, gene-rich Chromosome 19 is also CGI-rich, whereas gene-poor Chromosome 18 is correspondingly CGI-poor. With respect to annotated protein-coding genes, we found that 76% of CGIs are within 1.5 kb of a transcription unit, but only 49% overlap with the TSS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060022-t002">Table 2</xref>). It follows that half of CGIs are not TSS-associated, but are either within downstream regions of transcription units (22%) or located in intergenic DNA. Previous studies have detected CGIs at the TSS of 56% of human protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b024">24</xref>]. As 43.5% of TSSs overlap sequenced CGIs, we calculate that the sequenced set of 17,387 CGIs represents 78% of the CGI complement. According to this calculation, the total CGI number would be 22,400, somewhat less than the figure of 25,200 deduced from the fraction of sequenced inserts.</p>

        <title>MBD Affinity Purification and Blood CGI Methylation</title>
        <p>CAP selects CGIs from blood DNA based on their lack of methylation and therefore excludes the small fraction of CGIs (&lt;3%) that are fully methylated in somatic cells from the set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b014">14</xref>]. Indeed, CGIs associated with the human testis-specific antigen genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b010">10</xref>], which are methylated in somatic tissues, were not enriched by CAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) or present in the library (unpublished data). Despite the absence of these fully methylated CGIs, we reasoned that the blood CGI library provides an opportunity to screen for methylation that affects a fraction of all copies of a specific CGI in whole blood DNA. Also, it permits a screen for differential methylation of CGIs in tissues and cell types other than blood. To investigate CGI methylation in normal human tissues, we constructed an array of sequenced CGIs from the library by immobilising single-stranded PCR-amplified inserts on glass slides using 5′-aminolink chemistry as described (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Microarrays/arraylab/methods.shtml" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Microarrays/arraylab/methods.shtml</ext-link>). As probes for the array, methylated CGIs were enriched from genomic DNA using MBD affinity purification (MAP), which was shown previously to efficiently bind methylated CGIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b020">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g003">3</xref>B). Human male and female blood DNA was MseI-digested and ligated to universal catch linkers. We verified by PCR that affinity fractionation using MAP effectively separated known methylated CGIs (<italic>XIST</italic> on the active X chromosome and <italic>NYESO</italic>) from bulk genomic DNA and nonmethylated CGIs (<italic>P48</italic> and <italic>XIST</italic> on the inactive X chromosome; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Male and female DNA fractions were pooled after two rounds of MAP, amplified by linker-mediated PCR, cyanine labeled, and hybridized to the CGI microarray. Quadruplicate hybridisations (inclusive of cyanine dye swaps) gave mean enrichment values (MAP/Input) that allowed a comparison between male and female methylated CGI complements. As expected, these were positively correlated (<italic>R</italic> = 0.865 Pearson correlation) suggesting similar overall patterns. As the library comprises MseI fragments that sometimes overlap minimally with the cognate CpG-rich region, we chose to disregard data from spots that contained DNA with an average CpG frequency (observed/expected) of less than 0.5. Although the omitted fragments often denote CGIs, they include too little of the CpG-rich domain to be reliable for detection of MAP probes. This refinement reduced the number of analysable CGIs on the array to 14,318. To assess the relationship between hybridization signal relative to input and degree of enrichment by MAP, we measured a selection of CGIs in the probe by quantitative PCR and compared this data with the <italic>M</italic> values (log2 [MAP signal]/[Input signal]) for those sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The results established that <italic>M</italic> values greater than 1.5 denote CGIs that are significantly enriched by MAP and therefore methylated. CGIs of the <italic>BEST1</italic> and <italic>R4RL1</italic> genes were predicted to be nonmethylated (<italic>M</italic> = 0.2–0.4) and methylated (<italic>M</italic> = 2.2–2.8), respectively, based on the array data. Bisulfite genomic sequencing confirmed this expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g003">Figure 3</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g003">3</xref>H).</p>

        <p>The major difference in CGI methylation between male and female DNA was expected to be due to X chromosome inactivation (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b025">25</xref>]). We therefore compared the methylation status of CGIs on Chr 16 and Chr X in male versus female DNA. Chr 16 CGIs did not vary between males and females, whereas Chr X CGIs were significantly enriched in female DNA as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g003">Figure 3</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g003">3</xref>F; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060022-st002">Table S2</xref>). Studies of human X chromosome inactivation have indicated that a proportion of genes escape inactivation and are therefore expressed from both chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b027">27</xref>].

        <title>Differential CGI Methylation in Human Tissues</title>
        <p>Methylation of CGIs on the inactive X chromosome and at imprinted genes is well known, but CGI methylation at other chromosomal loci in normal cells and tissues is incompletely characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b030">30</xref>]. To investigate this issue on a large scale, we probed CGI arrays with MAP fractions from genomic DNA (three individuals per pool) of brain, muscle, spleen, and sperm in addition to blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). MAP enrichment of methylated CGIs in sperm DNA consistently failed to generate enough DNA for labeling using our standard PCR amplification conditions and was therefore not analysed further. We conclude that the level of CGI methylation in sperm is far lower than in any of the somatic tissues. Taking <italic>M</italic> values greater than 1.5 to signify methylation, we observed between 5.7% and 8.3% of CGIs methylated in the somatic tissues that were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g004">Figure 4</xref>B; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060022-t003">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060022-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>). Some CGIs were methylated in common between all the tested somatic tissues, whereas others were methylated in only one or a subset of the tissues. We noted that methylated CGIs disproportionately involved those that are remote from the TSS of an annotated gene. In the dataset as a whole, only 8% of TSS CGIs showed evidence of methylation in at least one tissue, whereas 22% of 3′ CGIs were methylated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060022-t004">Table 4</xref>). Do the methylated CGIs differ in sequence characteristics from CGIs that remain methylation-free? We plotted the CpG[o/e] frequencies of 1,657 CGIs that acquired methylation in one or more tissues and found a mean CpG[o/e] of 0.77 compared with 0.75 for methylated CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Though statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>-value = 1.413e-10) the biological significance of this small difference is unclear.</p>

        <p>We checked by bisulfite sequence analysis a panel of seven CGIs with <italic>M</italic> values suggestive of tissue-specific methylation (<italic>M</italic> values differing between tissues by &gt;0.75). In each case, bisulfite data confirmed the microarray predictions. CGI I1878 is not associated with an annotated gene (±1.5 kb) and is methylated exclusively in muscle and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).

        <p>Many methylated CGIs were associated with genes that are essential for development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This was confirmed by analysis of gene ontology, which showed significant overrepresentation of genes whose products are involved in developmental processes, including ectoderm and mesoderm development, neurogenesis, and segment specification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060022-st003">Table S3</xref>). Transcription factors, including homeobox family members and other DNA binding proteins, were twice as abundant as expected by chance. Other gene categories did not show significant enrichment. Among the CGIs whose methylation status was confirmed by bisulfite sequencing, <italic>PAX6</italic> is involved in eye development and neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b032">32</xref>], the <italic>HOXC</italic> cluster lays down the embryonic body plan, and <italic>OSR1</italic> is related to a gene involved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut development. We examined the extended <italic>HOXC</italic> and <italic>PAX6</italic> loci for CGI methylation status using the MAP-CGI array data. Our library identified 19 CGIs within the 150-kb <italic>HOXC</italic> gene cluster of which eight were methylated differentially in blood, muscle, and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Brain was the only tissue that lacked obvious <italic>HOXC</italic> CGI methylation. Of nine CGIs near <italic>PAX6</italic>, two showed differential methylation. In addition to brain-specific methylation of the <italic>PAX6-Q59GD2</italic> CGI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), we observed methylation of a CGI upstream of the major <italic>PAX6</italic> promoter in muscle and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g005">Figure 5</xref>D).</p>
        <p>The majority of CGIs identified as methylated by MAP-CGI array hybridization display composite methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g004">4</xref>, and 5), whereby DNA strands at a specific locus were either heavily methylated or essentially nonmethylated. This can explain why CGIs that were initially selected by being nonmethylated in blood DNA (by CAP) nevertheless register as methylated by MAP-CGI array analysis. One potential explanation for composite CGI methylation is that different individuals within the tissue pools exhibit different CGI methylation. To look for such “polymorphism,” we examined CGI I5134, which is within the <italic>HOXC</italic> cluster and shows composite methylation by bisulfite genomic sequencing. Analysis of individuals by MAP-CGI arrays showed highly significant differences between individual C and individuals A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). This strikingly confirms individual variability in methylation at this CGI.</p>
        <p>Another potential explanation for composite CGI methylation is that cell types within the tissue sample possess different CGI methylation profiles. Blood, for example, consists of monocytes and granulocytes, each of which is subdivided into other cell types. As CGI I2985 was methylated at about half of DNA strands in blood, we tested the level of CGI methylation in DNA from monocytes and granulocytes separately. The results showed that monocytes had high methylation levels at this CGI, whereas granulocytes had very low methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g005">Figure 5</xref>F). These findings indicate a developmental origin for cell type–specific methylation at this genomic CGI.</p>

        <title>A Comprehensive CGI Set</title>
        <p>We describe the characterisation of a comprehensive, verified CGI set derived from human blood genomic DNA that will be beneficial for studies of CGIs in normal human tissues and in disease settings. By focusing on CGIs alone, we excluded ∼98% of the genome from our analysis. While it will ultimately be important to know in detail the methylation status of whole genomes, this currently represents a technical challenge that has been addressed only for the small-genomed plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b034">34</xref>]. These studies used indirect microarray-based methods for mapping DNA methylation that depend upon probes enriched in methylated domains. Current enrichment methods require clusters of CpG methylation, which are notably absent from the CpG-deficient majority of the mammalian genome. As a result, much bulk genomic DNA is beyond the resolution limit of this approach. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing, the most direct and reliable method for mapping methylated sites, has not yet been attempted in any organism. We therefore decided to study a discrete genomic fraction with evident biological relevance whose methylation status can be interrogated using microarray-based methods.</p>
        <p>To isolate nonmethylated duplex CGIs from total genomic DNA, we harnessed the binding specificity of the CXXC protein domain. Extensive sequencing of the resulting library confirmed that CGIs represent a discrete fraction of the human genome with shared DNA sequence characteristics. The present CGI set supercedes a previous human CGI library that was prepared in our laboratory using an indirect affinity purification procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b020">20</xref>]. The initial library was not comprehensive and appears to have acquired significant levels of non-CGI contamination following amplifications. We estimate that the new library represents ∼25,000 CGIs, of which ∼60% have been arrayed as full-length single strands on glass slides. Additional analysis of inserts that initially failed conventional sequencing strategies will generate an array that covers the great majority of CGIs that are nonmethylated in human blood. The choice of blood DNA as a starting material necessarily excludes from the set any CGIs that are nonmethylated in germ cells, but densely methylated in the soma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b014">14</xref>]. In the future, it will be instructive to compare an exhaustive sequence analysis of this set with comparable sequences isolated by CAP from sperm DNA.</p>
        <p>The library prepared using CAP defines CGIs based on the empirical criterion of clustered nonmethylated CpGs, whereas criteria based purely on base sequence and composition necessarily ignore methylation status. Comparing our set with predicted CGIs on the NCBI database shows good overlap with predictions based on the “strict” algorithm. The CGI library did, however, identify 23% of CGIs that were negative by this criterion. This suggests that the software for DNA sequence-based CGI identification misses almost one in four CGIs that the more biological criterion of CAP is able to include. Recent CGI analyses identified large numbers of human CGI promoters that are enriched in methylation at lysine 4 of histone H3, a mark of transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b036">36</xref>]. Since it has been proposed that hypomethylation is dependent on germ line and early embryonic transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b003">3</xref>], we determined the overlap between our CGI set and the H3K4 sites in human embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b037">37</xref>]. We calculate that 90% of CGIs in the filtered set (14,318) coincide with H3K4 methylated promoters that were reported in the chromatin study. A better test of the relationship between CGIs and H3K4 methylation islands in ES cells is to exclude promoters of annotated genes and focus on intra- and intergenic CGIs. Here again, a high proportion (75%) of CGIs overlap with H3K4 methylation islands. These findings are compatible with the notion that the presence of CGIs is connected with specialised chromatin configurations in early embryonic cells. An intriguing proposal is that H3K4 methylation may be incompatible with docking of de novo methyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b038">38</xref>]. This could in theory insure that these regions remain free of CpG methylation at a time when the rest of the embryonic genome is subject to global methylation.</p>
        <p>We found that 49% of CGIs overlap the TSS of an annotated gene. In considering the function of the half of CGIs that are remote from an annotated TSS, it is noteworthy that several intragenic CGIs have been shown to coincide with previously unforeseen promoters that initiate bona fide transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b040">40</xref>]. This raises the possibility that all CGIs function as promoters and are therefore TSS-associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b040">40</xref>]. In this connection, it is of interest that genome-wide analysis by tiling arrays detected over 10,000 unanticipated human transcripts, many of which may represent noncoding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b041">41</xref>]. It is conceivable that many inter- and intragenic CGIs mark promoters that drive the synthesis of these novel transcripts. The noncoding transcripts <italic>XIST</italic> and <italic>AIR</italic>, for example, whose RNA products play regulatory roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b044">44</xref>], both initiate within CGI promoters. The proximity of many methylated CGIs to developmentally important genes raises the possibility that putative CGI transcripts play regulatory roles during development. Recent analyses of the human <italic>HOX</italic> gene cluster highlight the functional importance of noncoding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b045">45</xref>]. Large numbers of potential CGI promoters within <italic>HOX</italic> gene loci may therefore contribute to the regulation of these complex loci.</p>

        <title>CGI Methylation in Normal Tissues</title>
        <p>CGI methylation has been extensively studied in cancers and their derivative cell lines, but relatively less attention has been paid to the phenomenon in normal tissues. Several studies have reported somatic CGI methylation, but in early examples the bioinformatics procedure used to identify these sequences was often equivalent to the NCBI-relaxed algorithm, which generates a large excess of questionable CGI candidates. The <italic>MASPIN</italic> gene, for example, scores as a methylated CGI promoter by the relaxed criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b028">28</xref>], but it is not detected as such either by the NCBI-strict algorithm or by CAP (unpublished data). A recent report addressing the methylation status of 16,000 human promoters identified that 3% of TSS-associated CGIs are normally methylated in somatic tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b014">14</xref>], which is somewhat below the levels observed in our study (7.8%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060022-t004">Table 4</xref>). We detect a much higher frequency of methylation at nonpromoter CGIs (average = 16%), which are obviously absent from promoter arrays. In particular, 22% of CGIs near the 3′ ends of genes are methylated. Extensive bisulfite sequence analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b013">13</xref>] surveyed 512 CGIs on Chrs 6, 20, and 21 and reported 9.2% to be methylated in somatic tissues. This is similar to the overall level of 11.6% methylation among 14,318 CGIs detected by our study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060022-t004">Table 4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our findings raise important questions about the relationship of CGI methylation to gene expression. On the X chromosome, it is clear that methylated CGIs correlate with inactivated genes whereas unmethylated CGIs correlate with genes known to escape inactivation. The generalisation that CGI methylation silences promoters is therefore supported (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b025">25</xref>]). The relevance to gene expression of the autosomal methylated CGIs identified here is complicated by the frequent presence of both methylated and nonmethylated alleles in a specific tissue (see below). This means that even if CGI methylation silences a promoter completely, large changes in gene expression are not to be expected. Also, many CGIs are not at promoters of annotated genes, but are within or between transcription units. Their function with respect to transcription, if any, may be positive or negative. Finally, any transcripts originating from these “orphan” CGIs have yet to be identified and cannot be tested. For these reasons, it is difficult to make predictions about the effect of CGI methylation on global transcription levels. We nevertheless mined published expression microarray data to determine whether tissues in which a specific set of promoter CGIs was methylated expressed the associated genes at a different level from tissues where the same CGI was unmethylated. The results showed no obvious correlation between CGI methylation and expression. This, therefore, remains an open question that demands detailed analysis of specific cases.</p>
        <p>Genes that play an important role in development were prominent among the set of methylated CGIs identified by MAP-CGI array hybridization. Out of 109 CGI-associated genes that contain homeobox-like domains, 27 (∼25%) were unmethylated in at least one tissue compared with ∼11% of all CGI-associated genes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060022-t004">Table 4</xref>). Specifically, we identified 79 CGIs in the four human <italic>HOX</italic> gene clusters A–D, of which 22 were methylated in at least one of the tissues that we tested. Given the relatively small selection of tissues analysed in the study, the actual frequency of <italic>HOX</italic> CGI methylation in all human tissues is likely to be higher than one in four. Interestingly, methylation of <italic>HOX</italic> gene CGIs is also reported in cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b046">46</xref>], raising the possibility that cancer CGI methylation patterns mimic patterns that arise during development. A potential link between normal development and cancer is suggested by the finding that CGIs methylated in cancer preferentially include promoters that are marked by association with polycomb group proteins in embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b049">49</xref>]. In contrast, we found little difference between the fractions of all CGIs (5.9% = 845/14,318) and of methylated CGIs (7.7% = 127/1,657) that were polycomb-associated in embryonic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b037">37</xref>]. The origins of CGI methylation in cancer may be distinct from the mechanisms that lead to CGI methylation in normal tissues.</p>
        <p>It was reported that the most CpG-rich CGIs among 512 analysed on Chr 6, Chr 20, and Chr 22 were never methylated, suggesting that the CpG-richness may protect from methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b013">13</xref>]. In a larger CGI set, we detected a very small, but statistically significant, difference in sequence properties between CGIs that become methylated and those that remain immune in the tested cell types. The mean CpG[o/e] was 0.75 for methylated CGIs compared with 0.77 for bulk CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060022-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Bock and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b050">50</xref>] identified sequence features that were predictive for CGI methylation, including specific repeats, sequence patterns, and DNA structure. Contrary to predictions of this method, methylated CGIs were significantly depleted in repetitive elements and showed no difference in predicted base twist. We did, however, observe small, but statistically significant, increases in simple sequence elements (TGTG/CACA) and base-stacking energy (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060022-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). The biological relevance of these minimal differences is uncertain.</p>
        <p>Weber and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b014">14</xref>] identified ∼2,000 promoters out of 16,000 that were more susceptible to methylation than CGIs themselves. These so-called “weak CpG islands” had an average CpG[o/e] ratio intermediate between CGIs and bulk genomic DNA. We have determined that 75% of weak CpG islands reported by Weber et al. are absent from the CGI library. Weak CGIs may be depleted because they are heavily methylated and therefore not enriched by CAP. Indeed, 22 methylated weak CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b014">14</xref>] were not detected in our library. Alternatively, their relatively low CpG density and somewhat elevated frequency of Mse1 sites may result in too few CpGs per fragment for efficient retention by the CXXC matrix.</p>

        <p>Those CGIs that were methylated often showed a mixture of heavily methylated and nonmethylated strands by bisulfite analysis. There are several possible explanations for composite methylation patterns. Firstly, at the highest level, it is possible that different individuals contributing to the DNA pool are polymorphic with respect to this epigenetic mark. We analysed specific CGIs in muscle DNA from three individuals and found evidence of individual variation of this kind. A large-scale survey would be required to determine the extent of inter-individual variability. A second possibility is that cells within the analysed tissue are heterogeneous with respect to CGI methylation. Each of the analysed tissues consists of multiple differentiated cell types that should be analysed separately to address this possibility. Analysis of three compositely methylated CGIs in blood showed one that was highly methylated in monocytes, but weakly methylated in granulocytes, indicating that cell type–specific CGI methylation underlay heterogeneous DNA methylation. A third possible explanation for composite methylation is monoallelic methylation. A previous study of 149 CGIs on Chr 21q detected three that were mono-allelically methylated, indicating that this explanation also accounts for some cases of composite CGI methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060022-b012">12</xref>].</p>
