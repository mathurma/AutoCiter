<abstract>
<p>In most mammals, the male to female sex ratio of offspring is about 50% because half of the sperm contain either the Y chromosome or X chromosome. In mice, the Y chromosome encodes fewer than 700 genes, whereas the X chromosome encodes over 3,000 genes. Although overall gene expression is lower in sperm than in somatic cells, transcription is activated selectively in round spermatids. By regulating the expression of specific genes, we hypothesized that the X chromosome might exert functional differences in sperm that are usually masked during fertilization. In this study, we found that Toll-like receptors 7/8 (TLR7/8) coding the X chromosome were expressed by approximately 50% of the round spermatids in testis and in approximately 50% of the epididymal sperm. Especially, TLR7 was localized to the tail, and TLR8 was localized to the midpiece. Ligand activation of TLR7/8 selectively suppressed the mobility of the X chromosome–bearing sperm (X-sperm) but not the Y-sperm without altering sperm viability or acrosome formation. The difference in sperm motility allowed for the separation of Y-sperm from X-sperm. Following in vitro fertilization using the ligand-selected high-mobility sperm, 90% of the embryos were XY male. Likewise, 83% of the pups obtained following embryo transfer were XY males. Conversely, the TLR7/8-activated, slow mobility sperm produced embryos and pups that were 81% XX females. Therefore, the functional differences between Y-sperm and X-sperm motility were revealed and related to different gene expression patterns, specifically TLR7/8 on X-sperm.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Male germ cells proliferate by mitosis, develop as primary spermatocytes, and eventually, by the process of meiosis, become mature sperm. In the first meiotic division, the primary spermatocyte divides into two secondary spermatocytes, which then cleave leading to the generation of four haploid round spermatids that contain either the X or Y chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref002">2</xref>]. The subsequent differentiation of round spermatids to sperm is called as spermiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref003">3</xref>], and during this process, the round spermatid undergoes dynamic morphological changes, including the nuclear condensation, acrosome formation, and the elongation of the sperm flagella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref004">4</xref>]. As indicated by studies using knockout mouse models, the morphological changes associated with spermiogenesis are associated with the expression of various genes, including <italic>Tekt</italic>, <italic>Tnp</italic>, and <italic>Gba2</italic> in the round spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref007">7</xref>]. Thus, active gene transcription occurs on chromosomes, including sex chromosomes, in haploid male germ cells, and some of them are essential for cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref008">8</xref>]. Using the cytoplasmic bridges between spermatids, cytoplasm including RNAs and proteins are shared to rescue Y chromosome bearing sperm (Y-sperm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref009">9</xref>]. It has been reported that the bridge works in spermatid at early stage of spermiogenesis, and the high levels of RNA polymerase II are detected in this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref011">11</xref>]. However, RNA polymerase II is still detected in later stages of spermiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref011">11</xref>], indicating that the unique features of sperm can be distinguished not only by the presence of the X or Y chromosome but also by expression of distinct genes encoded by each sex chromosome.</p>
<p>However, mouse Y chromosome encodes fewer than 700 genes, whereas mouse X chromosome encodes over 3,000 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref013">13</xref>]. The X chromosome contains some unique genes, such as <italic>Taz</italic> encoding tafazzin that is a transcriptional regulator activated by physical stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref014">14</xref>], <italic>Xiap</italic> encoding X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein that suppresses the activation of apoptosis signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref015">15</xref>], and <italic>G6pdx</italic> encoding X-linked glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase that catalyzes the oxidative pentose–phosphate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref016">16</xref>]. Thus, it is assumed that the X chromosome, as well as autosomes, play an essential role in regulating the somatic and germ cell functions. However, both X chromosome bearing sperm (X-sperm) and Y-sperm are produced and are equally functional, with no apparent difference between X-sperm and Y-sperm during fertilization in vivo or in conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures.</p>
<p>Despite these functional similarities, differences in X- and Y-sperm mobility have been observed. Specifically, although Sarkar and colleagues (1984) reported that the mobility of human sperm in the stationary fluid was not different between X-sperm and Y-sperm, the movement of X-sperm, but not Y-sperm, shifted to the nearly straight path in a flow-stream protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref017">17</xref>]. Additionally, the motility of Y-sperm rapidly decreased compared with that of X-sperm in specific in vitro conditions, such as low pH, high temperature, and high oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref018">18</xref>], whereas the motility of X-sperm decreased in the high-pH incubation conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref019">19</xref>]. These observations indicated that, the motility patterns of X-sperm and Y-sperm differ under specific in vitro (and presumably in vivo) conditions and might be related to the transcription of specific genes that impact the unique motility patterns of X-sperm or Y-sperm. However, these analyses have not yet been done.</p>
<p>Our previous studies showed that sperm express specific Toll-like receptors capable of responding to specific ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, one might predict that if sperm expressed specific environmental sensors (i.e., receptors) encoded by either the X chromosome or Y chromosome and if these sensors were activated selectively by specific conditions, then functional differences in motility might be manifested between X-sperm and Y-sperm. In this study, we sought to identify specific genes encoded by each sex chromosome in sperm that might account for the potential functional differences in between X-sperm and Y-sperm. Based on evidence obtained from this approach, we developed a novel fast and simple technology for determining Y-sperm versus X-sperm that, without specific and elaborate sorting systems, could be used to selectively separate Y-sperm or X-sperm and generate male and female pups in mice.</p>

<title>TLR7/8 are encoded by genes on the X chromosome in mouse sperm</title>
<p>From RNA sequence data of mouse sperm (Accession Number: DRA007935), 492 genes were selected as expressed genes from X chromosome in mouse sperm. Eighteen of the X chromosome genes encode receptors. Six of these receptors (<italic>Tlr8</italic>, <italic>Ar</italic>, <italic>Gpr174</italic>, <italic>Tlr7</italic>, <italic>Gpr34</italic>, and <italic>Edr2a</italic>) have specific ligands; the other 12 receptors have common ligands that also bind to receptors encoded by autosomes. The presence of these receptor mRNAs was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000398.s005">S1 Fig</xref>). Additionally, the marker genes of somatic cells, <italic>Hoxa1</italic> and <italic>Hoxb1</italic>, were not detected in RNAs extracted from mouse sperm by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000398.s005">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In our previous study, we have reported that TLR2 and TLR4 are detected in human, boar, and mouse sperm, and the TLR2 and TLR4 ligands suppress survivability, motility, and capacitation status of mammalian sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref021">21</xref>]. However, the function of TLR7/8 coding in X chromosome on sperm function remained unclear. Thus, in this study, we focused on TLR7/8 as candidates to understand the potential differences of X-spermatids and Y-spermatids and to develop new sexing technology. The presence of <italic>Tlr</italic>7<italic>/8</italic> mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR using intron-spanning primer; on the other hand, the presence of <italic>Hoxa1</italic> and <italic>Hoxb1</italic> mRNAs were not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The expressions of TLR7/8 protein were analyzed by western analyses, flow cytometry (FCM), and immunofluorescence (IF). Both TLR7/8 proteins were expressed in spleen and were used as a positive control (PC). TLR7/8 were also present in epididymal sperm, testicular sperm cells, and Leydig cells but were weak in Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). By FCM, the rates of TLR7- or TLR8-positive sperm were also analyzed using anti-acetylated tubulin antibody, a marker of the sperm flagella. The distinct two peaks of TLR7 or TLR8 were observed, and the peak under 1,100 was defined as negative sperm, and the other was defined as positive sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g001">Fig 1C and 1F</xref>). Almost all of the cells were stained by anti-acetylated tubulin antibody, and few of them were negative that were contaminated blood cells. The percent of the double-stained cells (TLR7<sup>+</sup>/Tubulin<sup>+</sup> or TLR8<sup>+</sup>/Tubulin<sup>+</sup>) was nearly equivalent to the percent of the sperm stained only by anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (TLR7<sup>−</sup>/Tubulin<sup>+</sup> or TLR8<sup>−</sup>/Tubulin<sup>+</sup>) (TLR7<sup>+</sup>/Tubulin<sup>+</sup> versus TLR7<sup>−</sup>/Tubulin<sup>+</sup>: 48.8% ± 1.8% versus 49.0 ± 2.1% [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>] and TLR8<sup>+</sup>/Tubulin<sup>+</sup> versus TLR8<sup>−</sup>/Tubulin<sup>+</sup>: 32.3% ± 0.8% versus 38.9% ± 0.3% [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>]).</p>

<p>By IF, TLR7-positive signals were observed in about half of the round spermatids that were double stained with zona pellucida 3 receptor (ZP3R; formerly called Sp56), a marker of round spermatids during spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The percent of double-positive cells was 45.2% ± 3.7% of Sp56-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). TLR8-positive signals were also detected in round spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The percent of double-positive cells was 46.3% ± 1.7% of Sp56-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

<title>TLR7/8 ligands suppressed progressive motility of the sperm bearing the X chromosome</title>
<p>Because TLR7 and TLR8 encoded on the X chromosome were expressed in sperm and both have common ligands, sperm were incubated with Resiquimod (R848) that binds both TLR7 and TLR8 or Imiquimod (R837), a specific ligand of TLR7. Using a motility assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000398.s009">S5 Fig</xref>), the percent of highly active sperm that swim to an upper layer (swim-up sperm) was significantly decreased by the addition of either ligand in a dose-dependent manner from 0.3 μM to 3 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The reduced mobility was also evident when sperm were incubated with 0.3 μM for more than 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). As a result of computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA), the tracks of some sperm incubated with 0.3 μM R848 or R837 were shorter than those of sperm incubated without TLR7/8 ligand (control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The average-path velocity (VAP) of sperm was also significantly decreased by R848 or R837. Although the number of sperm in the groups with approximately 50–100 μm/sec or over 150 μm/sec VAP was not altered by the treatment with R848 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>), the number of sperm significantly increased when VAP was observed under 50 μm/sec, and significantly decreased VAP was observed from 100 μm/sec to 150 μm/sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Additionally, by the treatment of R837, the number of sperm in the groups under 50 μm/sec also significantly decreased, indicating that TLR7/8 suppressed the velocity of some but not all sperm. The percent of X-sperm in the swim-up layer (in upper 200 μl of 500 μl) was dramatically decreased, whereas the percent of Y-sperm in upper layer was dramatically increased by the treatment of either R848 or R837 over 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Importantly, treatment with R848 did not affect either sperm viability or the acrosome status of sperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000398.s010">S6 Fig</xref>), indicating that sperm after the treatment with R848 kept the fertilization ability. Additionally, the slow motility of sperm mediated by R848 was reversed by the removing of R848 in the culture media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000398.s011">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>TLR7/8 ligands suppress ATP production by glycolysis via a GSK3α/β–hexokinase pathway</title>
<p>Because sperm velocity is regulated by intracellular ATP levels, we examined the effect of TLR7/8 ligands on the production of ATP in sperm. The results showed that ATP levels in sperm were significantly decreased by incubation with both TLR7/8 ligands for 30 min or greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The change was primarily observed in slow mobility sperm present in the lower layer after swim-up test with TLR7/8 ligand, and ATP level after R848 treatment was significantly lower than that after R837 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Because the production of ATP is regulated by the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, β-oxidation, and/or cytoplasmic glycolysis, the mitochondrial activity and glycolysis activity were measured. JC-1, which is a marker of mitochondrial activity, was significantly decreased by the treatment of R848 but not R837 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). To determine the activity of hexokinase, a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, we measured the levels of 2-deoxy-6-phosphate-glucose and observed that the levels were significantly suppressed by both TLR7/8 ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), indicating that the suppression of mitochondrial activity was a specific phenotype of the activation of TLR8, and the suppression of glycolysis activity was a common phenotype in both TLR7 and TLR8. As a consequence, phosphorylation of NFκB, a downstream target of TLRs signaling and the phosphorylation of GSK3α/β, an inhibitor of glycolysis was increased by the ligand R848 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). These changes were observed in slow-mobility sperm present in the lower layer after the swim-up test with R848 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g004">Fig 4G, 4H and 4I</xref>). Therefore, the activation of TLR8 localized in the midpiece of sperm suppressed mitochondrial activity, and the activation of TLR7 localized in the tail of sperm suppressed cytoplasmic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Changes in the expression of specific genes have been documented and shown to occur at distinct stages of spermatogenesis. Comprehensive analyses, such as microarray and RNA sequence analyses, of specific sperm cell types from spermatogonia to round spermatids catalogued the molecular profiles associated with spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref023">23</xref>], documented the decline in transcriptional activity from round spermatids to sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref011">11</xref>], and determined that noncoding small RNAs, such as micro RNA and piwi-interacting RNA, in sperm were associated preferentially (exclusively) with the early embryogenesis following fertilization but not before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref024">24</xref>]. However, the transcriptome profiles specific to the X and Y chromosomes that might confer inherent and different characteristics of X-sperm and Y-sperm, and perhaps explain sex bias, have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we focused on the qualitative, not quantitative, detection of RNAs encoded by sex chromosomes in sperm. Our RNA sequencing data identified 492 genes that were encoded by the X chromosome and only 15 genes by Y chromosome of mouse sperm. Among these genes are members of different classes of receptors that have the potential to mediate sperm responses to factors in their external environment, such as chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref026">26</xref>], creatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref027">27</xref>], progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref028">28</xref>], and pathogens. Thus, functional differences of X-sperm and Y-sperm can be identified and provide a novel approach for specifically selecting X-sperm or Y-sperm.</p>
<p>Members of the TLR family recognize specific pathogens, are expressed in mammalian sperm, and impair fertilization by altering sperm capacitation and hyperactivated motility when semen or uteri are infected with bacteria and/or viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref021">21</xref>]. Therefore, we focused on the receptor-coding genes encoded by the X chromosome that act as sensors that might confer functional differences between X-sperm and Y-sperm and provide a novel approach for specifically selecting X- or Y-sperm. Six receptor genes (<italic>Ar</italic>, <italic>Tlr8</italic>, <italic>Gpr174</italic>, <italic>Tlr7</italic>, <italic>Gpr34</italic>, and <italic>Eda2r</italic>) of the 492 X chromosome–encoded genes bind specific ligands but do not bind to ligands that activate receptors encoded by autosomes.</p>
<p>The functions of the six candidate genes have been reported; mice with a sperm cell–specific <italic>Ar</italic> knockout or mice with genomic disruption of ectodysplasin A-A2 (EDA-A2), a ligand of <italic>Eda2r</italic>, are fertile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref030">30</xref>]. In an in vitro culture study, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a ligand of <italic>Gpr34</italic> and <italic>Gpr174</italic>, induces the acrosome reaction of bull sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref031">31</xref>]. TLR7/8 are expressed in mouse sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref032">32</xref>], and the activation of TLR7/8 suppresses the motility of mouse and human sperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref033">33</xref>]. Although these studies indicated the possibility that receptors encoded by the X chromosome receptors might mediate functional differences between X-sperm and Y-sperm, functional differences in X-sperm and Y-sperm that might be related to X chromosome–specific transcription have not previously been determined. Our results, therefore, show for the first time that TLR7/8 are expressed in half of the round spermatids and sperm and that treatment of sperm with TLR7/8–specific ligands dramatically reduced the velocity of X-sperm without affecting that of Y-sperm. These novel observations indicated that TLR7/8 encoded by the X chromosome mediated functional differences between X-sperm and Y-sperm in response to specific activation TLR7/8.</p>
<p>However, it is thought that the cytoplasm in round spermatids is shared between X chromosome–bearing spermatids (X-spermatids) and Y chromosome–bearing spermatids (Y-spermatids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref009">9</xref>]. Additionally, the sharing of cytoplasm between X-spermatids and Y-spermatids is required for the survival of Y-spermatids because several survival factors are encoded in only the X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref010">10</xref>]. These RNAs/proteins are transferred through the cytosolic bridges between round spermatids. On the other hand, in this study, TLR7/8 were localized in only X-spermatids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000398.s006">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000398.s007">S3</xref> Figs), and all of TLR7/8 positive cells were stained by anti-sp56 antibody, a marker of acrosome, suggesting that these receptors were expressed in spermatids at the latter stage of spermiogenesis. Although we did not observe the proteins forming the cytosolic bridges between round spermatids, such as TEX14, it is one possibility that X chromosome–encoding proteins including TLR7/8 that are expressed at the latter stage of spermiogenesis would not be shared between X-spermatids and Y-spermatids.</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which TLR7/8 activation mediates changes in sperm activity appear to be directly regulated by the production of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref034">34</xref>]. Specifically, ligand activated TLR7/8 caused comparatively shorter tracks of sperm movement than those of control sperm in which TLR7/8 were not activated, and this was associated with decreased ATP content in the sperm and the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β(GSK3α/β) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) as known the downstream pathways of TLR7/8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref035">35</xref>]. Although there is no report about the relationship between TLR7/8 and the production of ATP in sperm, the phosphorylation of GSK3α/β decreases the hexokinase enzyme activity and decreases the ATP level in dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref037">37</xref>]. Hexokinase is an limited enzyme of the glycolysis that converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref038">38</xref>]. The enzyme that is expressed and localized in the sperm tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref039">39</xref>] is potentially suppressed by TLR7/8 activation in the dendritic cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref036">36</xref>]. On the other hand, it has been also reported that treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor induces acrosome reaction, and the phosphorylation of GSK3 activates the enzyme activity of phosphoprotein phosphatase family that impacts on sperm motility. Therefore, we provide the first evidence that activation of TLR7/8 leads to reduce the levels ATP production via the suppression of hexokinase activity; however, further studies are required for the mechanisms how TLR7/8 regulate hexokinase activity in sperm.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the treatment with R848 that activates both TLR7 and TLR8 suppressed not only hexokinase activity but also mitochondrial activity in sperm. R837 that is selective activator of TLR7 only decreased glycolytic pathway. TLR7 was detected in sperm tail but TLR8 expressed in the midpiece of sperm, which localized in mitochondria, indicating that the activation of TLR8 directly suppressed mitochondrial activity, and TLR7 inhibited hexokinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000398.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In our previous study, ATP production in mitochondria regulated the progressive motility in sperm, and the system was independent on glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref040">40</xref>]. Because sperm motility and ATP level were much decreased by the treatment with R848 as compared with those by R837, it is estimated that both TLR7 and TLR8 would regulate ATP generation, which impacts on sperm motility.</p>
<p>The physiological relevance of activating TLR7/8 receptors in sperm has not been thoroughly explored. However, TLR7/8 can be activated by single-strand RNA released from RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref041">41</xref>], such as Hepatitis C, HIV, and Zika, that are reported to infect the female reproductive tracts, especially the uterus and oviduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref044">44</xref>]. RNA-mediated activation of TLR7/8 in reproductive tracts might increase the ratio of XY embryos versus XX embryos. However, the relationship between RNA viral infections and the sex ratio of newborns has not been established. Interestingly, Drew and colleagues (1978) reported that the number of male newborns from couples infected with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) was higher than those born from the normal couples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref045">45</xref>]. Although HBV is a DNA virus and does not directly bind to TLR7/8, the synthesized ligand of TLR7 increases the response against HBV in T-cell and natural killer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref046">46</xref>]. Immunization with HBV and TLR7/8 agonists induce antigen-specific immune responses in HBV-transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref047">47</xref>]. Although the molecular mechanisms by which HBV and TLR7/8 interact have remained unclear, the relationship between TLR7/8 and HBV might be one of the reasons for the male sex ratio bias in newborns of the couples infected with HBV. Therefore, an epidemiological study of the relationship between the sex ratio bias and RNA viral infection would determine if there is such an in vivo function of TLR7/8 in sperm.</p>
<p>Based on these observations, we utilized ligand activation of TLR7/8 to provide a convenient, effective, fast, and simple method for the selectively separating Y-sperm from X-sperm by the reducing the velocity of X-sperm. Specifically, the incubation of sperm for 1 hr with TLR7/8 ligands efficiently separated X-sperm from Y-sperm without decreasing fertilization, at least in vitro. Gledhill and colleagues (1983) focused on the length of the sex chromosome and developed the separation method of X-sperm and Y-sperm by cell sorting of sperm stained with Hoechst 33342 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref048">48</xref>]. However, this method based on flow cytometry and cell sorting has several limitations. The ultraviolet rays used to detect fluorescence in sperm by flow cytometry decreases sperm fertilization capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref049">49</xref>]. Furthermore, flow cytometry with a cell-sorting system is too expensive to introduce locally at each farm. Because the expression of the <italic>Tlr7/</italic>8 gene is highly conserved on the mammalian X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000398.ref050">50</xref>], our novel protocol using TLR7/8 ligand activation has high promise of being adapted to mammalian reproductive technologies for separating the X-sperm and Y-sperm within a short time and without costly, injurious and time-consuming cell-sorting systems.</p>
<p>In conclusion, TLR7/8 encoded by the X chromosome is expressed in, and localized to, the mid piece and the tail of X-sperm but not the Y-sperm. The addition of TLR7/8 ligands dramatically suppressed the hyperactivated motility of X-sperm without the decreasing of sperm fertilization ability. Thereby, incubating sperm with TLR7/8 ligands permits easy separation of X-sperm and Y-sperm with XY selection attained at more than 90 percent in IVF. Thus, TLR7/8 is specific receptors that differentially impacts the functions of X-sperm but not Y-sperm.</p>

Briefly, the sperm samples were homogenized in 100 μL of cold PBS and then centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 5 min. Each supernatant was transferred to a separate well. Assay buffer and substrate were added at room temperature. After mixing by tapping the plate, the luminescence was read on a luminometer (2030 Multilabel Reader ARVO X4, PerkinElmer Inc, Waltham, MA, USA) within 1 min after adding.</p>
