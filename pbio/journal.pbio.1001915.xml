<abstract>
<p>Conflict between the sexes over reproductive interests can drive rapid evolution of reproductive traits and promote speciation. Here we show that inter-species mating between <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes sterilizes maternal individuals. The principal effectors of male-induced harm are sperm cells, which induce sterility and shorten lifespan by displacing conspecific sperm, invading the ovary, and sometimes breaching the gonad to infiltrate other tissues. This sperm-mediated harm is pervasive across species, but idiosyncrasies in its magnitude implicate both independent histories of sexually antagonistic coevolution within species and differences in reproductive mode (self-fertilizing hermaphrodites versus females) in determining its severity. Consistent with this conclusion, in androdioecious species the hermaphrodites are more vulnerable, the males more benign, or both. Patterns of assortative mating and a low incidence of invasive sperm occurring with conspecific mating are indicative of ongoing intra-specific sexual conflict that results in inter-species reproductive incompatibility.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The sexes have divergent reproductive interests, and conflict arising from this disparity can drive the rapid evolution of reproductive traits and promote speciation. Here we describe a unique reproductive barrier in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes that is induced by sperm. We found that mating between species can sterilize maternal worms and even cause premature death, and we were able to attribute this phenomenon directly to the sperm themselves. Sperm from other species can displace sperm from the same species and, in some cases, can invade inappropriate parts of the maternal reproductive system and even their non-reproductive tissues. We find that mating to males of another species harms females far more than does within-species mating. Overall, our observations are consistent with ongoing sexual conflict between the sexes within species, arising as a byproduct of sperm competition among the gametes of different males. Finally, patterns of assortative mating indicate that mating behaviours that reduce the likelihood of costly inter-species mating have evolved in this group of animals. These findings support an important role of sexual selection and gametic interactions contributing to reproductive boundaries between species, as predicted by evolutionary theory.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rarely do reproductive interests of males and females perfectly align. Sexual selection can accelerate the evolution of the traits and molecules mediating reproductive encounters, and this can lead to sexual conflict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Swanson1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Chapman1">[2]</xref>. Components of the reproductive system that mediate male-female interactions, such as reproductive tract morphology, sperm and egg traits, and molecular components of seminal fluid all diverge rapidly between many species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Arnqvist1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Arnqvist2">[4]</xref>. The particularly forceful process of sexual antagonism drives co-evolutionary arms races between sex-limited traits that exact or counteract harmful, but self-serving, effects on the other sex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Chapman1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Arnqvist2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Rice1">[5]</xref>. Ongoing sexually antagonistic coevolution that operates within a species might generate mismatched interactions between gametes or other reproductive tract components when mating occurs between species. When such mismatches interfere with normal conspecific reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Knowles1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Matute1">[7]</xref>, they have the potential to instigate or magnify reproductive isolation between species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Parker1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Rice2">[9]</xref>. Selection for traits that prevent the deleterious consequences of inter-species mating for the parents or hybrid offspring may result in further trait evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Servedio1">[10]</xref>. Though pre-mating reinforcement behaviours have received much attention and debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Servedio1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Butlin1">[12]</xref>, post-mating mechanisms of gametic isolation, such as conspecific sperm precedence, also can play key roles in pre-zygotic reproductive isolation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Howard1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Palumbi1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>The prevailing view of gametic isolation between species is that fertilization precedence of conspecific sperm can provide a potent reproductive barrier, mediated by cryptic female choice, sperm competition, or incompatibilities between female reproductive tracts and heterospecific ejaculates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Price1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Gregory1">[18]</xref>. Conspecific sperm precedence occurs both in species with internal and external fertilization, governed by a broad variety of proximate mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Palumbi1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Howard2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Lorch1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <italic>Drosophila</italic> provide examples of inter-species mating harm, for example, owing to an overly engorged “insemination reaction mass” that exacts a fitness cost on females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Knowles1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Matute1">[7]</xref>, and female <italic>Carabus</italic> beetles suffer ruptured reproductive tracts from physical damage upon inter-species matings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Sota1">[21]</xref>. Within species, male seminal proteins can manipulate female physiology in a manner sub-optimal for females but beneficial to males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Avila1">[22]</xref>. While coevolution between the sexes may obscure the traces of such sexual antagonism (as for other forms of genetic conflict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Werren1">[23]</xref>), interactions between divergent populations and species can unmask the underlying conflicts by revealing mismatched male and female traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Parker1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes provide a powerful system to examine both sexual antagonism and its modulation by reproductive mode. Males, females, and hermaphrodites will mate readily and promiscuously in lab culture, and mechanical harm incurred from multiple mating reduces longevity and survival in <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Gems1">[24]</xref> and <italic>C. remanei</italic> females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Diaz1">[25]</xref>. Male-derived chemical cues also are thought to accelerate female and hermaphrodite aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Maures1">[26]</xref>. Following copulation, <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites can expel male ejaculates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Kleemann1">[27]</xref>, and males deposit copulatory plugs that inhibit re-mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Palopoli1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Barker1">[29]</xref> and induce larger brood sizes in their partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Timmermeyer1">[30]</xref>. In response to experimentally elevated sperm competition, <italic>C. elegans</italic> evolve larger sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-LaMunyon1">[31]</xref>. Though anatomical evolution in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> is conservative, these intra-specific dynamics suggest there may be substantial inter-species divergence in cryptic reproductive traits.</p>
<p>Evolutionary transitions in reproductive mode from highly outbreeding to highly self-fertilizing are expected to reduce intra- and inter-sexual conflict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Greeff1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Brandvain1">[33]</xref>. Three species of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> have independently evolved androdioecy (hermaphrodites and males) from dioecy (females and males), such that hermaphrodites are capable of self-fertilization in addition to being fertilized by males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Kiontke1">[34]</xref>. These androdioecious species manifest a “selfing syndrome” analogous to plants that includes reduced sperm size and low mating vigor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Cutter1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Thomas1">[36]</xref>. Hermaphrodites from such species with relaxed sexual selection might be particularly susceptible to adverse effects of mating to vigorous males from closely related species that have a recent history of strong sexual selection (the “weak inbreeder, strong outbreeder” or WISO hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Brandvain1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-MartnCoello1">[37]</xref>). Despite the generally limited understanding of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> ecology and inter-species interactions in their rotting fruit and vegetal habitats, some species are sympatric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Kiontke1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Felix1">[38]</xref>, putting them at risk for inter-species encounters. Species readily mate with one another in the laboratory, and the animals' transparent bodies provide literal windows into postmating-prezygotic, and postzygotic, reproductive interactions and barriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Baird1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Hill1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we describe an unprecedented postmating-prezygotic reproductive barrier in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes, induced directly by sperm cells, that imposes potent fitness costs to females and hermaphrodites. Theory predicts species with selfing hermaphrodites to be more susceptible to inter-species harm and less capable of inducing harm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Brandvain1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-MartnCoello1">[37]</xref>. Theory also predicts that rapid divergence in sexually selected traits will produce heterogeneity in harmful effects between species pairs and consequently may fail to yield phylogenetic signal in the magnitudes of effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Chapman1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Arnqvist2">[4]</xref>. In this counterpoint to mechanisms of conspecific sperm precedence, we affirm a potent role for sexual conflict as a pre-zygotic isolating barrier between species.</p>

<title>Mating to Males of a Different Species Is Harmful</title>
<p>In no-choice mating arenas, <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> copulate repeatedly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s001">Figure S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s010">Text S1</xref>), and will readily mate with different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Hill1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Garcia1">[43]</xref>. We first examined the impact of mating the self-fertile hermaphrodites of <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Felix2">[44]</xref> with males of other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1A–1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s010">Text S1</xref>). Despite the presence of abundant self-sperm, offspring production was invariably compromised. By contrast, mating to conspecific males leads to increased reproductive output, because hermaphrodite sperm stores are supplemented by the male sperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Ward1">[45]</xref>. The extremity of reduced reproductive output upon inter-species mating, however, depends in part on the identity of maternal and paternal partners. For example, <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites produced &lt;5% and &lt;30% of their normal brood, respectively, when mated with any of seven dioecious species of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> hermaphrodites, however, showed similarly striking sensitivity to males of <italic>C. brenneri</italic>, but were resistant or less sensitive to males of other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Impacts of inter-species matings on hermaphrodites.</title>
<p>Hermaphrodites of each selfing species were mated to males of dioecious (A–C) or another androdioecious (D, E) species and reproductive output was quantified as the number of self-progeny produced two days post mating treatment. (A) <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and (B) <italic>C. elegans</italic> produced significantly fewer progeny after heterospecific matings to males of all species tested (white) compared to selfing or “no mating” (blue). (C) <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> also produced fewer progeny after heterospecific matings, but only to a subset of the species tested. (D) A single heterospecific mating event was sufficient to induce progeny loss for <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites crossed to <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males (Mann-Whitney U = 37.0, <italic>p</italic>≤0.001). (E, F) Males from hermaphroditic species also reduced hermaphrodite self-progeny production following heterospecific mating (<italic>C. briggsae</italic> U = 65.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; <italic>C. elegans</italic> U = 178.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008). However, males from hermaphroditic species were less effective at reducing progeny compared to dioecious males (<italic>C. briggsae</italic> U = 122.0, <italic>p</italic>≤0.001; <italic>C. elegans</italic> U = 631.0, <italic>p</italic>≤0.001). (G) <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites mated to <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males (solid blue line) suffer higher mortality than when mated to <italic>C. briggsae</italic> males (dashed black line; Kaplan-Meier log-rank test: χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.218, df = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.022). Asterisks in (A–F) indicate significant difference from selfing control (Mann-Whitney U test <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; Bonferroni correction applied in (A–C); (A, C) corrected α = 0.007; (B) corrected α = 0.008; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s007">Table S1</xref>). In (A–F), boxplot whiskers indicate 1.5× (interquartile range) and dotted horizontal lines indicate median of viable progeny produced by the selfing control for reference.

<p>In crosses between <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites and <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males, a single heterospecific mating event is sufficient to strongly depress reproductive output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), and prolonged exposure accelerates hermaphrodite mortality beyond that seen in conspecific or reciprocal crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Increasing the abundance of conspecific sperm in hermaphrodites by mating them with conspecific males immediately before or after the heterospecific matings was insufficient to prevent or rescue sterilization of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites by <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Males from androdioecious species of both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> were markedly less able to reduce the reproductive output of heterospecific hermaphrodites compared to the effect of dioecious males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>). However, there is no clear association between degree of sterilization and phylogenetic distance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), although notably <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> is most sensitive to males of its closest tested relative, <italic>C. brenneri</italic>.</p>
<p>The above observations demonstrate that (i) hermaphrodites of all three self-fertile species are susceptible to adverse effects of mating with males of at least some other species and (ii) males of all species are capable of adversely affecting the reproductive output of hermaphrodites of at least some species. Such disparities among species in gametic isolation are predicted to be a common outcome of sexual selection on sperm competition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-MartnCoello1">[37]</xref>. Consistent with intense intra-species sperm competition, multiple mating is readily observed in laboratory populations of outbreeding species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s001">Figure S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s010">Text S1</xref>), while the rarity of males in self-fertile populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Barrire1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Flix1">[47]</xref> suggests that multiple mating in these lineages is rare. Additionally, males from highly selfing species are less harmful to heterospecific mates, consistent with weak inbreeder, strong outbreeder (WISO) dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Brandvain1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-MartnCoello1">[37]</xref>.</p>

<title>Impacts of inter-species matings on females.</title>
<p>Females from dioecious species (A: <italic>C. nigoni</italic>, B: <italic>C. remanei</italic>) were initially mated overnight to conspecific males, followed by overnight mating of treatment females (white) to heterospecific males from either dioecious (<italic>C. nigoni, C. remanei, C. brenneri</italic>) or androdioecious (<italic>C. briggsae</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>) species; control females (red) did not receive a second mating. Reproductive output was then quantified as the number of progeny produced two days post mating treatment. (A, B) Females often became sterilized upon a subsequent mating with heterospecific males from dioecious species compared to controls: (A) <italic>C. nigoni</italic> females (<italic>C. remanei</italic> males U = 385.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; <italic>C. brenneri</italic> males U = 206.5, <italic>p</italic>≤0.001), (B) <italic>C. remanei</italic> females (<italic>C. nigoni</italic> males U = 239.5, <italic>p</italic>≤0.001; <italic>C. brenneri</italic> males U = 259.5, <italic>p</italic>≤0.001). However, females were resistant to harm induced by males of androdioecious species: (A) <italic>C. nigoni</italic> (<italic>C. briggsae</italic> males U = 409.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.020; <italic>C. elegans</italic> males U = 577.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.291), (B) <italic>C. remanei</italic> (<italic>C. briggsae</italic> males U = 887.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.886; <italic>C. elegans</italic> males U = 863.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.731). (C) <italic>C. nigoni</italic> females mated to heterospecific <italic>C. briggsae</italic> males (solid red line) did not incur a statistically significant survival cost relative to conspecific mating (dashed black line; Kaplan-Meier log-rank test: χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.203, df = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.652; <italic>ns</italic> not significant).

<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, different levels of sexual antagonism can lead to reduced female survivorship in inter-strain matings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Rice3">[50]</xref>. To explore whether heterospecific <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> matings exert negative effects beyond reproductive output, we quantified maternal survival in the four cross combinations involving <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and its outbreeding sister species, <italic>C. nigoni</italic>. Mating with <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males significantly reduced the lifespan of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites relative to conspecific mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), but did not adversely affect conspecific <italic>C. nigoni</italic> female survival in our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with additional harmful effects of heterospecific mating beyond sterilization. Matings between another closely related selfer-outbreeder pair produced a different pattern, in which males from the selfing <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> exerted a much weaker effect on <italic>C. wallacei</italic> female longevity than did the other three cross combinations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Matings between dioecious species yielded heterogeneous impacts on maternal survival. <italic>C. nigoni</italic> and <italic>C.</italic> sp. 5 males produced no significant reduction in female survival beyond that seen for conspecific matings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), whereas <italic>C. nigoni</italic> asymmetrically harmed <italic>C. remanei</italic> survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). Similar to sterilization, then, inter-species mating affects maternal survival with species-pair dependencies in both outbreeding and selfing species. This observation is consistent with distinct evolutionary resolutions of sexual conflicts in different lineages. Additionally, we see a compelling effect of reproductive mode: in selfing species, hermaphrodites are more vulnerable, the males more benign, or both (as for <italic>C. briggsae</italic>).</p>
<p>One possible mechanism of reduced female fitness is competitive displacement of conspecific sperm by heterospecific sperm. Hermaphrodite <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> make relatively small sperm that compete poorly with even conspecific male sperm, and their conspecific males make sperm that are smaller than those of dioecious species' males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-LaMunyon1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Baldi1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-LaMunyon2">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Murray1">[51]</xref>. Thus, the sterilization of hermaphrodites could result from the displacement of self-sperm by larger, yet ineffectual, heterospecific sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Hill1">[41]</xref>. To address this issue, we labeled <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males with vital dyes, mated them to phenotypically female <italic>C. elegans fog-2</italic> animals, and observed the transferred sperm from each male in live animals. Indeed, within a few hours of mating, we observed strong displacement of the smaller <italic>C. elegans</italic> male sperm from the spermathecae by the larger <italic>C. nigoni</italic> sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">S6C</xref>). However, sperm displacement does not explain the adverse effects of heterospecific mating on survivorship nor does it account for the seeming irreversibility of sterility induced by males upon their mating partners.</p>

<title>Invasive Sperm Are the Primary Cause of Male Harm</title>
<p><italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites mated to <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males display striking germ line abnormalities, including disorganized proximal germ cells and ectopic, distally localized diakinesis-stage oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, embryos often formed distal to the oviduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), and, more rarely, we observed egg-laying defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g003">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s005">S5</xref>).

Consistent with this, DNA staining of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites revealed extensive endomitotic oocyte accumulation after one day of mating with <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males (54%, <italic>n</italic> = 78; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), which increased further after a second day (91%, <italic>n</italic> = 70). No endomitotic oocytes were observed among <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites mated to conspecific males (<italic>n</italic> = 51; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males promote oocyte maturation defects in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites.</p>
<p>Males transfer both sperm and seminal fluid components to mates, and in principle, either might negatively affect their partner's reproduction and lifespan after heterospecific matings. To distinguish these possible mechanisms, we again applied a fluorescent vital dye to males, mated them to conspecific or heterospecific individuals, and observed transferred sperm in live animals. After six hours of mating to <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites, conspecific male sperm had localized to the spermathecae and uterus in all animals (<italic>n</italic> = 52), as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s008">Movie S1</xref>). In a striking contrast, we found that 90% of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites mated heterospecifically to <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males had sperm present in ectopic locations in the distal and proximal gonad, whereas only 10% of animals had sperm properly localized exclusively to the spermathecae or uterus (<italic>n</italic> = 188; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g004">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">S6A</xref>; Movies S1 and S2). This appears to begin when many sperm penetrate the distal spermathecal valve, which normally separates maturing oocytes from sperm. Further, 7% of the hermaphrodites showed invasion of sperm into the body cavity (<italic>n</italic> = 159; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g004">Figure 4F</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s008">Movie S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Sperm of <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males also commonly invaded the gonad past the spermatheca when mated to other species (<italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. remanei</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s005">Figures S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">S6A–S6C</xref>), but the effect was most extreme in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites, consistent with its pronounced deficits in reproductive output. Just three hours after mating, more than 50% (<italic>n</italic> = 72) of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites had <italic>C. nigoni</italic> sperm in the distal gonad (cf. 90% six hours post mating; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">Figure S6A and S6D</xref>), whereas ∼20% (<italic>n</italic> = 39) of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and 2.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 35) of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> hermaphrodites were similarly afflicted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). Ectopic sperm also were very rarely observed in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> hermaphrodites mated heterospecifically to <italic>C. brenneri</italic> and <italic>C. remanei</italic> (0.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 111 and 0%, <italic>n</italic> = 18, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">Figure S6B</xref>), consistent with the infrequency of sterilization observed for this species. The ability of <italic>C. nigoni</italic> sperm to overrun the spermatheca is greater than that of other species tested. <italic>C. remanei</italic> sperm were rarely found in ectopic locations in <italic>C. nigoni</italic> females (5%, <italic>n</italic> = 100; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">Figure S6A</xref>), and ectopic sperm originating from <italic>C. briggsae</italic> males were never observed (<italic>n</italic> = 70; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g004">Figure 4A and 4E</xref>). Notably, the distinctly stronger sterilization of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> by males of <italic>C. brenneri</italic> than <italic>C. nigoni</italic> occurs in the face of similar sperm localization patterns three hours post-mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">S6C</xref>), further supporting the idea that factors other than sperm displacement are important in heterospecific sterilization. Intriguingly, in conspecific matings with <italic>C. nigoni</italic> and <italic>C. remanei</italic>, 5%–8% of females had small numbers of sperm in ectopic gonad locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g004">Figures 4C, 4D</xref>, and S6A). This low but detectable incidence of mislocalized sperm in conspecific matings is indicative of ongoing sperm-driven sexual conflict within dioecious species.</p>
<p>Negative effects of seminal components contributed by somatic glands can potentially trigger harmful reactions in females and hermaphrodites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Chapman2">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Markow1">[56]</xref>. We therefore tested for a direct role of sperm in causing harm to <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites by feminizing the germ line of <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males via <italic>fog-3(RNAi)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Chen1">[57]</xref>. Treated males have a normal somatic testis, mate normally, and can deposit seminal components including the copulatory plug, but transfer no sperm. The reproductive output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) and survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites mated to spermless <italic>C. nigoni fog-3(RNAi)</italic> males is strikingly higher than that of animals mated to wild-type <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males. These observations implicate sperm infiltration into the gonad arms (and potentially into the body cavity) as the principal cause of male-induced permanent harm in heterospecific matings.</p>

<title>Assortative Mating of Species</title>

We created assay populations with an equal mixture of females from each of two species and males from one of them (reciprocally), and then quantified the incidence of avoidance behaviour and of mating success of each species, as evidenced by copulatory plugs placed onto the vulva. This assay design presumes that dioecious males mate indiscriminately <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Garcia1">[43]</xref> and thus that female and hermaphrodite behaviour will dominate mating outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s010">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Owing to their aggressive sperm, we first focused on copulatory responses to <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males.

The insensitivity of <italic>C. nigoni</italic> female reproductive output to having mated with androdioecious males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) could partially contribute to a lack of mate avoidance towards this class of heterospecific males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>), although female sex pheromones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Chasnov1">[58]</xref> and hermaphrodite mating avoidance behaviours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Garcia1">[43]</xref> also could contribute to this outcome. In addition to the mating outcomes, <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites were distinct in that they crawled away from the mating area when in the presence of <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males (t = −2.449, degree of freedom [df] = 44.672, <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we show that sperm transferred from matings between species of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes induce severe damage to females, compromising their reproduction and longevity. This phenomenon is the antithesis of the conspecific sperm precedence observed in diverse organisms, but still yields a form of gametic isolation owing to sperm displacement and ectopic sperm migration by heterospecific sperm. <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> females commonly mate with multiple males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s001">Figure S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s010">Text S1</xref>), and sperm competition selects for more aggressive sperm within species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-LaMunyon1">[31]</xref>. Attracted to oocyte-secreted chemical cues, sperm must repeatedly crawl to the spermatheca (the site of fertilization) as embryos push them into the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g007">Figure 7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Ward1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Han1">[59]</xref>. We propose that intra-specific sperm competition between males within the reproductive tracts of multiply mated females acts to select for aggressive sperm in an evolutionary intra-species arms race. Sperm migration into distal portions of the gonad would represent a byproduct of sperm competition with harmful consequences for females, that in turn leads to counter-selection for female resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Arnqvist2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Gavrilets1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Parker2">[61]</xref>. While co-evolution within a species largely keeps these interactions matched, male and female changes can fail to complement one another in an inter-species context. Although such divergence need not have precipitated the initial isolating events, they nevertheless contribute to extant reproductive isolation among species. It remains to be tested whether heterospecific sterilization by sperm could also be co-opted as a weapon in inter-species resource competition when multiple <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species inhabit the same resource patch.</p>

<p>This model of sperm competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g007">Figure 7D</xref>) and sexual conflict predicts sexual antagonism as an ongoing selective pressure within species of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>. We find evidence supporting this idea in the low incidence of ectopic sperm migration observed in conspecific matings for <italic>C. remanei</italic> and <italic>C. nigoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). This model also could explain fertility patterns reported for crosses between parthenogenic and amphimictic <italic>Aphelenchus</italic> nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Fisher1">[62]</xref>, suggesting applicability of this mode of gametic isolation across diverse taxa. Interactions between species with overlapping geographic ranges, as occurs for some <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> including <italic>C. briggsae</italic> with <italic>C. nigoni</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Kiontke1">[34]</xref> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> with several species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Felix1">[38]</xref>, could select for behavioural or gametic strengthening of species boundaries or yield reproductive character displacement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Servedio1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Matute2">[63]</xref>, consistent with some patterns of assortative mating and sperm migration observed in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g006">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">S6A, and S6B</xref>). However, further tests comparing sympatric and allopatric genotypes are needed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Servedio1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Palumbi1">[14]</xref>. This model further predicts the evolution of distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating male sperm vigor and female resistance in different species, and relaxation of selection in some highly self-fertilizing hermaphrodite species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Brandvain1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-MartnCoello1">[37]</xref>. Consistent with what we observe empirically, differences among species in the mechanisms of evolutionary response to intra-species sexual conflict will create phylogenetic heterogeneity in how strongly the inter-species mismatches manifest as harm to females and hermaphrodites.</p>
<p>We addressed several other potential mechanisms that could contribute to the compromised maternal fecundity and longevity upon inter-species mating. (i) Trauma through copulation may occur in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Gems1">[24]</xref>, and repeated matings in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> can induce female sterility and mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Chapman2">[54]</xref>. We can rule out this possibility because germline-feminized males with normal copulatory behaviours do not affect maternal reproductive output or longevity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). We also exclude repeated matings as an explanation for reduced reproduction because a single inter-species mating event also severely diminishes hermaphrodite reproductive output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). (ii) We can rule out insufficient sperm or oocytes as the cause of sterilization, as hermaphrodites cease laying embryos despite the abundance of oocytes and sperm in the reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Woodruff1">[40]</xref>. (iii) The reduction in progeny production after heterospecific mating could result from superior fertilization capability of heterospecific sperm, leading to mortality of hybrid embryos, as post-zygotic reproductive isolation is nearly complete between most species studied here. However, we and others have observed insufficient numbers of dead eggs to account for the overall reduction in reproductive output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Woodruff1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Baird2">[42]</xref>. (iv) Larger sperm from males of another species also could potentially outcompete and displace the conspecific sperm from the spermatheca, yielding fewer progeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Singson1">[64]</xref>. Indeed, such displacement occurs initially following heterospecific matings to males of a species with larger sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, hermaphrodite sperm for <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> all are similarly small <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Baldi1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-LaMunyon2">[49]</xref>, and yet these species differ starkly in susceptibility to the negative effects of mating to heterospecific males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1A–1C</xref>). Likewise, the disparity in sperm size of males from different dioecious species does not correlate with the extremity of reduced progeny production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s003">Figure S3</xref>), and would not be expected to shorten lifespan. These observations reinforce the direct effects of sperm mislocalization in the maternal reproductive tract as the primary mechanism of male-induced permanent harm in inter-species matings.</p>
<p>Although our experiments demonstrate the key role of sperm cells in heterospecific harm upon mating, non-sperm components also could contribute. For example, upon maturation, <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm cells release by exocytosis the contents of their lysosome-like membranous organelles (MOs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Ward2">[65]</xref>, and it is conceivable that molecules from this sperm cell-derived component of the seminal fluid could interact with female tissues. Indeed, the nematode major sperm proteins (MSPs) act as hormone-like signaling molecules to oocytes and gonad sheath cells, delivered in sperm-derived vesicles, in addition to MSP performing cytoskeletal functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Miller1">[66]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Kosinski1">[67]</xref>. Additionally, components of the seminal fluid that derive from cells of the male somatic gonad play important roles in reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Palopoli1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Smith1">[68]</xref>. Such seminal factors might compromise female tissue in some way that makes it more susceptible to adverse effects of heterospecific sperm, perhaps by inducing dilation of the gonadal sheath cells bordering the distal end of the spermatheca. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>gst-4</italic> and <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants show defects in dilation of the spermathecal valve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Edmonds1">[69]</xref> and many proteins affect sheath contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Han1">[59]</xref>, suggesting potential pathway targets for compounds transferred by males during mating.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, oocyte-derived chemical cues guide sperm migration to the spermathecae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Han1">[59]</xref>. The attractant comprises a complex mixture of F-series prostaglandins derived from poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) precursors, whose synthesis and modulation depends on a suite of fatty acid desaturases, glutathione S-transferases, cytochrome P450s, insulin-like signaling, and communication between the somatic gonad and germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Edmonds1">[69]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Edmonds2">[72]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants of these genes, conspecific sperm fail to localize efficiently to the spermathecae, instead occurring more readily in the uterus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Edmonds1">[69]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Hoang1">[70]</xref>. Heterospecific sperm migrate to the spermathecae efficiently in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodite reproductive tracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">Figure S6A–S6D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Hill1">[41]</xref>, indicating conservation of the sperm attractants and their detection between species. The high density of aggressive heterospecific sperm in their spermathecae then sets the stage for invasion of sperm into ectopic locations. However, sperm localization patterns for <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> suggests that its oocytes might secrete a sperm cue that is only weakly attractive, or a chemical mixture that attracts sperm efficiently only for some species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). Consequently, heterospecific sperm occur with lower density in the spermathecae, with correspondingly reduced likelihood of invasion into the distal gonad (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001915.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). This hypothesis could underlie the limited adverse effects of heterospecific mating on <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> hermaphrodites. It might even implicate the weak sperm attractants as an evolutionary response through gametic reinforcement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Lorch1">[20]</xref> if negative effects of inter-species mating in sympatry occurred in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>' past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Felix1">[38]</xref>. Finally, it is conceivable that differences among species in sperm attraction to distinct prostaglandins, or other compounds, coupled with secretion of them by more distally developing oocytes could encourage ectopic sperm migration.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which sperm migrate ectopically past the spermathecal boundary remains a key unsolved problem. Moreover, the breaching of the ovary basement membrane and migration of sperm into the body cavity through amoeboid movement, bearing a striking resemblance to features of metastasis in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Hanahan1">[73]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Podsypanina1">[75]</xref>, motivates further investigation of the molecular basis of tissue integrity and resistance to cellular invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Kelley1">[76]</xref>.</p>

<title>Quantification of Reduced Reproductive Output</title>
<p>Crosses consisted of placing one hermaphrodite at the fourth larval stage (L4, penultimate stage of development) with six heterospecific males overnight (18–24 hours) on a 35 mm diameter Petri dish with a 10 mm diameter bacteria spot (<italic>E. coli</italic> OP50). Hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1A–1F</xref>) that successfully mated (presence of a copulatory plug) were transferred daily and we measured reproductive output as the yield of viable adult progeny from two days of egg laying following the final mating event (representing &gt;90% of lifetime brood size). Control hermaphrodites were individuals allowed to produce self-progeny.</p>
<p>For matings involving females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), we first mated them to conspecific males overnight and the subsequent day we mated treatment females to heterospecific males.

<title>Survival Measurements</title>
<p>In situations when both female and hermaphrodites are used, they will be referred to as XX animals as they both have two X chromosomes. Seven L4 XX animals, depending on the species, were placed with ten heterospecific or conspecific males per plate and left overnight. The next day, XX animals were assayed for mortality by being touched on the head with an eyebrow hair glued to a toothpick. If the animal performed a backwards locomotive response to the touch, it was scored as alive. If it did not, it was scored as dead. This was performed every day for at least seven days. Every two days, XX animals and males were transferred to new plates in order to prevent the confusion of progeny with parents. Additionally, in these assays, XX animals were kept under continuous mating conditions: when males died or crawled off the plate, they were replaced with new males. XX animals that crawled off the plate were excluded from the lifespan measurements.</p>

<title>Assortative Mating</title>
<p>We focused our assortative mating assays on <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males, as their aggressive sperm results in sterility and increased mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>Assortative mating assays consisted of placing ten virgin <italic>C. nigoni</italic> males with ten virgin conspecific and/or heterospecific mating partners on a 35 mm diameter Petri dish. The three treatments involved presenting males to (i) ten conspecific, (ii) ten heterospecific (<italic>C. remanei</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, or <italic>C. briggsae</italic>), or (iii) a mixture of five conspecific and five heterospecific mating partners.

<p>We recorded successful mating by the presence of a copulatory plug deposited by a male onto an XX animal's vulva. We also recorded whether any XX animals left the 3 mm diameter (5 µl) bacterial spot mating area, which, we reasoned, was effective in avoiding copulation. We limited the mating period to 10 minutes to ensure males only mated once (male∶female ratio &gt;1 was used to more easily observe successful copulations with inefficient males of androdioecious species). This 10 minute mating period was determined by preliminary experiments with a male placed with multiple conspecific females. In order to visually distinguish the two female/hermaphrodite species from one another, strains with pharyngially expressed GFP (<italic>C. briggsae</italic> PS9391) or RFP (<italic>C. nigoni</italic> VX0092) markers were used, which we presume exerts no direct effect on mate choice.

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics v.20, unless otherwise noted. We conducted non-parametric tests for measures of reproductive output, owing to non-normal distributions and heterogeneous variances. To assess the effect of heterospecific matings on reproductive output (i.e., extent of sterilization), we compared the control (selfing for hermaphrodites and conspecific matings for females) to each treatment (heterospecific mating) using Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to test for an effect of mating on survival of females or hermaphrodites. The survival analyses were performed with the OASIS online application <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Yang1">[80]</xref> and SPSS.</p>
<p>In experiments that explored assortative mating with a mixed species treatment (five conspecific and five heterospecific mating partners; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g006">Figure 6</xref>), an index of mating bias was calculated as the difference between the number of mated <italic>C. nigoni</italic> females and the number of mated individuals of the other maternal species present in the arena, divided by the number of <italic>C. nigoni</italic> females present in the arena (five). Positive values indicate a mating bias towards <italic>C. nigoni</italic> females over the female (or hermaphrodite) species that they were paired with, negative values indicate the reciprocal, and a value of zero indicates no mating bias (a lack of preference or avoidance). Negative values were not observed in our experiments. We then tested for a significant difference from zero with two-tailed one sample <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p>

<p><bold>Inter-species mating harm is neither prevented nor substantially rescued by conspecific mating.</bold> <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites were left unmated (selfing only), treated to one mating period with one set of males (Con only: conspecific <italic>C. briggsae</italic> or Het only: heterospecific <italic>C. nigoni</italic>), or treated to two mating periods with two sets of males (Het-Het, Het-Con, Con-Het, Con-Con). A conspecific mating taking place one day after a heterospecific mating does not strongly rescue <italic>C. briggsae</italic> progeny production (Het-Het versus Het-Con: Mann-Whitney U = 126.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.043: not significant after multiple tests corrections). Additionally, a conspecific mating does not prevent sterilization from a subsequent heterospecific mating (Con-Con versus Con-Het: U = 5.5, <italic>p</italic>≤0.001). Finally, <italic>C. briggsae</italic> hermaphrodites mated with heterospecific males, regardless of order, experience the same decrease in reproductive output (Het-Con versus Con-Het: U = 208.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.599). Dotted line indicates the median of the selfing control for reference; samples sizes are in parentheses. Boxplot whiskers indicate 1.5× (interquartile range). For all mating treatments reproductive output is quantified by adult progeny produced two days following the second mating period. Multiple Mann-Whitney U tests were conducted and Bonferroni correction for multiple tests were applied (corrected α = 0.0125). Asterisk indicate statistical significance and (ns) indicate non-significance following Bonferroni correction.</p>

<p><bold>No correlation between severity of harm by heterospecific males and phylogenetic distance or disparity in sperm size.</bold> We constructed an ordinal scale of severity of harm to females (or hermaphrodites) as: 1 = no sterilization and/or ectopic sperm; 2 = weak progeny reduction and/or no ectopic sperm; 3 = moderate progeny reduction and/or some ectopic sperm detected; 4 = strong sterilization and/or ectopic sperm present; 5 = near complete sterilization and/or extensive ectopic sperm. (A) We plotted the metric of severity of harm as a function of discretized evolutionary distance of hermaphrodites to heterospecific males mates, on the basis of the phylogenetic topology among species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001915-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We observed no significant relation between phylogenetic distance and severity of harm, either for all hermaphrodite species pooled (Spearman's ρ = −0.15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.52) or considered separately (all distances have identical harm index for <italic>C. briggsae</italic>; <italic>C. elegans</italic> ρ = −0.54, <italic>p</italic> = 0.28, <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> ρ = −0.17, <italic>p</italic> = 0.74). Although this analysis is crude and is based on only a modest number of species comparisons, a more sophisticated analysis of phylogenetic contrasts is undermined by the topology of phylogenetic relationships among the species included in our study. (B) On the basis of sperm size values for the subset of species available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001915-Baldi1">[48]</xref>, we computed the difference in sperm cross-sectional area between conspecific and heterospecific males. In the case of matings to hermaphrodites, size of hermaphrodite sperm was used in calculations. Spearman rank correlation between these phylogenetically uncorrected metrics was not significant for matings to heterospecific males from dioecious species (<italic>p</italic> = 0.32). In the case of matings to androdioecious males, we detected a significant association (<italic>p</italic> = 0.012) owing to the weak sensitivity of hermaphrodites and no sensitivity of females to heterospecific androdioecious males.</p>
