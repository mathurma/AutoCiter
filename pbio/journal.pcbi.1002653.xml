        <p>A systematic assessment of global neural network connectivity through direct electrophysiological assays has remained technically infeasible, even in simpler systems like dissociated neuronal cultures. We introduce an improved algorithmic approach based on Transfer Entropy to reconstruct structural connectivity from network activity monitored through calcium imaging. We focus in this study on the inference of excitatory synaptic links. Based on information theory, our method requires no prior assumptions on the statistics of neuronal firing and neuronal connections. The performance of our algorithm is benchmarked on surrogate time series of calcium fluorescence generated by the simulated dynamics of a network with known ground-truth topology. We find that the functional network topology revealed by Transfer Entropy depends qualitatively on the time-dependent dynamic state of the network (bursting or non-bursting). Thus by conditioning with respect to the global mean activity, we improve the performance of our method. This allows us to focus the analysis to specific dynamical regimes of the network in which the inferred functional connectivity is shaped by monosynaptic excitatory connections, rather than by collective synchrony. Our method can discriminate between actual causal influences between neurons and spurious non-causal correlations due to light scattering artifacts, which inherently affect the quality of fluorescence imaging. Compared to other reconstruction strategies such as cross-correlation or Granger Causality methods, our method based on improved Transfer Entropy is remarkably more accurate. In particular, it provides a good estimation of the excitatory network clustering coefficient, allowing for discrimination between weakly and strongly clustered topologies. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to analyses of real recordings of <italic>in vitro</italic> disinhibited cortical cultures where we suggest that excitatory connections are characterized by an elevated level of clustering compared to a random graph (although not extreme) and can be markedly non-local.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Unraveling the general organizing principles of connectivity in neural circuits is a crucial step towards understanding brain function. However, even the simpler task of assessing the global excitatory connectivity of a culture <italic>in vitro</italic>, where neurons form self-organized networks in absence of external stimuli, remains challenging. Neuronal cultures undergo spontaneous switching between episodes of synchronous bursting and quieter inter-burst periods. We introduce here a novel algorithm which aims at inferring the connectivity of neuronal cultures from calcium fluorescence recordings of their network dynamics. To achieve this goal, we develop a suitable generalization of Transfer Entropy, an information-theoretic measure of causal influences between time series. Unlike previous algorithmic approaches to reconstruction, Transfer Entropy is data-driven and does not rely on specific assumptions about neuronal firing statistics or network topology. We generate simulated calcium signals from networks with controlled ground-truth topology and purely excitatory interactions and show that, by restricting the analysis to inter-bursts periods, Transfer Entropy robustly achieves a good reconstruction performance for disparate network connectivities. Finally, we apply our method to real data and find evidence of non-random features in cultured networks, such as the existence of highly connected hub excitatory neurons and of an elevated (but not extreme) level of clustering.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The identification of the topological features of neuronal circuits is an essential step towards understanding neuronal computation and function. Despite considerable progress in neuroanatomy, electrophysiology and imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Sporns1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Wedeen1">[8]</xref>, the detailed mapping of neuronal circuits is already a difficult task for a small population of neurons, and becomes impractical when accessing large neuronal ensembles. Even in the case of cultures of dissociated neurons, in which neuronal connections develop <italic>de novo</italic> during the formation and maturation of the network, very few details are known about the statistical features of this connectivity, which might reflect signatures of self-organized critical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Levina1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Tetzlaff1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Neuronal cultures have emerged in recent years as simple, yet versatile model systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Eckmann1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Feinerman1">[13]</xref> in the quest for uncovering neuronal connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Soriano1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Erickson1">[15]</xref> and dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Opitz1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Cohen1">[19]</xref>. The fact that relatively simple cultures already exhibit a rich repertoire of spontaneous activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Wagenaar1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Cohen2">[20]</xref> make them particularly appealing for studying the interplay between activity and connectivity.</p>
      <p>The activity of hundreds to thousands of cells in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured neuronal networks can be simultaneously monitored using calcium fluorescence imaging techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Soriano1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Stosiek1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Grienberger1">[22]</xref>. Calcium imaging can be applied both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and has the potential to be combined with stimulation techniques like optogenetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Yizhar1">[23]</xref>. A major drawback of this technique, however, is that the typical frame rate during acquisition is slower than the cell's firing dynamics by an order of magnitude. Furthermore the poor signal-to-noise ratio makes the detection of elementary firing events difficult.</p>
      <p>Neuronal cultures are unique platforms to investigate and quantify the accuracy of network reconstruction from activity data, extending analysis tools initially devised for the characterization of macro-scale functional networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Achard1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Honey1">[25]</xref> to the micro-scale of a developing local circuit.</p>
      <p>Here we report a new technique based on information theory to reconstruct the connectivity of a neuronal network from calcium imaging data. We use an extension of Transfer Entropy (TE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Schreiber1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Wibral1">[28]</xref> to extract a <italic>directed functional connectivity</italic> network in which the presence of a directed edge between two nodes reflects a direct causal influence by the source to the target node <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Aertsen1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Bressler1">[31]</xref>. Note that “causal influence” is defined operationally as “improved predictability” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Wiener1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Granger1">[33]</xref> reflecting the fact that knowledge of the activity of one node (putatively pre-synaptic) is helpful in predicting the future behavior of another node (putatively post-synaptic). TE has previously been used to study gene regulatory networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Wang1">[34]</xref>, the flow of information between auditory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Gourevitch1">[35]</xref>, to infer directed interactions between brain areas based on EEG recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Vicente1">[36]</xref> or between different LFP frequency bands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Besserve1">[37]</xref>, as well as for the reconstruction of the connectivity based on spike times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Garofalo1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Ito1">[39]</xref>. Importantly, our data-driven TE approach is model-independent. This is in contrast with previous approaches to network reconstruction, which were most often based on the knowledge of precise spike times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Cadotte1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Mishchencko1">[45]</xref>, or explicitly assumed a specific model of neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Vogelstein1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Shandilya1">[44]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A problem inherent to the indirect algorithmic inference of network connectivity from real data is that the true target topology of the network is not known and that, therefore, it is difficult to assess the quality of the reconstruction. In order to characterize the behavior of our algorithm and to benchmark its potential performance, we resort therefore to synthetic calcium fluorescence time series generated by a simulated cultured neural network that exhibits realistic dynamics. Since the “ground truth” topology of cultures <italic>in silico</italic> is known and arbitrarily selectable, the quality of our reconstruction can be evaluated by systematically comparing the inferred with the real network connectivities.</p>
      <p>We use a simplified network simulation to generate surrogate imaging data, improving their realism with the reproduction of light scattering artifacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Lichtman1">[6]</xref> which ordinarily affect the quality of the recording. Our surrogate data also reproduce another general feature of the activity of neuronal cultures, namely the occurrence of temporally irregular switching between states of asynchronous activity, with relatively weak average firing rates, and states of highly synchronous activity, commonly denoted as “network bursts” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Cohen2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Eytan1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Eckmann2">[47]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This switching dynamics poses potentially a major obstacle to reconstruction, since directed functional connectivity can be very different during bursting and inter-burst phases and can bear a resemblance to the underlying <italic>structural</italic> (i.e. synaptic) connectivity only in selected dynamical regimes in which causal influences reflect dominantly mono-synaptic interactions. To restrict our analysis to such “good” regimes, we resort to <italic>conditioning</italic> with respect to the averaged fluorescence level, as an indirect but reliable indicator of the network collective dynamics. Appropriate conditioning —combined with a simple correction coping with the poor time-resolution of imaging data— allows the method to achieve a good topology reconstruction performance (assessed from synthetic data), out-performing other standard approaches, without the need to infer exact spike times through sophisticated techniques (as is required, on the contrary, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Vogelstein1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Mishchencko1">[45]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Finally, we apply our algorithm —optimized through model-based validation— to the analysis of real calcium imaging recordings. For this purpose, we study spontaneously developing networks of dissociated cortical neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and we address, as a first step toward a full topology reconstruction, the simpler problem of extracting only their excitatory connectivity. Early mature cultures display a bursting dynamics very similar to our simulated networks, with which they also share an analogous state-dependency of directed functional connectivity.</p>
      <p>Our generalized TE approach thus identifies network topologies with characteristic and non-trivial features, like the existence of non-local connections, a broadened and strongly right-skewed distribution of degrees (although not “scale free”) and a moderate but significant level of clustering.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2"><italic>Results</italic></xref> section is organized as follows. After a brief presentation of the qualitative similarity between real calcium fluorescence data from neuronal cultures and simulated data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we introduce numerical simulations showing that networks with very different clustering levels can lead to matching bursting dynamics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We then develop our reconstruction strategy, based on a novel generalization of TE, and examine the different elements composing our strategy, namely <italic>“same-bin interactions”</italic> and <italic>conditioning</italic> with respect to the average fluorescence level. We show that only signals recorded during inter-burst periods convey elevated information about the underlying structural topology (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3</xref>). After a discussion of criteria guiding the choice of the number of links to include in the reconstructed network, we illustrate specific examples of reconstruction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g005">5</xref>), contrasting systematically TE with other standard linear and nonlinear competitor methods (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g006">Figure 6</xref>) and analyzing factors affecting its performance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Finally, we apply our reconstruction algorithm to biological recordings and infer topological features of actual neuronal cultures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

        <title>Real and surrogate calcium fluorescence data</title>
        <p>In this study, we consider recordings from <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures of dissociated cortical neurons (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). To illustrate the quality of our recordings, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g001">Figure 1A</xref> we provide a bright field image of a region of a culture together with its associated calcium fluorescence. As previously anticipated, to simplify the network reconstruction problem, experiments are carried out with blocked inhibitory GABA-ergic transmission, so that the network activity is driven solely by excitatory connections. We record activity of <italic>early mature</italic> cultures at day <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) 9–12. Such young but sufficiently mature cultures display rich bursting events, combined with sparse irregular firing activity during inter-burst periods (cfr. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Discussion</italic></xref>).</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g001">Figure 1B</xref> (left panel) we show actual recordings of the fluorescence traces associated to five different neurons. The corresponding population average for the same time window is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g001">Figure 1C</xref> (left panel). In these recordings, a stable baseline is broken by intermittent activity peaks that correspond to synchronized network bursts recruiting many neurons. The bursts display a fast rise of fluorescence at their onset followed by a slow decay. In addition, during inter-burst periods, smaller modulations above the baseline are sometimes visible despite the poor time-resolution of a frame every few tens of milliseconds.</p>
        <p>In order to benchmark and optimize different reconstruction methods, we also generate surrogate calcium fluorescence data (shown in the right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g001">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>), based on the activity of simulated networks whose ground truth topology is known. We simulate the spontaneous spiking dynamics of networks formed by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons, along a duration of 60 minutes of real time, matching typical lengths of actual recordings. Calcium fluorescence time series are then produced based on this spiking dynamics, resorting to a model introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Vogelstein1">[43]</xref> and described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref> section.</p>
        <p>Although over 1000 cells are accessible in our experiments, we observed in the simulations that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> neurons suffice to reproduce the same dynamical behavior observed for larger network sizes, while still allowing for an exhaustive exploration of the entire algorithmic parameter space. Furthermore, despite their reduced density, we maintain in our simulated cultures the same average probability of connection as in actual cultures, where this probability (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>) is an estimate based on independent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Erickson1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Wen1">[48]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The fluorescence signal of a particular simulation run or experiment can be conveniently studied in terms of the distribution of fluorescence amplitudes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g001">Figure 1D</xref> for both simulations and experiments, the amplitude distributions display a characteristic right-skewed shape that emerge from the switching between two distinct dynamical regimes, namely the presence or absence of bursts. The distribution in the low fluorescence region assumes a Gaussian-like shape, corresponding to noise-dominated baseline activity, while the high fluorescence region displays a long tail with a cut-off at the level of calcium fluorescence of the highest network spikes. As we will show later, qualitative similarity between the shapes of the simulated and experimental fluorescence distributions will play an important guiding role for an appropriate network reconstruction.</p>

        <title>Different network topologies lead to equivalent network bursting</title>
        <p>Neurons grown <italic>in vitro</italic> develop on a two-dimensional substrate and, hence, both connectivity and clustering may be strongly sensitive to the physical distance between neurons. At the same time, due to long axonal projections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Feinerman1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Kriegstein1">[49]</xref>, excitatory synaptic connections might be formed at any distance within the whole culture and both activity and signaling-dependent mechanisms might shape non-trivially long-range connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Sur1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Yu1">[51]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To test the reconstruction performance of our algorithm, we consider two general families of network topologies that cover a wide range of clustering coefficients. In a first one, clustering occurs between randomly positioned nodes (<italic>non-local</italic> clustering). In a second one, the connection probability between two nodes decays with their Euclidean distance according to a Gaussian distribution and, therefore, connected nodes are also likely to be spatially close. In particular, in this latter case, the overall level of clustering is determined by how fast the connection probability decays with distance (<italic>local</italic> clustering). Cortical slice studies revealed the existence of both local <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Holmgren1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Song1">[53]</xref> and non-local <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Perin1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Kalisman1">[54]</xref> types of clustering.</p>
        <p>We will later benchmark reconstruction performance for both kinds of topologies and for a wide range of clustering levels, because very similar patterns of neuronal activity can be generated by very different networks, as we now show.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g002">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the dynamic behavior of three networks (in this case from the non-local clustering ensemble). The networks are designed to have different clustering coefficients but the same total number of links (see the insets of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g002">Figure 2B</xref> for an illustration). The synaptic coupling between neurons was adjusted in each network using an automated procedure to obtain bursting activities with comparable bursting rates (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref> for details and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002653-t001">Table 1</xref> for the actual values of the synaptic weight). As a net effect of this procedure, the synaptic coupling between neurons is slightly reduced for larger clustering coefficients. The simulated spiking dynamics is shown in the raster plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. These three networks display indeed very similar bursting dynamics, not only in terms of the mean bursting rate, but also in terms of the entire inter-burst interval (IBIs) distribution, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. In the same manner, we constructed and simulated <italic>local</italic> networks —with a small length scale corresponding to high clustering coefficients and vice versa— and obtained the same result, i.e. very similar dynamics for very different decay lengths (not shown).</p>

Thus, the illustrative simulations of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g002">Figure 2</xref> provide genuine evidence that the relation between network dynamics and network structural clustering is not trivially “one-to-one”, despite the fact that more clustered networks have been shown to have different cascading dynamics at the onset of a burst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Pajevic1">[42]</xref>.</p>

        <p>We focus, first, on the reconstruction of simulated networks, taken from the <italic>local</italic> and <italic>non-local</italic> ensembles described above. We compute their directed functional connectivity based on simulated calcium signals. Synthetic fluorescence time series are pre-processed only by simple discrete differentiation, such as to extract baseline modulations associated to potential firing. These differentiated signals are then used as input to any further analyses.</p>

          <title>Generalized TE and directed functional connectivity</title>
          <p>We resort to a modified version of TE that includes two novel features (described in detail in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref> section), namely the treatment of “same bin interactions” and the ad hoc selection of dynamical states.</p>
          <p>The original formulation of TE was designed to detect the causal influence of events in the past with events at a later time. Practically, since calcium fluorescence is sampled at discrete times, standard TE evaluates how events occurring in time bin <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are influenced by events occurring in earlier time bins <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. By including <italic>same bin interactions</italic> in TE estimation, we also consider potential causal interactions between events that occur within the same time-bin <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This is important when dealing with experimental data of real neuronal cultures since the image acquisition rate is not sufficiently high to establish the temporal order of elementary spiking events.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the <italic>selection of dynamical states</italic> is crucial to properly capture interactions between neurons which lead to different activity correlation patterns in different dynamical regimes. Both simulated and real neuronal cultures indeed show a dynamical switching between two distinct states (bursting and non-bursting) that can be separated and characterized by monitoring the average fluorescence amplitude and restricting the analysis only to recording sections in which this average fluorescence falls in a predetermined range. Selection of dynamical states is discussed in the next section.</p>
          <p>Once TE functional connectivity strengths have been calculated for every possible directed pair of nodes, a reconstructed network topology can be obtained by applying a threshold to the TE values at an arbitrary level. Only links whose TE value is above this threshold are retained in the reconstructed network topology.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2c2">
          <title>Choosing a threshold is equivalent to choosing an average degree</title>
          <p>As a matter of fact, selecting a threshold for the inclusion of links corresponds to setting the average degrees of the reconstructed network. Intuitively, and as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s001">Figure S1A</xref>, a linear correlation exists between the number of links and the average degree. Because of this relation, an expectation about the probability of connection in the culture, and hence, its average degree, can directly be translated into a threshold number of links to include.</p>
          <p>Based on the aforementioned estimations of probability of connection and taken into account the different sizes of our (smaller) simulated network and of our (larger) experimental cultures, threshold values are roughly selected to include the <italic>top 10% of links</italic>, for reconstructions of simulated networks, and to include the <italic>top 5% of links</italic>, for reconstructions from actual biological recordings. These choices are such to lead, in both cases, to reconstructed networks with comparable probability of connection, as previously mentioned. The (limited) impact of a “wrong” threshold selection on the inference of specific topologic features, like the clustering coefficient, will be discussed in later sections.</p>

        <title>Network reconstruction depends on the dynamical states</title>
        <p>Immediately prior to the onset of a burst the network is very excitable. In such a situation it is intuitive to consider that the directed functional connectivity can depart radically from the structural excitatory connectivity, because local events can potentially induce changes at very long ranges due to collective synchronization rather than to direct synaptic coupling. Conversely, in the relatively quiet inter-burst phases, a post-synaptic spike is likely to be influenced solely by the presynaptic firing history. Hence, the directed functional connectivity between neurons is intrinsically <italic>state dependent</italic> (cfr. also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Battaglia1">[55]</xref>), a property that must be taken into account when reconstructing the connectivity.</p>
        <p>We illustrate here the state dependency of directed functional connectivity by generating a random network from the local clustering ensemble and by simulating its dynamics, including light scattering artifacts to obtain more realistic fluorescence signals. The resulting distribution of fluorescence amplitudes is divided into seven non-overlapping ranges of equal width, each of them identified with a Roman numeral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Finally, TE is computed separately for each of these ranges, based on different corresponding subsets of data from the simulated recordings.</p>
        <p>For simulated data, the inferred connectivity can be directly compared to the ground truth, and a standard <italic>Receiver-Operator Characteristic</italic> (ROC) analysis can be used to quantify the quality of reconstruction. ROC curves are generated by gradually moving a threshold level from the lowest to the highest TE value, and by plotting at each point the fraction of true positives as a function of the fraction of false positives. The quality of reconstruction is then summarized in a single number by the <italic>performance level</italic>, which, following an arbitrary convention, is measured as the fraction of true positives at 10% of false positives read out of a complete ROC curve.</p>
        <p>We plot the performance level as a function of the average fluorescence amplitude in each interval, as shown by the blue line of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. The highest accuracy is achieved in the lowest fluorescence range, denoted by I, and reaches a remarkably elevated value of approximately 70% of true positives. The performance in the higher ranges II to IV decreases to a value around 45%, to abruptly drop at range V and above to a final plateau that corresponds to the 10% performance of a random reconstruction (ranges VI and VII).</p>
        <p>Note that fluorescence values are not distributed homogeneously across ranges I–VII, as evidenced by the overall shape of the fluorescence distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. For example, the lowest and highest ranges (I and VII) differ by two orders of magnitude in the number of data points. To discriminate unequal-sampling effects from actual state-dependent phenomena, we studied the performance level using an equal number of data points in all ranges. Effectively, we restrict the number of data points available in each range to be equal to the number of samples in the highest range, VII. The quality of such a reconstruction is shown as the red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. The performance level is now generally lower, reflecting the reduced number of time points which are included in the analysis.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the “true” peak of reconstruction quality is shifted to range II, corresponding to fluorescence levels just above the Gaussian in the histogram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. This range is therefore the most effective in terms of reconstruction performance for a given data sampling.</p>
        <p>For the ranges higher than II, the reconstruction quality gradually decreases again to the 10% performance of purely random choices in ranges VI and VII. The effect of adopting a (shorter) equal sample size is particularly striking for range I, which drops from the best performance level almost down to the baseline for random reconstruction. As a matter of fact, range I is the one for which the shrinkage of sample length due to the constraint for uniform data sampling is most extreme (see later section on dependence of performance from sample size).</p>
        <p>The above analysis leads to a different functional network for each dynamical range studied. For the analysis with an equal number of data point per interval, the seven effective networks are drawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3C</xref> (for clarity only the top 10% of links are shown). Each functional network is accompanied with the corresponding ROC curve.</p>
        <p>The lowest range I corresponds to a regime in which spiking-related signals are buried in noise. Correspondingly, the associated functional connectivity is practically random, as indicated by a ROC curve close to the diagonal. Nevertheless, information about structural topology is still conveyed in the activity associated to this regime and can be extracted through extensive sampling.</p>
        <p>At the other extreme, corresponding to the upper ranges V to VII —associated to fully developed synchronous bursts— the functional connectivity has also a poor overlap with the underlying structural network. As addressed later in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Discussion</italic></xref> section, functional connectivity in regimes associated to bursting is characterized by the existence of hub nodes with an elevated degree of connection. The spatio-temporal organization of bursting can be described in terms of these functional connectivity hubs, since nodes within the neighborhood of the same functional hub provide the strongest mutual synchronization experienced by an arbitrary pair of nodes across the network (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Discussion</italic></xref> and also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The best agreement between functional and excitatory structural connectivity is clearly obtained for the inter-bursts regime associated with the middle range II, and to a lesser degree in ranges III and IV, corresponding to the early building-up of synchronous bursts.</p>
        <p>Overall, this study of state-dependent functional connectivity provides arguments to define the optimal dynamical regime for network reconstruction: The regime should include all data points whose average fluorescence across the population <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is below a “conditioning level” <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, located just on the right side of the Gaussian part of the histogram of the average fluorescence (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). This selection excludes the regimes of highly synchronized activity (ranges III to VII) and keeps most of the data points for the analysis in order to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, the inclusion of both ranges I and II combines the positive effects of correct state selection and of extensive sampling.</p>
        <p>The state-dependency of functional connectivity is not limited to synthetic data. Very similar patterns of state-dependency are observed also in real data from neuronal cultures. In particular, in both simulated and real cultures, the functional connectivity associated to the development of bursts displays a stronger clustering level than in the inter-burst periods. An analysis of the topological properties of functional networks obtained from real data in different states (compared with synthetic data) is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s003">Figure S3</xref>. In this same figure, sections of fluorescence time-series associated to different dynamical states are represented in different colors, for a better visualization of the correspondence between states and fluorescence values (for simplicity, only four fluorescence ranges are distinguished).</p>

        <title>Analysis of two representative network reconstructions</title>
        <p>Our generalized TE, conditioned to the proper dynamic range, enables the reconstruction of network topologies even in the presence of light scattering artifacts. For non-locally clustered topologies we obtain a remarkably high accuracy of up to 75% of true positives at a cost of 10% of false positives. An example of the reconstruction for such a network, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. For locally-clustered topologies, accuracy typically reaches 60% of true positives at a cost of 10% of false positives, and an example for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g005">Figure 5A</xref>.</p>
        <p>In both topologies, we observe that for a low fraction of false positives detection (i.e. at high thresholds <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) the ROC curve displays a sharp rise, indicating a very reliable detection of the causally most efficient excitatory connections. A decrease in the slope, and therefore a rise in the detection of false positives and a larger confidence interval, is observed only at higher fractions of false positives. The confidence intervals are broader in the case of locally-clustered topologies because of the additional network-to-network variability that results from the placement of neurons (which is irrelevant for the generation of the non-locally clustered ensembles, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>).</p>
        <sec id="s2e1">
          <title>Non-local clustering ensemble</title>
          <p>To address the reconstruction quality of the network topology, we focus first on the results for the non-local clustered ensemble. For a conditioning level which corresponds to the right hand side of the Gaussian in the fluorescence amplitude histogram (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), we consider three main network observables, namely the distributions of local clustering coefficients, in-degrees, and the distances of connections. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, we obtain a reconstructed network that reproduces well the ground truth properties, with similar mean values and distributions for all three observables considered. We observe, however, a small shift towards lower clustering indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, top panel) and especially towards lower average distances (bottom panel) for this highly clustered network.</p>
          <p>Despite this underestimation bias for instances with high clustering, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g004">Figure 4C</xref> shows the existence of a clear linear correlation between the real average clustering coefficient and that of the topology reconstructed with generalized TE (Pearson's correlation coefficient of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Such linear relation allows, notably, a reliable discrimination between networks with different levels of clustering but very similar bursting dynamics. Note that this linear relation between real and reconstructed clustering coefficient is robust against misestimation of the expected average degree, or, equivalently, of the number of links to include, as highlighted by <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s001">Figure S1B</xref>.</p>
          <p>TE-based reconstructions also yield estimates of the average distance of connection —constant and not correlated with the clustering level— with reasonable accuracy as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s004">Figure S4A</xref>.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2e2">
          <title>Local clustering ensemble</title>
          <p>For this ensemble (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g005">Figure 5</xref>), the quality of reconstruction can be assessed even visually, due to the distance-dependency of the connections, by plotting the network graph of reconstructed connections. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g005">Figure 5B</xref> we compared the structural network (top panel) with the reconstructed one (bottom panel), obtained by including as links only edges corresponding to the top 10% of TE values. This corresponds here to about 600 true positives (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all possible true positives, and plotted in green) and about 400 false positives (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all possible false positives, plotted in red). The statistical properties of the structural and reconstructed networks are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g005">Figure 5C</xref>. Again, reconstructed network properties correlate with real properties. The reconstructed distribution of connection distances displays a reduced right-tail compared to the real one. A tendency to estimate a more local connectivity is evident also from a marked overestimation of local clustering coefficients. We attribute such a mismatch to light scattering artifacts that increase local correlations in a spatial region matching the length scale of real structural connections. This is confirmed by the fact that the length scale is correctly inferred in simulations without the light scattering artifact (not shown).</p>
          <p>Note, that there is again a very good linear correlation (Pearson's correlation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) between the actual and reconstructed (spatial) average connection length, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g005">Figure 5D</xref>. Similarly, the reconstructed average clustering coefficient is linearly correlated with that of the ground truth (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), as shown in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s004">Figure S4B</xref>.</p>

          <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g005">Figure 5D</xref> we compare the performance of generalized TE with other reconstruction strategies, respectively for the non-local and for the local clustering ensemble. We considered, as competitors, crosscorrelation (XC), Granger Causality (GC) or Mutual Information (MI) metrics. All of these methods have previously been used to study the connectivity in neural networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Cadotte1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Garofalo2">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Ferguson1">[61]</xref>. Detailed definitions of these methods and of the adaptations we introduce for a fair comparison with generalized TE are provided in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref> section. When using these alternative metrics, functional networks were extracted exactly as when using generalized TE. The only difference consisted in evaluating functional coupling scores based on XC, GC or MI for each directed edge.</p>
          <p>We observe then that MI-based reconstructions yield linear correlations between real and reconstructed clustering coefficient and length scales as well. For the adopted optimal conditioning level, MI can actually out-perform generalized TE (cfr. Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s004">Figure S4</xref>), probably due to the smaller sample size required for its estimation. On the contrary, XC-based reconstructions fail in all cases to reproduce these linear correlations, yielding a constant value independently from the ground-truth values. For the non-local clustering ensemble, it distinctly over-estimates average clustering level; for the local clustering ensemble, it severely underestimates the average length of connections. Therefore, in XC-based reconstructions, all information on the actual degree of clustering in the network is lost and a high clustering level is invariably inferred.</p>
          <p>GC-based reconstructions display the same error syndrome (not shown), which indicates that capturing non-linear correlations in neural activity —as MI and TE can do, but XC and GC cannot— is crucial for the inference of the clustering level.</p>
          <p>We would like to remind that XC-, GC- and MI-based methods, analogously to the generalized TE approach, include, as generalized TE, the possibility of “same-bin interactions” (zero-lag). Furthermore, we have modified them to also include optimal conditioning in order to make the comparison between different methods fair.

We test linear methods, XC and GC (of order 2; the performance of GC of order 1 is very similar and not shown), and non-linear methods, namely MI and TE (of Markov orders 1 and 2; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref> for details). XC and MI are correlation measures, while GC and TE are causality measures. Note that, for each of these methods, we account for state dependency of functional connectivity, performing state separation as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref> section.</p>
        <p>In the case of the non-local clustering ensemble and without light scattering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g006">Figure 6</xref>, top row), even a linear method such as XC achieves a good reconstruction. This success indicates an overlap between communities of higher synchrony in the calcium fluorescence, associated to stronger activity correlations, and the underlying structural connectivity, especially for higher full clustering indices.</p>
        <p>GC-based reconstructions have an overall worse quality, due to the inadequacy of a linear model for the prediction of our highly nonlinear network dynamics, but they show similarly improved performance for higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>In a band centered around a shared optimal conditioning level <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, both MI and generalized TE show a robust performance across all clustering indices. This value is similar to the upper bound of the range II depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, i.e. it lies at the interface between the bursting and silent dynamical regimes. In particular for TE and in the case of low clustering indices (which leads to networks closer to random graphs), conditioning greatly improves reconstruction quality. At higher clustering indices the decay in performance is only moderate for conditioning levels above the optimal value, indicating an overlap between the functional connectivities in the bursting and silent regimes. Note, on the contrary, that the performance of MI rapidly decreases if a non-optimal conditioning level is assumed.</p>
        <p>The introduction of light scattering causes a dramatic drop in performance of the two linear methods (XC and GC), and even of MI and TE with Markov order <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The performance of TE at Markov order 2 also deteriorates, but is still significantly above the random reconstruction baseline in a broad region of parameters. Interestingly, for the optimal conditioning level <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the performance of the TE for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> does not fall below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for any clustering level or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value. It is precisely in this optimal conditioning range that we obtain the linear relations between reconstructed and structural clustering coefficients, for both the non-local and the local clustering ensembles.</p>
        <p>A similar trend is obtained when varying the length scale <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the local ensembles (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s005">Figure S5</xref>). For very local clustering and without light scattering, both XC and TE achieve performance levels up to 80%. The introduction of light scattering, however, reduces the performance of all measures except for MI (but only in the narrow optimal conditioning range) and for TE of higher Markov orders (robust against non-optimal selection of conditioning level). Overall, the performance of the reconstruction for the local clustering ensembles is lower than for the non-locally clustered ensembles. This is also true, incidentally, in absence of light scattering since networks sampled from this ensemble tend to be very similar to purely random topologies (of the Erdös-Rényi type, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Newman1">[62]</xref>) as soon as the length scale is sufficiently long, and for which performance is generally poorer (cfr. top row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g006">Figure 6</xref>, for weak clustering levels).</p>

        <title>Contributions to the performance of generalized TE</title>
        <p>Our new TE method significantly improves the reconstruction performance compared to the original TE formulation [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002653.e191">Eq. (9)</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g007">Figure 7A</xref> for both the local and the non-local clustered networks, reconstruction with the original TE formulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, blue line) yields worse results than a random reconstruction, as indicated by the corresponding ROC curves falling below the diagonal. Such a poor performance is due in large part to “misinterpreted” delayed interactions. Indeed, by taking into account same bin interactions, a boost in performance is observed (red line). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g007">Figure 7A</xref> also shows that an additional leap in performance is obtained when the analysis is <italic>conditioned</italic> (i.e. restricted) to a particular dynamical state of the network, increasing reconstruction quality by 20% (yellow line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The determination of the optimal conditioning level is discussed later and takes into account the considerations introduced above (cfr. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Note that the introduction of same bin interactions alone (red color curves) or conditioning on the dynamical state of network alone (yellow color curves) already brings the performance to a level well superior to random performance. However, at least for our simulated calcium-fluorescence time series, a remarkable boost in performance is obtained only when the inclusion of same-bin interactions and optimal conditioning are combined together (green color curves). Although, in principle, conditioning is enough to indirectly select a proper dynamical regime, the poor time-resolution of the analyzed signals (constrained not only by the frame-rate of acquisition but also intrinsically by the kinetics of the dissociation reaction of the calcium-sensitive dye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Eberhard1">[63]</xref>) also requires the potential consideration of causally-linked events occurring in the same time-bin.</p>
        <p>A different way to represent reconstruction performance are “Positive Precision Curves” (as introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Garofalo2">[56]</xref> and described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref> section), obtained by plotting, at a given number of reconstructed links, the “true-false ratio” (TPR), which emphasizes the probability that a reconstructed link is present in the ground truth topology (true positive). For the same networks and reconstruction as above, we plot the PPCs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s006">Figure S6</xref> (for the ROC curves see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Over a wide range of the number of reconstructed links (TFS), the PPC displays positive values of the TFR, indicative of a majority of true positives over false positives. For both the locally and non-locally clustered networks, the PPC reaches a maximum value of the TPR about 0.5 and remains positive up to about 18% of included links for the clustered topology, or up to 12% in the case of the local topology.</p>

        <title>Recording length affects performance</title>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, we analyze the performance of our algorithm against changes of the sample size. Starting from simulated recordings lasting 1 h of real time (corresponding to about 360 bursting events) and with a full sample number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we trimmed these recordings producing shorter fluorescence time series with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> samples, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> being a divisor of the sample size. For both network topology ensembles, we found that a reduction in the number of samples by a factor of two (corresponding to 30 minutes or about 180 bursts) still yields a performance level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. By further reducing the sample size, we reach a plateau with a quality of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for about 40 bursts (corresponding to 6 minutes).</p>
        <p>All the experiments analyzed in this work are carried out with a duration between 30 and 60 minutes. Since conditioning, needed to achieve high performance, requires one to ignore a conspicuous fraction of the recorded data, we expect long recordings to be necessary for a good reconstruction, albeit the fact that it is possible to increase the signal-to-noise ratio by increasing the intensity of the fluorescent light. However, the latter manipulation has negative implications for the health of neurons due to photo-damage, limiting our experimental recordings to a maximum of 2 hours.</p>

        <title>Analysis of biological recordings</title>
        <p>We apply our analysis to actual recordings from <italic>in vitro</italic> networks derived from cortical neurons (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). To simplify the network reconstruction problem, experiments are carried out with blocked inhibitory GABA-ergic transmission, so that the network activity is driven solely by excitatory connections. This is consistent with previously discussed simulations, in which only excitatory neurons were included.</p>
        <p>We consider in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g008">Figure 8</xref> a network reconstruction based on a 60 minutes recording of the activity of a mature culture, at day <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) 12, in which <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> active neurons were simultaneously imaged. A fully analogous network reconstruction for a second, younger dataset at DIV 9 is presented in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s007">Figure S7</xref>. In general, fluorescence data neither affected by photo-bleaching nor by photo-damage during this time, as proved by the stability of the average fluorescence signal shown in the Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s008">Figure S8A</xref>.</p>
        <p>The probability distribution of the average fluorescence signal is computed in the same way as for the simulated data. Neuronal dynamics and the calcium fluorescence display the same bursting dynamics that are well captured by the simulations, leading to a similar fluorescence distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thanks to this similarity we can make use of the intuition developed for synthetic data to estimate an adequate conditioning level. We select therefore a conditioning level such as to exclude the right-tail of high fluorescence associated to to fully-developed bursting transient regimes. We have verified, however, that the main qualitative topological features of the reconstructed network are left unchanged when varying the conditioning level in a range centered on our “optimal” selection. More details on conditioning level selection are given in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref> section.</p>
        <p>Reconstruction analysis is carried out for the entire population of imaged neurons. We analyze a network defined by the top 5% of TE-ranked links, as discussed in a previous section. Such choice leads to an average in–degree of about 100, compatible with average degrees reported previously for neuronal cultures of corresponding age (DIV) and density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Soriano1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Jacobi1">[64]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Comparison with randomized networks</title>
          <p>The ground truth excitatory connectivity is obviously not known for real recordings and performance cannot be assessed by means of an ROC analysis. However, we can compare the obtained reconstruction to randomized variations to identify non-trivial topological features of the reconstructed network. We perform two kinds of randomizations: In a first one, randomization is full and only the number of network edges is preserved. Comparison with such <italic>fully</italic> randomized networks detects significant deviations of the reconstructed network from an ensemble of random graphs in which the degree follows the same prescribed Poisson distribution for each node (Erdös-Rényi ensemble, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Newman1">[62]</xref>). In a second randomization, both the total edge number and the precise out-degrees of each node are preserved. The comparison of the reconstructed network with such a <italic>partially</italic> randomized ensemble detects local patterns of correlations between in- and out-degrees —including, notably, clustering— which do not arise just in virtue of a specific distribution of out-degrees. Comparison with partial randomizations is particularly important when skewed distributions of degrees are expected.</p>

          <title>Topology retrieved by TE</title>
          <p>Our analysis shows that the resulting reconstructed topology is characterized by markedly non-local structures, as visible in the portion of the reconstructed network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g008">Figure 8A</xref>. Distributions of degree, distance of connection and local clustering coefficients inferred by TE are shown in the top row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g008">Figure 8B</xref> (yellow histograms). The degree distribution is characteristically broadened and distinctly right-skewed, deviating from the Poisson distribution associated to Erdös-Rényi random graphs (the histogram for fully randomized networks shown in blue). Note that, for partial randomizations (histograms shown in red), we have randomized the out-degree of each node but plotted here the resulting in-degree distribution (the distribution of out-degrees would be, by construction, unchanged).</p>
          <p>While the distribution of connection distances matches the one of randomized networks, TE detects clustering at a level which is moderate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) but significantly larger than for random networks. Note that this larger clustering cannot be ascribed to the broadened degree distribution since both full and partial (red histograms) randomizations lead to consistently smaller clustering levels (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>

          <title>Topology retrieved by XC</title>
          <p>By analyzing a network reconstruction based on cross-correlation (XC), we find differences to TE (bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). In particular, XC infers a distribution of distances markedly more local than for full and partially randomized network instances and, correspondingly, markedly higher clustering coefficient (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Distribution of degrees inferred by XC is on the contrary random-like.</p>
          <p>As a matter of fact, remarkably similar patterns of discrepancy between reconstruction results based on TE and on XC are also robustly present in synthetic data. Synthetic data analyses consistently show the superior performance of TE compared to XC. Furthermore, these analyses identify a tendency of XC to infer an artificially too local and too clustered connectivity. Therefore, we believe that the topology of the neuronal culture inferred by XC is not reliable, and is biased by the aforementioned systematic drifts.</p>

        <title>Relation to state of the art</title>
        <p>We have introduced a novel extension of Transfer Entropy, an information theoretical measure, and applied it to infer excitatory connectivity of neuronal cultures <italic>in vitro</italic>. Other studies have previously applied TE (or a generalization of TE) to the reconstruction of the topology of cultured networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Ito1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Garofalo2">[56]</xref>. However, our study introduces and discusses important novel aspects, relevant for applications.</p>
        <sec id="s3a1">
          <title>Model independency</title>
          <p>Our algorithm is model-independent and it is thus not constrained to linear interactions between nodes. This absence of a parametric model can be advantageous not only conceptually, where we hope to make the least amount of assumptions necessary, but also practical for applications to real data. Due to its generality, it can be used virtually without modifications even for the reconstruction based on spike trains or voltage traces. This is important, since massive datasets with modalities beyond calcium fluorescence imaging might become available in a near future, thanks to progresses in connectomics research. Model-independence is also important to avoid potential artifacts due to a too restrictive or inappropriate choice of model for neuronal firing or for network topology. Therefore, it constitutes a major advantage with respect to regression methods or even more elaborated Bayesian approaches, as the one considered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Mishchencko1">[45]</xref>. Both regression and Bayesian techniques indeed assume specific models of calcium fluorescence and neuronal firing dynamics, either explicitly (in the case of the Bayesian framework) or implicitly (assuming a linear dynamical model in the case, e.g., of XC or GC). Note that we use here dynamical network models to benchmark our reconstruction quality. However, our method still remains model-free, because knowledge about these models is not required for reconstruction.</p>

          <title>No need for spike times</title>
          <p>Competitor approaches used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Garofalo2">[56]</xref> or put emphasis on the need of reconstructing exact spike times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Mishchencko1">[45]</xref> with sophisticated deconvolution techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Vogelstein1">[43]</xref>, as a preprocessing step before actual topology reconstruction.</p>
          <p>As we have shown here, acquiring such difficult-to-access information is unnecessary for our method, which performs efficiently even for slow calcium fluorescence acquisition rate and operates directly on imaging time series. This is a crucial feature for applications to noisy data, which remains useful even when —as for the data analyzed in this study— the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently good to allow sometimes the isolation of individual firing events (cfr. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

        <sec id="s3a3">
          <title>Robustness against bursting</title>
          <p>We optimized our algorithm to infer excitatory connectivity based on time series of calcium fluorescence with a complex nonlinear dynamics, capturing the irregular bursting and the corresponding time-dependent degree of synchronization observed in cultured networks <italic>in vitro</italic>. To our knowledge, no previous study about algorithmic connectivity reconstruction has tackled with simulated dynamics reaching this level of realism. We have here identified a simple and conceptually elegant mean-field solution to the problem of switching between bursting and non-bursting states, based just on conditioning with respect to the average level of fluorescence from the whole culture.</p>
          <p>A feature of our model network dynamics, and one that is crucial to reproduce temporally irregular network bursting, is the inclusion of short-term depressing synapses. Remarkably, other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Ito1">[39]</xref>, which have modeled explicitly more complex forms of spike-time dependent synaptic plasticity, neglect completely this short-term plasticity, failing correspondingly to generate a realistic model of spontaneous activity of an <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. Yet, our network model remains very simplified, although the use of networks of integrate-and-fire neurons to generate surrogate data is widespread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Ito1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Mishchencko1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Eytan1">[46]</xref>. Several features of real cultured neurons are not explicitly included, like heterogeneity in synaptic conductances and time-constants, slow NMDA excitatory currents or distance-dependent axonal delays. However, time-series from more complex models could be used to benchmark our algorithm, without need of introducing any change into it, due to its model-free nature.</p>

          <title>Robustness against light scattering</title>
          <p>We have found that, among the tested methods, only generalized TE of at least Markov order <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with a proper conditioning allows to distinguish random from clustered topologies and local from long-range connectivities in a reliable manner, in the presence of light scattering artifacts. These artifacts indeed lead to the inference of spurious interactions between the calcium signal of two nodes, reducing the performance of linear causality measures like XC or GC to a random level. Note that this is very likely a similar effect as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Vicente1">[36]</xref>, where reconstruction with TE is still possible despite cross-talk between EEG electrodes.</p>

          <title>Low computational complexity</title>
          <p>Finally, we note that our algorithm is computationally simple and relatively efficient. Preprocessing of time series is a simple discrete differentiation. State selection is achieved via conditioning data on a range, which requires only to read once the input time series and compare them with a threshold. The inference procedure itself is not iterative (unlike in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Pajevic1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Mishchencko1">[45]</xref>) and evaluation of TE is done through simple “plug-in” estimation, which is fast (unlike elementary steps in, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Mishchencko1">[45]</xref>). The principal determinant of computational complexity is therefore the growing number of putative links (which grow as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and, hence, of TE scores that must be computed.</p>
          <p>For the recording duration of one hour considered in this work, we typically found a computation time of approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> including pre-processing on a 2.67 GHz Intel Xeon processor. Reconstructions of networks with 100 nodes required roughly ten minutes; with 1000 nodes roughly half a day. Note however that as the computation of TE for two distinct links is (after pre-processing and conditioning) computationally independent, it can be easily parallelized, reducing the computation time by a factor equal to the number of CPUs.</p>

          <title>Good reconstruction of clustering</title>
          <p>Based on synthetic time series of calcium fluorescence, we have studied the relation between ground truth topological features and their reconstructed counterparts. By restricting directed functional connectivity estimation to a proper dynamical regime through conditioning, we found strong linear correlations between real and reconstructed topological properties, both for the average Euclidean distance of connections and the clustering coefficient (CC). Note that deviations from this linear relationship at higher CC values, visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, are in part due to the fact that we have used a constant conditioning level for all reconstructions, while the optimal conditioning level increases slightly for high CCs.</p>
          <p>Clustering coefficient is the most widespread measure of higher order topological features, going beyond characterization of neighbors in a network, but analyzing correlation between local neighborhoods of different nodes. We have adopted the so-called “full” clustering index to measure clustering in our directed networks. However, several other definitions of clustering coefficient for directed network exist, emphasizing the contribution to the clustering phenomenon of different topological motifs such as cycles or “middleman” loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Fagiolo1">[65]</xref>. We have checked that the linear relationship between real and reconstructed clustering indices hold for all the clustering index types defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Fagiolo1">[65]</xref>, with an almost identical degree of correlation.

Considering for instance the network whose reconstruction is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g005">Figure 5</xref>, we identified in the ground truth topology of this network all occurrences of <italic>shared source motifs</italic>, i.e. motifs in which a node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was connected to a node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and to a node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) but in which there was no direct connection between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the reconstructed as well as the ground truth topology. Such a motif might be harmful for reconstruction, because the existence of a shared input <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> might be mistaken for a reciprocal causal interaction between nodes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Nevertheless, only in a minority of cases (about 20%), spurious links <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where erroneously included in our reconstruction. Equivalently, in the case of embedded chains, i.e. motifs in which a node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is connected to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, connected on its turn to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, without a direct link from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the presence of a link <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (reflecting potentially indirect causation, mistaken for direct) was erroneously inferred only in, once again, about 20% of cases. Note that other studies have investigated the performance of various metrics in the reconstruction of specific small network motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Gourvitch1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Quinn1">[67]</xref>, but it is not clear that the efficiency of reconstruction quantified for such small networks continues to hold when these motifs are embedded in larger networks with hundreds of nodes or more.</p>
          <p>Good reconstruction of higher-order topological features is important since these features (like e.g. the tendency of existing links to form chains) are known to affect the synchronizability of networks, as stressed by a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Zhao1">[68]</xref>. Our algorithm was not specifically optimized to infer higher order structures. Analyses based on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-ples rather than on pairs of nodes might lead to a better description of higher order connectivity structures, at a price, however, of a more severe sampling problem. In this sense, conditioning transition probabilities for a specific edge to the ongoing mean-field activity, constitute already a first compromise, allowing to extend the analysis beyond a mere pairwise approach.</p>

          <p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Zhao1">[68]</xref>, the role played by the fraction of bidirectional links (i.e. situations in which there is a connection <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but also a connection <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was also explored.</p>
          <p>In our case, approximately 60% of the bidirectional links present in the ground truth topology were reconstructed as bidirectional in the reconstruction of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g004">Figure 4</xref>. However, this reconstruction exhibited as well a severe overestimation of the number of bidirectional links. Unidirectional in the ground-truth topology were more difficult to detect, such as only 4% of them were ranked among the top 10% of TE scores. Furthermore, when such unidirectional links <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were reconstructed, the presence of a link <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was also in most of the cases (85%) spuriously inferred, i.e. included unidirectional links were often mistaken for bidirectional links.</p>
          <p>It is likely that an improvement in the inference of directionality might be achieved by increasing the time-resolution of the recordings beyond the present limits of calcium imaging techniques.</p>

        <title>Functional connectivity hubs</title>
        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3</xref> for simulated data and in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s003">Figure S3</xref> for actual culture data, epochs of synchronous bursting are associated to functional connectivity with a stronger degree of clustering and a weaker overlap with the underlying structural topology. This feature of functional connectivity is tightly related to the spatio-temporal organization of the synchronous bursts.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s002">Figure S2A</xref>, we highlight the position of selected nodes (of the simulated network considered in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3</xref>), characterized by an above-average in-degree of functional connectivity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref> for a detailed definition in terms of TE scores). We denote these nodes —different in general for each of the dynamic regimes numbered from I to VII— as (state-dependent) <italic>functional connectivity hubs</italic>.</p>
        <p>Given a specific hub, we can then define the community of its first neighbors in the corresponding functional network. Consistently across all dynamic ranges (but the noise-dominated range I) we find that synchronization within each of these functional communities is significantly stronger than between the communities centered on different hubs ((<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Mann-Whitney test, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). The results of this comparison are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s002">Figure S2B</xref>, showing particularly marked excess synchronization during burst build-up (ranges II, III and IV) or just prior to burst waning in the largest-size bursts (VII). Therefore, functional connectivity hubs reflect foci of enhanced local bursting synchrony.</p>
        <p>Other studies (in brain slices) reported evidence of functional connectivity hubs, whose direct stimulation elicited a strong synchronous activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Morgan1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Bonifazi1">[70]</xref>. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Morgan1">[69]</xref>, the functional hubs were also structural hubs. In the case of our networks, however only functional hubs associated to ranges II and III have an in-degree (and out-degree) larger than average as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Morgan1">[69]</xref>. In the other dynamic ranges, this tight correspondence between structural and functional hubs does not hold anymore. Nevertheless, in all dynamic ranges (but range I), we find that pairs of functional hubs have an approximately three-times larger chance of being structurally connected than pairs of arbitrarily selected nodes (not shown).</p>
        <p>The timing of firing of these strong-synchrony communities is analyzed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s002">Figure S2C</xref>. There we show that the average time of bursting of functional communities for different dynamic ranges is shifted relatively to the average bursting time over the entire network (details of the estimation are provided in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). This temporal shift is negative for the ranges II and III (indicating that functional hubs and related communities fire on average <italic>earlier</italic> than the rest of the culture) and positive for the ranges V to VII (indicating that firing of these communities occurs on average <italic>later</italic> than the rest of the culture). The highest negative time delay is detected in range III, such that the communities organized around its associated functional hubs can be described as local burst initiation cores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Eytan2">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Eckmann3">[72]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Purely excitatory networks</title>
        <p>In this study we did not consider inhibitory interactions, neither in simulations nor in experiments (GABAergic transmission was blocked), but we attempted uniquely the reconstruction of excitatory connectivity.</p>
        <p>We would like to point out that this is not a general limitation of TE, since the applicability of TE does not rely on assumptions as to the specific nature of a given causal relationship – for instance about whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory. In this sense, TE can be seen as a measure for the <italic>absolute</italic> strength of a causal interaction, and is able in principle to capture the effects on dynamics of both inhibitory and excitatory connections. Note indeed that previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Ito1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Garofalo2">[56]</xref> have used TE to infer as well the presence of inhibitory connections. However, TE alone could not discriminate the sign of the interaction and additional <italic>post-hoc</italic> considerations had to be made in order to separate the retrieved connections into separate excitatory and inhibitory subgroups (e.g., in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Ito1">[39]</xref>, based on the supposedly known existence of a difference in relative strength between excitatory and inhibitory conductances).</p>

          <title>A simpler complex problem</title>
          <p>By focusing on excitatory connectivity only, our intention was to simplify the full problem of network reconstruction, aiming as a first step to uncover systematically the strongest excitatory links in the network. Such simplification allows indeed to remove potential causes of error, like, e.g. disynaptic inhibition or synchronous excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a same cell, that might result in failed inference of both the excitatory and the inhibitory connections. Nonetheless, this simpler problem remains very difficult because we attempt to reconstruct not only few connections but an entire adjacency matrix for the excitatory subnetwork.</p>

          <title>Excitation shapes spontaneous activity</title>
          <p>The inference of excitatory connectivity is by itself a very relevant issue. Excitatory recurrent connections are indeed a strong —if not the main— determinant of spontaneous activity. They act as an “amplifier”, propagating to the network locally generated firing, and guaranteeing thus that the level of spontaneous activity of the culture remains elevated. Furthermore, modeling studies (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Levina1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Levina2">[73]</xref>) suggest that excitatory connections only are sufficient to obtain network bursts with experimentally observed statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Beggs1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Mazzoni1">[75]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Sharper signals</title>
          <p>Second, when moving to experimental data, neurons fire more strongly when inhibition is blocked, which makes the identification of firing occurrences more accurate. The amplitude of the fluorescence signal increases by a factor two or more when inhibition is blocked (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Jacobi1">[64]</xref>). In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s008">Figure S8B</xref> we show an example of the fluorescence signal for the same neuron, before (blue) and after (black) blocking inhibitory synaptic transmission. Therefore the reconstruction problem of purely excitatory networks becomes simpler, not really from the algorithmic side (since the algorithm is potentially ready to cope with inhibition), but rather from the experimental side, because of an improved signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, when we generate synthetic data for algorithmic benchmarking, we aim at reproducing these same optimal experimental conditions.</p>
          <p>We also note that the distribution of fluorescence values would be different for recordings with and without inhibition. Nevertheless, our method might still be applied, without need of qualitative changes, and state selection might still be performed.

          <title>A two-steps strategy?</title>
          <p>A possible strategy to extend our method to the reconstruction of inhibitory connections could be to follow a two-steps experimental approach: first, reconstruct only excitatory connectivity, based on recordings in which inhibitory transmission is blocked; and second, reconstruct only inhibitory connectivity, based on recordings in which, after the wash-out of the culture, excitatory transmission is blocked. In such an experiment, when recurrent excitation is blocked, the spontaneous level of firing activity should be restored by chemical non-synaptic activation. We note however, that although complete blockade of excitation combined with drug-induced network activation is a standard protocol in slice studies (cfr. e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Bartos1">[76]</xref>), such an approach has never been attempted in cultures of dissociated neurons.</p>
          <p>A compromise might be, therefore, to systematically compare the reconstructed connectivity before and after the wash-out of the inhibition blocker thereby collecting indirect evidence about the existence of inhibitory connection, through an analysis of the modulatory action they exert on the causal strengths of previously inferred excitatory connections.</p>

          <title>Connectivity in cultures vs. connectivity <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
          <p>We have here used our current TE algorithm to the inference of connectivity from calcium fluorescence recordings of <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured networks of dissociated cortical neurons. However, such studies of cultures do not yield direct information about the connectivity of cortical tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>. Several factors contribute to shape the neuronal circuits in an intact living brain, including the adequate orientation of neurons, dendrites, and axons, the biochemical guidance of processes towards their targets, and the refinement of circuitry through activity. Ultimately, development leads to a complex cortical structure organized both in layers and in columns, and with many particular topological features such as clusters or hierarchical organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Gong1">[5]</xref>.</p>
          <p>All these structures —which are preserved in slices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Perin1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Song1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Lefort1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Stepanyants1">[78]</xref> — are completely lost during the dissociation of the embryonic brain that precedes the preparation of <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures. Neuronal cultures form new connections “from scratch”, with a combination of short and long length connections, leading to circuits that have orders of magnitude less neurons and synapses.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, understanding how neurons wire together spontaneously in a controlled medium is also of utmost importance, because it allows separating endogenous and exogenous driving components of neuronal wiring. Furthermore, cultures and slices share similar spontaneous bursting dynamics. If this observation alone should not be used to support the existence of shared topological features (cfr. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g002">Figure 2</xref>), it is true that the self-organization principles underlying the development of networks up to a bursting dynamical state may be common in all living neuronal networks.</p>

          <title>Calcium imaging vs. multielectrode arrays</title>
          <p>Our algorithm has been optimized for the application to real calcium imaging data, by determining an optimal conditioning range based only on qualitative features of the distribution of the average fluorescence in the network (very similar for synthetic and real data). Other studies have however used electrophysiological recordings from cultures grown on multielectrode arrays (MEAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Eckmann1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Erickson1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Marom1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Wagenaar1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Beggs1">[74]</xref> as a basis for their topology reconstruction strategies (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Ito1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Garofalo2">[56]</xref>).</p>
          <p>MEAs provide excellent temporal resolution and, to a certain extent, also the possibility to resolve individual spikes. However, MEAs have a limited number of electrodes and often neurons are not precisely positioned on an electrode but at its vicinity, which requires complex processing of the data to identify the source of a given spike. Additionally, the electrodes have to be in contact or embedded into the neuronal tissue, limiting its use to mostly cultures and brain slices.</p>
          <p>Calcium imaging, in contrast, offers important advantages. First, the technique provides access to the activity of thousands of neurons in large fields of view for several hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Feinerman1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Soriano1">[14]</xref>, and with a time resolution proven to be sufficient for reconstruction in the present study. Second, calcium imaging with superior temporal and spatial resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Grienberger1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Takano1">[79]</xref> is a technique that combines perfectly with new breakthroughs in experimental neuroscience, particularly optogenetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Yizhar1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Knpfel1">[80]</xref> and genetically encoded calcium indicators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Knpfel1">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Hires1">[81]</xref>, technologies that are under expansion both <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Li2">[82]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Buchen1">[83]</xref>. Our reconstruction method can promptly be readapted for the analysis of other calcium imaging datasets.

          <p>As a matter of fact, extended TE might even be applied to multielectrode array data with very few modifications, along lines analogous to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Ito1">[39]</xref>.

Furthermore, cortical developmental processes strongly dictate <italic>in vivo</italic> (and slice) connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Price1">[88]</xref>, while a larger freedom to establish connections exist potentially in cultures <italic>in vitro</italic>. The growth process and the final length of the processes depend not only on the density of the culture and the population of glia, but also on the chemical properties of the substrate where neurons and process grow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-GrumbacherReinert1">[89]</xref>. The lack of restrictions during the development of neuronal processes (axons and dendrites) leads to longer axonal lengths in the culture on average, explaining the high connection distance obtained in the reconstruction.</p>
          <p>Such long axons in cultures have been reported in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Erickson1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Kriegstein1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Feinerman2">[90]</xref>, providing broad distributions of lengths with an average value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Using Green Fluorescence Protein transfection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Zeitelhofer1">[91]</xref>, we have directly visualized axonal processes as long as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in cultures of comparable age and density to the ones that we used for the fluorescence imaging recordings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s008">Figure S8C</xref>). Such long axons would be required to mediate the long-range causal interactions captured by the TE analysis. As a matter of fact, as revealed by the randomization of the reconstructed connectivity, long average connection lengths might simply be expected to exist as a result of the bi-dimensional distribution of neurons on a substrate in combination with long individual axonal lengths (i.e. spanning the entire field of view).</p>
          <p>For a younger culture at 9 DIV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s007">Figure S7</xref>), on the other hand, we retrieved a probability of connection at short distances higher than expected from randomized networks. This over-connectivity at short distances can be ascribed to the fact that young cultures have less developed axons and therefore a connectivity favored towards closer neurons. However, more exhaustive studies —going beyond the scope of the present work— would be needed to assess the full dependence of reconstructed network topology on culture age, neuronal density and spatial distribution, as well as on connection length.</p>

          <title>Evidence for moderate clustering</title>
          <p>Our TE-based analysis suggest an enhanced tendency to clustering of connections in the analyzed neuronal cultures. Indeed, although the average clustering coefficient is moderated, it is significantly higher than what might be expected based on randomized networks.</p>
          <p>Neurons in culture aggregate during growth, giving rise to fluctuations in neuronal density. Since denser areas in the culture have been reported to have a higher connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Soriano1">[14]</xref>, some level of clustering is naturally expected in the real network, as detected by the reconstruction. We could not however identify in our reconstructed topology a statistically significant correlation between the local density of neurons —quantified by the number of cells within a radius of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> centered on each given neuron— and the local degree of clustering (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for both considered cultures).</p>
          <p>This finding suggests the existence of a mixture of local and non-local clustering in the culture and indicates that network clustering in a sparse culture is not a mere byproduct of the inhomogeneous density of cells, but might reflect activity-dependent mechanisms for synaptic wiring.</p>

          <title>No evidence for scale free connectivity</title>
          <p>Despite the observation that the distribution of degrees inferred by TE is characteristically broadened and has a conspicuous right tail, we have found no evidence of a scale free degree distribution (i.e. following a power-law <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Barabsi1">[92]</xref>). A similar conclusion was also reached for cultured neuronal networks in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Srinivas1">[93]</xref>.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, studies like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Pajevic1">[42]</xref> hinted at a large overlap in cultures between the structural connectivity and the retrieved scale free functional connectivity, meeting other studies that identified power-law degree distributions in the functional connectivity of cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Eytan1">[46]</xref> or of slices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Bonifazi1">[70]</xref>.</p>
          <p>Whether connectivity in neural networks, <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> can be characterized as scale free or not is a highly debated issue (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Kaiser2">[94]</xref>), and, especially for self-organized networks of dissociated neurons, it is likely to depend on details of how the culture is grown. The connectivity retrieved from our calcium recordings might possibly be better described as “small-world” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Watts1">[95]</xref>, due to the existence of hub nodes with very high out- and in-degree.

          <title>How reliable are absolute values of reconstructed properties?</title>
          <p>Through our reconstructions of culture connectivity, we have provided actual absolute values for properties such as average degree, average clustering or average connection length. We note that such estimates are affected by a large uncertainty that goes beyond the variability described by their reconstructed distributions. Indeed, these estimates come from a reconstruction based on a specific choice of the number of links to include. This choice, as highlighted by <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s001">Figure S1</xref> for synthetic data, corresponds to selecting directly a specific value of the average culture in- and out-degree. Therefore, as previously discussed, the included link number should be determined by our expectations on the average degree of the network to reconstruct, based on independent experimental evidence or on extrinsic guiding hypotheses.</p>
          <p>The inference of average clustering or of average distance is robust even against relatively large mistakes in the initial guess for the average degree (see e.g. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s001">Figure S1</xref>, for clustering estimation). In the case of the DIV 12 network reconstructed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g008">Figure 8</xref>, doubling the threshold of included links from 5% to 10% (and therefore adopting a twice as large guess for the average culture degree) changes the inference for the average clustering coefficient from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the average connection distance from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>m. Nevertheless, the precise values obtained do depend on the number of reconstructed links.</p>
          <p>Due to the lack of information, a better strategy might be, rather than focusing on absolute estimated values, to focus on comparisons with fully and partially randomized networks with analogous average degree or degree distribution, respectively. Such comparisons indeed can convey qualitative information about the occurrence of non-trivial deviations from chance expectations, which are likely to be more reliable than quantitative assessments.</p>

        <title>Conclusions and perspectives</title>
        <p>In summary, we have developed a new generalization of Transfer Entropy for inferring connectivity in neuronal networks based on fluorescence calcium imaging data. Our new formalism goes beyond previous approaches by introducing two key ingredients, namely the inclusion of <italic>same bin</italic> interactions and the separation of dynamical states through <italic>conditioning</italic> of the fluorescence signal. We have thoroughly tested our formalism in a number of simulated neuronal architectures, and later applied it to extract topological features of real, cultured cortical neurons.</p>
        <p>We expect that, in the future, algorithmic approaches to network reconstruction, and in particular our own method, will play a pivotal role in unravelling not only topological features of neuronal circuits, but also in providing a better understanding of the circuitry underlying neuronal function. These theoretical and numerical tools may well work side by side with new state-of-the-art techniques (such as optogenetics or high-speed two-photon imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Grinvald1">[96]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Bernstein1">[100]</xref>) that will enable direct large-scale reconstructions of living neuronal networks. Our Transfer Entropy formalism is highly versatile and could be applied to the analysis of <italic>in vivo</italic> voltage-sensitive dye recordings with virtually no modifications.</p>
        <p>On a shorter time-scale, it would be important to extend our analysis to the reconstruction of both excitatory and inhibitory connectivity in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, which is technically feasible, and to compare diverse network characteristics, such as neuronal density or aggregation. Our algorithm could be used to systematically reconstruct the connectivity of cultures at different development stages in the quest for understanding the switch from local to global neuronal dynamics. Another crucial open issue is to design suitable experimental protocols allowing to confirm the existence of at least some of the inferred synaptic links, in order to validate statistically the reconstructed connectivity. For instance, the actual presence of directed links to which our algorithm assigns the largest TE scores might be systematically probed through targeted paired electrophysiological stimulation and recording. Furthermore, GFP transfection or inmunostaining might be used to obtain actual, precise anatomical data on network architecture to be compared with the reconstructed one. Finally, it might be interesting to reconstruct connectivity of cultured networks before and after physical disconnection of different areas of the culture (e.g. by mechanical etching of the substrate or by chemical silencing). These manipulations would provide a scenario to verify whether TE-based reconstructions correctly capture the absence of direct connections between areas of the neuronal network which are known to be artificially segregated.</p>

        <p>We generated synthetic networks with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> neurons, distributed randomly over a squared area of 0.5 mm lateral size. We chose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the connection probability between neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Wen1">[48]</xref>, leading to sparse connectivities similar to those observed in local cortical circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Song1">[53]</xref>. We used non-periodic boundary conditions to reproduce eventual “edge” effects that arise from the anisotropic cell density at the boundaries of the culture.</p>
        <p>We considered two general types of networks: (i) a <italic>locally-clustered ensemble</italic>, where the probability of connection depended on the spatial distance between two neurons; and (ii) a <italic>non-locally clustered ensemble</italic>, with the connections engineered to display a certain degree of clustering.</p>
        <p>For the case of a non-local clustering ensemble, we first created a sparse connectivity matrix, randomly generating links with a homogeneous probability of connection across pairs of neurons. We next selected a random pairs of links and “crossed” them (links <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> became <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). We accepted only those changes that updated the clustering index in the direction of a desired target value, thereby maintaining the number of incoming as well as outgoing connections of each neuron. The crossing process was iterated until a clustering index higher or equal to the target value was reached. The overall procedure led to a full clustering index of the reference random network of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (mean and standard deviation, respectively, across 6 networks).

        <p>Note that we defined a network burst to occur when more than 40% of the neurons in the network were active within a time window of 50 ms. Such a criterion does not play any role in the reconstruction algorithm itself, where state selection is achieved through conditioning, but is only used for the automated generation of random networks with a prescribed bursting rate. Typically, for a fully developed burst, more than 90% of the neurons fire within a 50 ms bin, while, during inter-burst intervals, less than 10% do. Due to the clear separation between these two regimes, our burst detection procedure does not depend significantly on the precise choice of threshold within a broad interval.</p>

        <p>TE can be seen as the distance in probability space (known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-MacKay1">[109]</xref>) between the “single node” transition matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the “two nodes” transition matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As expected from a distance measure, TE is zero if and only if the two transition matrices are identical, i.e. if transitions of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> do not depend statistically on past values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and is greater than zero otherwise, signaling dependence of the transition dynamics of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>We use TE to evaluate the directed functional connectivity between different network nodes. In a pre-processing step, we apply a basic discrete differentiation operator to calcium fluorescence time series <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as a rather crude way to isolate potential spike events. Thus, given a network node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e209" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we define <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e210" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This pre-processing step also improves the signal-to-noise ratio, thus allowing for a better sampling of probability distributions with a limited number of data points. To adapt TE to our particular problem we need to take into account the general characteristics of the system. We therefore modified TE in two crucial aspects:</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>We take into account that the synaptic time constants of the neuronal network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e211" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are much shorter than the acquisition times of the recording (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e212" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). We therefore need to account for “same bin” causal interactions between nodes, i.e. between events that fall in the same time-bin. Slower interactions with longer lags are still taken into account by evaluating TE for a Markov order larger than one (in time-bins units).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>We consider the possibility that the network dynamics switches between multiple dynamical states, i.e. between bursting and inter-bursting regimes. These regimes are characterized by different mean rates of activity and, potentially, by different transition matrices. Hence, we have to restrict the evaluation of TE to time ranges in which the network is consistently in a single dynamical state. The separation of dynamical states can be achieved by introducing a variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e213" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the average signal of the whole network,</p>

        </p>
        <p>We then include all data points at time instants in which this average fluorescence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e215" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is below a predefined threshold parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e216" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. we consider only the time points that fulfill <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e217" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We only make an exception that corresponds to the simulations of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s002">Figure S2</xref>, where we considered time points that fall within an interval bounded by a higher and a lower thresholds, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e218" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>Using these two novel aspects, we have extended the original description of Transfer Entropy [<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002653.e191">Eq. (9)</xref>] to the following form<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002653.e219"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e219" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula></p>
        <p>Probability distributions have to be evaluated as discrete histograms. Hence, the continuous range of fluorescence values (see e.g. the bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g001">Figure 1</xref>) is quantized into a finite number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e220" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of discrete levels. We typically used a small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e221" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a value that we justify based on the observation that the resulting bin width <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is close to twice the standard deviation of the signal. The presence of large fluctuations, most likely associated to spiking events, is then still captured by such a coarse, almost non-parametric description of fluorescence levels.</p>

        <title>Network reconstruction</title>
        <p>Generalized TE values are obtained for every possible directed pair of network nodes, and using a fixed threshold level <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The set of TE scores are then ranked in ascending order and scaled to fall in the unit range. A threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is then applied to the rescaled data, so that only those links with scores above <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are retained in the reconstructed network.</p>
        <p>A standard <italic>Receiver-Operator Characteristic</italic> (ROC) analysis is used to assess the quality of the reconstruction by evaluating the number of true positives (reconstructed links that are present in the actual network) or false positives (not present), and for different threshold values <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Fawcett1">[110]</xref>. The highest threshold value leads to zero reconstructed links and therefore zero true positives and false positives. At the other extreme, the lowest threshold provides both 100% of true positives and false positives. Intermediate thresholds give rise to a smooth curve of true/false positives as a function of the threshold. The performance of the reconstruction is then measured as the degree of deviation of this curve from the diagonal, and that corresponds to a random choice of connections between neurons.</p>
        <p>To provide a simple method to compare different reconstructions, we arbitrarily use the quantity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e227" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, defined as the fraction of true positives for a 10% of false positives, as indicator for the quality of the reconstruction.</p>
        <p>An alternative to the ROC is the <italic>Positive Prediction Curve</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Garofalo2">[56]</xref>, plotting the “true-false ratio” (TFR) against the number of reconstructed links, called “true-false sum” (TFS).

        <title>Hubs of (causal) connectivity</title>
        <p>Connectivity in reconstructed networks is often inhomogeneous, and groups of nodes with tighter internal connectivity are sometimes visually apparent (see e.g. reconstructed topologies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We do not attempt a systematic reconstruction of network communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Fortunato1">[111]</xref>, but we limit ourselves to the detection of “causal sink” nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Seth1">[112]</xref>, which have a larger than average in-degree. We define this property in terms of the sum of TE from all other nodes to one particular node (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e249" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), choosing the top 20 nodes for each particular network as selected “hub nodes”.</p>
        <p>We then analyze the dynamics of these selected hub nodes and of their neighbors.

We analyze then the cross-correlogram of the average fluorescence of a given group <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e251" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with the average fluorescence of the whole culture:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002653.e252"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e252" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(18)</label></disp-formula>The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e253" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-notation indicates that we correlate discretely differentiated average fluorescence time series, rather than the average time series themselves.

        <p>The culture was washed off Fluo-4 after incubation and finally placed in a chamber filled with fresh recording medium. The chamber was mounted on a Zeiss inverted microscope equipped with a 5× objective and a 0.4× optical zoom.</p>
        <p>Neuronal activity was monitored through high-speed fluorescence imaging using a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 2.8 CMOS camera attached to the microscope. Images were acquired at a speed of 100 frames/s (i.e. 10 ms between two consecutive frames), which were later converted to a 20 ms resolution using a sliding window average to match the typical temporal resolution of such recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Feinerman1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Vogelstein1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Mishchencko1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Feinerman2">[90]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Sasaki1">[114]</xref>.

This settings provided a final field of view of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e276" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that contained on the order of 2000 neurons.</p>
        <p>Activity was finally recorded as a long image sequence of 60 minutes in duration. We verified that the fluorescence signal remained stable during the recording, as shown in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s008">Figure S8A</xref>, and we did not observe neither photo-bleaching of the calcium probe nor photo-damage of the neurons.</p>
        <p>Before the beginning of the experiment, inhibitory synapses were fully blocked with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e277" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bicuculline, a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e278" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> antagonist, so that activity was solely driven by excitatory neurons.</p>
        <p>Since cultures were studied after GABA switch, the blockade of inhibition resulted in an increase of the fluorescence amplitude, which facilitated the detection of neuronal firing, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s008">Figure S8B</xref>.</p>
        <p>The image sequence was analyzed at the end of the experiment to identify all active neurons, which were marked as regions of interest (ROIs) on the images. The average grey-level on each ROI along the complete sequence finally provided, for each neuron, the fluorescence intensity as a function of time. Each sequence typically contained on the order of a hundred bursts.</p>

        <title>Analysis of experimental recordings</title>
        <p>The fluorescence data obtained from recordings of neuronal cultures was analyzed following exactly the same procedures used for simulated data (e.g. processed in a pipeline including discrete differentiation, TE or other metrics evaluation, ranking, and final thresholding to maintain the top 10% of connections).</p>
        <p>Due to the lack of knowledge of the ground-truth topology, optimal conditioning level cannot be known. However, based on the similarity between experimental and simulated distributions of calcium fluorescence, we select a conditioning level such to exclude the high fluorescence transients associated to fully-developed bursting transients while keeping as many data points as possible. Concretely, this is achieved by taking a conditioning level equal to approximately two standard deviations above the mean of a Gaussian fit to the left peak of the fluorescence histogram. Such a level coincides with the point where, when gradually increasing the conditioning level, the reconstructed clustering index reaches a plateau, i.e. matches indicatively the upper limit of range II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g003">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
        <p>To check for robustness of our reconstruction, we generated alternative reconstructions based on different conditioning levels. For the selected conditioning value, and for both the experimental datasets analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002653.s007">S7</xref>), we verified that the inferred topological features, including notably the average clustering coefficient and connection distance, were stable in a range centered on the selected conditioning value and wide as much as approximately two standard deviations of the fluorescence distribution.</p>
        <p>To identify statistically significant non-random features of the real cultured networks in exam, we compared the reconstructed topology to two randomizations.</p>
        <p>A first one consisted in a complete randomization that preserved only the total number of connections in the network, but scrambled completely the source and target nodes. The resulting random ensemble of graphs was an Erdös-Rényi ensemble (see, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Newman1">[62]</xref>) in which each possible link exists with a uniform probability of connection <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e279" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e280" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of connections in the reference reconstructed network.</p>
        <p>A second partial randomization preserved the in-degree distributions only, and was implemented by shuffling the entries of each row of the reconstructed adjacency matrix, internally row-by-row. In this way, the out-degrees of each node were preserved. In both randomization processes, we disallowed diagonal entries.</p>
        <p>For both randomizations we calculated the in-degree, the distance of connections and the full clustering index for each node, leading to distributions of network topology features that could be compared between the reconstructed network and the randomized ensembles, to identify significant deviations from random expectancy.</p>

          <p><bold>Dependence of performance on characteristic length scale, conditioning level and light scattering.</bold> The color panels show the overall reconstruction performance level, quantified by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e281" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (black, 0% true positives; white, 100% true positives), for different target ground-truth clustering coefficients and as a function of the used conditioning level. Five different reconstruction algorithms are compared: cross-correlation (XC), Granger Causality (GC) with order <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e282" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Mutual Information (MI), and Transfer Entropy (TE) with Markov orders <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e283" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The top row corresponds to simulations without artifacts, and the bottom row to simulations including light scattering. TE of order <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e284" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and with light scattering provides a fair reconstruction quality at any length scale for a conditioning value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002653.e285" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

A definition of positive prevision curves is provided in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>, following Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002653-Garofalo2">[56]</xref>. The plots show the “true-false ratio” (TFR) as a function of the “true-false sum” (TFS), i.e. the number of reconstructed links, and indirectly describe the likelihood that an included link is actual true positive. Positive values correspond to a larger number of true than false positives among the reconstructed links. Similarly to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, only generalized TE including both same-bin interactions and optimal conditioning robustly displays positive values of TFR in a broad range of TFS. Note that a threshold of 10% top links (used for example at the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002653-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), provides a TFS value of 990. Shaded areas are 95% confidence intervals across 6 networks.</p>
