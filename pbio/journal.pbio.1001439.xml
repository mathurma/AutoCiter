        <p>Growth cone localization of <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA switches the classic function of MKK7 protein in transcriptional control to regulation of microtubules necessary for neuronal outgrowth.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Local mRNA translation in neurons has been mostly studied during axon guidance and synapse formation but not during initial neurite outgrowth. We performed a genome-wide screen for neurite-enriched mRNAs and identified an mRNA that encodes mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) for Jun kinase (JNK). We show that <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localizes to the growth cone where it has the potential to be translated. MKK7 is then specifically phosphorylated in the neurite shaft, where it is part of a MAP kinase signaling module consisting of dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), MKK7, and JNK1. This triggers Map1b phosphorylation to regulate microtubule bundling leading to neurite elongation. We propose a model in which <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization and translation in the growth cone allows for a mechanism to position JNK signaling in the neurite shaft and to specifically link it to regulation of microtubule bundling. At the same time, this uncouples activated JNK from its functions relevant to nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>MRNA transcripts are usually translated into proteins in the cytosol. Some mRNAs, however, are first transported to specific subcellular regions where they are translated to perform localized functions. This is especially important in highly polarized cells such as neurons. Here, we find that a transcript encoding the signaling molecule mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) localizes to the growth cone of neuronal processes, where it most likely is translated. This is surprising, because MKK7 has been linked to activation of transcription in the nucleus in response to cellular insults. We find that growth cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA transcript localization, and potentially its translation at this subcellular localization, allows the MKK7 protein to switch its function and regulate the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is necessary for neuronal outgrowth. This occurs through the formation of a spatially regulated MKK7 signaling domain in the neurite that performs this highly specialized function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Local mRNA targeting and translation is an important aspect of the regulation of axonal guidance and the remodeling of synapses in the nervous system. In axons, local translation of β-<italic>actin</italic> mRNA has been implicated in growth cone turning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Holt1">[1]</xref>. Local translation of <italic>RhoA</italic> mRNA regulates axonal growth cone collapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Wu1">[2]</xref>. Local translation of the transcription factors ELK at the synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Barrett1">[3]</xref> and CREB in the axon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Cox1">[4]</xref> allows for retrograde signaling between these organelles and the nucleus. Local mRNA translation is also observed in response to neuronal injury. In this context, local translation of <italic>Stat3</italic> mRNA, and its subsequent retrograde shuttling to the nucleus induces survival signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-BenYaakov1">[5]</xref>. A combination of gene expression profiling and neuronal process purification techniques, has unveiled complex local transcriptomes that depend on the neurite identity (axon/dendrite) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Jung1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Cajigas1">[9]</xref>, the differentiation state (young versus old axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Zivraj1">[10]</xref>) and on neurite injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Gumy1">[11]</xref>. This suggests that a large variety of local translational programs regulate distinct neuronal functions depending on specific cellular states during development. However, local mRNA targeting and translation has not yet been explored during the initial process of neurite outgrowth, before axon-dendrite specification.</p>
      <p>Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1–3) are a subgroup of mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs) that control transcriptional programs and the neuronal cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Weston1">[12]</xref>. While JNKs were originally considered to regulate neuronal survival or death in response to stress and injury, significant JNK activity is maintained in neurons even in the absence of stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Coffey1">[13]</xref>. Consistently, it recently became clear that JNKs are essential regulators of neurite growth and regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Waetzig1">[14]</xref>. In this context, JNKs have been implicated in the regulation of microtubule (mt) dynamics through phosphorylation of a variety of proteins. JNKs phosphorylate and regulate mt-associated proteins (MAPs), consequently, JNK1-deficient mice display loss of axonal mt integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Chang1">[15]</xref>. JNKs phosphorylate the catastrophy promoting factors stathmins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Ng1">[16]</xref> and the protein SCG10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Tararuk1">[17]</xref>, which exhibits mt depolymerizing activity. JNKs also phosphorylate doublecortins to modulate neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Gdalyahu1">[18]</xref>. Finally, JNKs have also been implicated in the regulation of axonal specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Oliva1">[19]</xref>, which might be regulated by the JNK scaffold protein (JNK interacting protein 1 [JIP1]) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-DajasBailador1">[20]</xref>. The three JNK isoforms are directly phosphorylated and controlled by two MAP kinase kinase (MAP2Ks), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 and 7 (MKK4 and MKK7, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Haeusgen1">[21]</xref>), which are also known to be phosphorylated during neurite outgrowth of cerebellar granule neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Coffey1">[13]</xref>. Further upstream, these MAP2Ks can in turn be phosphorylated by a wide variety of MAP3Ks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Haeusgen1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Gallo1">[22]</xref>. While it is clear that JNKs are essential for the control of neuronal mts, the molecular details of how the JNK signaling network is spatio-temporally wired to control distinct (and sometimes opposing) mt regulating activities versus nuclear translocation and regulation of transcriptional responses remains unknown.</p>
      <p>Here we perform a genome-wide screen and identify 80 mRNAs that are significantly enriched in neurites of N1E-115 neuronal-like cells. We identify the neurite-enriched <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA, which localizes to growth cones, where it most likely is translated, and subsequently activated in the neurite shaft through phosphorylation. We propose a model in which growth cone localization of <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA, and possibly its translation at this subcellular localization triggers a spatio-temporal JNK signaling module in the neurite to specifically regulate mt bundling and neurite elongation.</p>

        <title>Genome-wide Screen Identifies mRNAs That Localize to the Growth Cone</title>
        <p>To identify on a genome-wide scale neurite-localized mRNAs during neuronal outgrowth, we used our previously described microporous filter technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Pertz1">[23]</xref> to fractionate neurites from the soma of N1E-115 neuronal-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar approaches have been previously used to study local mRNA translation in dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Torre1">[24]</xref>. In this model system, differentiated N1E-115 cells are plated on a 3-µm microporous filter that has been coated with laminin on the bottom part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This leads to neurite outgrowth to the bottom filter surface, allowing biochemical separation of neurites from the soma. Total RNA from purified neurite and soma equivalents was analyzed by Affymetrix gene chip technology to quantitate relative mRNA abundance. This revealed 80 mRNAs that are significantly enriched in the neurite fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s021">Table S1</xref>), and encode a wide variety of different functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To validate the enrichment of mRNAs in the neurite, we used quantitative PCR coupled with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) to compare relative mRNA abundance in both fractions and observed similar results as for the gene chip experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We also explored the localization of a panel of these neurite-enriched mRNAs using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments in N1E-115 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g001">Figures 1D, 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s001">S1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s001">S1B</xref>). While some mRNA is present in the soma, these mRNAs predominantly localized to bright punctate structures in growth cones, suggesting association with ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Kiebler1">[25]</xref>. Soma-enriched transcripts consisted mostly of small nucleolar RNAs. FISH showed that such a non-coding RNA, <italic>Snord15b</italic>, specifically localized to the soma and was absent from the growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Because β<italic>-actin</italic> mRNA was previously documented to be localized in neuronal growth cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Holt1">[1]</xref>, but was not found in our genome-wide screen, we also evaluated its subcellular localization in N1E-115 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). While β<italic>-actin</italic> mRNA was evident in growth cones, the bulk of the mRNA was in the soma. Thus, our purification approach, which relies on relative comparison of mRNA levels in purified neurite and soma equivalents, will only detect transcripts that are robustly enriched in the neurite, but will miss mRNAs of which only a small portion of the total pool localizes to the growth cone. The control sense FISH probes for all these transcripts exhibited very little signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s001">Figure S1C</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s001">S1H</xref>).</p>

        <title>MKK7 Activates a Spatio-Temporal JNK Signaling Module in the Neurite Shaft</title>
        <p>We chose to further study the functional significance of growth cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization. As a first approach, we evaluated the subcellular localization of total MKK7 protein (tMKK7) and its activated, phosphorylated form (pMKK7). In N1E-115 cells, tMKK7 displayed a cytosolic subcellular location and was excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, upper row). In contrast, pMKK7 was observed predominantly in the neurite shaft and exhibited a decreasing gradient from the base of the neurite to the growth cone, with a very sharp loss of pMKK7 at the base of the neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g002">Figures 2A</xref>, middle row, and quantitated in 2B and S2A). This striking subcellular pMKK7 pattern was observed in 84.8%±3.1% of cells observed (<italic>n</italic> = 2 experiments with 50 cells counted in each experiment). A small pMKK7 pool was also significantly enriched in filopodia, but to a much lower extent than in the neurite shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom row). Western blot analysis of biochemically purified neurite and soma fractions also revealed an increase of pMKK7 in the neurite, while tMKK7 was equally distributed in both fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the phosphorylated form of the other JNK-specific MAPKK MKK4 (pMKK4) was found to display a distinct distribution than pMKK7, being high in the soma and the growth cone and decreasing in the neurite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s003">Figure S3A</xref>).</p>

        <p>To further understand the role of MKK7 in neurite outgrowth, we compared pMKK7, tMKK7, and <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA levels and subcellular localization in non-differentiated (e.g., cells without neurites) and differentiated N1E-115 cells. Western blot analysis revealed an increase in pMKK7 level concomitant with differentiation while tMKK7 remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Immunostaining revealed that this raise in pMKK7 resulted exclusively from the neurite localized pMKK7 pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In both cases, tMKK7 was excluded from the nucleus. At the transcript level, <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA was found throughout the cytosol of non-differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). During differentiation, 53%±3% (<italic>n</italic> = 23 cells) of <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA RNPs relocalized to the growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Globally, these results show that there is an increase of pMKK7 level associated with cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth. This pMKK7 pool specifically localizes to the neurite, and might therefore regulate cytoskeletal rather than nuclear functions. At the same time, this correlates with a redistribution of <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA from the cytosol to the growth cone.</p>
        <p>We then evaluated the signaling events downstream of MKK7, and observed activation of JNKs in the neurite. We found that total JNK (tJNK) was evenly distributed throughout the cell and excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). An antibody that detects the activated, mono-phosphorylated form of JNK isoforms 1, 2, and 3 (pJNK T183) specifically stained the neurite in an identical pattern than pMKK7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g003">Figures 3A, 3B</xref>, and quantitated in S2B). This striking subcellular pJNK T183 pattern was observed in 82.8%±1.7% of cells observed (<italic>n</italic> = 2 experiments with 50 cells counted in each experiment). In contrast, an antibody that recognizes the dually phosphorylated form of JNKs (pJNK T183Y185) prominently stained the growth cone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s003">Figures S3B</xref> and quantitated in S2C). Biochemical experiments showed that both phosphorylated JNK forms were also enriched in purified neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), and increased concomitantly with differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Beyond the ability of these JNK isoforms of being phosphorylated in the neurite, we also directly measured JNK activity in single living cells using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based reporter for JNK activation (JNKAR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Fosbrink1">[26]</xref>. We observed JNK activity throughout the neurite, including the growth cone, but not in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Time-lapse analysis showed that this neurite-localized pool of JNK activation was stable for timescales of minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s023">Video S1</xref>). A non-phosphorylatable JNKAR T/A mutant probe did not exhibit increased FRET signal in the neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>). The observation that the FRET activation pattern does not precisely recapitulate the striking pMKK7 and pJNK T183 patterns can be explained because JNKAR is a cytosolic probe that will rapidly diffuse upon phosphorylation, and because JNKAR can be phosphorylated by all JNK isoforms. These results formally show the existence of localized JNK activity in neurites.</p>

        <p>We then evaluated the subcellular localization of multiple mt-regulating JNK substrates in their phosphorylated form.

In contrast, phospho-stathmin and JNK interacting proteins (JIP1 and JIP3, scaffolds for JNK signaling) localized to growth cones and recapitulated the subcellular location of pMKK4 and pJNK T183Y185 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s003">Figure S3C</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s003">S3E</xref>).

        <title>MKK7 Controls Neurite Elongation by Regulating mt Bundling</title>
        <p>To study the function of MKK7 during neurite outgrowth, we used RNA interference to knockdown (KN) <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This led to a potent reduction in neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). To explore if this is a global cell differentiation or a specific cytoskeletal defect, we examined the cell morphology of control and <italic>MKK7</italic> KN cells. In the undifferentiated state, N1E-115 cells display flat lammelipodial protrusions that are not sensitive to <italic>MKK7</italic> KN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). During differentiation N1E-115 cells lift up, adopt a round and loosely adherent soma, and extend neurites.

        <p>We then explored which cytoskeletal defects could be the cause of this effect. Because, the signaling events downstream of MKK7 are highly likely to involve mts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Chang1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Tararuk1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Hirai1">[27]</xref>, we evaluated the mt cytoskeleton in fixed, immunostained, as well as live cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tubulin. Newly formed neurites in control cells displayed highly parallel, mt bundles. In contrast, neurites from <italic>MKK7</italic> KN cells displayed curly and bent mts that were unable to coalesce in obvious bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g004">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s025">Video S3</xref>). <italic>MKK7</italic> KN cells were able to recruit mts to the growth cone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s004">Figures S4C</xref>, quantitated in S4D) and did not display any defects in centrosome formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s004">Figure S4E and S4F</xref>, observed in all of 20 cells/condition). To exclude the possibility that frequent neurite collapse is the result of a defect in actin dynamics, we examined the F-actin cytoskeleton in growth cones. In the morphodynamic state of extension, no obvious defect was observed when F-actin density was quantitated in growth cone filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g004">Figure 4H and 4I</xref>). This was also apparent when growth cone F-actin dynamics were studied using the Lifeact-GFP probe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s026">Video S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Riedl1">[28]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We conclude that MKK7 specifically regulates mt bundling in the neurite, most likely to provide the rigidity necessary for outgrowth above a critical length. This is consistent with the idea that the JNK substrates Map1B and MAP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Chang1">[15]</xref>, which are key regulators of mt bundling, are phosphorylated in the neurite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Dehmelt1">[29]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Identification of Determinants That Allow Growth Cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA Targeting</title>
        <p>To explore the functional significance of growth cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization, we identified the determinants, often localized in 3′-UTRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Martin1">[7]</xref>, which allow mRNA targeting to the growth cone. Mapping of the <italic>MKK7</italic> locus had previously revealed that alternative splicing generates six protein-coding mRNA isoforms, leading to proteins with three different N-termini and two different C-termini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Tournier1">[30]</xref>. However, in the latter study the 3′-UTR sequences were not taken in account. The ENSEMBL database indicates the existence of two alternative 3′-UTRs, a 138-nucleotide-long 3′-UTR1, and a 2,067-nucleotide-long 3′-UTR2. The latter 3′-UTR2 sequence is generated by retention of the intron situated between exons 13 and 14, leading to insertion of a STOP codon at the end of exon 13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). As a consequence, 3-UTR2 containing mRNAs encode MKK7 isoforms with truncated C-termini. Furthermore, this also implies that the 3′-UTR1 sequence is contained within the 3′-UTR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Each of the six MKK7 isoforms contains the kinase domain, and except for the report that two specific MKK7 isoforms display different kinase activity in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Tournier1">[30]</xref>, their functional relevance remains unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Haeusgen1">[21]</xref>. In this work, we collectively refer to the six possible MKK7 protein isoforms as MKK7. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE) showed that 3′-UTR1 containing mRNAs were expressed in non-differentiated and differentiated cells (unpublished data). However, no specific probe can be produced to detect these 3′-UTR1 containing mRNA species, and it is not possible to measure their abundance in different differentiation states. Higher levels of 3′-UTR2 containing mRNAs were observed during differentiation using quantitative RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To evaluate the ability of these 3′-UTR sequences lo localize mRNA transcripts, we flanked these two sequences at the 3′ of a chimeric human β-globin construct that was previously used to study mRNA transport to fibroblast lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s005">Figure S5C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Mili1">[31]</xref>. We then exogenously expressed these constructs in N1E-115 cells, biochemically purified neurite and soma fractions, and used RT-qPCR to determine the relative enrichment of the exogenously expressed mRNAs in the neurite and the soma. We found that the 3′-UTR2 allowed enrichment of the β<italic>-globin</italic> mRNA in the neurite, while this was not observed with the 3′-UTR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s005">Figure S5D</xref>). To study the function of these two distinct 3′-UTR sequences, we engineered siRNA-resistant, GFP-tagged human MKK7 constructs that either remained unflanked, or were flanked with 3′-UTR1 or 3′-UTR2 sequences at their 3′ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We first validated the relative enrichment of the mRNAs encoded by these exogenously expressed constructs using the neurite purification assay, and observed identical results as with the β-globin constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Evaluating the subcellular localization of these chimeric mRNAs with FISH using an antisense GFP probe, yielded an additional level of complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g005">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s006">S6</xref>, soma and growth cone mRNAs highlighted by black and red arrowheads, respectively). Exogenously expressed <italic>MKK7-GFP/-</italic> mRNA solely localized to the soma. While the bulk of <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR1</italic> mRNA also localized to the cell soma, a small mRNA pool was also evident in the growth cone. By contrast, the <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR2</italic> mRNA robustly localized to the growth cone and was only marginally observed in the soma. This is consistent with our data obtained with a FISH probe recognizing endogenous transcripts containing the 3′-UTR2 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The contradicting results between our enrichment (using the neurite purification assay) and our localization measurements (using FISH) concerning the 3′-UTR sequence, can be explained because the <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR1</italic> mRNA is present both in the soma and the growth cone. Here, the large somatic mRNA pool obscures the subtle growth cone pool in neurite purification experiments in which neurite and soma mRNA equivalents are compared.</p>

        <title>Growth Cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA Localization Is Essential for Neurite Elongation, Robust mt Bundling, and Selective MKK7 and JNK T183 Phosphorylation in the Neurite</title>
        <p>We then evaluated the ability of these constructs, that allow differential <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization, to rescue MKK7 function in <italic>MKK7</italic> KN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g005">Figure 5D and 5E</xref>). While the <italic>MKK7-GFP/-</italic> mRNA was able to rescue neurite outgrowth to some extent, it could not restore the level of growth observed in control cells. However, the <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR1</italic> and <italic>3′-UTR2</italic> mRNAs fully rescued neurite outgrowth, demonstrating an important role for growth cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization in this process. This was also apparent when neurite outgrowth dynamics were evaluated. Here, rescue with <italic>MKK7-GFP/-</italic> led to less stable neurite outgrowth dynamics than with <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR1</italic> or <italic>3′-UTR2</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s027">Videos S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s028">S6</xref>). Furthermore, neurite outgrowth robustness correlated with the ability of the different constructs to rescue mt bundling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s007">Figure S7A and S7B</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR1</italic> or <italic>3′-UTR2</italic>, but not <italic>MKK7-GFP/-</italic> mRNAs, led to longer neurites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s008">Figure S8B</xref>), and assessment of MKK7 fluorescence intensities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s008">Figure S8C</xref>), revealed that all three MKK7-GFP mRNAs led to similar MKK7 protein expression levels.</p>
        <p>To understand the relative contributions of the catalytic activity of MKK7, and of the ability of <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA to localize to the growth cone, we also tested previously described constitutively active (CA) S271D T275E and inactive (CI) S271A T275A MKK7 mutants in the MKK7 KN rescue experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Takahashi1">[32]</xref>. We observed that the CA MKK7 still necessitated 3′-UTR1 or 3′-UTR2 sequences to rescue robust neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s009">Figure S9A and S9B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization provides an additional layer of regulation on top of basic MKK7 activation. CI MKK7 was not able to rescue neurite outgrowth irrespectively of the presence or absence of any 3′-UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s009">Figure S9A and S9B</xref>). This indicates that both MKK7 catalytic activity, and <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA 3′-UTR sequences are required for proper neurite elongation, and excludes the possibility of independent function of the 3′-UTRs.</p>
        <p>To functionally link these phenotypes with MKK7 signaling, we evaluated subcellular tMKK7 and pMKK7 patterns in this rescue experiment. At the total protein level, MKK7 exogenously expressed from the different mRNAs all displayed identical subcellular localization patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s008">Figure S8D</xref>). High protein levels were found in the soma (but were excluded from the nucleus), and were decreasing in the neurite towards the growth cone. Different pMKK7 subcellular patterns were however observed in response to rescue with the different constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g005">Figures 5F</xref>, quantification of fluorescence profiles in S10A, quantification of fluorescence intensities in 5G and S10B). While control cells displayed the characteristic pMKK7 pattern that is focused at the neurite base, and absent from the cell soma, MKK7 protein originating from soma-localized <italic>MKK7-GFP/-</italic> mRNA was mainly phosphorylated in the soma and exhibited only diffuse signal in the neurite. MKK7 protein originating from somatic and growth cone-localized <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR1</italic> mRNA was robustly phosphorylated at the neurite base and still to some extent in the soma. Finally, as observed in control cells, MKK7 originating from the solely growth cone-localized <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR2</italic> mRNA was exclusively phosphorylated at the neurite base as in control cells. These results show a parallel between the specific subcellular localizations of <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNAs and MKK7 protein phosphorylation, which in turn correlate with the robustness of neurite elongation. Similar results were observed when the subcellular localization of the downstream target pJNK T183 phosphosite was evaluated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s011">Figure S11</xref>).</p>
        <p>Altogether, these results show that <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA growth cone localization is necessary for specifying neurite-localized pMKK7 and downstream pJNK T183 signaling domains, which in turn modulate mt bundling and neurite elongation.</p>

        <p>To address if <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA 3′-UTR sequences allow not only localization but also translation in the growth cone, we took advantage of a recently described sensor for local translation, which consists of a membrane-targeted, photoconvertible Dendra2 fluorophore, PalX2-Dendra2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Welshhans1">[33]</xref>. This sensor was flanked at its 3′ with <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA 3′-UTR1 or 3′-UTR2 sequences and exogenously expressed in N1E-115 cells. Rather than using photoconversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Welshhans1">[33]</xref>, which in our hands led to poor elimination of the green fluorophore form, we illuminated the growth cone and the first 50 µm of the neurite shaft with intense green light to bleach the Dendra2 fluorophore. Because membrane targeted proteins diffuse at a rate of ∼50 µm/h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Fivaz1">[34]</xref>, any newly green fluorescence appearing in the growth cone in a period of less than 1 h should derive from locally translated protein. We observed that PalX2-Dendra2 was exclusively present at the plasma membrane, and absent from vesicular structures, excluding the possibility that trafficking might be the source of any growth cone fluorescence recovery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s012">Figure S12A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s029">Video S7</xref>). The PalX2-Dendra2 reporters were also expressed at identical levels allowing for a fair comparison between the different constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s012">Figure S12B</xref>). We found that PalX2-Dendra2 not flanked with any 3′-UTR sequence poorly recovered fluorescence post bleaching, whereas 3′-UTR1 or 2 flanked reporters displayed robust green fluorescence growth cone recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g006">Figure 6A–6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s030">Video S8</xref>).

        <title>Functional Characterization of a Neurite-Localized JNK Signaling Module</title>

Intermediate levels of axonal specification were observed with the <italic>MKK7-GFP/-</italic> and <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR1</italic> mRNAs, while full rescue was observed with the <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g009">Figure 9D</xref>). Importantly, all stage 3 neurons retained the ability of specifying a single axon. Finally, we correlated these responses with the subcellular localization of pMKK7 and tMKK7 in the rescue experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g009">Figure 9E and 9F</xref>). MKK7 originating from somatically localized <italic>MKK7-GFP/-</italic> mRNA and <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR1</italic> were aberrantly phosphorylated in the cell soma and to a low extent in the neurite. In contrast, MKK7 originating from <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR2</italic> mRNA was specifically and robustly phosphorylated in the neurite but not in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g009">Figure 9E and 9F</xref>). MKK7 proteins originating from all three mRNAs were mostly localized in the soma, and displayed similar expression levels as endogenous MKK7 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g009">Figure 9E and 9G</xref>). We also observed that the subcellular patterns of the downstream target pJNK T183 paralleled those of pMKK7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s020">Figure S20</xref>) in the MKK7 rescue experiment. These experiments show a strong correlation between pMKK7 subcellular localization, neurite outgrowth, and axonal specification rescue. These results are however slightly different than in N1E-115 cells. First, in hippocampal neurons, exogenously expressed <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR1</italic> and <italic>3′-UTR2</italic> mRNAs localize to both the soma and growth cone. Second, only the <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR2</italic> mRNA allows for robust MKK7 phosphorylation in the neurite and full rescue of neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons.</p>
        <p>Globally, these results show that growth cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization is a conserved mechanism for mt bundling and neurite elongation in both N1E-115 cells and hippocampal neurons.</p>

        <title>Localized Transcriptomes during Neurite Outgrowth</title>
        <p>Fine tuning of local proteomes through mRNA localization and translation is a widely used mechanism in neurons. In highly polarized neuronal cells, the general view is that local mRNA translation allows axonal or dendritic compartments to rapidly respond to extrinsic signals such as chemotropic responses or regeneration after injury. Because these compartments are distant from the soma, this allows them to bypass the need for recruitment of somatically translated proteins. Here, we identify a set of 80 mRNAs that localize to neuronal processes during the initial neurite outgrowth process. This suggests that even in these relatively undifferentiated cellular compartments, in which diffusion of somatically translated proteins most likely is not limiting, anchoring of mRNAs at specific subcellular regions and, possibly, their local translation plays a role in cell morphogenesis. Consistently, it is important to note that mRNA translation paradigms have also been observed in cell systems in which diffusion of cytosolically translated proteins is not limiting. One important example is β<italic>-actin</italic> mRNA translation at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Condeelis1">[37]</xref>.</p>
        <p>These mRNAs encode a large variety of different signaling, cytoskeletal, motor, and trafficking proteins that are consistent with local functions in the neurite. Some of these mRNAs have also been found in fibroblast lamellipodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Mili1">[31]</xref>, in axons from retinal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Zivraj1">[10]</xref>, and axons from embryonic or adult sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s021">Table S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Gumy1">[11]</xref>. Globally, these studies hint that complex local transcriptomes exist in neuronal processes that will need to be further studied.</p>

        <title><italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA Localization Regulates Spatio-Temporal Activation of a JNK Signaling Network Controlling mt Bundling and Neurite Elongation</title>
        <p>We explored the function of growth cone localization of an mRNA that encodes MKK7, a MAPKK for JNKs. We found that <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization is essential for its selective phosphorylation and activation within the neurite. At this location, it functions within a spatio-temporal JNK signaling network that we identify to contain DLK (MAP3K), MKK7 (MAP2K), and JNK1 (MAP1K) leading to MAP1b phosphorylation, which then controls mt bundling in the neurite to allow its elongation.</p>
        <p>Evidence for this spatio-temporal signaling mechanism stems from the observations that the products of <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA engineered to have somatic and/or growth cone localization are phosphorylated at these specific subcellular localizations. In our N1E-115 rescue experiment, unlike in wild-type (wt) cells, somatically localized <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA (originating from the MKK7-GFP/- construct) is aberrantly phosphorylated in the soma. Some weak neurite pMKK7 signal is also observed in the neurite, most likely resulting from diffusion from the soma, and might allow for the limited rescue of the neurite elongation phenotype. In contrast, <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA with robust growth cone localization (originating from the MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR2 construct) leads to exclusive phosphorylation in the neurite, and allows for robust rescue of neurite elongation. Here, the specific pMKK7 signal also exhibits the characteristic gradient (high at the neurite base decreasing towards the growth cone) as observed in wt cells. Finally, the <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA species containing the 3′-UTR1, which localizes to both the growth cone and the soma, leads to MKK7 phosphorylation at both subcellular localizations and also enables full rescue of neurite elongation. Identical results are observed with pJNK T183, which is the substrate of MKK7, clearly showing that spatio-temporal control of MKK7 activation is transmitted to downstream signaling.</p>
        <p>This mechanism for spatio-temporal control of MKK7 activity is also observed in primary hippocampal neurons, with the difference that the <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA species containing the 3′-UTR1 does neither rescue neurite pMKK7 and pJNK T183 signals, nor robust neurite elongation. One possible explanation for this difference is that MKK7 proteins are expressed at high level in N1E-115 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s008">Figure S8B and S8C</xref>), but to near endogenous levels in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g009">Figure 9G</xref>). Overexpression of the <italic>MKK7-GFP/3′-UTR1</italic> mRNA might therefore provide functional compensation and allow the strong neurite pMKK7 signal in the N1E-115 cells, concomitant with rescue of neurite outgrowth.</p>

        <title>Local <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA Translation as a Mechanism for Spatio-temporal Control of MKK7 Phosphorylation</title>
        <p>The most likely mechanism that explains how growth cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization allows MKK7 phosphorylation in the neurite, is that it is translated at this location and subsequently phosphorylated. This is supported by the finding that the <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA 3′-UTR1 and 3′-UTR2 sequences not only allow growth cone mRNA localization but also translation. Furthermore, our rescue experiments with CI MKK7 clearly show that both the <italic>MKK7</italic> 3′-UTR mRNA sequences, and MKK7 activity are necessary for proper neurite elongation, excluding an independent role for the 3′-UTR. No obvious difference in MKK7 protein levels and subcellular localization were observed with rescue of the <italic>MKK7-GFP/-</italic>, <italic>/3′-UTR1</italic>, or <italic>/3′-UTR2</italic> mRNAs. This suggests that only a small pool of MKK7 is locally translated (and phosphorylated), which has been previously observed for β<italic>-actin</italic> mRNA in axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Eng1">[38]</xref>. We were however not able to formally show that local mRNA translation is necessary for selective neurite MKK7 phosphorylation and subsequent neurite elongation using translation inhibitors. Bulk application of anisomycin did not affect pMKK7 signals in a time window of 1 h, possibly reflecting the existence of a stable pMKK7 signaling complex, until the N1E-115 cells died (unpublished data). At the early differentiation stage we are studying, it is not possible to fluidically isolate neurites using microfluidic devices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Taylor2">[39]</xref> to selectively apply translation inhibitors to the growth cone. In the future, this might be studied using novel chemical biology techniques that can specifically label newly synthesized proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Dieterich1">[40]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our results show that growth cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization, and most likely translation, is a mechanism for spatio-temporal regulation of JNK signaling. We present a model on how this mechanism allows regulation of neurite outgrowth during initial differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g010">Figure 10</xref>). This mechanism allows for several important features for the regulation of neurite outgrowth.</p>

During neurite initiation, <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA containing RNPs are transported to the growth cone where local translation occurs. Local MKK7 synthesis and its phosphorylation by DLK allows to switch on JNK1, MAP1b phosphorylation, and mt bundling to ultimately allow neurite elongation.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>First, our results suggest that growth cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA translation provides a mechanism to specifically position mt bundling activity in the neurite necessary for its rigidification and proper elongation. This seems also to be important for generation of the pMKK7 gradient, which in turn allows high MAP1b phosphorylation at the base of the neurite. This might allow robust mt stabilization and stiffness at this location versus more flexibility in the neurite distal region that might be important for growth cone motility. In that respect, it will be important in the future to explore the molecular mechanisms that allow retention of pMKK7 in the neurite and the formation of the characteristic pMKK7 gradient. One potential mechanism might be that growth cone translated MKK7 protein diffuses throughout the neurite and gets phosphorylated by DLK, which displays an identical subcellular localization than pMKK7. DLK might therefore be a key player that shapes the specific pMKK7 signaling zone. However, the observation that somatically-translated <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA cannot reproduce the characteristic pMKK7 gradient implies that there are additional mechanisms, controlled by MKK7 mRNA localization, that regulate the diffusion of this pMKK7 pool so that it remains in the neurite. Furthermore, our experiments with CA MKK7 formally show that <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA growth cone localization is essential for MKK7 protein function independently of simply being in an activated state. One possibility is that locally translated and phosphorylated MKK7 is endowed with specific post-translational modifications and/or ability to interact with particular scaffolds that tether it to the neurite. One can also imagine the local action of MKK7-specific phosphatases at the base of the neurite. However, the underlying signaling machinery allowing this spatio-temporal regulation remains elusive since our perturbation studies targeting a potential MKK7-JNK interactome (including scaffold proteins and phosphatases), suggested by our previous proteomic analysis of the neurite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Pertz1">[23]</xref>, did not yield any significant neurite outgrowth phenotype. Globally, these results suggest that the function of <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization and translation is the formation of a specific signaling complex that can activate a precise spatio-temporal MAPK module.</p>
        <p>Second, while local mRNA translation has been mostly studied in the context of acute chemotropic or neuronal injury responses in axons, the mechanism we report here might continuously occur during neurite outgrowth. We propose that local <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization and translation allows for a cell-geometry dependent mechanism to switch on the JNK pathway during neuronal differentiation. Here, simple production of a growth cone, by providing a platform for <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA translation, will trigger and appropriately position pMKK7 and the specific MAPK module leading to mt bundling. In that respect, there is evidence that local mRNA translation is coupled with adhesion signaling which is specifically taking place in the growth cone. Ribosomes, RNA binding proteins and mRNAs have been shown to localize to adhesion complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Chicurel1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-deHoog1">[42]</xref> and regulation of β<italic>-actin</italic> mRNA translation is regulated by Src-dependent phosphorylation of zipcode binding protein in neurites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Huttelmaier1">[43]</xref>. An important consequence of a growth cone mediated adhesion signal that switches on local MKK7 mRNA translation, is that simple growth cone removal due to neurite collapse is susceptible to switch off this specific spatio-temporal JNK signaling network. Consistently, we observe that neurite JNK activation is lost during growth cone collapse using the JNKAR FRET probe (unpublished data). Thus, this might allow to co-ordinate growth cone de-attachment with mt unbundling in the neurite shaft during collapse. Finally, it is important to mention that <italic>MAP1b</italic> mRNA has also been observed in neuronal processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Antar1">[44]</xref>. This suggests that additional components of the spatio-temporal JNK signaling network we have defined might also be subjected to regulation by mRNA localization and translation.</p>
        <p>Third, growth cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization and translation as a mechanism to segregate active JNK in the neurite also provides an elegant mechanism for its uncoupling from nuclear translocation and activation of transcription, which typically occurs in response to cellular stress or neuronal injury. Importantly, in the latter process, retrograde transport of JNK containing signaling endosomes from the axon to the nucleus are used as a mechanism to switch on stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Waetzig1">[14]</xref>. An interesting question is therefore if neurite-tethered active JNK also represents a reservoir that can be mobilized for retrograde signaling in response to neuronal injury.</p>

        <title>Function of <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA Species with Distinct 3′-UTRs</title>
        <p>As mentioned above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001439.s005">Figure S5</xref>), the MKK7 locus produces multiple mRNAs that contain either the short 3′-UTR1 or the long 3′-UTR2, and encode different MKK7 isoforms. It will be important to explore the structural nature of the <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA 3′-UTR1 and 2 determinants, as well as the RNA binding proteins that control <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA transport and local translation. Our preliminary bioinformatic analysis was not able to pinpoint any RNA motif in the <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA 3′-UTRs that could bind to specific RNA binding proteins. Importantly, the 3′-UTR2 containing mRNAs are generated by retention of an intron, which has recently been shown to occur in a panel of dendritically targeted mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Buckley1">[45]</xref>. A correlate of this is that the 3′-UTR1 is embedded within the 3′-UTR2 sequence. Thus, because both 3′-UTR1 and 3′-UTR2 sequences lead to MKK7 mRNA localization, this suggests that 3′-UTR1 might contain a minimal growth cone targeting motif.</p>
        <p>What might be the functional significance of two different 3′-UTRs? The observation that 3′-UTR1 containing MKK7 mRNA species are predominantly localized in the soma suggests that they provide the bulk of cytosolic MKK7 that can be used during stress responses irrespectively of the differentiation state. The more diffuse staining observed with chimeric 3′-UTR1 constructs suggests that not all mRNA is bound to RNPs. A subset of the 3′-UTR1 containing <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA species however localizes to the growth cone, and might initiate the JNK network upon growth cone formation during the differentiation process. Such a dual localization pattern (soma and growth cone) is also observed for the β-<italic>actin</italic> mRNA in N1E-115 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001439-g001">Figure 1G</xref>) and, generally, is thought to occur because RNA binding proteins are limiting for packaging and transport of mRNAs to the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Donnelly1">[46]</xref>. Surprisingly, 3′-UTR2 containing <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA species robustly localize to the growth cone, and are mostly absent from the soma. It will therefore be interesting to study how this striking localization pattern is achieved. This might involve low expression levels and efficient packaging and/or mRNA decay in the soma. This might be controlled by additional sequences in the 3′-UTR2 compared to the 3′-UTR1. We observe an increase in the level of 3′-UTR2 containing <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA species during N1E-115 differentiation, suggesting a more specialized function in the regulation of mts.</p>

        <title>Function of Growth Cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA Localization and of the DLK-MKK7-JNK1-MAP1b Signaling Module in Hippocampal Neurons</title>
        <p>Evaluation of the subcellular location of the signaling components (in N1E-115 cells and hippocampal neurons), as well as the mapping of the hierarchy in the signaling module (in N1E-115 cells), clearly identifies a DLK-MKK7-JNK1 spatio-temporal signaling module leading to mono-phosphorylation of T183 on JNK, ultimately leading to Map1b phosphorylation. This is consistent with documented biochemical interactions: (1) DLK preferentially phosphorylates MKK7 (versus MKK4) in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Merritt1">[47]</xref>; (2) MKK7 preferentially phosphorylate T183 (versus Y185) on JNKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Fleming1">[48]</xref>; (3) Map1b is a direct substrate of JNK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Chang1">[15]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our results show that growth cone <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA localization also modulates this JNK signaling module in hippocampal neurons. However, in this cellular context, only 3′-UTR2 containing <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA seems to contribute to robust neurite outgrowth. The MKK7 rescue experiment clearly shows a strict correlate between neurite length and axonal specification. Furthermore, the DLK-MKK7-JNK1 module clearly operates in each neurite in hippocampal neurons. These results imply that the JNK signaling module does not directly regulate axonal specification, and that the axonal specification phenotypes we observe in response to molecular perturbations are the result of modulation of neurite outgrowth dynamics. This is consistent with experiments using primary neuron cultures isolated from knockout mice that show that loss of DLK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Hirai1">[27]</xref> or MKK7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Yamasaki1">[49]</xref> impairs stage 1 to 2 transition, and subsequently, axonal specification. Importantly, DLK was specifically linked to JNK1 in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Hirai1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our analysis of additional JNK signaling network components in N1E-115 cells and hippocampal neurons suggests the existence of a second spatio-temporal JNK signaling module that leads to dually phosphorylated JNK T183Y185 specifically in the growth cone, where it co-localizes with pMKK4, JIP1, and pStathmin. Consistently, MKK4 preferentially phosphorylates Y185 (versus T183) on JNKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Fleming1">[48]</xref>. In hippocampal neurons, there is clear evidence that both dually phosphorylated JNK T183Y185 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Oliva1">[19]</xref> and JIP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-DajasBailador1">[20]</xref> become selectively enriched in the axon, and are important for axonal specification. This therefore suggests the existence of a distinct spatio-temporal JNK signaling module solely devoted to regulation of axonal specification, and gives insight about the complexity of spatio-temporal JNK signaling.</p>
        <p>In vivo studies show that DLK, MKK7, and JNK1 loss of function animals show defects in axon elongation. Loss of function of each protein seems to affect axon fiber tracts, ultimately leading to defects in commissure formation. Specifically, DLK knockout animals display impaired fiber tract development by neocortical pyramidal neurons in the cerebrum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Hirai2">[50]</xref>. Conditional genetic ablation of MKK7 in the brain leads to decreased forebrain axon tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Yamasaki1">[49]</xref>. Finally, in JNK1 knockout mice, axon tracts of the anterior commissure first appear normal until postnatal day 6, but then subsequently degenerate, suggesting a role for JNK1 in axon maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Chang1">[15]</xref>. These studies show that defects in the DLK-MKK7-JNK1 signaling module lead to defects in axon outgrowth in vivo.</p>
        <p>In short, our results show that localization of mRNAs in the growth cone, and most likely also local mRNA translation also operates during neurite outgrowth, before the axon-dendrite specification step. The function of <italic>MKK7</italic> mRNA growth cone localization, and most likely translation, is the positioning of a specific JNK signaling module with a highly dedicated function in spatio-temporal regulation of the cytoskeleton, allowing “insulation” from other JNK signaling modules.</p>

Phase contrast live imaging of neurite dynamics: N1E-115 cells were replated on laminin-coated glass-bottom multi-well plates (MatTek). 3–4 h after plating, cells were imaged in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) in a heated closed chamber. GFP-tubulin, JNKAR FRET, and PalX2-dendra2 live cells imaging experiments: serum-starved, N1E-115 cells transfected with the different constructs were replated on laminin-coated coverslips for different times and imaged in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 10 µg/ml oxyrase reagent (Oxyrase Inc.) in a closed chamber. FRET ratio imaging was performed as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Hodgson1">[53]</xref>. In the bleaching experiments, a FRAP3D module (Roper Scientific) was used to bleach a region of interest with 488 nm laser light. Neurite outgrowth analysis: automated neurite segmentation was performed using Metamorph software. For confocal imaging of fixed, stained samples, a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope steered was used.</p>

        <title>Bioinformatic and Statistic Analysis</title>
        <p>The JNK signaling network was extracted from our previously published neurite proteome dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001439-Pertz1">[23]</xref>, using Ingenuity pathways software (Ingenuity Systems). Only proteins that were enriched in the neurite or found in the neurite and soma fractions were considered. MKK7, MKK4, JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 were used as “bait” to discover proteins that can directly interact with them. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (Mozilla Labs). For multiple comparisons one-way ANOVA with Dunnet test with 95% confidence intervals was used, for single comparisons a two-tail unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used.</p>

        <title>Antibodies and Plasmids</title>
        <p>For Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments the following antibodies were used: anti-MKK7, anti-JNK1, anti-JIP1, anti-JIP3 (all Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-MKK7 (S271+T275), anti-phospho-JNK (T183+Y185), anti-phospho-JNK (T183), anti-DLK, anti-phospho-MKK4 (S257+T161), anti-phospho-doublecortin (S28), anti eEF1A1, anti-GluTubulin (all Abcam), anti-phospho-stathmin (S38), anti-phospho-MAP2 (S136) (all Cell Signaling), anti-MAP2 (Millipore), anti-α-tubulin, anti-MAP kinase activated (T183−Y185), anti-ERK1 (Sigma Aldrich), anti-GFP (Roche), Alexa Fluor350 phalloidin, Alexa Fluor488 phalloidin, Alexa Fluor555 phalloidin (all Invitrogen), DAPI (Sigma Aldrich). Anti-phospho-MAP1b was a gift from Fatiha Nothias (Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris). GFP-MKK7 (gift of Jiyan Zhang, Institute of Basic Medical Science, Beijing) was mutated to confer siRNA resistance. GFP-MKK7, β-globin (gift of Ian G. Macara, University of Virginia, Charlottesville), and PalX2-Dendra (gift of Gary Bassell, Emory University, Atlanta) reporters in eukaryotic expression vectors were all flanked at the 3′ with the <italic>MKK7</italic> 3′-UTR 1 and 2 sequences. JNKAR1 and JNKAR1(T/A) genetically encoded FRET probes were a kind gift of Jin Zhang (John Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore). Detailed construct maps are available on request.</p>

        <title>Primary Neurons Isolation and Transfection</title>
        <p>Primary neurons were isolated from mouse embryos at E18. In brief, hippocampi were dissected, trypsinized for 15 min, and dissociated by trituration. Per condition 500,000 cells were transfected with 1 µg plasmid DNA and/or 50 pmol Accell siRNA using the Amaxa Nucleofector I system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, cells were plated onto coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine and analyzed after 1 or 2 DIV. For experiments in which CMV promoter-based expression vector was used, low expression levels necessitated anti-GFP immunostaining to identify transfected cells. Coverslips were then scanned using high content microscopy. Neurite outgrowth measurements were performed using metamorph by gating on GFP-positive cells. Staging of differentiation status was performed visually on GFP-positive cells.</p>
