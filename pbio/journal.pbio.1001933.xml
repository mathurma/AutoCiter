<p>mRNA capping and decapping requires a cytoplasmic complex to maintain and/or restore the 5′ cap on a subset of the mammalian transcriptome; Nck1, an SH2/SH3 adapter, creates a scaffold upon which the cytoplasmic capping complex forms.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Cytoplasmic capping is catalyzed by a complex that contains capping enzyme (CE) and a kinase that converts RNA with a 5′-monophosphate end to a 5′ diphosphate for subsequent addition of guanylic acid (GMP). We identify the proline-rich C-terminus as a new domain of CE that is required for its participation in cytoplasmic capping, and show the cytoplasmic capping complex assembles on Nck1, an adapter protein with functions in translation and tyrosine kinase signaling. Binding is specific to Nck1 and is independent of RNA. We show by sedimentation and gel filtration that Nck1 and CE are together in a larger complex, that the complex can assemble <italic>in vitro</italic> on recombinant Nck1, and Nck1 knockdown disrupts the integrity of the complex. CE and the 5′ kinase are juxtaposed by binding to the adjacent domains of Nck1, and cap homeostasis is inhibited by Nck1 with inactivating mutations in each of these domains. These results identify a new domain of CE that is specific to its function in cytoplasmic capping, and a new role for Nck1 in regulating gene expression through its role as the scaffold for assembly of the cytoplasmic capping complex.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>We previously described a cyclical process of mRNA decapping and recapping termed “cap homeostasis.” Recapping is catalyzed by a complex of cytoplasmic proteins that includes the enzyme known to catalyze nuclear capping, and a kinase that converts RNA with a 5′-monophosphate end to a 5′-diphosphate capping substrate. The current study shows these two enzymatic activities are brought together in the cytoplasmic capping complex as both bind to adjacent domains of the adapter protein Nck1. Nck1 is a cytoplasmic protein best known for transducing receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. We identify a proline-rich sequence at the C-terminus of a human capping enzyme that is required for binding to Nck1, and we show that this interaction is required for integrity of the cytoplasmic capping complex. Depletion of Nck1 causes the cytoplasmic capping complex to dissociate. The inhibition of cytoplasmic capping by Nck1 with mutations in either the 5′-kinase or capping enzyme binding sites identified a functional role for Nck1 in cap homeostasis and a previously unknown function for Nck1 in cell biology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The 7-methylguanosine “cap” is a defining feature of all eukaryotic mRNAs, and the cap plays a role in almost every step of mRNA metabolism. In the nucleus, the cap is bound by a heterodimer of CBP80-CBP20, and its interaction with other proteins coordinates many of the subsequent steps in pre-mRNA processing and mRNA surveillance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Schoenberg1">[1]</xref>. mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm cap-end first, where the CBP80-CBP20 heterodimer is replaced by eIF4E, leading to translation initiation through the eIF4F complex. Translation and mRNA decay are interconnected processes, and for many transcripts loss of the cap is thought to be an irreversible step leading to mRNA decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Schoenberg2">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Nuclear capping is catalyzed by the sequential actions of capping enzyme (RNGTT, RNA guanylyltransferase, and 5′-phosphatase, CE) and RNA cap methyltransferase (RNMT), both of which are positioned at the transcription start site by their binding to the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Gu1">[3]</xref>. A number of approaches use the cap to map transcription start sites. These include paired end analysis of transcription start sites (PEAT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Ni1">[4]</xref>, Capped analysis of gene expression (CAGE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Kodzius1">[5]</xref>, and RNA annotation and mapping of promoters for the analysis of gene expression (RAMPAGE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Batut1">[6]</xref>. In human cells ∼72% of transcription start sites have matching CAGE data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Djebali1">[7]</xref>. However, a significant number of CAGE tags do not correspond to transcription start sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-FejesToth1">[8]</xref>, mapping instead to locations within the body of the transcript. Intriguingly, there is no evidence for downstream CAGE tags in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Batut1">[6]</xref>, suggesting that the presence of capped ends located downstream within the transcript body is unique to higher metazoans.</p>
<p>The decay of nonsense-containing human β-globin mRNA in erythroid cells results in the accumulation of a reproducible pattern of metastable decay intermediates that are missing sequences of their 5′ ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Mascarenhas1">[9]</xref>. These were previously characterized as having a cap or cap-like structure on their 5′ ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Lim1">[10]</xref>, and it was in the course of re-examining this observation that we discovered cytoplasmic capping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref>. In nuclear capping, the diphosphate substrate for guanylic acid (GMP) addition is generated by hydrolysis of the β-γ phosphate bond on the 5′ ends of newly transcribed pre-mRNA, followed by the transfer of GMP bound covalently at lysine 294 to generate GpppX, where X is the 5′-most nucleotide. In cytoplasmic capping the proximal substrate for cytoplasmic capping is also a 5′-diphosphate, but this is generated by a 5′-monophosphate kinase that sediments with CE in a ∼140 kDa complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our first <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments looked at the impact of inhibiting cytoplasmic capping on cellular recovery from stress. Stress was selected for study because it results in a generalized inhibition of translation, with non-translating mRNPs accumulating in P bodies and stress granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Anderson1">[12]</xref>. We reasoned that some transcripts might be stored in an uncapped state, and cytoplasmic capping might be required to restore these to the translating pool. Support for this hypothesis was seen in Otsuka and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref>, where the ability of cells to recover from a brief arsenite stress was reduced by expression of an inactive form of capping enzyme (termed K294A) that is restricted to the cytoplasm by deletion of the nuclear localization sequence and addition of the HIV Rev nuclear export sequence. Proof that K294A expression inhibits cytoplasmic capping came from work in Mukherjee and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Mukherjee1">[13]</xref>. The original purpose of that study was to identify mRNAs that are regulated by cytoplasmic capping, and in the course of doing so we discovered a cyclical process of decapping and recapping that we termed “cap homeostasis.” Cytoplasmic capping targets can be grouped into three categories on the basis of their cap status and stability in cells that are inhibited for cytoplasmic capping. One group of natively uncapped transcripts is destabilized when cytoplasmic capping is inhibited. In Mukherjee and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Mukherjee1">[13]</xref> these are referred to as the “uninduced” pool. Another group has natively uncapped transcripts that are not destabilized. Instead, inhibition of cytoplasmic capping results in an increase in the uncapped population of each of the “common” transcripts. The third group accumulates uncapped forms only when cytoplasmic capping is inhibited. There is no change in the steady-state level of these “capping inhibited” mRNAs, and their uncapped forms accumulate in non-translating mRNPs. A number of these transcripts encode proteins that are involved in the mitotic cycle, which may explain the reduced survival of K294A-expressing cells after arsenite stress.</p>
<p>Ultimately, progress in understanding the function of cytoplasmic capping depends on identifying the components of the cytoplasmic capping complex and determining how the CE, the 5′-kinase that generates the diphosphate substrate, and a cap methyltransferase are brought together in a single complex. We noticed that modifications to the C-terminus reduced the relative amount of kinase and capping activity recovered from cytoplasmic extracts with CE. Because these modifications had no impact on covalent binding of GMP (i.e., guanylylation activity), this suggested the C-terminus might play a role in assembling the cytoplasmic capping complex. A search for functional domains identified a proline-rich SH3 binding site close to the C-terminus of vertebrate CE, but not in CE of lower metazoans. <italic>Drosophila</italic> CE has a run of three prolines, but there is an additional 34 amino acids that separates these from the C-terminus. The current study identifies this region as a third domain of CE that is bound by adapter protein Nck1, which in turn brings CE together with the 5′-monophosphate kinase to form the core of the cytoplasmic capping complex.</p>

<title>C-Terminus of Capping Enzyme Is Required for Cytoplasmic Capping</title>
<p>Murine and human CE have proline-rich sequences immediately upstream of their C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas the three prolines in <italic>Drosophila</italic> CE are separated from the C-terminus by 34 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001933.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To determine if differences here are relevant for cytoplasmic capping we examined the impact of modifying this portion of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) on the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of the cytoplasmic capping complex recovered from cells that were transfected with the constructs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. The proteins analyzed here included wild-type enzyme (CE), the same protein missing 25 amino acids from the C-terminus (CEΔ25C), the cytoplasmically restricted form of CE described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref> (CEΔNLS+NES), which has an N-terminal Myc tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag, a similar construct without FLAG that has an added N-terminal sequence that becomes biotinylated <italic>in vivo</italic> (bio-cCE), the same construct missing the C-terminal 25 amino acids (bio-cCEΔ25C), and a construct similar to CEΔNLS+NES in which the C-terminal FLAG tag was replaced with one that is biotinylated (cCE-bio). These plasmids or a control expressing Myc-GFP were transfected into 293 cells and cytoplasmic forms of each of the epitope-tagged proteins and their associated partners was recovered using anti-Myc or streptavidin paramagnetic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel).</p>

<title>The capping enzyme C-terminus participates in assembly of the cytoplasmic capping complex.</title>
<p>(A) The organization of vertebrate CE is shown with the N-terminal triphosphatase domain indicated in white, the guanylyltransferase domain indicated in grey, and the proline-rich C-terminus indicated by the black oval. The proximity of the proline-rich sequence to the C-terminus is indicated by the sequence of the last 12 amino acids of human CE. (B) The forms of CE used to analyze the impact of C-terminal modifications is shown. In the nomenclature used here CE corresponds to full-length protein with an N-terminal Myc tag. CEΔ25C is the same protein missing the C-terminal 25 amino acids. This deletion includes the NLS. CEΔNLS+NES was described in Otsuka and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref> and consists of Myc-tagged CE with the NLS deleted (X), a C-terminal FLAG tag and the HIV Rev NES (black box). In bio-cCE the NLS is deleted and a sequence that is biotinylated <italic>in vivo</italic> is added upstream of Myc tag and Rev NES. In bio-cCEΔ25C the C-terminal 25 amino acids of this protein were deleted. cCE-bio is similar to CEΔNLS+NES except that the C-terminal FLAG tag is replaced with the biotinylation sequence. (C) The plasmids shown in (B) or a plasmid expressing Myc-tagged GFP were transfected into HEK293 cells. GFP or CE and its associated proteins were recovered with anti-Myc beads (CE, CEΔ25C, cCE-bio, and CEΔNLS+NES) or streptavidin beads (bio-cCE and bio-cCEΔ25C). The recovered protein was incubated with α-[<sup>32</sup>P]GTP and analyzed for the covalent binding of [<sup>32</sup>P]GMP (guanylylation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref>, and for [<sup>32</sup>P]GMP labeling of 5′-monophosphate RNA (capping). The products were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The amount of capping activity relative to guanylylation activity is shown at the bottom of the figure, with results normalized to either CE or to bio-cCE as indicated by the vertical line. (D) The experiment in (C) was repeated with an additional assay for 5′-kinase activity. The vertical line in the Western blot and guanylylation assay is to indicate that CE and CEΔ25C were separated by empty lanes on each of these gels. In (C and D) the mean ± standard deviation (<italic>n</italic> = 3) for recovered kinase and capping activity normalized to guanylylation activity is shown beneath each autoradiogram. In each case comparison to matching controls yielded <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;0.05 by Student's <italic>t</italic> test.</p>

<p>The first experiments examined the impact of the C-terminal modifications on covalent binding of GMP (guanylylation) to the active site lysine at 294 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Yue1">[14]</xref>. Proteins recovered from transfected cells were incubated with α-[<sup>32</sup>P]GTP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, middle panel). For the most part the amount of [<sup>32</sup>P]GMP bound covalently to each of these proteins matched the relative amount of protein determined by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel), indicating the C-terminal modifications had little or no impact on the ability of these proteins to bind GMP. In Otsuka and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref> we described a functional <italic>in vitro</italic> capping assay that measures the labeling of a 23 nt long 5′-monophosphate RNA with α-[<sup>32</sup>P]GTP in a reaction containing unlabeled ATP. While the C-terminal modifications had relatively little impact on guanylylation activity they each reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> capping activity of the recovered proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom panel).</p>
<p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> capping assay depends on the activity of a 5′-kinase to generate a diphosphate substrate for transfer of GMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref>. The recovery of this activity with the different forms of CE was examined by incubating the recovered proteins and 5′-monophosphate RNA with γ-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001933.s002">S2</xref>). Again the Δ25C deletion had no impact on recovery of CE or guanylylation of the recovered protein; however, it resulted in the parallel loss of kinase and capping activities. The experiment in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001933.s002">Figure S2</xref> also included a [<sup>32</sup>P]labeled, capped human β-globin transcript that was added to each reaction to control for contaminating ribonuclease activity. The similar recovery of this RNA from each of the reactions confirmed that the differences seen with each of the C-terminal modifications were due to differences in activity of the complex.</p>

<title>Nck1 Binds to the Proline-Rich C-Terminus of Cytoplasmic CE</title>
<p>MIT ScanSite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Obenauer1">[15]</xref> identified adapter protein Nck1 (NP_006144.1) as a potential binding partner for the proline-rich C-terminus. Nck1 has 3 SH3 domains and a single C-terminal SH2 domain, and it has roles in transducing tyrosine kinase signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Castello1">[16]</xref>, in translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Kebache1">[17]</xref> and in development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Bladt1">[18]</xref>. It is classified as a cytoplasmic protein, and this was confirmed by Western blotting of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and by indirect immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001933.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To determine if Nck1 binds the proline-rich C-terminus we examined its recovery with bio-cCE, bio-cCE missing the C-terminal 25 amino acids (bio-cCEΔ25C), or bio-cCE missing the five C-terminal proline residues (bio-cCEΔpro). Cytoplasmic extracts from cells that were co-transfected with plasmids expressing each of these forms of CE and HA-Nck1 were recovered on streptavidin beads and assayed for Nck1, guanylylation, and capping activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). As in the preceding experiment loss of the proline-rich C-terminus sequence had no impact on guanylylation activity. However, each of the deletions affected the recovery of both Nck1 and <italic>in vitro</italic> capping activity. The recovery of Nck1 with cCE was unaffected by prior treatment with micrococcal nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating RNA is not required for the interaction between these proteins. The binding of HA-Nck1 to CE is also independent of GMP binding as changing the active site lysine to alanine (K294A) had no effect on its recovery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001933.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of Nck1 binding to cytoplasmic CE.</title>
<p>(A) HEK293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing HA-Nck1 and bio-cCE (lanes 1 and 4), bio-cCEΔ25C (lanes 2 and 5), and bio-cCEΔpro in which the five C-terminal prolines shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figure 1A</xref> were deleted (bio-cCEΔpro, lanes 3 and 6). Protein recovered on streptavidin beads was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc (cCE) and anti-HA (Nck1) antibodies (upper two panels). In the lower two panels the bound complexes were assayed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figure 1</xref> for guanylylation and capping activity. The quantified capping activity (mean ± standard deviation, <italic>n</italic> = 3) for capping assay is shown beneath that autoradiogram. The same results were obtained for each of the modified forms of CE, with <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;0.05 by Student's <italic>t</italic> test. (B) Cytoplasmic extract from cells expressing bio-cCE (cCE) and HA-Nck1 was treated ± micrococcal nuclease (MNase) prior to recovery of CE and associated proteins with streptavidin beads. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc (cCE) and anti-HA (Nck1) antibodies. (C) HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing bio-cCE or a protein consisting of two MS2 binding sites fused to the biotinylation sequence present in bio-cCE (MS2-bio) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Tsai1">[19]</xref>. Proteins recovered on streptavidin beads were analyzed by Western blotting with HRP-streptavidin (bio-cCE and MS2-bio), and with an antibody to endogenous Nck1. (D) The experiment in (C) was repeated except Western blots of recovered proteins were probed with antibodies to Nck2 and Grb2. (E) Cytoplasmic extract was immunoprecipitated with control IgG or anti-Nck1 antibody. 2.5% of input sample and 20% of the immunoprecipitated sample was used for Western blotting to determine Nck1 recovery, and 2.5% of input sample and 70% of the immunoprecipitated sample was assayed by guanylylation to determine CE recovery. The weak guanylylation signal seen in the input sample is due to the presence of a previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref> inhibitory activity in cytoplasmic extract.</p>

<p>We next examined if endogenous Nck1 also binds to cytoplasmic CE.

Fractions containing each of these proteins were identified by Western blotting of input fractions with antibodies to the Myc tag on bio-cCE and to Nck1 (upper 2 panels). Streptavidin beads were used to recover bio-cCE from individual fractions and bound proteins were again analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-Nck1 antibodies (lower two panels).

Starting with the void volume individual fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-CE and anti-Nck1 antibodies. The missing CE band in fraction 3 was due to sample loss during loading.

<p>We next looked for the evidence of a native complex containing CE bound to Nck1. In the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g003">Figure 3B</xref> cytoplasmic extract from non-transfected cells was separated on a calibrated Sephacryl S-200 column, and individual fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for CE and Nck1. Both proteins eluted in the same fractions, at a size estimated from standards to be larger than that seen on glycerol gradients. The difference in size determinations may be due to the shape of the complex or the dissociation of one or more proteins during prolonged sedimentation. Nck1 was also present in later fractions, a result that is consistent with an excess of Nck1 over CE (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). To determine if CE was bound to Nck1 in the co-eluted fractions these were pooled, immunoprecipitated with control immunoglobulin G (IgG) or anti-Nck1, and the recovered proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The selective recovery of CE with Nck1 confirmed that the native proteins were indeed bound to each other in this complex.</p>
<p>The relative amount of Nck1 bound to CE was estimated by immunoprecipitating cytoplasmic extract from non-transfected cells with anti-CE antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-Nck1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). On the basis of signal intensity and the amount of protein loaded onto the gel, we estimate that 1% of Nck1 is bound to cytoplasmic CE.</p>

<title>Nck1 Is the Scaffold for Assembly of the Cytoplasmic Capping Complex</title>
<p>Because Nck1 lacks catalytic activity its presence in the cytoplasmic capping complex suggested it might act as a scaffold to bring CE together with the 5′-kinase and perhaps other proteins. To test this concept we first asked if a functional complex could assemble <italic>in vitro</italic> on recombinant Nck1.

Selective <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of bio-cCE to Nck1 was demonstrated by Western blotting with HRP-streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel). Perhaps of greater importance, guanylylation assay showed that CE present in each of the extracts also bound selectively to Nck1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, right middle panel, lanes 4 and 6). Finally, capping assay was performed on the bead-bound proteins to determine if all of the activities (i.e., CE plus the 5′-kinase) can assemble <italic>in vitro</italic> on Nck1. Bead-bound proteins were incubated with 5′-monophosphate RNA, ATP, and α-[<sup>32</sup>P]GTP, and the products were separated on a denaturing gel.

The middle panel is a Western blot using HRP-streptavidin of cytoplasmic extracts of cells that were transfected with plasmids expressing bio-cCE or MS2-bio.

The effectiveness of Nck1 knockdown was determined by Western blotting with anti-Nck1 and anti-GAPDH antibodies, and the expression of bio-cCE and its recovery on streptavidin beads was monitored by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. The recovery of Nck1 with bio-cCE was determined by Western blotting with anti-Nck1 antibody (upper panels).

<p>The preceding data also suggest that CE and the 5′-monophosphate kinase each bind to Nck1 but not to one another. If so, Nck1 knockdown should reduce the amount of kinase and capping activity recovered with bio-cCE.

Nck1 knockdown had no impact on the amount of bio-cCE or its recovery on streptavidin beads. However, significantly less kinase and capping activity were recovered in cells knocked down for Nck1 compared to the scrambled control (lower panels). Together with results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g004">Figure 4A</xref> these data point to Nck1 as the scaffold that brings cytoplasmic CE together with the 5′-kinase to form a functional capping complex.</p>

<title>Nck1 Functions in Cap Homeostasis</title>
<p>We next sought to build on our success in knocking down Nck1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) to demonstrate a functional role for Nck1 in cap homeostasis. However, Nck1 knockdown resulted in a general decrease in the steady-state level of every transcript examined, regardless of classification with respect to cytoplasmic capping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001933.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The reason for this is not known, but it does not appear to be related to cell viability, as this was unaffected by Nck1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001933.s006">Figure S6</xref>). As an alternative we asked whether cap homeostasis could be disrupted by overexpression of Nck1 with inactivating mutations in the CE and 5′-kinase binding domains.</p>
<p>As noted in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>, cytoplasmic capping targets can be categorized by differences in their behavior when cytoplasmic capping is inhibited. The “capping inhibited” pool make up the most obvious targets because stable uncapped forms of these transcripts appear when cytoplasmic capping is inhibited. Triplicate cultures of U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type Nck1, or the M2 and M3 forms of Nck1, and their overexpression with respect to endogenous Nck1 was confirmed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001933.s007">Figure S7</xref>). We also confirmed that their overexpression did not have an inhibitory impact on their steady-state levels as seen with Nck1 knockdown. The appearance of uncapped transcripts was determined using an assay from our previous study in which these are ligated to an RNA adapter, hybridized to a biotinylated antisense DNA oligonucleotide, and recovered on streptavidin beads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Jiao1">[21]</xref>. Each preparation included an internal control of uncapped β-globin RNA. In agreement with a central role for Nck1 in cap homeostasis, overexpression of Nck1 mutated in the CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, M3) or 5′-kinase binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, M2) resulted in the appearance of uncapped forms of each of four “capping inhibited” targets (DNAJB1, NM_006145; ILF2, NM_004515.3; MAPK1, NM_002745.4; and RAB1A, NM_004161.4).</p>

Each preparation contained an equal amount of uncapped human β-globin mRNA as an internal control and RNA recovered from M3 (A) and M2 (B) expressing cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR for four transcripts that accumulate uncapped forms in cells that are inhibited for cytoplasmic capping (DNAJB1, ILF2, MAPK1, RAB1A). The results are normalized to the signal from cells expressing wild-type Nck1. RNA from M3 (C) or M2 (D) expressing cells was also analyzed by qRT-PCR for three transcripts of the “uninduced” pool whose steady state levels are reduced when cytoplasmic capping is inhibited (TLR1, NME9, S100Z, black bars), one of the transcripts examined in a and b (MAPK1, grey bars), and a control transcript (BOP1, white bars). The results are presented as fold change with respect to wild-type Nck1 and are presented as mean ± standard deviation.

<p>Inhibition of cytoplasmic capping also results in the Xrn1-mediated degradation of natively uncapped transcripts in the “uninduced” pool. The impact of overexpressing the M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and the M2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) forms of Nck1 was examined for three of these transcripts (TLR1, NM_003263.3; NME9, NM_178130.2; S100Z, NM_130772.3). The steady-state level of each target RNA was reduced compared to wild-type control, again confirming cap homeostasis is inhibited by overexpression of Nck1 with mutations in the CE or 5′-kinase binding domain. The mutant forms of Nck1 had little impact on the steady-state level of MAPK1, a result that is consistent with the stability of the uncapped forms of this class of transcripts. We also looked at the impact of each of these proteins on steady-state levels of BOP1 (NM_015201.3), one of the control transcripts whose cap status is unaffected by changes in cytoplasmic capping. M3 overexpression had no impact on the level of BOP1 mRNA; however, BOP1 was unexpectedly increased in cells that overexpress the M2 form of Nck1. The reason for this is not known, but we suspect it may be a consequence of interfering with one of the other pathways in which Nck1 participates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prior to this study the functional domains of mammalian capping enzyme were limited to the N-terminal triphosphatase domain and the C-terminal guanylyltransferase domain. Our results add a third domain at the C-terminus of the mammalian protein whose binding to the third SH3 domain of Nck1 functions in the assembly of the cytoplasmic capping complex. In the course of this work we also discovered that C-terminal extensions (such as the FLAG tag on CEΔNLS+NES, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and K294A) interfere with CE binding to Nck1. Because CE and the 5′-kinase activity bind to Nck1 rather than to each other this may explain why the cytoplasmic capping targets identified in Mukherjee and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Mukherjee1">[13]</xref> have 5′-monophosphate ends rather than 5′-diphosphate ends as might be expected if these proteins interacted directly.</p>
<p>We realized early on that knowing the targets of cytoplasmic capping was a necessary first step toward validating the identity of proteins in the cytoplasmic capping complex. Results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Mukherjee1">[13]</xref> grouped the targets of cytoplasmic capping into three broad classes on the basis of the relative stability of their uncapped forms. Overexpression of Nck1 with inactivating mutations in the CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) or the 5′-kinase-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) resulted in the appearance of uncapped forms of transcripts that also appear when cytoplasmic capping was blocked by induction of the inactive K294A form of cytoplasmic CE. Other cytoplasmic capping targets have natively uncapped forms that are degraded when cytoplasmic capping is inhibited. Together with the appearance of stable uncapped forms of the “capping inhibited” transcripts, the lower steady-state levels of these RNAs in cells expressing Nck1 with inactivating mutations in the CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) or 5′-kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) binding sites provided <italic>in vivo</italic> confirmation of an essential role for Nck1 in cytoplasmic capping. Together, they confirm that Nck1 is essential for the assembly of the cytoplasmic capping complex and for cap homeostasis.</p>

Although Nck1 and Nck2 share 68% sequence identity CE only binds to Nck1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001933-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

Our findings suggest that the absence of downstream CAGE tags in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Batut1">[6]</xref> results from the inability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CE to bind Nck1 and participate in the cytoplasmic capping complex. The presence of Nck1 at the core of the cytoplasmic capping complex also suggests that cytoplasmic capping, and perhaps the proteins translated from recapped transcripts, may vary in response to different stimuli, for example by activation of a particular receptor tyrosine kinase. Adding to this complexity, the amount of Nck1 is also regulated by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Buvall1">[33]</xref>. Ubquitination by the c-Cbl E3 ubiquitin ligase targets Nck1 for degradation by the proteasome, which in turn may impact cytoplasmic capping by reducing the amount of Nck1 that is available for bringing cytoplasmic CE together with the 5′-kinase. Nck1 ubiquitination is inhibited by the binding of synaptopodin, a proline-rich actin binding protein, to the same site on Nck1 as the 5′-kinase activity. These findings raise the possibility of competition by these proteins, and of a link between cytoplasmic capping and the cytoskeleton.</p>

This was digested by Kpn I and Apa I and cloned in similarly digested pcDNA3/TO vector yielding pcDNA3/TO myc-cCE-bio (cCE-bio). To generate CE with an N-terminal biotinylation tag (bio-cCE), the sequence corresponding to the tag only (without the Tev cleavage site) was amplified from the above template with primers Bio RP and Bio FP. This tag was introduced into pcDNA3 myc-NES-mCEΔNLS, pcDNA3 myc-NES-mCE (K294A) ΔNLS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref> and pcDNA3 myc-mCEΔ25C using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Clontech). The NES from construct used in our previous work was added to pcDNA3 bio-myc-mCEΔ25C to generate pcDNA3 bio-myc-NES-mCEΔ25C (bio-cCEΔ25C). Bio-cCEΔpro was generated from bio-cCE by site directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with oligos Amp-R (Stratagene) and cCE-ΔPPP. The plasmid for expression of GFP (pcDNA4/TO myc-GFP-Flag) was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001933-Otsuka1">[11]</xref>. All constructs were verified by sequencing.
