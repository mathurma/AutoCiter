<p>The folding pathway and rate coefficients of the folding of a knotted protein are calculated for a potential energy function with minimal energetic frustration. A kinetic transition network is constructed using the discrete path sampling approach, and the resulting potential energy surface is visualized by constructing disconnectivity graphs. Owing to topological constraints, the low-lying portion of the landscape consists of three distinct regions, corresponding to the native knotted state and to configurations where either the N or C terminus is not yet folded into the knot. The fastest folding pathways from denatured states exhibit early formation of the N terminus portion of the knot and a rate-determining step where the C terminus is incorporated. The low-lying minima with the N terminus knotted and the C terminus free therefore constitute an off-pathway intermediate for this model. The insertion of both the N and C termini into the knot occurs late in the folding process, creating large energy barriers that are the rate limiting steps in the folding process. When compared to other protein folding proteins of a similar length, this system folds over six orders of magnitude more slowly.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Proteins are chains, which must fold into a compact structure for the molecule to perform its biological function. There are a large number of ways the molecule can move into this final shape. Proteins have evolved sequences that perform this difficult task by having strong biases toward the final shape, while not getting stuck in different structures along the way. One way proteins can be trapped is by forming a knot in the chain. For the most part, proteins are remarkable in avoiding knotting. However, in order to function a few proteins form knots. We show how a model protein is able to knot itself, and estimate how fast this process occurs. Our goal is to treat a small and uncomplicated protein to estimate the fastest rate possible for the folding of a knotted protein. This rate is interesting when compared to the speed of folding of other proteins. We have visualized how the molecule changes shape to its functional position, and examined other paths the molecule may take.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The wide range of kinetics that characterizes protein folding has attracted interest from both experimentalists and theoreticians for decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Fersht1">[1]</xref>. Proteins fold on time scales that vary from microseconds to minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Kubelka1">[2]</xref>, even though the corresponding energy landscape directs folding towards its native state. This wide range of rates can be explained by the diverse size and shapes of the free energy barriers between the unfolded and folded ensembles, which are largely determined by the pattern of contacts, often called the protein topology. Some of the slowest folding proteins, such as the green fluorescent protein, are both long and have complicated contact patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Dietz1">[3]</xref>. In the past 15 years, a set of proteins has been discovered that fold slowly and have knotted topologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Takasugawa1">[4]</xref>. Topological constraints can lead to large energy barriers that are difficult to characterize, so we employ a reduced description of the protein and explore the landscape using geometry optimization techniques. Topological problems have been investigated previously using G<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Gosavi1">[5]</xref>, and have shown that local unfolding may be required in some cases to organize the sequence of the folding of structural units. This type of potential energy landscape analysis with transition state theory has been used for describing kinetic phenomena in systems as diverse as molecular clusters, glasses, and proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales1">[6]</xref>. An advantage of this approach is that the topological constraint limits the utility of a simple energy based reaction coordinates (like <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section), which ordinarily work well to describe folding.</p>
<p>We studied a tRNA methyltransferase (PDB code 1UAM), which contains a deep trefoil knot in the C terminus domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Ahn1">[7]</xref>. The goal of this study was to estimate the fastest speed possible for folding a small knotted protein, and we therefore truncated the system to residues 78–135 to limit the number of atoms not included in the knot. Mathematically knots are defined in closed loops. In proteins links are used to connect the termini, and the structure is topologically classified by the determination of its Alexander polynomial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Virnau1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Kolesov1">[9]</xref>. Recently knotted proteins have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Taylor1">[10]</xref> and their kinetics explored. Knotted systems with a larger number of residues beyond the knot will exhibit slower kinetics, because of the need to break a larger number of contacts to fold properly. Protein models based on random contacts produce knotted proteins with greater frequency than is seen in protein structure databases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Lua1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Raymer1">[12]</xref>. Knotted proteins are likely avoided during evolution, while some have remained and are an evolutionary curiosity. Knotting can also occur in other biopolymers such as DNA, and these systems exhibit significantly slower kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Bois1">[13]</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A connected path of minima and transition states between an unfolded structure and the native state was created with the discrete path sampling method (DPS) combined with the associative memory Hamiltonian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales3">[15]</xref>. After obtaining an initial connection, this database of structures was expanded using schemes to systematically reduce the length and barriers associated with the largest contribution to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rate coefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales4">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Carr1">[19]</xref>. Here, the SS superscript refers to an approximate formulation where the steady-state condition is applied to minima outside the product and reactant sets. This formulation provides a convenient framework for analysis because <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be written as a sum over discrete paths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales4">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales6">[20]</xref>. Once this pathway appeared to have converged, the database was further refined by connecting undersampled minima with a large ratio of the free energy barrier to free energy difference from the global minimum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Carr2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Carr3">[22]</xref>. This choice is motivated by the idea of optimizing folding kinetics for topologically constrained system in a similar way to the minimization of energetic frustration obtained by comparing the folding temperature to the glass transition temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Bryngelson1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Goldstein1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>The resulting database contained 212054 minima and 206923 transition states, and the corresponding disconnectivity graph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Becker1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales7">[26]</xref> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g001">Figure 1</xref>, as rendered by VMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Humphrey1">[27]</xref>. Here we remind the reader that every vertical line in the graph terminates at the energy of a local minimum, and that the minima are progressively connected together as the threshold energy, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, increases, according to the lowest barrier between them. The graph exhibits three distinct color coded features corresponding to potential energy basins, with properly knotted minima occupying the lowest-lying states in the center of the figure. Branches corresponding to minima with the knotted topology are colored blue, while those with the C and N termini still free are colored green and red, respectively. The kinetic coefficients for interconverting minima within these basins are relatively fast, so that local equilibrium is achieved on the time scale of the slow kinetics determined by the barriers between the different basins. This figure represents an unusual folding energy landscape, where large energy barriers occur despite the lack of favorable non-native interactions in the Hamiltonian. The two higher energy sets of structures correspond to local minima where either the C or N terminus has the native topology, but the other terminus is still unknotted, and we will refer to these as N-free and C-free geometries, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g003">3</xref>).</p>

<p>A useful descriptor of these ensembles is their structural overlap. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value (a measure of structural similarity, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section) between the N-free and native minima is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, between the C-free and native minima is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and between N-free and C-free minima is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The small variation in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> shows that only a few contacts are different, where a contact is restricted to be less than 9 Å in order to distinguish structures that have a high degree of similarity. Most of the contacts in each basin are identical, except for a few important differences near the termini. In the N-free minima these interactions are between residues 7–8 and 45–46 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g004">Figure 4</xref>, while in the C-free minima they are between 48–52 and 30–34 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g005">Figure 5</xref>, and define the interactions that prevent unphysical chain crossings. These non-native contacts are energetically neutral with respect to the interaction Hamiltonian <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section) due to the native-only form of the Hamiltonian, but they affect the calculated pathways through an excluded volume repulsion due to the backbone interaction <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<p>A kinetic analysis of the DPS database using transition state theory requires choices for the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the mass associated with each site in the AMH potential. For simplicity a value of 12 atomic mass units (amu) was assigned to each site. To assign a value for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we compared the normal mode frequencies for the AMH potential with typical values associated with heavy atom motion in all-atom representations of proteins. This comparison suggests that <italic>ε</italic> should be around one kcal/mol. The discrete path that makes the largest contribution to the phenomenological two-state rate coefficient, which we use to define the overall reaction mechanism, exhibits the same qualitative features over a wide range of values for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The estimated rate coefficients themselves are more sensitive, as discussed below. If we take <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>kcal/mol and the values of length and mass in the AMH potential as 1 Å and 12 amu then the reduced value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at room temperature is approximately 0.59. The pre-exponential factor for each minimum-to-minimum rate coefficient scales as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while the reduced value for room temperature decreases linearly, lowering the corresponding Boltzmann factors exponentially.</p>
<p>The choice of the reactant and product states can have a significant effect on the calculated rates. One way of selecting the states is to calculate an order parameter for all the local minima, and simply assign reactant and product states on this basis. However, an alternative method is possible using the known characteristics of the kinetic transition network and a self-consistency condition. Here we take the two endpoints that were used to calculate an initial path, and assign these minima to reactant and product sets. We then regroup the database using a recursive scheme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Carr2">[21]</xref>, combining free energy minima that can interconvert without encountering a barrier higher than a chosen threshold value, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This approach is attractive, because we require a separation of time scales for equilibration in the product and reactant regions, compared to the folding transition time, in order to recover a two-state description of the kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales6">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Chandler1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Dellago1">[29]</xref>. In this case, we expect to see a range of values for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that give a similar value for the calculated rate coefficient.</p>
<p>Rate coefficients were calculated for three different choices of the reactants, namely a fully unfolded minimum and low-lying minima from the C-free and N-free regions of the landscape. In each case a low-lying minimum from the set of knotted configurations was chosen as the product, and rate coefficients were calculated for a range of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values. Following the recursive regrouping of states according to the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, mean first-passage times were calculated from each minimum in the reactant set using a graph transformation procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales5">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Trygubenko1">[30]</xref>. A phenomenological two-state rate coefficient is then obtained using appropriate occupation probabilities for the starting minimum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales4">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales5">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales6">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Trygubenko1">[30]</xref>. These values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> tested (1.0, 0.9 and 0.7 kcal/mol) are close to the magnitude suggested by examining the normal mode frequencies. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>kcal/mol the rate coefficient varies from 0.04 to 0.4 s<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>kcal/mol using a fully unfolded or C-free minimum as the reactant.

Here the path length is defined from the Euclidean distance between successive configurations in the folding reaction. These pathways are based on the rate coefficients and associated free energy barriers calculated at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the entropy terms that derive from alternative discrete paths through the stationary point database are all included in the estimates of the overall rate coefficients. This kinetic analysis suggests that the local maxima in the energy profiles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g006">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g008">8</xref> generally correspond to kinetic bottlenecks. Starting from an unfolded state, we see that the N terminus first forms a loop that threads through the middle of the protein, and then opens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The structures involved in this process appear very similar to the corresponding event in the pathway starting from an N-free minimum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g008">Figure 8</xref>, aside from the state of the C terminus. The final folding events illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g006">Figure 6</xref> are very similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000835-g007">Figure 7</xref>, with a bend forming at the C terminus, threading through the center of the structure, and straightening. The calculated rate coefficients are also very similar when the reactant is chosen as either the fully unfolded state or a C-free minimum, indicating that knotting of the C terminus is the rate-determining step for this model system. The region of configuration space corresponding to low-lying N-free minima is then interpreted as a kinetic trap, which would probably result in a distinct relaxation time scale.</p>

<p>In this study a truncated sequence from a tRNA methyltransferase was considered with a G<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> model containing only the favorable interactions that are present in the global minimum. In contrast to previous minimally frustrated models, which exhibit only a single potential energy funnel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Miller1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales8">[33]</xref>, the landscape for the knotted protein is divided into three distinct regions, corresponding to the correctly folded native state and to structures where either the C or N terminus are not knotted. The potential energy barriers between the lowest minima in these regions are relatively large, with values of order 15 to 20 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in units of the associated memory Hamiltonian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Friedrichs1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Friedrichs2">[35]</xref> parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for which we estimate a value of around one kcal/mol. The calculated rates for folding are therefore rather slow, in agreement with previous simulations of knotted proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wallin1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Sukowska1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>The folding reaction is hindered by the complex topology of this protein. Modeling these interactions and mechanisms in a realistic way requires new tools that prevent unphysical chain crossing events from occurring during the interpolation between structures that have an intervening chain. Details of the procedure are given in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section, and an overview is provided here. Our initial aim was to avoid chain crossings by changing parameters of the potential. However, tightening the bond length constraints for covalent bonds does not solve the problem, because the interpolated images simply avoid the chain-crossing region. In the doubly-nudged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Trygubenko2">[38]</xref> elastic band <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Henkelman1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Henkelman3">[41]</xref> (DNEB) method for identifying useful starting geometries for transition state refinement, a set of images are connected by harmonic springs, and the images can be equally spaced by increasing the corresponding force constant. However, this increase forces the chains into high energy structures that bracket an unphysical crossing. To avoid this situation it is necessary to construct a non-linear interpolation between the end points, and two strategies were implemented. To accelerate the energy evaluation, an elastic network potential was defined based on the two end points, with harmonic restraining potentials for atoms whose separation does not change. This geometrical analysis was also used to diagnose chain crossings for a linear interpolation between the end points, and to distinguish the chain that is moving from one that constitutes a barrier. When crossings were identified the potential was modified to shrink the end of the moving chain and add repulsive interactions to keep it away from the other chain. The DNEB images were then refined following standard procedures and the modified potential was morphed back into the AMH potential slowly enough for sites on one chain to move around the other chain, rather than through it. Overall, this procedure allows paths to be obtained that circumvent chain crossing, while retaining flexibility and providing a solution that is free of constraints.</p>
<p>Both the C and N termini must effectively cross over a chain belonging to the central region of the protein in order to achieve the knotted topology. In the present model it is the C terminus crossing that appears to be the rate-determining step. The rate coefficients reported here are order of magnitude estimates, and correspond to a slow folding process, as expected from previous simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wallin1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Sukowska1">[37]</xref> and experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Mallam1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Mallam2">[43]</xref>. The precise energetics of this truncated model may differ from those of the full protein, but we expect the key steps in the folding and knotting pathways to be retained. Making a meaningful estimate of the scaling behavior with respect to chain length will be addressed in future work. For both the C and N termini the chain cross-over are achieved by formation of a loop, which then inserts through the center of the protein and straightens. While the chain is in the loop conformation the folding process could notionally be reversed by pulling the end of the chain, which is one definition of a slipknot topology, consistent with previous simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Sukowska1">[37]</xref>. The region of configuration space corresponding to N-free local minima, where the C terminus crossing occurs first, is therefore likely to give rise to a separate relaxation time scale. The folding pathways exhibit some interesting mechanistic features, which might be transferable to related systems of knotted proteins and polymers. In particular, both the C and N termini crossings are achieved by formation of a loop that threads through the main body of the protein. The order of the knotting of the chain and the folding of the protein may change as the length of the system changes and as the energy function becomes more realistic. Adding non-native interactions would likely lower the free energy barrier of folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Clementi1">[44]</xref>, but could also stabilize non-native structures and slow local refolding of the loops involved in chain crossings. Introducing non-additive cooperative contacts would increase the energy barriers and likely slow the kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Eastwood1">[45]</xref>. Protein engineering studies of YibK suggest that knotting and formation of native structure are independent events that occur in sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Mallam3">[46]</xref>. These experiments also suggest an early knotting event and slow development of native structure in the knotted region. Similar behavior is seen in DNA, where local unfolding speeds up diffusion of the knot along the polymer chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Metzler1">[47]</xref>. To provide meaningful comparisons with these observations will require simulations of longer systems, rather than the truncated sequence considered in the present work. When compared to other protein folding proteins of a similar length, which fold on the microsecond time scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Kubelka1">[2]</xref>, this system folds over six orders of magnitude more slowly.</p>

<p>For this Hamiltonian, we employed the discrete path sampling (DPS) approach to create databases of local minima and their intervening transition states, starting from two end points. To identify suitable endpoints, we used basin-hopping global optimization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Li1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales9">[64]</xref> to search for the global minimum of the energy landscape, and to create an unfolded conformation. We have previously shown how basin-hopping can be successfully combined with associative memory Hamiltonians for identifying low energy states, and high quality structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Prentiss2">[62]</xref>. The discrete path sampling approach is a coarse-grained analogue of the transition path sampling method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Dellago1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Dellago2">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Bolhuis1">[66]</xref>, where geometry optimization tools are employed to refine a kinetic transition network. The network consists of local minima and transition states of the energy potential, where a transition state is defined as a stationary point with a single negative Hessian eigenvalue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Murrell1">[67]</xref>. The connectivity is defined by approximate steepest-descent paths obtained by energy minimization following infinitesimal displacements parallel and anti-parallel to the eigenvector corresponding to the unique negative eigenvalue. A discrete path then refers to a series of minimum-to-minimum connections together with the intervening transition states. The original DPS formulation has been presented in detail elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales4">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales6">[20]</xref>, as have more recent developments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Strodel1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Carr2">[21]</xref>. The aim is to enlarge a database of connected stationary points starting from those in the initial path, by adding all the minima and transition states found during successive connection-making attempts for pairs of minima selected from the current database.</p>
<p>The main challenge of DPS calculations is the characterisation of transition states. In contrast, energy minimization and identifying approximate steepest-descent pathways is straightforward; here we used the limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm of Liu and Nocedal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Nocedal1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Liu1">[69]</xref>. The transition state searches are connection attempts for a given pair of local minima. A doubly-nudged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Trygubenko2">[38]</xref> elastic band <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Henkelman1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Henkelman3">[41]</xref> (DNEB) refinement of interpolated images was first run for each connection attempt, and the images corresponding to local energy maxima were then tightly converged using hybrid eigenvector-following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Munro1">[70]</xref>. The missing-connection algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Carr4">[71]</xref> was employed to choose subsequent pairs of minima for further connection attempts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Wales3">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>To avoid unphysical chain crossed transition states, we made two changes in methodology to generate physical interpolations for finding potential transition state structures. We define two new potentials <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which maintains chain connectivity, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which introduces atomic repulsion. The potential is modified in three stages during the DNEB refinement. During the first third of the DNEB steps <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are used with modified distances. In the second third the distances are relaxed to physically meaningful values, and in the final third we switch to the full AMH potential. We also define a simpler potential function, often referred to as an elastic network model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Tirion1">[72]</xref> to represent the system during some of the DNEB refinement. The two end points for the DNEB calculation are analyzed to identify pairs of atoms within a cutoff distance (10 Å) that are found at the same separation within a given tolerance in both structures. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the distances between atoms <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the starting and finishing geometries, then we introduced a harmonic restraining potential for this pair if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> such pairs the restraining potential was then<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e094" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the distance between the atoms involved in restraint <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was initially set equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was set to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the present calculations, where the DNEB spring constant was set to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has the appearance of an elastic network model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Tirion1">[72]</xref>, which reflects the conserved interatomic distances in the two endpoints. Analyzing the conserved distances is also useful for diagnosing when crossings occur, so that corresponding changes can be made to the potential, as described below. The initial images in the DNEB interpolation were simply placed at regular intervals for a linear interpolation between the specified endpoints, after putting these two structures into optimal alignment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Kearsley1">[73]</xref>. All pairs of atoms corresponding to different restraints with no common atoms were then examined for all pairs of DNEB images. The crossing check was applied for the largest untested image separation of every remaining image. Only pairs of restraints where the separation of the midpoints between the restrained atoms in both images were below a cutoff value of 10 Å were considered. The midpoint separation in one of the two images was also required to change by at least 3 Å from the value in the nearest endpoint structure. For restrained pairs satisfying these criteria a crossing is diagnosed when the dot product between the vectors joining the midpoints between the constraint pairs in the two images is negative. Outer and inner atom pairs are then defined according to how far the midpoints move between the two images: the midpoint that moves the furthest is assumed to belong to the outer chain, which needs to move around the inner chain.</p>
<p>To avoid unphysical crossings in the interpolation, we modify the potential <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and add repulsive terms through <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If atomic contacts within the set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> pairs are found to cross, using the above geometrical condition, then repulsive terms are added according to the four distances between the two pairs of atoms. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> crossings of restrained distances, the repulsive contribution to the potential is<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e107" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a step function, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (10 Å) is a cut-off for the repulsive terms, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) defines the magnitude of the repulsion, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is one of the four distances between pairs of atoms whose restrained contacts are found to cross. To enable chains to pass around one another when crossings are diagnosed, further changes were made to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For the restrained contact in the outer and inner chains <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was changed to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively, for each crossing. Hence the outer chain shrinks while the inner chain expands. The first third of the DNEB iterations were run with the modified <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> potential plus <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For the middle third of the DNEB optimization the restraint distances <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were switched back to the value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> according to the schedule <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000835.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The full AMH potential was then used for the last third of the DNEB iterations.</p>
<p>To describe the global kinetics of the transition network, we calculated the rate coefficients associated with each transition state using transition state theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000835-Pelzer1">[74]</xref> (TST) with vibrational densities of states obtained from harmonic normal mode analysis. The most important features of the mechanism of folding to the knotted state are relatively insensitive to the values assigned to minimum-to-minimum rate coefficients, while the total rate coefficients that we report are order of magnitude estimates.</p>
