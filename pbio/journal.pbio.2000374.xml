<abstract>
<p>Sirtuin genes have been associated with aging and are known to affect multiple cellular pathways. Sirtuin 2 was previously shown to modulate proteotoxicity associated with age-associated neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson disease (PD). However, the precise molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into the interplay between sirtuin 2 and α-synuclein, the major component of the pathognomonic protein inclusions in PD and other synucleinopathies. We found that α-synuclein is acetylated on lysines 6 and 10 and that these residues are deacetylated by sirtuin 2. Genetic manipulation of sirtuin 2 levels in vitro and in vivo modulates the levels of α-synuclein acetylation, its aggregation, and autophagy. Strikingly, mutants blocking acetylation exacerbate α-synuclein toxicity in vivo, in the substantia nigra of rats. Our study identifies α-synuclein acetylation as a key regulatory mechanism governing α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity, demonstrating the potential therapeutic value of sirtuin 2 inhibition in synucleinopathies.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Parkinson disease is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons from a region in the brain known as the substantia nigra and by the accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein in intracellular clumps called inclusions. Whether these inclusions are the cause or a consequence of the pathological processes is still unclear. Sirtuin proteins are considered master regulators of the ageing process and have previously been associated with neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the interplay between sirtuin 2 and alpha-synuclein in order to dissect the molecular mechanisms associated with protection against alpha-synuclein toxicity. We found that sirtuin 2 interacted with and removed acetyl groups from alpha-synuclein. By decreasing the levels of sirtuin 2, or by expressing mutant versions of alpha-synuclein that modulate its acetylation status, we found that acetylation reduces the aggregation of alpha-synuclein and its cytotoxicity in vitro. Next, we evaluated whether genetic inhibition of sirtuin 2 could prevent the deleterious effects of alpha-synuclein in vivo and found that, in two different models of Parkinson disease, deletion of sirtuin 2 was neuroprotective. Our data therefore suggest that strategies aimed at decreasing sirtuin 2 activity might prove valuable therapeutic avenues for intervention in Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sirtuins are NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacylases and lifespan determinants in several model organisms. Sirtuin proteins have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, conditions that are strongly associated with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref002">2</xref>]. In mammals, there are seven members of the sirtuin (SIRT) family: SIRT1–SIRT7. SIRT2 is the most abundant sirtuin in the brain and its levels increase with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref003">3</xref>]. Interestingly, SIRT2 emerged as a potential culprit in Parkinson disease (PD) pathology, as we showed that SIRT2 modulates α-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation and toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref004">4</xref>]. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 ameliorates aSyn-mediated toxicity in cell models and in vivo (in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of PD), but the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref004">4</xref>]. aSyn is the main constituent of Lewy bodies, protein inclusions typically found in the brains of PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref005">5</xref>], and is therefore a central protein in PD. Interestingly, the balance between acetylation and deacetylation is altered in both aging and neurodegeneration, and a link between acetylation of nonhistone proteins and neuroprotection has recently emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref006">6</xref>]. Given that SIRT2 is a deacetylase and that modulating its activity affects aSyn aggregation and toxicity, we hypothesized that SIRT2 may induce neurodegeneration by modulating aSyn acetylation, rendering it more prone to aggregate and to be cytotoxic. Here, we provide detailed insight into the mechanism through which SIRT2 modulates aSyn toxicity and demonstrate that acetylation on lysine (K)6 and K10 might be used as targets for therapeutic intervention in PD and in other synucleinopathies.</p>

<title>SIRT2 interacts with and deacetylates aSyn</title>
<p>To determine the mechanism of SIRT2-mediated protection against aSyn toxicity and aggregation, we hypothesized that aSyn might be acetylated and that this could be a substrate for SIRT2. Thus, we first evaluated if aSyn was acetylated in mouse brain. To this purpose, endogenous aSyn was thermoenriched from the brain of wild-type (WT) mice and evaluated by mass spectrometry (MS) as we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref007">7</xref>]. Notably, we confirmed that aSyn is ubiquitously acetylated at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s009">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref008">8</xref>]. In addition, we identified K6 and K10, in the conserved N-terminal region, as aSyn acetylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s009">S1 Table</xref>). Next, we investigated whether SIRT2 and aSyn interact, as this would be an indication that perhaps aSyn is a substrate for SIRT2. We coexpressed SIRT2 (tagged with green fluorescent protein [GFP]) with aSyn in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and immunoprecipitated aSyn or SIRT2. Using immunoblot analyses, we confirmed the coimmunoprecipitation of aSyn with SIRT2, demonstrating that both proteins interacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To confirm the interaction in a physiologically relevant context (i.e., without overexpressing the proteins), we immunoprecipitated aSyn from mouse brain extracts and, in agreement with the results obtained in transfected HEK cells, we found that SIRT2 coimmunoprecipitated with aSyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we investigated whether acetylated aSyn is a substrate of SIRT2 deacetylase activity. We transiently expressed aSyn together with SIRT2 or with the enzymatically inactive SIRT2-H187Y mutant in HEK cells and measured the levels of aSyn acetylation after immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with an anti-acetyl–lysine antibody. We found that SIRT2, but not the inactive SIRT2-H187Y mutant, reduced the levels of acetylated aSyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). We then assessed the levels of aSyn acetylation in the brains of SIRT2 knockout (T2.KO) mice. Consistently, we found that deletion of SIRT2 leads to aSyn hyperacetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). We also observed an age-associated reduction in the levels of aSyn acetylation in T2.KO mice but not in WT animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To further investigate the ability of SIRT2 to deacetylate aSyn, we performed in vitro deacetylation assays. Chemical acetylation of aSyn yielded two to eight acetylations per protein molecule, with a distribution maximum of five acetyl modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Peptide MS revealed that three of the five KxK motifs in aSyn, namely K21/23, K32/34, and K58/60, showed little or no acetylation, while all other lysines—including K6 and K10—were acetylated efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In vitro treatment of acetylated aSyn with SIRT2 and NAD<sup>+</sup>, its cofactor, caused efficient deacetylation, as demonstrated by the shift of the modification peak maximum from five to two acetyl groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). We also investigated the specific SIRT2-dependent deacetylation of aSyn on lysines K6 and K10. For this, we generated acetylated forms of aSyn specifically on residues K6 or K10 (acK6 and acK10) using our previously established semisynthetic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref010">10</xref>]. We found that SIRT2 indeed deacetylates both acK6 and acK10 in a dose-dependent and in an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent manner, with similar efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). In conclusion, we identified K6 and K10 as aSyn acetylation sites that are targeted by SIRT2.</p>

<title>SIRT2 KD suppresses aSyn aggregation and toxicity</title>
<p>Given that we demonstrated that aSyn acetylation can be modulated by SIRT2, we investigated whether SIRT2 modulates aSyn aggregation. To that purpose, we decreased SIRT2 levels using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown in an established cellular model of PD in which aSyn aggregation is recapitulated. This model consists of the coexpression of a C-terminally modified form of aSyn (SynT) that increases its aggregation propensity, and synphilin-1 (an aSyn interactor that potentiates its aggregation) in H4 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref012">12</xref>]. Upon SIRT2 knockdown (T2.KD), we detected comparable levels of SynT and synphilin-1 as in cells transduced with scramble shRNA (Scr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To quantify the effect on aSyn aggregation, T2.KD and Scr cells were analyzed by immunocytochemistry (ICC) 48 h posttransfection. Remarkably, T2.KD decreased the percentage of cells displaying SynT-positive inclusions to half of that in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Biochemically, we confirmed that T2.KD increased SynT triton X-100 solubility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) and decreased the levels of higher-molecular-weight (MW) oligomeric species, as assessed by sucrose gradient separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Next, we evaluated the levels of acetylated aSyn in the same cell-based aggregation model. By immunoprecipitating SynT, we observed that T2.KD increased the levels of acetylated aSyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Importantly, concomitantly with the decrease in SynT aggregation and hyperacetylation, T2.KD also decreased the cytotoxicity of SynT, as measured by the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g002">Fig 2F</xref>).</p>

<title>K6 and K10 acetylation modulate aSyn aggregation and membrane-binding ability</title>
<p>To determine whether K6 and K10 acetylation modulated aSyn aggregation, we generated aSyn mutants in which both lysine residues were replaced by either arginine residues (KR) to mimic acetylation-resistant aSyn or by glutamine residues (KQ) to mimic constitutively acetylated aSyn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref013">13</xref>].

<p>To assess if the observed phenotype was due to an intrinsic modulation of aSyn aggregation, we investigated the oligomerization kinetics of recombinant mutant aSyn, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref014">14</xref>]. The kinetics of aSyn fibril formation was monitored using thioflavin T (ThT). For the WT aSyn, we observed the expected increase in ThT fluorescence signal, confirming the formation of amyloid-like fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that while acetylation-resistant mutants increased, acetylation-mimic mutants prevented aSyn oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Moreover, when coincubated with WT aSyn, acetylation-resistant mutants also increased, while acetylation-mimic mutants prevented WT aSyn oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>We then investigated the effects of aSyn acetylation on its structure, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, using again recombinant KR and KQ aSyn mutants produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, as above. Two-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N correlation spectra of soluble aSyn and its mutants showed a narrow spread of NMR resonances, demonstrating that both WT and acetylation-resistant and/or acetylation-mimic mutants are intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). In addition, a high degree of NMR signal overlap between the WT and mutant proteins suggested that the mutations do not strongly perturb the conformational ensemble of aSyn in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we probed the impact of acetylation-resistant and acetylation-mimic mutants on the ability of aSyn to bind to lipid membranes, a property thought to be associated with the physiological function of the protein. In the presence of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), aSyn constantly exchanges between the soluble disordered state and the helical, membrane-bound structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref015">15</xref>]. Because of this exchange process, aSyn residues involved in membrane-binding experience NMR line broadening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref015">15</xref>], in which residues with stronger binding generally experience more broadening. We detected the residue-specific NMR signal attenuation, which is typically observed for aSyn in the presence of SUVs: the N-terminal 100 residues are strongly attenuated—in particular the N-terminal 20–30 residues, which anchor aSyn to the membrane surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref016">16</xref>]—while the C-terminal domain of aSyn binds only very weakly to POPC:POPA membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). In the case of the acetylation-resistant mutant (aSyn KR), a very similar profile was observed, demonstrating that replacement of lysine residues at positions 6 and 10 with arginine does not perturb the exchange of aSyn between the solution and membrane-bound state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). In contrast, addition of POPC:POPA SUVs to the acetylation-mimic mutant (aSyn KQ) resulted in less signal attenuation, and thus higher NMR signal intensities, in the N-terminal 100 residues when compared to the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). The strongest difference was observed for the N-terminal 20–30 residues. Because of the dynamic nature of the aSyn–membrane interaction, the overall affinity of aSyn for POPC:POPA membranes was only slightly attenuated, as estimated by circular dichroism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>aSyn acetylation modulates autophagy</title>
<p>Since T2.KD decreased SynT aggregation, we evaluated how it affected SynT clearance in the cell. For this purpose, we performed a time-chase experiment blocking de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX). We did not observe significant differences in the levels of SynT between T2.KD or Scr cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Since the autophagy lysosome pathway (ALP) is described as the main mechanism to clear high-molecular-weight species of aSyn that cannot be degraded by the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref017">17</xref>], we evaluated the effects of T2.KD on autophagy. Remarkably, although we observed no differences in the ALP in naïve cells, T2.KD significantly enhanced the activity of the ALP in the SynT aggregation model, as seen by the increased accumulation of LC3-II levels after 2 h of ALP inhibition with bafilomycin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To further evaluate these findings, we scored the number of LC3 punctae in T2.KD and Scr cells in both naïve cells or in the SynT aggregation model using immunocytochemistry for LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In agreement with the previous data, LC3 punctae were not modulated by T2.KD in naïve cells. However, in the aSyn aggregation model, T2.KD increased the number of LC3 punctae per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Consistently, upon T2.KD, we observe a basal decrease in the levels of SQSTM1 (P62) in the cell model of aSyn aggregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In total, these results suggest that while basal autophagy is not affected by SIRT2, upon aSyn aggregation, SIRT2 inhibition potentiates the activity of ALP, thereby efficiently clearing aSyn aggregates.</p>

<p>As we showed that SIRT2 regulates aSyn acetylation and that reduction of SIRT2 levels is protective in a cell model of PD, we next aimed at validating our findings in rat primary cortical neuronal cells. It was previously described that 10 d posttransduction of primary cortical neurons with adeno-associated viruses (AAV) encoding for WT aSyn results in severe neuronal loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref018">18</xref>]. Based on this model, rat cortical neurons were transduced with AAV6 vectors encoding WT, KR, or KQ aSyn under the synapsin promoter for neuronal expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). We detected similar expression levels of WT and of the two aSyn acetylation mutants 7 d post-viral transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Remarkably, we observed that cells expressing the acetylation-mimic mutant (aSyn KQ) displayed a significant reduction in the toxicity observed 10 d posttransduction (31%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). However, two to three weeks after transduction, no significant differences were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Next, we performed live cell imaging to determine the effect of aSyn intrinsic acetylation in the number of living neurons over time. Neurons were cotransduced with aSyn (WT or mutant) and enhanced GFP (EGFP), and EGFP-positive neurons were counted at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). At 7 d posttransduction, the number of transduced neurons was identical for all conditions. Between 15 and 21 d posttransduction, both WT and KR aSyn induced pronounced neuronal loss, while the number of living neurons in cultures expressing the acetylation mimic mutant KQ was significantly higher (2-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). We next examined the distribution and intracellular localization of aSyn in neurons 15 d posttransduction. Using an antibody that specifically recognizes human aSyn, we did not observe major differences on the subcellular distribution of the different aSyn variants—all were distributed throughout the neurons, both in cell bodies and neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Strikingly, both the WT and the KR aSyn severely affected the dendritic phenotype, promoting an evident shortening and loss of dendritic arborisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). In contrast, the dendritic structure was preserved in neurons expressing the KQ mutant, as shown by microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Overall, both WT and KR—but not KQ aSyn—promoted prominent neurodegeneration and loss of dendritic arborisation, suggesting aSyn acetylation is protective.</p>

<title>Blocking aSyn acetylation induces nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss</title>
<p>In order to investigate the effect of aSyn acetylation in vivo, we stereotaxically injected AAV6 viruses driving the neuronal expression of WT, KR, or KQ mutant aSyn into the rat substantia nigra (SN). First, we established the neurotoxicity of AAV6-mediated expression of WT aSyn at three different time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). We observed that 6 d after injection of WT aSyn, no significant tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) loss was detected. However, 12 d postinjection, the number of TH-positive cells was significantly reduced in comparison to that observed in the GFP-injected group. No additional TH-cell loss was observed 18 d postinjection, indicating the lesion did not increase between 12 and 18 d postinjection. As expected, the expression of GFP did not induce TH-positive neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we compared the neurotoxicity of the KQ and KR aSyn mutants using the same paradigm. Based on the data obtained for WT aSyn, we assessed the effect 3 wk postinjection. Stereological quantification of TH-positive cells revealed a significant loss of TH-positive neurons 3 wk post-KR aSyn expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). In agreement with the in vitro results, the TH-positive cell loss in cells expressing the KQ aSyn mutant was identical to that observed in control conditions (GFP expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). On the other hand, the KR mutant induced strong loss of TH-positive cells in the SN.</p>

<p>We next investigated whether interfering with aSyn acetylation on K6 and K10 affected aSyn pathology in vivo. The expression of both KQ and KR aSyn variants in the SN resulted in the detection of phosphorylated aSyn on Ser129 (pS129) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), suggesting the accumulation of pathological forms of aSyn. However, the subcellular localization of the pS129 signal was different depending on the aSyn variant. While the KQ mutant displayed a predominantly cytoplasmic staining, the KR mutant displayed a homogeneous pS129 staining throughout the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). We also assessed aSyn pathology by immunostaining with the 5G4 antibody, which reacts with aggregated forms of aSyn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref019">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). As expected, all variants tested resulted in immunostaining with this antibody, suggesting they all formed aSyn aggregates. Unexpectedly, we observed a stronger staining in rats expressing WT aSyn when compared to that observed in animals expressing the acetylation mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). However, as observed for the pS129 staining, immunostaining with the 5G4 antibody also revealed different aSyn subcellular localization depending on the mutant expressed. The KQ mutant appeared predominantly in the cytoplasm, being excluded from the nucleus in most cells. In contrast, the signal for both KR mutant or WT aSyn was homogeneously distributed throughout the cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s008">S8B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Aging is, by far, the major risk factor for PD and other neurodegenerative disorders, but the precise molecular mechanisms involved are still elusive. The sirtuin family of deacetylases regulates many aspects of the aging process. Intriguingly, several sirtuins have emerged as putative therapeutic targets in several neurodegenerative diseases. For example, SIRT1 overexpression has proven beneficial in models of Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref021">21</xref>]. However, while SIRT1 is ubiquitously expressed in the body, SIRT2 is the most abundant sirtuin in the brain and is primarily present in the cytoplasm of brain cells (neurons and oligodendrocytes). The levels of SIRT2 increase with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref003">3</xref>], and we previously showed that pharmacological inhibition of this sirtuin is protective in cellular, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mouse models of PD but not in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref022">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms of SIRT2-mediated protection against aSyn aggregation and toxicity are still unclear.</p>
<p>In the present study, we provide strong evidence demonstrating that SIRT2 inhibition robustly alleviates neuropathology in several models of synucleinopathy by regulating the levels of aSyn acetylation. We show, for the first time, that SIRT2 interacts with and deacetylates aSyn in the highly conserved N-terminal domain.</p>
<p>We started with the premise that acetylation balance is impaired in neurodegeneration. Thus, we first hypothesized that SIRT2-dependent modulation of aSyn acetylation could be the basis for aSyn pathogenicity. It was previously shown that aSyn is acetylated in the N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref023">23</xref>] and that this modification is important for the interaction of aSyn with lipids, as acetylation increases membrane-binding properties of aSyn by increasing its alpha helical content and reducing its ability to aggregate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref024">24</xref>]. Other posttranslational modifications are also known to affect the structure, membrane-binding ability, and oligomerization properties of aSyn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref025">25</xref>]. Since aSyn is a very lysine-rich protein, with 15 putative acetylation sites located mainly in the N-terminal region of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref026">26</xref>], it was reasonable to hypothesize that aSyn could be naturally acetylated in lysine residues in addition to the N-terminal acetylation and that these residues could, perhaps, be substrates for SIRT2 deacetylation. In our study, and in agreement with previous findings, we confirmed that aSyn is acetylated in the N-terminus. However, we also detected acetylation on residues K6 and K10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s009">S1 Table</xref>). Importantly, a previous proteomic analysis of lysine acetylation in rat tissue also detected aSyn acetylation on K6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref027">27</xref>]. Here, we also demonstrated that SIRT2 interacts with and deacetylates aSyn.</p>
<p>We previously reported that pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 reduces aSyn toxicity and decreases aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref004">4</xref>]. Therefore, to exclude potential off-target effects of SIRT2 inhibitors, we evaluated the effects of genetic inhibition of SIRT2 on aSyn aggregation and toxicity in a well-established cellular model of aSyn aggregation. Strikingly, we found that by elevating the levels of aSyn acetylation, knockdown of SIRT2 was able to reduce aSyn aggregation and toxicity. Therefore, we reasoned that aSyn acetylation might be protective. To evaluate the intrinsic implications of aSyn acetylation on K6 and K10, we generated acetylation-mimic (KQ) and acetylation-resistant (KR) mutants. Using the cell-based model of aSyn aggregation, we confirmed that while the majority of cells expressing the KR mutant displayed aSyn inclusions, those expressing the KQ displayed almost no inclusions. Moreover, we showed that recombinant aSyn acetylation mutants display the same trend. Notably, combining WT aSyn with the KQ acetylation-mimic aSyn suppressed fibrillisation, while combining WT with the KR acetylation-resistant mutant potentiated aSyn fibrillisation.</p>
<p>The fact that KQ aSyn is able to suppress WT aSyn fibrillisation suggests that, in normal conditions, the acetylated form of aSyn might be dominant. This observation raises the important and provocative question of how much acetylated aSyn is necessary in the brain in order to prevent fibrillisation as we age. Going one step further, this might enable us to predict what are the chances of developing PD later in life by measuring the levels of SIRT2 and/or acetylated aSyn and could shed light into the question of why some people end up developing PD later in life.</p>
<p>Both NMR and far UV-CD data showed that the presence of acetylation-resistant modifications do not affect the binding of aSyn to lipid vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). In contrast, mimicking aSyn acetylation reduces the ability of the N-terminal region to bind membranes, preventing this region from acting as a membrane-attachment anchor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Importantly, this finding suggests that acetylation may regulate the physiological role of aSyn on vesicular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref029">29</xref>] and should be further investigated in future studies.</p>
<p>Protein acetylation is known to modulate the clearance of different proteins. For example, acetylation of huntingtin—another intrinsically disordered and misfolding-prone protein—on K444 facilitates its clearance via the ALP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref030">30</xref>]. In addition, SIRT2 has been previously associated with autophagy. First, when SIRT2 releases FOXO1, the latter gets acetylated and binds to ATG7, inducing autophagy in the context of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref032">32</xref>]. Second, overexpression of SIRT2 inhibits autophagic turnover by interfering with aggresome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref033">33</xref>]. Therefore, we asked whether SIRT2 could also modulate the clearance of aSyn, mainly by interfering with the ALP. Although we did not observe significant differences in the rate of aSyn clearance, we found that T2.KD induced macroautophagy only in the presence of aSyn inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000374.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000374.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Since we observed that acetylated aSyn is less prone to aggregate and could even prevent the aggregation of the WT form and that T2.KD promoted a more efficient clearance of the aggregates, we propose that SIRT2 acts on several fronts, potentiating neurodegeneration. On one side, SIRT2 affects the conformation of aSyn through deacetylation, thus rendering it more prone to aggregate. Simultaneously, it regulates the main clearance pathway for aggregated aSyn. Therefore, we propose a model in which the age-dependent increase of SIRT2 in the brain, with the concomitant decrease of acetylated aSyn, comes with two major deleterious consequences: an increase of aggregation and the exacerbation of the expected defects in the ALP associated with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000374.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>We then assessed the effects of aSyn acetylation in rat primary cortical cultures. By analysing the expression of aSyn acetylation mutants over time, we observed that while expression of the acetylation-resistant mutant aSyn induced a similar reduction in the number of neurons to that observed for WT aSyn, the acetylation-mimic mutant was less toxic. Expression of the same aSyn variants in vivo in the rat SN confirmed that the acetylation-mimic KQ mutant was less toxic to TH-positive neurons that the KR mutant or than WT aSyn. Interestingly, although the immunoreactivity for pS129 or aggregated forms of aSyn was identical for both the KQ and KR mutants, the intracellular distribution of the protein was altered. Altogether, this suggests that acetylation may not completely abolish the ability of aSyn to aggregate in vivo but that it may also modulate the subcellular distribution of the protein, thereby modulating its toxicity.</p>
<p>Given the protective effects of mimicking aSyn acetylation in vivo, we also evaluated the putative protective effects of SIRT2 deletion. For this we used two in vivo models reporting on different aspects of PD: aSyn toxicity and TH-cell loss. Importantly, we found that SIRT2 deletion was protective in both the AAV-mediated model of aSyn expression in the SN and in the chronic MPTP model of parkinsonism.</p>
<p>In summary, our data suggest that acetylation of aSyn on K6 and K10 may regulate the distribution (and perhaps the function) of aSyn, also modulating its aggregation potential and toxicity. We identify acetylation as a mechanism for removing aSyn by targeting it to autophagy. Thus, SIRT2 activity is an important mediator of aSyn acetylation, underlying its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in synucleinopathies and, possibly, in other neurodegenerative disorders in which protein acetylation may play underappreciated roles in modulating protein homeostasis.</p>

<title>Acetylation-resistant mutant of aSyn is toxic.</title>
<p>Lactate dehydrogenase levels (LDH) were measured in the supernatants of primary cultures infected with AVV6 encoding for WT, KQ or KR aSyn, at different time points after transduction. The KR mutant is toxic 3 days after infection, and the toxicity is then indistinguishable at later time points. Data in all panels are average ± SD, * p &lt; 0.05, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was used for statistical calculations (n = 4).
