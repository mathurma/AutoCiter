        <p>Treatment of chronic bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis (TB), requires a
                    remarkably long course of therapy, despite the availability of drugs that are
                    rapidly bacteriocidal in vitro. This observation has long been attributed to the
                    presence of bacterial populations in the host that are
                    “drug-tolerant” because of their slow replication and low rate of
                    metabolism. However, both the physiologic state of these hypothetical
                    drug-tolerant populations and the bacterial pathways that regulate growth and
                    metabolism in vivo remain obscure. Here we demonstrate that diverse
                    growth-limiting stresses trigger a common signal transduction pathway in
                        <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> that leads to the induction of
                    triglyceride synthesis. This pathway plays a causal role in reducing growth and
                    antibiotic efficacy by redirecting cellular carbon fluxes away from the
                    tricarboxylic acid cycle. Mutants in which this metabolic switch is disrupted
                    are unable to arrest their growth in response to stress and remain sensitive to
                    antibiotics during infection. Thus, this regulatory pathway contributes to
                    antibiotic tolerance in vivo, and its modulation may represent a novel strategy
                    for accelerating TB treatment.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Despite the availability of antibiotics that rapidly kill bacteria in vitro, the
                    treatment of chronic bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis, requires
                    long-term drug therapy. The reasons for this are unclear, but many have
                    hypothesized that the slow replication and concomitantly low metabolic rate of
                    bacteria in the host environment produce an “antibiotic-tolerant”
                    state. We have tested this hypothesis by identifying the bacterial pathways
                    responsible for slowing the growth and metabolism of <italic>Mycobacterium
                        tuberculosis</italic> in response to stress. We found that diverse
                    growth-limiting stresses trigger a common signal transduction pathway that slows
                    bacterial growth by redirecting cellular carbon fluxes away from central
                    metabolic pathways and towards storage. Disruption of this metabolic switch
                    increased the antibiotic sensitivity of the bacterium during infection,
                    verifying that this response significantly contributes to antibiotic tolerance
                    and suggesting new strategies for accelerating therapy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Over fifty years after the discovery of antimycobacterial drugs,
                    <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> remains an endemic pathogen
                throughout much of the world. Based on immunological tests, one-third of the global
                population has been exposed to this organism, which sickens 10 million and kills 2
                million yearly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-World1">[1]</xref>.
                Arguably, the most important factor limiting TB control efforts is the remarkably
                long antibiotic regimen that is necessary to eradicate the pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Salomon1">[2]</xref>. Despite the
                availability of drugs that rapidly kill the bacterium in vitro, treatment with these
                agents requires at least 6 mo. Incomplete treatment is both ineffective and promotes
                the selection of drug-resistant strains.</p>
      <p>The reasons that antibiotics are less effective in vivo remain unclear but likely
                reflect the altered metabolic state of the bacterium in this environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Gomez1">[3]</xref>. In the mammalian
                host, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> is challenged by a variety
                of pressures, including low oxygen, iron limitation, low pH, and changes in nutrient
                availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-DeVoss1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Pandey1">[7]</xref>. In vitro, many bacteria respond to similar environmental
                stresses by arresting their growth and assuming a quiescent or dormant state in
                which they remain viable until the environment once again becomes favorable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Hayes1">[8]</xref>. Similarly,
                    <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> dramatically reduces both its growth and
                metabolic activity in chronically infected animals, doubling only once every 100 h
                or more <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Gill1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-MunozElias1">[10]</xref>. Since
                virtually all antibiotics preferentially kill rapidly replicating bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Gomez1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Tomasz1">[11]</xref>, it has been
                hypothesized that the reduced growth and metabolic activity of these quiescent
                populations is responsible for the “antibiotic-tolerance” observed
                during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Mitchison1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While the physiologic state of these slowly replicating mycobacterial populations in
                vivo is difficult to investigate directly, in vitro models have been developed to
                mimic this condition. The best defined of these models is long-term hypoxic culture,
                which has been proposed to mimic the oxygen tension found in some TB lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Rao1">[13]</xref>. When <italic>M.
                    tuberculosis</italic> is cultured under oxygen-limiting conditions, this
                obligate aerobe ceases replicating and adopts an antibiotic-tolerant state that can
                be maintained almost indefinitely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Corper1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Wayne1">[15]</xref>. While macromolecular synthesis slows dramatically during
                this period, continual ATP production is required for survival, indicating that
                cellular metabolism remains at least nominally active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Rao1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Taken together, these observations indicate that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is
                able to adopt a relatively quiescent antibiotic-tolerant state both in vitro and
                within the host. Previous efforts to eradicate nonreplicating bacterial populations
                have generally focused on the development of drugs that directly kill these
                organisms. As an alternative to this approach, we sought to define the bacterial
                functions that govern mycobacterial growth and could therefore be manipulated to
                increase drug sensitivity. In this work, we define a functional pathway that enables
                the bacterium to reduce its metabolic rate in response to environmental stress.
                Mutants lacking this regulatory pathway remain markedly more sensitive to
                antibiotics during infection, demonstrating that this specific response contributes
                to the antibiotic tolerance observed in vivo.</p>

        <p>To understand the mechanisms controlling the growth of <italic>M.
                        tuberculosis</italic> during infection, we sought to identify mutants that
                    had lost the ability to arrest their growth and continued to replicate in
                    hypoxic culture. We subjected a library of transposon mutants to a low oxygen
                    environment sufficient to arrest the growth of wild type <italic>M.

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Via1">[6]</xref> and used
                    transposon site hybridization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Sassetti1">[16]</xref> to identify the set of mutants that were
                    overrepresented after 6 wk of culture, suggesting a growth or survival
                    advantage.</p>
        <p>Prominent among the 34 identified genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s009">Table S1</xref>) were several predicted to encode
                    the enzymes necessary to produce triacylglycerol (TAG) from glycerol and
                    acyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The
                    gene that appeared to play the most important role, <italic>tgs1</italic>,
                    encodes a well-characterized TAG synthase that represents the dominant
                    triglyceride synthetic activity under hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Sirakova1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Daniel1">[18]</xref>. The importance of the
                        <italic>tgs1</italic> gene under this condition is likely due to its
                    transcriptional induction via the DosR regulator, which controls the earliest
                    response to hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Park1">[19]</xref>. Consistent with the known regulatory relationship
                    between <italic>tgs1</italic> and DosR, our genetic screen also indicated that
                        <italic>dosR</italic> mutants were overrepresented in the library exposed to
                    hypoxia. The similar phenotypes of mutants lacking virtually every step in this
                    pathway indicated that DosR-triggered TAG accumulation was critical for
                    hypoxia-induced growth arrest.</p>

        <p>To verify the predictions of our genetic screen, we generated a mutant lacking
                    the <italic>tgs1</italic> gene. In aerated broth cultures, both wild type and
                        Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutant bacteria accumulated only small amounts of
                    TAG and grew at similar rates (unpublished data). However, when these bacteria
                    were cultured in sealed vials to produce hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Wayne1">[15]</xref>, the
                        Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutant failed to accumulate the TAG observed in
                    wild type or complemented mutant cells and grew to a density that was 10-fold
                    higher than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g001">Figure
                        1B</xref>). To confirm that the Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutant continued
                    to replicate under hypoxia, we calculated the doubling time of the bacteria by
                    quantifying the segregation of an unstable plasmid that was lost at a constant
                    rate per cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Gill1">[9]</xref>. Indeed, while wild type bacteria completely arrested
                    growth once hypoxia was established, the Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutant
                    continued to replicate for at least 14 more days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Even between 14 and 21 d, when
                    the total number of Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> bacteria did not change
                    significantly, the cells continued to segregate the plasmid. This confirmed that
                    the Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> strain was unable to arrest its growth, and even
                    the apparent stasis of this strain represented a state of balanced growth and
                    death. While the cause of death remains uncertain, the cytosolic ATP
                    concentration of the mutant decreased as oxygen was consumed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s002">Figure S2</xref>),

                    synthesis might modulate growth under multiple conditions. Indeed, we found that
                    while each of these conditions retarded the growth of wild type bacteria and the
                    complemented mutant, the Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> strain continued to grow at

                    this regulator had not been shown to act in these other conditions. To determine
                    if the same regulatory circuit was operational, we used a reporter derived from

                    induced by low pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Induction under these conditions
                    is likely due to the recently described activation of DosR by alterations in

        <title>TAG Synthesis Inhibits Growth by Reducing TCA Flux</title>
        <p>When <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> or related environmental bacteria are
                    exposed to stress, they accumulate large cytosolic stores of triglycerides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Garton1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Waltermann1">[24]</xref>. This
                    dramatic production of lipid suggested that the growth regulatory effects of
                        <italic>tgs1</italic> induction might be due to the wholesale redirection of
                    carbon flux into TAG synthesis and away from intermediary metabolic pathways.
                    Since acetyl CoA is a primary substrate of both the TCA cycle and TAG synthesis,
                    we hypothesized that TAG production lowered the growth and metabolic rate of the
                    organism by directly competing for this metabolite (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s001">Figure
                    S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Acetyl CoA is incorporated into the TCA cycle by citrate synthase, which
                    condenses it with oxaloacetate (OAA) to form citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To test whether TAG synthesis
                    competes with citrate synthase for acetyl CoA, we supplied wild type <italic>M.

                    citrate synthase activity by increasing substrate concentration. As anticipated,
                    this treatment mimicked the Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutation by enhancing
                    growth in both hypoxic and iron-restricted cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g002">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s004">S4</xref>). Other
                    related metabolites had no effect on growth, supporting the conclusion that OAA
                    enhances growth under these conditions by stimulating citrate synthase

        <p>Similarly, we tested this model by overexpressing the <italic>citA</italic> gene,
                    encoding citrate synthase. This excess enzyme activity appeared to effectively
                    compete for acetyl CoA, as the overexpression strain
                    (<italic>citA</italic>*) resembled the Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutant in
                    both hypoxic and low iron culture; that is, bacteria continued to grow and
                    failed to accumulate TAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g002">Figure
                        2B,C</xref>). Both <italic>citA</italic> overexpression and oxaloacetate
                    addition in hypoxic conditions appeared to have an even more pronounced effect
                    than <italic>tgs1</italic> deletion, as the viability of these cultures
                    decreased more rapidly than the Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> strain once oxygen
                    was depleted.</p>
        <p>To verify that titrating the flux between these two competing pathways produced
                    the expected changes in growth rate, we employed a small molecule inhibitor of
                    TAG degradation. The accumulation of TAG is antagonized by cellular lipases that
                    release the acyl chains for degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, we expected that inhibiting
                    this reverse, lipase-dependent, pathway would promote carbon accumulation in TAG
                    and thereby inhibit growth under stress. To test this prediction, we added
                    tetrahydrolipostatin (THL), a broad-spectrum lipase inhibitor, to bacteria
                    cultured under conditions that induce TAG synthesis and retard growth. As
                    predicted, the addition of THL caused a dose-dependent decrease in the growth of
                    wild type, but not <italic>tgs1</italic>-deficient, bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g002">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s005">S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, to directly demonstrate that the TCA cycle and TAG synthesis compete for
                    the same carbon pool, we quantified the relative rates of carbon flux into these
                    two pathways by metabolic labeling with [<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate.
                    Under hypoxic conditions, we found that the deletion of <italic>tgs1</italic>
                    and overexpression of <italic>citA</italic> had a similar effect. Both
                    manipulations increased acetate flux into CO<sub>2</sub> via the TCA cycle, at
                    the expense of TAG production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). The antagonistic effect of TAG synthesis on TCA flux was
                    independently verified by monitoring the abundance of amino acids, which
                    represent relatively stable markers of the TCA activity. We found that the
                    intracellular concentrations of lysine, threonine, and alanine, amino acids
                    derived from oxaloacetate or affected by its turnover, were decreased in wild
                    type bacteria as they lowered their metabolic activity during adaptation to
                    hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s006">Figure
                        S6</xref>). In contrast, deletion of <italic>tgs1</italic> or overexpression
                    of <italic>citA</italic> reversed this decline, verifying that TCA activity
                    remained relatively high in these strains. In sum, the opposing effects of the
                    Tgs1 and CitA enzymes on both growth and carbon flux indicate that TAG
                    production restricts the growth of wild type bacteria by diverting carbon away
                    from growth-promoting pathways such as the TCA cycle.</p>

        <title>Modulation of Carbon Fluxes Can Reverse Antibiotic Tolerance In Vitro and In
                    Vivo</title>
        <p>Since decreased metabolic activity generally correlates with lower antibiotic
                    efficacy, we speculated that TAG synthesis might contribute to the drug-tolerant
                    phenotype induced by stress. We tested this hypothesis using in vitro conditions
                    that trigger TAG accumulation. Indeed, we found that the
                        Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutant remained significantly more sensitive to a
                    variety of antibiotics under tolerance-inducing conditions such as hypoxia and
                    iron limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g003">Figure 3</xref>).
                    The antibiotics used were chemically distinct and targeted diverse cellular
                    pathways, suggesting that the general hypersensitivity of the
                        Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> bacteria was due to a fundamental alteration in
                    cellular metabolism. As expected, the increased multidrug-susceptibility of the
                        Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutant was much less pronounced under favorable
                    growth conditions in which this gene is not induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s007">Figure S7</xref>).
                    Under these conditions, the mutant was no more susceptible than wild type to any
                    of the drugs tested, except the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor, isoniazid (INH).
                    We conclude that while TAG synthesis may influence INH sensitivity through
                    multiple mechanisms, the multidrug susceptibility of the
                        Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutant is due to a general increase in growth
                    rate and/or metabolic activity. This conclusion was supported by the remarkable
                    antibiotic sensitivity of the <italic>citA</italic>* strain that we observed
                    in tolerance-inducing cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This strain was killed even more rapidly than the
                        Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutant, verifying that metabolic rate is a major

                    required for antibiotic tolerance in vivo. The Δ<italic>tgs1</italic>
                    mutation did not overtly disrupt the physiology of the bacterium in vivo, as
                    only subtle defects in bacterial viability were observed in mice infected with
                    the mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Despite this apparently normal behavior, the metabolic
                    state of the mutant was clearly different from wild type, as the
                        Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> strain remained significantly more sensitive to
                    several antibiotic regimens targeting different cellular functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with a
                    central role for TCA activity in antibiotic tolerance in vivo, we found that
                    overexpressing citrate synthase had a more pronounced effect. The
                        <italic>citA</italic>* strain displayed a modest growth or survival
                    defect in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001065-g004">Figures 4A,B</xref>

                    indicating that increased TCA flux under these conditions decreased overall
                    fitness. More importantly, this strain remained even more sensitive to
                    antibiotics during infection than the Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> mutant, as we
                    had previously observed under in vitro stress conditions. After 28 d of
                    monotherapy, the number of viable wild bacteria had only decreased 20-fold,
                    while the number of viable <italic>citA</italic> overexpressors was reduced

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Many organisms accumulate TAG in preparation for long periods of inactivity.
                Previously, this response had been largely thought to serve a carbon storage
                function, allowing the rapid restoration of metabolism upon resuscitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Daniel1">[18]</xref>. More recently,
                it has been proposed that TAG synthesis may be important for redox homeostasis in
                cells with low respiratory activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Leistikow1">[26]</xref>. In addition to these
                potential functions, we now show that TAG synthesis represents an active stress
                response that can play a causal role in governing growth, metabolic rate, and
                antibiotic susceptibility by redirecting cellular carbon fluxes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Reducing metabolic rate in response to stress is likely to be advantageous for a
                variety of reasons. In the most general terms, continual growth under conditions
                lacking a critical nutrient or cofactor can result in catastrophic imbalances in
                cellular metabolism, as we observed in the hypoxia model. While the
                    Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> and <italic>citA</italic>* strains have a
                temporary fitness advantage over wild type bacteria in hypoxia, these mutants are
                unable to sustain this advantage due to an increased rate of cell death. A similar
                failure to reduce metabolic activity under growth-limiting stress also resulted in
                the attenuation of the <italic>citA</italic>* strain in vivo.</p>
      <p>An additional important consequence of the low metabolic rate of <italic>M.
                    tuberculosis</italic> during infection is decreased antibiotic sensitivity. We
                found that the redirection of carbon into TAG synthesis was critical for assuming
                this antibiotic tolerant phenotype under a variety of different in vitro and in vivo
                stresses. As anticipated, antibiotic sensitivity was correlated with replication
                rate under many conditions, but this correlation was not absolute. For example,
                increased replication could not account for the heightened susceptibility of the
                    <italic>citA</italic>* strain relative to the Δ<italic>tgs1</italic>
                mutant in vitro, as both strains appeared to grow similarly at the time of
                treatment. Replication rate alone was also unlikely to account for the
                hypersensitivity of these strains in vivo. We did not observe increased numbers of
                viable bacteria in the tissues of mice infected with Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> or
                    <italic>citA</italic>* strains and were unable to detect progressive
                histopathology or the accumulation of bacterial chromosomes by quantitative PCR
                (unpublished data) that would be anticipated if continual growth and death were
                occurring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-MunozElias1">[10]</xref>. Thus, we conclude that the increased metabolic activity
                (i.e., TCA flux) of these strains reversed the general antibiotic tolerance induced
                in vivo, even though replication was effectively suppressed by the combination of
                stresses produced by host immunity. Many antibiotics kill bacteria not by inhibiting
                a specific cellular target but by producing toxic metabolic byproducts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Kohanski1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-vanStelten1">[29]</xref>. Most of
                these products, particularly reactive oxygen species, are produced in a
                TCA-dependent manner in antibiotic-treated bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Kohanski1">[27]</xref>, suggesting that the drug
                sensitivity of the more metabolically active Δ<italic>tgs1</italic> and
                    <italic>citA</italic>* strains was likely due to the increased production of
                toxic intermediates.</p>
      <p>Despite the central role played by the <italic>tgs1</italic> gene in restricting
                growth under a number of environmental stresses, the induction of this gene is
                certainly not the only mechanism regulating metabolic rate in response to stress.
                The observation that citrate synthase overexpression has a quantitatively larger
                effect than <italic>tgs1</italic> deletion suggests that this enzyme may compete
                with multiple redundant acetyl CoA-consuming pathways of which Tgs1-mediated TAG
                synthesis is only one. Indeed, we identified a second TAG synthase in our genetic
                screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s009">Table
                    S1</xref>) that is also likely to contribute to metabolic regulation. In
                addition, mycobacteria are known to accumulate glycogen upon nitrogen starvation
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Elbein1">[30]</xref>, and
                increased flux into the gluconeogenic pathway could also consume acetyl CoA and
                limit metabolism. Thus, while <italic>tgs1</italic> plays an indispensable role in
                limiting mycobacterial growth under the DosR-stimulating conditions described here,
                it is likely that other pathways contribute under different conditions. A number of
                additional genes, such as those encoding both succinate- and pyruvate dehydrogenase,
                were identified in our screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001065.s009">Table S1</xref>). Further study will be required to
                determine if these enzymes also act by redirecting carbon fluxes or if distinct
                mechanisms are responsible.</p>
      <p>The propensity for mycobacteria to accumulate TAG in response to stress has been
                described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Garton1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001065-Deb1">[31]</xref>, but the physiological role of this response has remained
                unclear. Our work demonstrates that TAG synthesis represents an active stress
                response in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that promotes antibiotic tolerance both
                in vitro and in vivo by reducing growth and metabolic activity. This supports the
                hypothesis that quiescent bacterial populations are responsible for the relative
                inefficacy of antibiotics in vivo. We suggest that the manipulation of these
                metabolic regulatory pathways might represent a novel strategy to improve antibiotic
                efficacy, once the consequences of such an intervention on pathogenesis and the
                acquisition of drug resistance are more thoroughly understood.</p>

                    were plated on 7H10 agar to enumerate CFU. The indicated groups of mice were
                    treated with antibiotics beginning at 4 wk of postinfection. Drug was delivered
                        <italic>ad libitum</italic> by adding the following concentrations to
                    drinking water: 100 µg/ml INH, 600 µg/ml EMB, and 600 µg/ml
                    Pyrazinamide (PZA, MP Biomedicals). All drug-containing water was replaced
                    weekly. Water consumption was monitored to determine the delivered daily dose
                    (INH: 26.5±0.9 mg/kg, PZA and EMB: 132.6±4.7 mg/kg). No
                    significant difference in consumption was observed between groups. To measure
                    CFU in drug-treated mice, the bacteria in organ homogenates were pelleted by
                    centrifugation and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-80 before
                    plating.</p>

          <p>Competing acetyl CoA utilizing pathways modulate growth and antibiotic
                        sensitivity in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Under favorable growth
                        conditions, nutritional carbon is efficiently incorporated into central
                        metabolic pathways, such as the TCA cycle, fueling growth by providing the
                        cell with energy and biosynthetic precursors. Under these conditions, the
                        bacterium is sensitive to antibiotics, which preferentially target rapidly
                        metabolizing cells. A variety of environmental stresses trigger expression
                        of the DosR regulon, leading to the expression of the <italic>tgs1</italic>
                        gene and the conversion of mono- and di-acylglycerol (“MAG” and
                        “DAG”) into TAG. This response redirects the flow of carbon away
                        from growth-promoting pathways and into fatty acid synthesis, effectively
                        retarding the growth and metabolic activity of the organism. Under these
                        conditions, the low growth and metabolic activity of the organism renders it
                        relatively insensitive, or “tolerant” to antibiotics.
                        Genetically manipulating the flux of carbon between these two competing
                        pathways alters both the growth rate and antibiotic sensitivity of
                            <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p>
