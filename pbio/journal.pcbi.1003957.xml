<abstract>
<p>In multicellular organism development, a stochastic cellular response is observed, even when a population of cells is exposed to the same environmental conditions. Retrieving the spatiotemporal regulatory mode hidden in the heterogeneous cellular behavior is a challenging task. The G1/S transition observed in cell cycle progression is a highly stochastic process. By taking advantage of a fluorescence cell cycle indicator, Fucci technology, we aimed to unveil a hidden regulatory mode of cell cycle progression in developing zebrafish. Fluorescence live imaging of Cecyil, a zebrafish line genetically expressing Fucci, demonstrated that newly formed notochordal cells from the posterior tip of the embryonic mesoderm exhibited the red (G1) fluorescence signal in the developing notochord. Prior to their initial vacuolation, these cells showed a fluorescence color switch from red to green, indicating G1/S transitions. This G1/S transition did not occur in a synchronous manner, but rather exhibited a stochastic process, since a mixed population of red and green cells was always inserted between newly formed red (G1) notochordal cells and vacuolating green cells. We termed this mixed population of notochordal cells, the G1/S transition window. We first performed quantitative analyses of live imaging data and a numerical estimation of the probability of the G1/S transition, which demonstrated the existence of a posteriorly traveling regulatory wave of the G1/S transition window. To obtain a better understanding of this regulatory mode, we constructed a mathematical model and performed a model selection by comparing the results obtained from the models with those from the experimental data. Our analyses demonstrated that the stochastic G1/S transition window in the notochord travels posteriorly in a periodic fashion, with doubled the periodicity of the neighboring paraxial mesoderm segmentation. This approach may have implications for the characterization of the pathophysiological tissue growth mode.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cell cycle progression is considered to involve a cellular time-counting machinery for proper morphogenesis and patterning of tissues. Therefore, it is important to understand the regulatory mode of cell cycle progression during physiological and pathological tissue growth, which will benefit tissue engineering therapy and tumor diagnosis. Since cell cycle progression is a highly variable process, it is a challenging task to retrieve the spatiotemporal regulatory mode hidden in heterogeneous cellular behavior. To overcome this issue, we took advantage of live imaging analyses with a fluorescence cell cycle indicator, Fucci technology, and mathematical modeling of developing zebrafish fish embryo as a model system of growing tissue. Our result demonstrated that the developmental growth of embryonic axis progressed in a rhythmic fashion. The presented analyses will benefit the characterization of the regulatory mode of tissue growth, in both physiological and pathological development, such as that involving tumor formation, thus may contribute to cancer diagnosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of multicellular organisms is a highly coordinated process, in which cell proliferation and sequential changes in cellular identities are spatiotemporally regulated, through which patterned tissues and organs are ultimately formed. As a system to ensure the precision and reproducibility of the developmental process, the concept of “intrinsic time” has been postulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Johnson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-West1">[2]</xref>. Cell cycle progression has long been considered to involve a cellular time-counting machinery for proper morphogenesis and patterning of tissues. This notion is fundamentally supported by observations of increased mitotic activity in populations of cells that transiently appear during the developmental process. The presence of temporal waves of mitotic activity in the developing limb mesenchyme is reported to correlate with a segmented skeletal pattern, thus possibly accommodating the positioning of bones and joints in limbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Lewis1">[3]</xref>. In addition, a clustered mitotic activity observed in the endoderm are proposed to be responsible for morphogenetic folding to form the digestive tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Miller1">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, periodic surges of mitotic activity in the paraxial mesoderm have been repeatedly observed in concert with reiterate somite formation in embryonic tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Stern1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Venters1">[7]</xref>. Since somites principally endow a segmented architecture to the axial skeleton and its associated muscles and neurons, timed machineries of somite formation provide a fundamental system for body plan and anatomical structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Benazeraf1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Iimura1">[10]</xref>. The periodic formation of somites is regulated by the segmentation clock, which exhibits an oscillatory expression of signaling molecules related to Notch, Wnt and Fgf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Pourquie1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Cooke1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Palmeirim1">[14]</xref>. Though it has been proposed that cell cycle progression regulates periodic somite formation, as described above, the current findings argue against the idea that the cell cycle clock is involved as an oscillator of the segmentation clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Zhang1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Gomez1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is well established that cell cycle progression is a highly variable process. A phenomenological description of the stochastic cell cycle progression has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Shields1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Zetterberg2">[22]</xref>, and mathematical models that account for the variable transition timing in cell cycle progression have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Smith1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Shields2">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Spencer1">[30]</xref>. Based on <italic>in vitro</italic> observations of mammalian cell cultures, a conceptual framework of “the restriction point” of the G1/S transition has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Zetterberg2">[22]</xref>. The restriction point divides the G1 phase into the G1-postmitosis phase (G1-pm) and the G1-pre S phase (G1-ps), in which cells are able to proliferate dependent and independent of mitotic stimuli, respectively. G1-pm is highly constant in time length (approximately three hours), while the duration of G1-ps varies considerably. The restriction point is currently understood to extend the timing of phosphorylation of Rb proteins by Cyclin D1, thus releasing E2F in order to initiate S phase entry. Mathematical modeling analyses have also suggested a bistable mechanism to control the restriction point in the mammalian G1/S transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Aguda1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Thron1">[35]</xref>. Yao et al., experimentally demonstrated bistable E2F activation that directly correlated with the ability of a cell to traverse the restriction point by temporally monitoring the E2F transcriptional activity with stimuli of various magnitudes, thus validating that the RB-E2F pathway involving multiple positive feedback loops can generate bistability; namely, by forming the Rb-E2F bistable switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Yao1">[36]</xref>. This Rb-E2F bistable switch is further extended to work even when subjected to noise, which supported the proposed models to account for the temporal variability in the G1-S transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Lee1">[37]</xref>. In this stochastic model, both cellular intrinsic and extrinsic noise can be taken into account. The intrinsic noise results from the stochastic nature of biochemical interactions due to the stochastic gene expression levels in each single cell, while the extrinsic noise arises from heterogeneous properties of a cell, such as the cell's size, shape, cell cycle phase and cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Elowitz1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Volfson1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>Generally, during <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue development, biochemical phenomena are intrinsically associated with stochasticity, in which fluctuations in cellular responses are observed in populations of cells exposed to the same environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Elowitz1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Ozbudak1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Aoki1">[47]</xref>. In multicellular organism development, heterogeneous cellular behavior, such as the G1/S transition, possibly blinds regulatory events. Therefore, it is relevant to develop novel approaches to numerically estimate noise strength or the probability of a stochastic cellular response in multicellular organisms, which would unveil a regulatory mode of tissue growth associated with morphogenesis and patterning. Our research group previously reported the findings of whole-view imaging of cell cycle progression during embryonic development obtained using fluorescence live imaging of Cecyil, a zebrafish line that genetically carries a fluorescence cell cycle indicator, Fucci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Sugiyama1">[48]</xref>. The Fucci system applies ubiquitin-based cell cycle phase-specific oscillators that are fused to distinct colored fluorescence proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-SakaueSawano1">[49]</xref>, which demarcates cell nuclei in the G1 and S/G2/M phases in red and green, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figures 1A, B</xref>). By taking advantage of the Fucci system, this study aimed to establish a method to clarify the regulatory mode of cell cycle progression veiled in the stochastic behavior of developing tissue. Quantitative analyses of our live imaging data combined with mathematical modeling demonstrated that the stochastic G1/S transition window in the notochord travels posteriorly in a periodic fashion with doubled periodicity of neighboring paraxial mesoderm segmentation. The results of our analyses are expected to benefit the characterization of the regulatory mode of tissue growth, in both physiological and pathological development, such as that involving tumor formation.</p>

<title>Cecyil revealed that the G1/S transition in notochordal cells is associated with progressive somite segmentation and body axis elongation</title>
<p>Mid-sagittal optical sections of fixed Cecyil embryos counterstained with phalloidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and live observation of fluorescence and DIC (differential interference contrast) images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1 D to K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003957.s010">Movie S1</xref>) demonstrated that morphological differentiation of notochordal cells is associated with cell cycle progression. Newly formed notochordal cells in the posterior region expressed intense red fluorescence signals in their nuclei, being arranged to form two arrays of red cells. These cells arose from their precursor pools of chord neural hinges that comprised a mixture populations of dark-red cells and green cells (indicated by the sky blue arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1 D to K</xref>), suggesting that G1 entry is tightly related to initial notochord formation. The second color switches of the Fucci signals (G1 red to S/G2/M green, indicated by the red and green arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1 D to K</xref>) were observed prior to the initiation of cell vacuolization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1C</xref>); therefore, this initial G1/S transition is possibly required for notochord differentiation. In most of the observations, we observed a mixed population of green and red cells between the anterior green cells and posterior red cells, possibly suggesting the stochastic behavior of the G1/S transition in each cell. Therefore, we termed this mixed population of green and red cells the G1/S transition window. As embryonic development progressed, the G1/S transition window moved posteriorly by following the direction of body axis elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1 F to K</xref>). Comparing the DIC and fluorescence images, we mapped the position of a newly formed somite (indicated by the blue arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1 F to K</xref>) and that of the G1/S transition window (red and green arrowheads). This observation indicated that the initial G1/S transition is always observed at a position posterior to newly formed somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These findings suggest that the regulatory mode of the G1/S transition in notochordal cells is related to progressive modes of embryonic body axis elongation and somite segmentation.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Scoring the mode of G1/S transition in notochordal cells</title>
<p>In order to quantitatively analyze the mode of G1/S transition in notochordal cells, we digitalized two cellular states, the G1 and S/G2/M phase, using image processing. We initially tracked each single notochordal cell by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the red and green signals in live imaging data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1J</xref> shows the representative tracking data of a single cell indicated by the white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1 G to H</xref>. The time point of the G1/S transition was determined as the crossing point of the red and green lines of the fluorescence intensity, which occurred at 115 minutes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1J</xref>. For details, please see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section.</p>
<p>Based on this method, we next plotted the binary valued cellular states of the upper (dorsal) and lower (ventral) columns of cells in a single dimension of the anterior to posterior position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003957.s011">Movie S2</xref>). This plotting was then applied to succeeding time lapse images. Therefore, the second dimension was introduced in order to demonstrate the temporal dynamics of the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, the spatial positions of the G1/S transition were observed to overtly progress posteriorly, although the transition in each cell did not occur in the exact order of their position, but rather in a stochastic fashion. When the total number of green and red cells was scored at each time point, it was obvious that the stochastic G1/S transition progressed posteriorly as time progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), although the modes of the upper and lower cells were not entirely synchronized.</p>

<p>In order to further investigate the mode of this stochastic G1/S transition in more detail, we focused on spatiotemporal changes in a mixed population of red and green cells that demarcated the stochastic G1/S transition window.

<title>Model establishment and estimation of the probability of G1/S transition</title>
<p>In order to unveil a possible regulatory mode of the G1/S transition in notochordal cells, we employed a mathematical modeling approach. The model was constructed according to a Markov process describing the stochastic transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. At each time step <italic>t</italic>, a cell undergoes the G1/S transition with a probability <italic>αΔt</italic> over a short time interval <italic>Δt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The spatial position of the notochordal cells is represented as a one-dimensional lattice in the order of anterior to posterior (left to right, respectively, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Each cell in the lattice is identified by an index <italic>i</italic> (<italic>i</italic> = <italic>1,…,n</italic>). Based on our biological observations described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g001">Figure 1</xref>, we assumed the presence of a regulatory wave that conveys a signaling cue to promote the G1/S transition in notochordal cells in a stochastic fashion. This signaling cue on a single dimensional axis is controlled by the signal transmitting function <italic>f(i,t)</italic> of <italic>t</italic> and <italic>i</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). By introducing a tuning parameter <italic>z</italic> in <italic>f(i,t)</italic>, we were able to examine how the probability affects the distinct mode of the regulatory cue (for details, see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). In other words, <italic>z</italic> corresponds to the step size, which is defined by the width of a given number cells. For example, in the model of <italic>z</italic> = 8, the step size is the total width of eight cells. Based on our observations described above, we assumed modes of continuously traveling waves (continuous mode) and periodically traveling waves (periodic modes) with different periodicity.</p>

<p>In the deterministic cell cycle progression, i.e. <italic>αΔt = 1</italic>, without fluctuation, the continuous wave model (<italic>z</italic> = 1) exhibited a linear mode of progression in the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003957.s004">Figures S4A and S4C</xref>). Meanwhile, in the periodic models (a model of <italic>z</italic> = 8 with 30 minutes periodicity is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g004">Figure 4C</xref> as an example), the G1/S transition progressed in a step-wise mode (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003957.s004">Figures S4B and S4C</xref>). Under these conditions, the spatial positions of the ARC and PGC always coincided with each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003957.s004">Figure S4D</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to introduce stochasticity into the model, i.e. <italic>αΔt</italic>&lt;1, we estimated the range of probability, <italic>αΔt</italic>. Based on our analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, the timing of the G1/S transition is not tightly affected by the cell cycle phase of neighboring cells. Therefore, the time differences of S phase entry between the upper and lower cells allowed us to estimate the probability range. A set of time differences in S phase entry was computed for all tracked cells in three individual specimens, and the probability distribution was subsequently obtained by summing all of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, histogram). For curve fitting, we theoretically derived the probability distribution function for the time difference based on two independent Bernoulli processes (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). By fitting the parameter with experimental data, we estimated that <italic>αΔt</italic> = 0.1101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, red line), suggesting that the plausible parameter space is located around <italic>αΔt</italic> = 0.1, which specifically means that approximately 10% of cells would exhibit S phase entry in <italic>Δt</italic> = (2.5 minutes) of a single time lap of the imaging transition (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). Therefore, we hereafter set the parameter as <italic>αΔt</italic> = 0.1 and examined the system behavior around this value.</p>

<p>In order to dissociate the continuous mode from periodic modes regulating the stochastic G1/S transition, we next quantified the positions of the PGC and ARC in these <italic>in silico</italic> simulations. Consequently, the temporal changes in the position of the PGC under the periodic mode appeared to retain its step-wise progression pattern compared to that observed under the continuous mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, green lines and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003957.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>), while the position of the ARC exhibited a largely fluctuating pattern under both of these regulatory waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, red lines, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003957.s005">Figure S5C and S5D</xref>). Therefore, we decided to perform a detailed analysis of the progressive mode of the PGC position by measuring the time interval from the appearance time of a PGC to that of the next PGC. An example of the calculation procedure of the time interval of the PGC is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003957.s006">Figure S6</xref>. A set of the interval is first computed from a simulation result, after which the probability distribution is obtained. The probability distribution of three different simulations, the continuous model (<italic>z</italic> = 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), periodic model (<italic>z</italic> = 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and two-fold periodic model (<italic>z</italic> = 16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) are subsequently calculated. In the continuous model, the time interval is concentrated on a smaller range (&lt;20 min), and the frequency decreases as the time interval increases. The probability extends to a larger range around 20–40 minutes in the periodic model and extends further and persists up to 60 minutes in the two-fold periodic model. On the other hand, the same analyses of the ARC exhibited no apparent differences between the distributions obtained from three distinct simulation models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003957.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Therefore, these analyses indicated that measuring the time interval of PGC reflects the regulatory mode of the stochastic G1/S transition and that the probability distribution function can be used to provide discrimination information in order to analyze the regulatory mode of stochastic changes.</p>

The mean KL distance values of the periodic models were smaller than those of the continuous model, indicating that the hypothesis of the periodic G1/S transition is likely. Among these periodic models, the two-fold periodic model had the lowest KL distance value. In order to validate our simulations, we carried out sensitivity analyses varying the transition probability <italic>αΔt</italic>, with a range from 0.07 to 0.12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g006">Figure 6F</xref>) and the number of cells constituting a single somite width modified from eight to seven cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003957.s009">Figure S9</xref>); the obtained results did not affect the conclusions.

Once notochordal cells are formed from their precursor pool located at the tip of an embryo, the cells in the G1 phase shown in red are arranged in a line. In the next step, a group of G1 cells enters the S phase. This G1/S transition is temporally stochastic; therefore, a mixed population of green and red cells is established between a group of posterior red cells and a group of anterior green cells, which we described as the G1/S transition window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g008">Figure 8B i</xref>). In this window, an increasing number of G1 cells enters the S phase shown in green; therefore, this region is eventually filled with green cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g008">Figure 8B ii</xref>). In the subsequent cycle, the next G1/S transition window shifts a width of 16 cells (two somite widths) posteriorly, thus establishing a new window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g008">Figure 8B iii</xref>).

<title>Quantitative data acquisition from live imaging</title>
<p>Based on the live imaging data of the developing Cecyil embryos, numerical conversion of the G1/S transition in notochordal cells was carried out using concomitant tracking of the cell fates and changes in the fluorescence intensity of the red and green Fucci signals. As previously described, live imaging of Cecyil embryos provides an almost entire view of morphogenetic cellular movement and cell cycle transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Sugiyama1">[48]</xref>. With careful observation and analyses of morphogenetic cellular events in Cecyil embryos, we noticed that the developing notochord is an appropriate organ for our purposes in establishing a modeling approach. Once notochordal cells are formed, they are arrayed as two columns of cells in the anterior to posterior axis in mid-sagittal optical sections. Their cellular movement is much less active than that of other mesodermal tissues; therefore, the precision of cell tracking and enumeration of spatiotemporal mapping of the G1/S transition are highly ensured.</p>

<title>Model establishment</title>
<p>In order to establish a reliable mathematical model to extract the regulatory mode of the G1/S transition in developing multicellular tissue, we employed a transition probability model in which cellular states are simply represented as binary states, the G1 or S phase, and temporal variability in S phase entry originates from a random transition with a fixed probability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Shields1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Zetterberg2">[22]</xref>. The phenomenological model is advantageous, with very few parameters to be measured or inferred in an appropriate manner, although it lacks details in terms of molecular mechanistic insight. The molecular mechanisms underlying the random G1/S transition are currently understood to involve stochasticity in Rb-E2F dynamics, as described by employing stochastic differential equations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Lee1">[37]</xref>. This model demonstrates that the stochastic dynamics in the Rb-E2F model can be quantitatively mapped into phenomenological models. Therefore, we decided to apply a simple transition probability model in order to analyze the dynamics of the G1/S transition based on live imaging data of developing multicellular tissue.</p>
<p>We next investigated the independency or dependency of the timing of S phase entry in cells in the G1/S transition window using a linkage analysis. Comparisons of <italic>in silico</italic> simulations and scoring from the imaging data indicated that the G1/S transition in notochordal cells progresses independently from the cell cycle state of neighboring cells. This analysis interestingly suggested that stochasticity in the cellular response is highly intrinsic, even in populations of developing multicellular tissue affected by regulatory surges. This finding firstly confirms the phenomenological concept of the stochastic G1/S transition in <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue development and helped us to estimate the probability of timing of S phase entry, as discussed in the following paragraph.</p>
<p>We then constructed a mathematical model to describe the regulatory mode of the stochastic G1/S transition in notochordal cells. Seeing that the spatial position of the G1/S transition window is always located between newly formed somites and the posterior tip of the embryo, the presence of a sort of progressive developmental wave that triggers S phase entry was postulated and mathematically represented by introducing the signal transmitting function. Our model here has only one free parameter, that is, the probability of timing of the G1/S transition. This parameter was successfully estimated by fitting the theoretically derived probability distribution function with data obtained from live imaging. The notochord structure is profitable in that we simply plotted the time differences in S phase entry between the upper and lower cells in order to estimate the probability range based on the assumption that the developmental wave travels from anterior to posterior and equally to dorsal and ventral cells. Our strategy of model construction with probability estimation is applicable to cell populations in which the timing of the G1/S transition is tightly affected by the cell cycle state of neighboring cells. However, in that case, an alternative method for parameter estimation is required.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Model selection</title>
<p>With the probability estimation, we conducted model selection by comparing the results obtained from the models with those obtained from the experimental data. We tested several hypothesized models assuming the presence of continuous wave or periodic waves with different periodicity, as reflected in the choice of the tuning parameter <italic>z</italic> of the signal transmitting function. Due to the stochasticity, the boundary of the G1 and S phase cells fluctuated, presenting some difficulty in dissociating the continuous and periodic regulatory mode. For instance, merely counting the temporal changes in the total number of green and red cells did not provide any information about the spatial progressive mode of the G1/S transition window. It is probable that the noise strength numerically estimated in this work completely veiled the spatial information related to a possible regulatory mode in this analysis. Therefore, we focused on the PGC (posterior-most green cell) and ARC (anterior-most red cell). After conducting several trials, the probability distribution in the time interval of the PGC, but not the ARC, was found to provide information regarding a possible regulatory mode. Once the G1/S transition window opens at a given time point of embryonic development, all cells within the window equally acquire the chance to enter the S phase. Among these cells, the cells that immediately traverse the G1/S transition demarcate the spatial position of the newly established window. Therefore, the PGC tends to indicate the posterior end of the window, although this is not always precise, thus implying some information about the possibility of retrieving the progressive mode of the window shift. In contrast to the PGC, the ARC comprises the last cells to traverse the G1/S transition affected by the window at a given time, thus losing the spatio-temporal information of the window. This finding highly contributed to our model selection, which suggests that analyses of immediately responding cells provide clues for inferring possible regulatory modes under stochastic cellular behavior. In order to statistically determine which model represents the most likely scenario, we applied the KL distance, a measurement of the difference between two probability distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Kullback1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Burnham1">[53]</xref>. The KL distance is applied as a discriminant function; therefore, it is often used as a basic tool for model inference and selection. This use of the KL distance enables hypothesized models to be ranked from likely to unlikely, thus allowing for the selection of the most possible regulatory mode. Consequently, the G1/S transition in notochordal cells was found to progress under the influence of periodic developmental waves, and its periodicity is most likely to involve the two-fold period of somite segmentation. We validated this result by employing another method to score the results of the <italic>in silico</italic> simulation. Enumeration of the total number of green cells in the G1/S transition window was applied, as performed in the linkage analysis to analyze the independency of the timing of S phase entry in each cell. The analysis also demonstrated that only periodic waves of the two-fold period of somite segmentation showed stable synchronized oscillation.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3d">
<title>Stepwise posterior shift of the G1/S transition window</title>
<p>Our analyses also clarified that the G1/S transition in notochordal cells posteriorly travels in a stepwise fashion, which appears to be accompanied by embryonic body axis elongation and neighboring paraxial mesoderm segmentation. This finding implies that the G1/S transition regulatory window is reminiscent of the bistability window of the mutual inhibition of FGF and RA signaling, which has been proposed to provide a poised state of segmentation of the paraxial mesoderm as well as initial differentiation of neuronal cells from stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Goldbeter1">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Wilson1">[58]</xref>. Within the bistability window, cells can be triggered to switch between either of the two steady states. This trigger is provided by the periodic signal of the segmentation clock in the paraxial mesoderm. In fact, the occurrence of periodic surges of the G1/S transition of paraxial mesoderm cells at the exact position of the bistability window in chick development has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Venters1">[7]</xref>, although we did not observe a similar phenomenon in the zebrafish paraxial mesoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Sugiyama1">[48]</xref>. However, the periodicity operated in the G1/S transition window is two-fold longer than that of the zebrafish segmentation clock. None of the cyclic patterns of the gene expression have been observed in early notochordal cell development. It has also not yet been elucidated how such an extrinsic bistable switch comprised by FGF and RA gradients affects the intracellular machinery. Therefore, the molecular machinery of the cyclic regulation of the G1/S transition in notochordal cells remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>As it has been reported that a component of the segmentation clock oscillates during chick fore-limb development with a six-hour periodicity that is four-fold longer than that of chick somite segmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Pascoal1">[59]</xref>, a mechanism that multiplies the periodicity composed by Notch signals may exist in developing tissues, potentially linked to periodic surges of cell division, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Lewis1">[3]</xref>. Given that intracellular bistable switches have also been proposed to be involved in the cell cycle phase transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Spencer1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Yao1">[36]</xref>, it is interesting to consider how distinct levels of multiple bistable switches interact to induce dynamic changes in the cellular properties, which may cause phenomenologically described complex modes of periodic entrainment. It would be worthwhile to analyze a model organism in which the activity of intracellular molecules composing a bistable switch, such as Rb and E2F, are genetically modified.</p>
<p>Recently, a Doppler effect has been reported to be involved in zebrafish segmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Soroldoni1">[60]</xref>. Time-lapse observations of the transcriptional activity of <italic>her1</italic>, a component of the segmentation clock, during embryonic development revealed that its oscillation in the posterior portion is slower than that in the anterior part. Since the anterior oscillation is directly linked to the pace of segmentation, the shortening rate of the presomitic mesoderm due to a gradual slowdown in the rate of embryonic body axis elongation may affect the segmentation pace through a Doppler effect. It is possible that the stepwise posterior shift of the G1/S transition window observed in this work was also affected by this Doppler effect. However, this is less obvious, because the G1/S transition window is always located between newly formed segments and the tail tip throughout embryonic development.</p>

<title>Stochasticity in the G1/S transition and its significance</title>
<p>It is relevant to consider how the stochastic G1/S transition would benefit organ development. Vertebrate embryos employ a robust system for developmental pattern formation, with the primary function of establishing a reproducible pattern in a proliferating population of cells. Biological robustness is proposed to be a characteristic required to maintain cell functions in the face of external and internal perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Kitano1">[61]</xref>. The stochasticity observed in molecular and cellular functions can be considered an opposite concept to robustness. For instance, cell proliferation has been reported to serve as a source of noise for the synchronized expression of genes of the segmentation clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Horikawa1">[16]</xref>. However, stochasticity in the cell cycle also provides the mechanical flexibility necessary to adapt to a fluctuating environment and/or respond to sudden changes in environmental cues. Therefore, it is possible that the stochasticity of the G1/S transition in notochordal cells is required to maintain the tissue structure and provide a poised state for subsequent tissue development.</p>

<title>Implications in pathophysiological tissue development based on quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling</title>
<p>Correlations of cell cycle progression in embryonic morphogenesis and organ development have long been proposed based on counts of the number of cells exhibiting mitotic nuclei in tissue sections or three-dimensionally reconstructed fixed tissues. By exploiting fluorescent live imaging of Cecyil embryos with subsequent scoring and mathematical modeling, we successfully extrapolated an unprecedented regulatory pattern of the G1/S transition during early notochord development. It is possible that periodic regulation of cell cycle progression in a group of cells is a common phenomenon and that the stochastic nature of cell cycle progression in developing tissue hinders an unobserved regulatory system. Our approach provides a way to infer the regulatory mode of the stochastic G1/S transition in tissue and organ development. The potential utility of this approach may be applicable, not only for understanding physiological development, but also clarifying mechanisms of pathological tissue development, such as that involving carcinogenesis. Generally, cancer cells are associated with the affected cell cycle mechanism, which may directly or indirectly influence the bistable switch of cell cycle transitions. Therefore, tumor tissue growth can increase the occurrence of the complex or de-regulated mode. The gold standard for cancer classification fundamentally involves microarray-based gene profiling to characterize the cancer signature. The utility of mathematical models of stochastic molecular pathways is also proposed to be applicable for cancer diagnosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Lee1">[37]</xref>. Mathematical models based on experimental studies are proposed to bridge genetics and tumor behavior, with the potential to provide better personalized cancer treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Tyson1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Tyson2">[63]</xref>.

<p><italic>In vivo</italic> time-lapse imaging was carried out as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Sugiyama1">[48]</xref>, with some modifications. Dechorionated embryos were embedded in small holes molded by glass beads (Iuchi BZ-1) on the surface of 1% agarose (Takara L03) solution in E3 medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2 and 0.16 mM MgSO4) and then covered with 0.3% agarose. The chamber encasing the embedded embryos was filled with E3 solution containing Tricaine. Time-lapse 3D imaging was subsequently performed in the xyz-t mode using a confocal upright microscope EZ-C1 system (Nikon, Tokyo) equipped with a water-immersion 16× objective (N.A. 0.8). Two laser lines, 488 nm and 561 nm, were used. Differential interference contrast microscope (DIC) images were concomitantly acquired. The recording interval was 2.5 minutes. At each time point, optical sagittal sections of 27∼34 confocal images along the <italic>z</italic> axis were acquired to access developing notochord tissue located in the deepest embryonic layer. In order to avoid cross-detection of green and orange signals, the images were acquired sequentially at 488 nm and 561 nm. Total eighteen time-lapse imaging data of distinct embryos were obtained. Seven of them were subjected to image processing, and representative data of three distinct embryos were used for modeling analyses.</p>

<p>Optical slices focusing on tissue layers containing notochord tissue at each time point were manually selected, and the time sequence was reconstructed for further image processing. Cell tracking was performed using the Manual Tracking plugin in the ImageJ software program. To ensure recognition of the final position of each notochordal cell, the tracking was conducted in a temporally backward and forward manner. In order to monitor temporal changes in the green and red fluorescence intensity of each cell, we developed a program that automatically averages the signal intensity of a defined area of the nucleus at each time point on sequential images. This program was written in C/C++ for use under Win32 environments. In order to define the timing of the G1/S transition of each cell, the time course of the signal intensity of the green and red fluorescence signals was plotted. The time point of transition was defined as the time at which the intensity of the green signal increased and exceeded that of the red signal continuously five times points.</p>

<title>Mathematical modeling of the stochastic G1/S transition</title>
<p>In order to describe the stochastic cell cycle transition, we developed a mathematical model based on the Markov process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-VanKampen1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003957-Gillespie1">[65]</xref>. When only a single cell is considered, at each time step <italic>t</italic>, a cell undergoes the G1/S transition with a probability <italic>αΔt</italic> within a short time interval <italic>Δt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The backward process of the transition, such as the green (S) to red (G1) transition, is not assumed. The time <italic>t</italic> is measured in units corresponding to the time-lapse interval <italic>Δt</italic> = 2.5 minutes, and the parameter <italic>α</italic> represents the probability of the transition per unit time <italic>Δt</italic>. In a developing notochord, the cells are arrayed along the anterior-posterior axis, and the cell cycle transition progresses from anterior to posterior in a time-dependent manner. In order to model this time-dependent stochastic process on the one-dimensional axis, we introduced the signal transmitting function <italic>f(i,t)</italic> of <italic>t</italic> and <italic>i</italic>, where <italic>i</italic> denotes the cell position along the anterior-posterior axis. The stochastic process is designed such that each cell independently undergoes the G1/S transition with a probability <italic>αΔt</italic>, if the condition <italic>f(i,t)≤0</italic> is satisfied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003957-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The signal transmitting function <italic>f(i,t)</italic> can be written in the following form:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003957.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003957.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>z</italic> is a positive integer, and <italic>t<sub>k</sub></italic> is taken as <italic>t<sub>k</sub> = k L<sub>c</sub> z/(λΔt). L<sub>c</sub></italic> is the diameter of notochordal cells and <italic>λ</italic> is the posterior elongation speed, both of which are estimated from time-lapse imaging data as <italic>L<sub>c</sub></italic> = 5 µm and <italic>λ</italic> = 4/3 µm/min, respectively. Therefore, the number of cells constituting a single somite width is calculated as <italic>T*λ/L<sub>c</sub></italic> = 8, where <italic>T</italic> ( = 30 min) is a period of the segmentation clock. The time-dependent function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003957.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><italic>(t<sub>k</sub>≤t)</italic> is a step function satisfying<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003957.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003957.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>In the numerical simulations, <italic>t<sub>m</sub></italic> should be greater than the maximum simulation time <italic>tmax</italic>; therefore, <italic>m</italic> should be taken so as to be <italic>m&gt;m<sub>c</sub> = λΔt tmax/(L<sub>c</sub>z)</italic>.</p>
<p>Hypothesized models can be obtained by modulating the parameter <italic>z</italic>. We categorized the models into two basic types, “the continuous model” and “the periodic model.” If we take <italic>z</italic> = 1, we can obtain the continuous model in which the external cell cycle cue comes continuously in a spatiotemporally correlated manner. The periodic models are further divided into subtypes based on the cue period. In this case, <italic>z</italic> can be interpreted as the number of cells constituting a single somite width. Hence, if we take <italic>z</italic> = 8, we can obtain the (normal) periodic model in which the signaling cue comes periodically, in concert with the cycle of the segmentation clock. When <italic>z</italic> is taken to be equal to the integral multiple of 8, we have a multifold periodic model in which the period is a multiple of the cycle of the segmentation clock. In this study, we considered the two-fold periodic model (<italic>z</italic> = 16) and three-fold periodic model (<italic>z</italic> = 24).
