<p>The authors propose that short repeat sequences may play an important role in causing the pervasive clustering of mutations across diverse genomes from prokaryotes to humans.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>The genome-sequencing gold rush has facilitated the use of comparative genomics to uncover patterns of genome evolution, although their causal mechanisms remain elusive. One such trend, ubiquitous to prokarya and eukarya, is the association of insertion/deletion mutations (indels) with increases in the nucleotide substitution rate extending over hundreds of base pairs. The prevailing hypothesis is that indels are themselves mutagenic agents. Here, we employ population genomics data from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> to provide evidence suggesting that it is not the indels per se but the sequence in which indels occur that causes the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions. We found that about two-thirds of indels are closely associated with repeat sequences and that repeat sequence abundance could be used to identify regions of elevated sequence diversity, independently of indels. Moreover, the mutational signature of indel-proximal nucleotide substitutions matches that of error-prone DNA polymerases. We propose that repeat sequences promote an increased probability of replication fork arrest, causing the persistent recruitment of error-prone DNA polymerases to specific sequence regions over evolutionary time scales. Experimental measures of the mutation rates of engineered DNA sequences and analyses of experimentally obtained collections of spontaneous mutations provide molecular evidence supporting our hypothesis. This study uncovers a new role for repeat sequences in genome evolution and provides an explanation of how fine-scale sequence contextual effects influence mutation rates and thereby evolution.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>An intriguing observation made during the comparison of genomes is that insertion and deletion mutations (indels) cluster together with nucleotide substitutions. Two (not mutually exclusive) hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. The first postulates that an indel mutation causes an increase in the likelihood of the surrounding sequence incurring nucleotide substitutions, while the second claims that the region of DNA in which such a cluster is located is more likely to sustain both indels and substitutions. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the region of DNA, and not the indel, is associated with the accumulation of clusters of mutations over evolutionary time scales. We find that repeat sequences are closely associated with a large proportion of indels and that the abundance of repeat sequences is linked with regions of increased nucleotide diversity. By analysing molecular data and measuring the mutation rates of genes engineered to contain repeats, we find that the mutation rate can be manipulated by the insertion of long repeat sequences. On the basis of these results, we propose a model in which repeat sequences are prone to cause stalling of the high-fidelity DNA polymerase, leading to the recruitment of error-prone repair polymerases which then replicate the surrounding sequence with a higher-than-average error rate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A major challenge of evolutionary genetics is to determine the mechanisms underlying cryptic patterns of mutation rate variation and how they influence evolutionary outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Nishant1">[1]</xref>. One of the most striking of these trends is the association between indel mutations and nucleotide substitutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Chen1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Yang1">[7]</xref>. Inter-species genome comparisons have revealed this trend to be universal to all prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes examined thus far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Tian1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Zhu1">[6]</xref>. The prevailing explanation for this association is that indels, as “universal mutators” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Tian1">[4]</xref>, cause the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions in the hundreds of base pairs of sequence surrounding the indel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Tian1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Zhu1">[6]</xref>. Although such studies have been unable to unequivocally determine if the clusters are due to a single multimutational event (multiple mutation hypothesis), the indel per se (the mutagenic indel hypothesis), or the region of sequence in which the indel is found (the regional differences hypothesis), the mutagenic indel hypothesis has been adopted by workers in the field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Conrad1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Shuda1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>The mechanism of indel mutagenicity proposed by Tian and co-workers is that indels, when heterozygous, cause paired chromosomes to form heteroduplex DNA during meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Tian1">[4]</xref>. This is posited to cause error-prone DNA repair systems to target indel-containing regions, leading to an increased likelihood of nucleotide substitution in the sequence surrounding the indel. Over time, this increase in mutation rate is predicted to leave as its signature the clustering of nucleotide substitutions in the DNA surrounding indels, while corresponding non-indel-containing orthologous sequences should have a lower number of substitutions, in accordance with the background substitution rate. In addition, because the proposed mutagenic effect of the indel is postulated to be dependent on its heterozygosity, the accumulation of substitutions should cease as soon as the indel becomes homozygous in the population. These predictions contrast with the regional differences hypothesis; regional effects are predicted to cause both indel and non-indel haplotypes to accumulate substitutions whether the indel is heterozygous or not. The multiple mutations hypothesis differs from both the regional and indel hypotheses in that clusters of mutations are due to a one-off mutation event. Determining whether mutations have accumulated over time or are due to a single mutation event is difficult without the ability to examine indel divergence on a temporal scale.</p>
<p>Here we use a population genomics approach to tease apart the dynamics of indel divergence using the genomes of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic> (<italic>S. paradoxus</italic>), <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and humans. We show that it is not the indel but rather the sequence region in which the indel occurs that is associated with the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions over evolutionary time scales. We propose a mechanism whereby a DNA sequence that is prone to cause replication fork stalling causes the recurrent recruitment of error-prone DNA polymerases to certain DNA sites, resulting in an increased likelihood of nucleotide substitutions in the surrounding DNA sequence.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>To initiate our investigation into the mechanisms underlying indel-associated mutation, we used a unique population genomics resource: 20 high-quality genomes of the Escherichia/Shigella complex ranging from 0.1% to 2.5% sequence divergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s007">Table S1A</xref>). Employing this range of evolutionary distances facilitates capture of the incipient stages of indel divergence, minimizing the obscuring effect of time unavoidable during analyses of more diverged species. DNA replication and repair in <italic>E. coli</italic> are well understood and, due to their central and conserved role in all living cells, have provided a useful model for eukaryotic systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-AugustoPinto1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Alignments were created between orthologous regions of pairs of <italic>E. coli</italic> genomes totalling 96.3 Mb, uncovering 5,390 indels. We then performed stringent tests to ensure that results were not due to artefacts of the alignment process (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Following Tian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Tian1">[4]</xref>, we generated estimates of overall nucleotide diversity, D, (D = 0.01 is equivalent to 1% divergence) and plotted the magnitude of D against sequence intervals of defined distance (designated as windows 1, 2, 3, etc.) from the nearest indel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s001">Figure S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows an increase in nucleotide divergence in the sequence window closest to the indel (window 1) for all of the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain comparisons.</p>

<title>Substitutions Accumulate Around Indels in Haploid (Non-Heterogenote) Bacteria</title>
<p>The detection of indel-associated mutation in bacterial species poses a dilemma for the mutagenic-indel hypothesis. Prokaryotes are haploid; following the indel-causing event, the cell has only a brief heterogenote period during which, according to the mutagenic-when-heterozygous hypothesis, the indel is mutagenic. After a few cell divisions, the daughter cell will produce only indel-containing copies of the genome and will not have a non-indel version to recognize that the indel is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The mutagenic-when-heterozygous theory then predicts (at least in prokaryotes) that nucleotide diversity does not accumulate over time. To test this prediction, we generated pre-defined, non-overlapping sets of old and new indels in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Old indels are those determined (using an appropriate outgroup) to have occurred before the divergence of the two strains under comparison; new indels are those that have occurred after their divergence (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s002">Figure S2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s003">S3</xref>, D values are significantly higher for old indels (black lines) than those for new indels (grey lines). This result demonstrates that, contrary to the mutagenic-when-heterozygous and multiple mutation hypotheses, mutations are accumulating at a higher rate in regions surrounding indels over time.</p>

<p>Cells have up to four copies of their genome during rapid growth. This raises the possibility that indels could be mutagenic during their attempted repair using the non-indel-containing chromosome copy. Following cell division, one of the daughter cells will possess an indel-containing chromosome, while the other daughter cell will not. The indel lineage will thereafter be homogenote for the indel. According to the previously proposed mutagenic-when-heterozygous hypothesis, the indel will not be mutagenic as it no longer exists as a heterogenote and nucleotide substitutions will not accumulate around them.</p>

<p>Old indels (black) have accumulated a higher D than new indels (grey) in both <italic>E. coli</italic> (A) and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (B) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).

DW1 is D of the window closest to the indel.

(D and E) Both indel and non-indel haplotypes have elevated D close to the indel containing site.

The total nucleotide diversity can be divided into fractions attributable to the indel + region effect (Di), the region (non-indel) effect (Dni), or the background level divergence of the two aligned orthologous fragments (Db) (red dashed lines in panel D).</p>

<title>Non-Indel Haplotypes Also Have Increased Amounts of Nucleotide Diversity</title>
<p>Background D (Db) is the average difference in the DNA sequences of two aligned orthologous regions. An increase in the number of differences between the nucleotide sequences of two aligned orthologous regions above this average indicates an increase in the rate of the accumulation of substitutions. The mutagenic indel hypothesis states that the indel per se is the cause of an increase in mutation rate and the accumulated nucleotide diversity in the surrounding sequence. A consequence of this is that, of two aligned fragments of DNA, the indel-containing fragment should have a highly elevated D close to the indel and its corresponding non-indel-containing orthologous fragment should have a D equivalent to the background. These predictions can be tested by choosing an orthologous sequence from a third <italic>E. coli</italic> genome as an outgroup to infer the ancestral state of the aligned sequence, thus allowing us to pinpoint in which of the two aligned genome fragments the indel event has occurred. This is dependent on the assumption of parsimony—if indels are a convergent character, the indel haplotype could be mistakenly assigned. D can be calculated for the sequence windows surrounding an indel-containing region (the indel haplotype) and the corresponding orthologous region without the indel (the non-indel haplotype) with which it is paired. In order to minimize the bias caused by differences in the selective constraints upon aligned sequences, we employed stringent filters to ensure that the sequences compared are strictly orthologous (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g003">Figure 3D</xref> shows that the values of D for both the indel- and non-indel-containing haplotypes, Di and Dni, are elevated in window 1 as compared to the background nucleotide diversity Db. Although the values of Di in window 1 are often higher than Dni (an average 14% difference in D), this was not significant (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s008">Table S2</xref>) for any of the strains compared. By contrast, when Di and Dni are compared to Db, in five out of six comparisons Di is significantly greater than Db (an average 57% difference in D), while Dni is significantly greater than Db in four cases (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s008">Table S2</xref>; average 40% difference in D). Thus, for nearly as many instances as the indel haplotype, the non-indel haplotype has a D significantly higher than the background nucleotide divergence, confirming that the regional effect plays a role in the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions.</p>
<p>These results raise the possibility that the accumulation of mutations surrounding indels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) is mainly due to regional effects and not attributable to indels per se. However, this conflicts with the inferences of previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Chen1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Tian1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Zhu1">[6]</xref>, that concluded that indels, not regions, are mutagenic. In order to find the cause of this disagreement, we took a closer look at the results of those studies as well as our own data. We noticed that the strains that are less diverged tended to have the largest difference between the indel and non-indel haplotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s008">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Indels detected in the comparisons of two highly similar strains must have happened since their relatively recent divergence. The fact that the more diverged strains differed less between the indel and non-indel haplotypes suggests that the indel-associated effect diminishes over time. When we studied the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Tian1">[4]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Zhu1">[6]</xref>, we found the same trend. For example, using data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Zhu1">[6]</xref>, when bacterial divergence was plotted against difference between Di and Dni, it showed that the difference between Di and Dni decreases with increasing divergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s004">Figure S4</xref>). A further example is provided by Tian et al.'s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Tian1">[4]</xref> analysis of heterozygote alleles at one-third and two-thirds frequencies in yeast. The mutagenic-when-heterozygous mechanism predicts that indels occurring at a higher frequency in a population have been accumulating mutations for longer periods and should thus have a higher D value and a greater difference between Di and Dni. Conversely, the indels at two-thirds frequency have a smaller Di/Dni (1.40) than the indels at one-third frequency (2.23). The fact that indels that have been segregating for longer time have a smaller difference between the indel and non-indel haplotypes indicates that spending more time as a heterozygote actually diminishes the indel-associated effect, contrary to the prediction of the mutagenic-when-heterozygous hypothesis.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>The Proportion of D Attributable to the Indel Diminishes over Time</title>
<p>The separation of D into Di and Dni allows us to calculate the proportion of D on the indel haplotype that can be attributed to the indel effect and to the regional effect, respectively (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Under the assumption that indel-causing events are uniformly distributed since the time of divergence, it follows that the level of divergence between two strains is correlated with the average age of the indels found during comparison. If an indel constantly influences the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions in the surrounding sequence while polymorphic, we expect to see an increase in the difference between Di and Dni over time. Conversely, if indels have a one-time-only effect on nucleotide diversity, we expect to find a decline in this difference over time. We compared Di and Dni for alignments identifying new and old indels (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s009">Table S3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows that the difference between Di and Dni decreases with increasing divergence (Pearson's correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic> = −0.769, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0093). This negative correlation is striking when compared to the positive correlation between time since divergence and nucleotide diversity when the indel and region effects are not separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, Pearson's correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> = +0.711, <italic>p</italic> = 0.00092). This result suggests that it is the region, but not the indel, that is constantly influencing the accumulation of substitutions over evolutionary time scales.</p>

All these results suggest that a difference between the indel and non-indel haplotype exists following the indel-causing event but that this difference decreases over time until stabilising with both haplotypes having the same amount of nucleotide diversity. Because our study is able to track indel divergence within a species, this analysis provides unequivocal evidence that nucleotide diversity associated with indels decreases over time.</p>

We found that, even when indel-containing windows were excluded, windows with a higher number of repeat sequences had more nucleotide substitutions than those without (83% increase for SE11/REL606 and 71% increase for SE15/REL606 in windows with six repeats).

The declining ratio of Di/Dni shows that this bump is smoothened over evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g004">Figure 4</xref>). One explanation for this is that indel mutagenicity is transient because the indel-containing allele is only mutagenic as a heterozygote and its mutagenic effect will vanish when it becomes homozygous. The period for which bacteria exist as heterogenotes for an indel is orders of magnitude less than that for diploid eukaryotes. However, a consistent decrease in Di/Dni is found across taxonomic kingdoms, an observation at odds with the proposal that heterzygosity/heterogenosity causes the indel “bump.” An alternative explanation is that the indel-associated bump in D may be due to the indel-causing event resulting in multiple nucleotide changes. This possibility is not implausible considering the spectrum of mutations in baker's yeast. Lang and Murray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Lang1">[30]</xref> found that in 63% of instances where two mutations occurred at the same time one was an indel and the other a nucleotide substitution; yet indels constituted only 6.67% of all mutations observed in that study.

<title>Indels, Substitutions, and Repeat Sequences Collected from a Haploid, Non-Indel-Containing <italic>ura3</italic> Marker Cluster Together</title>
<p>All the inferences made about indels, nucleotide substitutions, and repeat sequences have so far been drawn only from the comparisons of genomes. In order to test predictions made by the 3R and mutagenic indel hypotheses, we utilized the comprehensive collection of spontaneous <italic>ura3</italic> mutants gathered by Lang and Murray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Lang1">[30]</xref>. This collection comprises 207 <italic>ura3</italic> mutant alleles, each of which resulted from a single mutational event in a haploid (and non-indel-containing) gene. The mutagenic indel hypothesis predicts that the clustering of mutations is caused by indels; thus, this set of independently occurring mutants should not cluster. Conversely, the 3R hypothesis states that repeat sequences cause an increase in the likelihood of the surrounding sequence sustaining both indels and nucleotide substitutions; thus, according to this hypothesis, indels and substitution mutations collected from independent mutants should cluster around repeats. Using a model based on a hyper-geometric distribution (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>), we first found that indels and substitutions cluster together (<italic>p</italic> = 0.019), even though most substitutions occurred without a co-occurring indel (97%). Next, we tested for the association of indel/nucleotide substitution mutations with any of the 264 four-nucleotide combinations of A, T, C, and G (e.g., ATCG, ATCA, ATCT, etc.). It is expected by chance that 2 or 3 four-nucleotide combinations should be found to be significant; however, significant associations were found only with the repeat sequences TGTG (<italic>p</italic> = 0.00027), AAAA (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0093), and GTGT (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0098). These results confirm that indels, substitutions, and repeat sequences are associated independently of any initiating mutator indel.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Here we have provided evidence suggesting that regional effects have a strong influence on the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions over evolutionary time scales. Although an indel effect is also observed, we have shown the proportion of D attributable to an indel effect diminishes over time. In addition, it is not possible to formally exclude whether this effect is due to a mutagenic indel effect or a single multiple mutation causing event.</p>
<p>Although we found that many indels are associated with repeat sequences, many are not. This finding may be explained by the existence of other non-repeat polymerase stalling sequence motifs; another possible explanation is that repeat sequences were destroyed by mutation, while the indel remained.</p>
<p>So what is the impact of the indel/region effect on phenotypic evolution? Most indels in <italic>E. coli</italic> are within 100 bp of the nearest gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, 25% of promoters contain repeat sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Vinces1">[32]</xref> and 600 seven-nucleotide homopolymer runs have been identified in essential genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Heck1">[33]</xref>, putting cis-regulatory regions and coding sequences well within the range of the effect of indel/repeat-associated mutation.</p>

For instance, when three genomes were aligned to determine indel and non-indel haplotypes, the number of mutations on the non-indel haplotype was counted by comparison of the non-indel fragment with the outgroup, and the number of substitutions on the indel haplotype was calculated by comparing the indel haplotype and the outgroup.

Repeat sequences interrupted by a substitution mutation so that the homopolymer was less than four continuous nucleotides in length were not included. We then calculated total D for each window as well as the D for these classes of mutation: substitution, indel, transition, and transversion.

Each of these designations as highly related was supported by our own estimations of divergence provided by pairwise alignments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s010">Table S4</xref>). Two pairs of recently diverged strains were aligned by performing a new alignment of all four orthologous fragments in ClustalW, giving a total of four aligned genomes.

D for new indels was calculated using the alignment of two similar strains, of which one had been found to contain the indel. Old indels were those sites which concurred within recently diverged pairs but were different between the two pairs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Such indels must have happened before the divergence of the highly similar strains yet after the divergence of the two sets of strains.

If there are double mutations (sites where the two similar genomes are different from each other and the other diverged pair), these are scored as one substitution because the difference between the two similar strains must have happened since the divergence of the two diverged sets of strains and have already been scored in the new-indel analysis.

<p>For pairwise comparisons between indel and non-indel haplotypes, previous studies have used paired <italic>t</italic> tests, however we found that our data was not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). We used the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to test for the appropriateness of the non-parametric Wilcoxon Sum Rank test for our samples. If the samples were found to be different by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was named and <italic>p</italic> value given (as was the case for the indel/non-indel analysis). If the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test found the samples under comparison to be of the same shaped distribution, we carried out and presented the Wilcoxon Sum Rank test and <italic>p</italic> values (this was the case for the repeat/window analysis).</p>

<title>Correlation of D and Age of Indel</title>
<p>A comparison of the amount of nucleotide substitutions attributable to the indel and regional effects for indels of different ages would provide for a test of the hypothesis that indel-associated mutations accumulate over time. In principle, this could be achieved by using the sets of old and new indels used for the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>; however, the generation of the set of old indels required a four-genome alignment; a fifth genome needs to be added to determine the indel and non-indel haplotypes. Because of our strict criteria for defining orthologous regions, the partitioning of the old and new indel sets into indel and non-indel haplotypes leaves prohibitively few orthologous regions for analysis. An alternative is to consider pairwise sets of alignments. The background nucleotide diversity for each pairwise comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g001">Figure 1</xref>) provides a measure of relatedness; the greater the average value of background D, the more diverged the two strains. In order to gauge the range and degree of difference across these pairwise comparisons, the sets of background diversity values (provided by the D values for windows 3 to 10, which were chosen because they are outside the range of indel/region-associated influence) were compared. We found that most strains had distinct levels of sequence divergence from each other (Tukey's HSD, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s010">Table S4</xref>), with an approximately 20-fold difference in D values between the most and least diverged strains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000622.s010">Table S4</xref> for details). In order to cover a range of pairwise comparisons of increasing divergence, we chose four strains and systematically compared them to strains from clades of increasing divergence. The least divergent outgroup was always chosen. Each value of D can be partitioned into composite fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000622-g003">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>). Di is attributable to the effect of the indel and the region together, whereas Dni is attributed to the region alone. (Di − Db)/(Dni − Db) provides a measure of the total proportion of Di that is influenced by the indel. If (Di − Db)/(Dni − Db)  = 1, none of the increase in nucleotide diversity can be attributed to the indel. As the value increasingly exceeds one, more of the nucleotide substitutions surrounding indels can be attributed to the indel effect. The indels detected in pairwise comparisons of more diverged strains cannot be strictly called “old” indels; these pairwise alignments will also include indels that have occurred relatively recently. However, increasingly divergent strains will be composed of a greater proportion of relatively old indels. This method of comparing indels between less diverged and more diverged strains will therefore underestimate the negative association between indels and the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions.</p>

<title><italic>D. melanogastor/D. melanogastor</italic> Indel Analysis</title>
<p>In order to explore indel divergence in a metazoan genus, we aligned sequenced genomes of the genus Drosophila. However, all pairwise comparisons (except the alignment of <italic>D. sechelia</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic>) were diverged so much that the difference between Di and Dni was undetectable ((Di − Db)/(Dni − Db) = 1). To possibly obtain alignments of less diverged genomes, we used alignments of 37 genomes available from the <italic>D. melanogastor</italic> 50 genome project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~cdewey/fly_CAF1/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~cdewey/fly_CAF1/</ext-link>). However, the alignment of any two of these genomes could not give enough indels suitable for analysis; most indels detected within <italic>D. melanogastor</italic> tended to cluster, leading to the rejection from our analysis of many indel-containing regions. To overcome this, suitable indels found from the alignment of all 35 strains from the Raleigh collection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Jordan1">[36]</xref> to two of the Malawi strains (MW63 and MW27) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Begun1">[37]</xref> were used; indels found in more than one alignment were discarded, and from this set the 100 most and 100 least diverged indel-containing alignments were taken (background divergence was taken as Db and calculated based on the average D of windows 3 to 10).</p>

<title>Modelling the Distribution of Indels, Nucleotide Substitutions, and Repeat Sequences Using a Hypergeometric Distribution</title>
<p>Each nucleotide site of <italic>URA3</italic> was classified as being mutable or not, based on the 5 bp of sequence on each side of that nucleotide, creating a stringent null model for the expected distribution of nucleotide substitutions and indel mutations. The probability of obtaining the observed distribution under the null model was calculated using the hypergeometric distribution: <disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000622.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

<title>Mutation Rate Analysis</title>
<p>A single (TG)<sub>6</sub>, (G)<sub>12</sub>, or (A)<sub>12</sub> tract (or a random 12-mer (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAGTGTCAAATA</named-content>) as a control) was inserted between positions −4 and −5 of <italic>URA3</italic>. Because these sequences are inherently unstable, multiple lengths of a homonucleotide tract were recovered during the cloning process, all of which left <italic>URA3</italic> functional—providing evidence that alteration in the length of this sequence could not confer the Ura-, 5-FOA-resistant phenotype. Fluctuation tests were carried out in order to determine the mutation rate of altered <italic>URA3</italic> genes. These were carried out by first setting up overnight cultures of each strain to be assayed in CSM-Ura media to ensure maintenance of the functional <italic>URA3</italic> gene. The following day each strain's culture was diluted so that low numbers of cells (∼1,000) were inoculated into at least 10 independent 100 µl YPD cultures per strain in 96 well plates. Cultures were incubated at 30°C for 2 d without shaking and then spot plated onto dry 5-FOA plates. Aliquots (5 µl) of each culture were pooled, diluted, and subsequently plated onto three YPD plates to determine the total cell count. Each experiment was repeated three times. Mutation rates were calculated using the equation µ = m/Nt, where m is the mutant frequency and Nt is the total number of cells in the culture. m was determined by counting the number of 5-FOA resistant colonies for each of the 3 sets of 10 independent cultures; then calculations were carried out using FALCOR software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Hall1">[38]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.keshavsingh.org/protocols/FALCOR.html#interface" xlink:type="simple">http://www.keshavsingh.org/protocols/FALCOR.html#interface</ext-link>), which employs a maximum likelihood method developed by Sarkar, Ma, and Sandri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Sarkar1">[39]</xref>. The resultant value for m (mean mutant frequency) is divided by the total number of cells in the culture Nt. Nt provides a measure of the total cell divisions that have occurred in the culture; therefore, our final unit is number of Ura− mutants per cell division. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals as calculated by FALCOR using a formula devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Rosche1">[40]</xref>. <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare all strains to the wild-type strain, using formula 5 on the FALCOR website.</p>

<title>Human-Human Indels</title>
<p>In order to identify indels occurring within the human lineage that may have influenced phenotypic evolution, we used a collection of recent segmental duplications (&lt;5% diverged) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000622-Ho1">[31]</xref> and identified them as expressed by comparing with the human mRNA sequence collection (refseq, NCBI). We used the Chimpanzee genome as an outgroup to identify indel and non-indel haplotypes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#chimp" xlink:type="simple">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#chimp</ext-link>). All human segmental duplications were present as a single copy in the chimpanzee genome. The non-indel haplotype corresponds to the human copy that is the same as the chimp single copy at the indel site, while the indel-containing copy is the one that differs from the chimp version at the indel site.</p>

<title>Comparison of Indel Position and Potential Sequence Elements of Interest</title>
<p>We searched for an association between indel sites and various sequence elements that could have been associated with an increased nucleotide substitution rate. We generated a list of indels found in the <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 MG1655 genome, the best studied of all <italic>E. coli</italic> strains for which such sequence elements are well characterized. For each indel, the sequence region flanking 1 kb of the indel was designated as an indel-containing portion of the genome. The frequency with which sequence elements of interest were found in indel-containing portions of the genome compared to the rest of the genome was scored. The sequence elements that were searched were transposable elements and insertion sequences, tRNA genes, recombination sites (as indicated by the chi site), DNA sites prone to breakage (sites identified by the program Twist Flex), and repeat sequences.</p>

<p>Sequence intervals for indel-flanking regions. In order to extract indel-flanking sequences for analysis, the positions of indels were recorded in each orthologous region. Next, the sequences (1 kb each) on each side of the indel were extracted and examined for additional indels. If one of the flanking sequences was found to contain additional indels, that flanking region was discarded. Blocks of sequence regions surrounding a specific indel are named and ordered as windows 1 to 10 (W<sub>1</sub>–W<sub>10</sub>): W1 comprises the 50 nucleotides closest to the indel, W<sub>2</sub>–W<sub>9</sub> are each composed of 100 nucleotides, and W10 consists of the outermost 150 nucleotides. In each window, the nucleotide divergence is computed by the Jukes-Cantor method.

Old indels are defined as indels that happened before divergence of the closely related species. For example, if B1 and B2 both have the same indel but A1 and A2 both do not, this would be considered an old indel, as it must have happened before the divergence of the highly similar strains B1 and B2. Conversely, if an indel is present only in A1 but not A2, B1, or B2, this indel is new because it must have happened after the divergence of A1 and A2.</p>
