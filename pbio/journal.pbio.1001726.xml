<p>The cancer-associated TRAF4 protein has a TRAF domain that is a bona fide phosphoinositide-binding domain and involved in the modulation of tight junctions and cell migration.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) is frequently overexpressed in carcinomas, suggesting a specific role in cancer. Although TRAF4 protein is predominantly found at tight junctions (TJs) in normal mammary epithelial cells (MECs), it accumulates in the cytoplasm of malignant MECs. How TRAF4 is recruited and functions at TJs is unclear. Here we show that TRAF4 possesses a novel phosphoinositide (PIP)-binding domain crucial for its recruitment to TJs. Of interest, this property is shared by the other members of the TRAF protein family. Indeed, the TRAF domain of all TRAF proteins (TRAF1 to TRAF6) is a <italic>bona fide</italic> PIP-binding domain. Molecular and structural analyses revealed that the TRAF domain of TRAF4 exists as a trimer that binds up to three lipids using basic residues exposed at its surface. Cellular studies indicated that TRAF4 acts as a negative regulator of TJ and increases cell migration. These functions are dependent from its ability to interact with PIPs. Our results suggest that TRAF4 overexpression might contribute to breast cancer progression by destabilizing TJs and favoring cell migration.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 4, also known as TRAF4, is an unusual member of the TRAF protein family. While TRAFs are primarily known as regulators of inflammation, antiviral responses, and apoptosis, research on TRAF4 has identified its involvement in development and cancer. Importantly TRAF4 overexpression has been associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancers. TRAF4 has multiple subcellular localizations: to the plasma membrane in tight junctions (TJs), cytoplasmic and nuclear. The recruitment mechanisms and the functional impact of these distinct localizations are not completely understood. Here we investigate how TRAF4 is recruited to TJs and its involvement in cell–cell contacts in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). We show that the TRAF domain of all TRAFs contains a lipid binding module, and that TRAF4 uses this domain to form a trimeric complex that associates with phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane. Moreover this interaction is necessary for its recruitment to TJs. Additionally, we show that through its interaction with lipids TRAF4 delays TJ assembly and increases cell migration. We propose that TRAF4 has an important function in cancer progression by destabilizing TJs and favoring cell migration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4</italic> (<italic>TRAF4</italic>) was originally identified as a gene overexpressed in breast carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rgnier1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Tomasetto1">[2]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>TRAF4</italic> overexpression is not restricted to breast cancer and extends to a variety of different carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-CamilleriBrot1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rhodes1">[4]</xref>. TRAF4 belongs to the TRAF family that is composed of seven members in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Bradley1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Zotti1">[6]</xref>. Among the seven TRAF family members, TRAF4 is one of the most conserved during evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kedinger1">[7]</xref>. Indeed, a TRAF4 ortholog has already been identified in snail fur (Hydractinia achinata), a cnidaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Zapata1">[8]</xref>. Moreover, the unique TRAF protein in the worm shares a higher homology with human TRAF4 than with other human TRAF proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Preiss1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, one of the three fly TRAF proteins, dTRAF1, shares the highest homology with human TRAF4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Preiss1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Grech1">[10]</xref>. In line with an essential and conserved biological function of TRAF4, flies that carry null-alleles of TRAF4 have many developmental abnormalities, leading to lethality before the pupal stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Cha1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Mathew1">[12]</xref>. Likewise, TRAF4 deficiency in mice was lethal at the embryonic stage in approximately one third of the homozygote mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rgnier2">[13]</xref>. All surviving animals exhibited multiple defects including trachea alteration and various nonfully penetrant phenotypes involving the axial skeleton and the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rgnier2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Shiels1">[14]</xref>. Surviving adult TRAF4-deficient mice also exhibited ataxia, associated with myelination alteration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Blaise1">[15]</xref>. Together, these various genetic models suggest that TRAF4 has an essential function conserved in most, if not all, pluricellular animals.</p>
<p>TRAF4 encodes a 53 kDa adaptor protein with multiple subcellular localizations. Indeed, cytoplasmic, nuclear, and membrane localizations have been described in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rgnier1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Glauner1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kedinger2">[17]</xref>. Of interest, the subcellular localization of TRAF4 is altered in cancers. While in normal breast tissue the protein is predominantly localized in the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Krajewska1">[18]</xref>, more precisely in tight junctions (TJs) present at the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kdinger1">[19]</xref>, in cancer samples the protein can be localized either in the cytoplasm and/or in the nucleus of cancer epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rgnier1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-CamilleriBrot1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Glauner1">[16]</xref>. Until recently the implication of these multiple localizations were unclear. A recent report shed light into the significance of the nuclear localization of TRAF4 in breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Yi1">[20]</xref>. This study indicated that TRAF4 nuclear localization in breast tumors was associated with poor survival in breast cancer patients after adjuvant therapy. Moreover, this report showed that TRAF4 promotes p53 protein destabilization in the nucleus of cancer cells and contributes to resistance to cytotoxic stress in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Yi1">[20]</xref>. To date, the function of TRAF4 in TJs and in the cytoplasm remains unclear. Many lines of evidence indicate that TRAF4 functions in the organization and patterning of the cell cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Mathew1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wang1">[21]</xref>. TRAF4 is required for the polarized trafficking of NADPH oxidase to filopodia in migrating endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Li1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wu1">[23]</xref>. In the fly, TRAF4 can interact with proteins involved in asymmetric division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wang1">[21]</xref> and functions in the establishment of the junctional architecture of mesodermal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Mathew1">[12]</xref>. In the mouse nervous system, TRAF4 deficiency altered the formation and/or stability of axoglial and interglial junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Blaise1">[15]</xref>. Collectively, all these data indicate that TRAF4 might exert a function related to cell junctions and polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rousseau1">[24]</xref>. However, TRAF4 appears to function in a cell-specific manner, making its functional characterization difficult. While TRAF4 is ubiquitously expressed at a basal level, there exists a spatial and temporal up-regulation of TRAF4 gene expression during specific developmental stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kalkan1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Masson1">[26]</xref>. For example, during gastrulation in frogs, mRNA encoding TRAF4 and one of its interacting partners SMURF1 become enriched in the neural plate and neural crest cells. In these cells, both TRAF4 and SMURF1 are essential for proper neural crest development and neural plate morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kalkan1">[25]</xref>. In human mammary epithelial cells (MECs), the role of TRAF4 in TJs remains unclear. However, we showed previously that this localization was a highly dynamic process, supporting the notion that TRAF4 might relay signals from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm, and possibly the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kedinger2">[17]</xref>. Given the recently established role of nuclear TRAF4 in the destabilization of the tumor suppressor p53 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Yi1">[20]</xref>, it is now necessary to understand how TRAF4 subcellular localization in the mammary epithelium is regulated under physiopathological conditions. To address this, we explored the molecular determinants involved in its subcellular localization at the plasma membrane and in TJs of MECs. We also directly addressed the function of TRAF4 in the formation and maintenance of TJs in polarized cells. Finally, having established that TRAF4 is a negative regulator of TJs in breast cells, we have explored its contribution to cell motility.</p>

<p>MECs form ducts and acini with an established apicobasal polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-BarcellosHoff1">[27]</xref>. Adhesion and TJ formation are instrumental to the establishment of this polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Bazzoun1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Debnath1">[29]</xref>. In polarized MECs, TRAF4 is mainly found in TJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kedinger2">[17]</xref>, suggesting a specific function of the protein in the formation and/or dissociation of TJs. To address the function of TRAF4 in TJs, we used the human immortalized normal MEC model, MCF10A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Soule1">[30]</xref>. Monolayers of MCF10A provide a good system to study TJs because at confluence they form clusters of polarized cells exhibiting TJs and they can be used to measure the contribution of a given gene in the formation and/or stabilization of TJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Brown1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Brysse1">[32]</xref>. In practice, quantification of cell clusters exhibiting a continuous membrane-associated ZO-1 staining indicates the extent of cells making TJs. This cell system has been successfully used to demonstrate TJ alterations following long-term TGF-β treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Brown1">[31]</xref>. To study the role of TRAF4 on TJs, we down-regulated its expression in MCF10A cells using a shRNA strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In cells stably expressing a shRNA specific for TRAF4 (MCF10A/shT4), TRAF4 expression was reduced to less than 10% compared to parental MCF10A cells and to cells expressing a control shRNA (MCF10A/shCtrl). Next, MCF10A/shT4, MCF10A/shCtrl, and MCF10A parental cells were plated at the same density, and 48 h later, cell monolayers were fixed and stained for the TJ marker ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The relative number of cells harboring TJs was then measured. Cells harboring TJs were defined as cells with an enclosed ring of contiguous apical ZO-1 staining. Compared to parental MCF10A and to MCF10A/shCtrl cell lines, TRAF4 silencing was associated with a 2-fold increase in cells harboring TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g001">Figure 1B,E</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Western-blot analysis of TRAF4 in parental and in established MCF10A cell lines. To knock down TRAF4, parental MCF10A cells (lane 1) were transduced with a shRNA targeting TRAF4 (MCF10A/shT4, lanes 3–5); a nonspecific shRNA was used as control (MCF10A/shCtrl, lane 2). To restore TRAF4 expression, MCF10A/shT4 cells were transduced with a shT4-insensitive vector encoding TRAF4 (MCF10A/shT4+TRAF4, lane 5); the control cell line (MCF10A/shT4+pBABE, lane 4) was transduced with the empty vector. A gain of function and a control cell line were generated with a TRAF4 expression plasmid (MCF10A/TRAF4, lane 7) or the empty vector (MCF10A/pBABE, lane 6), respectively. TRAF4 expression levels normalized to actin are indicated. (B–D) The presence of TJs was estimated by ZO-1 staining in the different cell lines of TRAF4 loss of function (B), gain of function (C), and rescue (D) experiments. Left panels are representative confocal sections of ZO-1 staining (green), and right panels are merges with Hoechst staining (blue). Scale bar, 20 µm. (E) TJ quantification. Score representing the number of cells with a continuous ZO-1 staining, normalized to parental MCF10A cells (percentage). The number of microscopic fields used for the quantification is indicated at the bottom of the bar chart. TRAF4 knock-down increased the number of cells with TJs, whereas TRAF4 overexpression had the opposite effect.</p>

<p>To support the role of TRAF4 expression on TJs, we performed the complementary experiment in which TRAF4 was overexpressed in MCF10A cells. In cells stably expressing the protein (MCF10A/TRAF4), TRAF4 was increased over 6-fold as compared to parental MCF10A cells and to cells transduced with the empty vector (MCF10A/pBABE). The presence of TJ was assayed in these different cell lines as described above; compared to parental MCF10A cells and to MCF10A/pBABE control cells, TRAF4 overexpression resulted in a 2-fold decrease in TJ-harboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g001">Figure 1C,E</xref>). To further substantiate the role of TRAF4 on TJs, we restored TRAF4 expression in MCF10A/shT4 cells (MCF10A/shT4+TRAF4) using an expression system insensitive to shT4-mediated down-regulation. TRAF4 expression was efficiently restored as the protein was expressed over six times higher than in parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). MCF10A/shT4 cells transduced with the empty vector (pBABE) served as a negative control (MCF10A/shT4+pBABE). These cell lines were then assayed for the formation of TJs using ZO-1 staining on confluent monolayers. Similarly to TRAF4-silenced MCF10A cells, in the absence of rescue (MCF10A/shT4+pBABE), the number of TJs was two times higher than in parental and nonsilenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g001">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Remarkably, compared to parental MCF10A cells, rescued cells (MCF10A/shT4+TRAF4) had a 2-fold decrease in TJs similar to TRAF4 overexpressing cells (MCF10A/TRAF4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g001">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Thus restoring TRAF4 expression rescues the TJ phenotype induced by its silencing.</p>
<p>To study whether TRAF4 might regulate the expression level of proteins involved in TJs, adherens junctions, and desmosomes, levels of ZO-1, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and desmoplakin were measured in the different cell lines by immunoblotting. Modulating TRAF4 expression did not modify significantly ZO-1, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and desmoplakin protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). In addition, immunofluorescence of endogenous beta-catenin showed that TRAF4 does not affect the membrane-bound beta-catenin pool, suggesting that TRAF4 primarily targets TJs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s001">Figure S1B</xref>–D).</p>
<p>To know whether TRAF4 acts on TJ assembly, we next used the “calcium switch” model in MCF7 cells. This assay involves reversible disruption of epithelial junctions by extracellular calcium removal followed by a rapid reassembly triggered by calcium repletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Ivanov1">[33]</xref>. MCF7 cells form well-defined TJs in tissue culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-VanDeurs1">[34]</xref> and endogenous TRAF4 is predominantly localized at TJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kedinger2">[17]</xref>. To address the role of TRAF4 on TJ assembly, we generated a TRAF4-silenced cell line in MCF7 cells using a shRNA strategy. Compared with parental (MCF7) and control (MCF7/shCtrl) cells, TRAF4 silencing (MCF7/shT4) resulted in a 90% reduction in protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). We next examined if TRAF4 silencing affected reassembly of MCF7 TJs using the “calcium switch” assay. TRAF4 down-regulation accelerated the reassembly of TJs, as shown by the appearance of continuous junctional labeling of ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). After 3, 5, and 7 h of calcium repletion, TRAF4-silenced cells showed more formed TJs than parental and control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s002">Figure S2B</xref>,C). After 20 h of calcium repletion, all cells recovered TJs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Moreover, reintroduction of TRAF4 in silenced cells rescued the phenotype of TRAF4-depleted cells, since cells expressing a sh-insensitive TRAF4 construct (MCF7/shT4+TRAF4) reassembled TJs in a kinetic comparable to that of parental MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s002">Figure S2B</xref>,C).</p>
<p>Thus, in the normal MEC MCF10A, TRAF4 negatively regulates TJs. Moreover, in the malignant MEC MCF7 forming well-defined TJs, TRAF4 delays the reassembly of TJs. Collectively these data indicate that TRAF4 modulates TJs by delaying their formation and/or by favoring the dissociation of TJ.</p>

<title>TRAF4 Is a Novel Phosphoinositide Binding Protein</title>
<p>In MECs, TRAF4 was shown to be present at the plasma membrane in a highly dynamic manner. Indeed fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments showed that the protein has a short residency time in the membrane. These experiments supported the notion that TRAF4 is shuttling between the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm, and possibly the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kedinger2">[17]</xref>. In addition, in flies, TRAF4 was shown to interact with proteins from TJs, including PAR3 (Partitioning-defective 3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wang1">[21]</xref>, making this protein a good candidate to explain TRAF4 addressing in junctions. However, in human cells, we failed to find a direct interaction between TRAF4 and PAR3 (F.A. unpublished data), suggesting that another mechanism is responsible for TRAF4 membrane targeting. Of interest, it was shown that adaptor proteins from TJs, including PAR3 and ZO-1, were localized to cell membranes via an interaction with membrane lipids belonging to the phosphoinositide (PIP) family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Meerschaert1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wu2">[36]</xref>. We thus reasoned that TRAF4 might be targeted to the cell membrane and possibly TJ by using a similar mechanism. To address the potential TRAF4 interaction with membrane lipids, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> lipid binding assay called lipid overlay assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Dowler1">[37]</xref>. To this aim, recombinant TRAF4 protein was produced and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Recombinant TRAF4 was flanked by two tags, a Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP)-tag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Puig1">[38]</xref> and a 6His-tag at the amino- and carboxy-terminal parts, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The efficiency of the purification was probed by Coomassie blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2Ba</xref>) and Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2Bb</xref>). Recombinant proteins were detected using an antibody recognizing the immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein-A from the TAP tag. We next tested the direct interaction of recombinant TRAF4 with lipids immobilized on membranes by lipid overlay assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). While the control TAP-6His protein did not bind to any lipid, recombinant TRAF4 did bind to all PIPs and phosphatidic acid (PA). Interestingly, TRAF4 did not bind to other negatively charged lipids like phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

The TAP-6His recombinant protein served as a negative control. Immunodetection of bound proteins was performed using a TAP-identifying antibody.

Electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry deconvoluted spectra of the TRAF domain of TRAF4 in the absence (a) and in the presence (b) of PI(3,4,5)P3-diC4. In isolation and in the absence of lipid, the TRAF domain is a trimer (a). In the presence of PIP, three additional peaks corresponding to one to three bound lipids are detected (b).

Binding of recombinant control TAP-6HIS (b) and TRAF domain of TRAF4 (c) to liposomes using membrane flotation assay. Fluorescent analyses (dot blot) of NBD-PE indicated that blank and PIP-containing liposomes were present in the top fraction. The presence of recombinant proteins in each fraction was detected by Western blot using anti-His antibody and quantified by densitometry-analysis using ImageJ software. The control TAP-6His was predominantly detected in the bottom fraction (b). In contrast the centrifugation profile of the TRAF4-TRAF domain was modified in the presence of PIP-containing liposomes (c).

<p>TRAF4 is a modular protein composed of a RING domain, seven TRAF-type zinc-fingers, and a TRAF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rousseau1">[24]</xref>. To narrow down the domain involved in this binding, we produced two deletion mutants of TRAF4: one lacking the TRAF domain and thus only composed of the RING domain and of the seven zinc fingers (RING-7xZf) and the second one lacking all domains except the TRAF domain (TRAF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). While the RING-7xZf part of the protein showed no detectable binding to lipids, the TRAF domain showed a lipid-binding profile similar to the wild-type TRAF4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This result shows that the TRAF domain of TRAF4 is responsible for the interaction of the protein with PIPs.</p>
<p>We next used a different method called native mass spectrometry to show the binding of the TRAF domain with PIPs. This method is sensitive enough to measure the molecular weight of lipid–protein complexes and address their stoichiometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Potier1">[39]</xref>. In this assay, the recombinant TRAF domain in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) was incubated with a soluble form of PI(3,4,5)P3 and analyzed by Electrospray Ionisation Time of Flight (ESI-TOF) mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In absence of lipid, the TRAF domain fused to a 6His tag (TRAF-6His) was detected as a single peak of 67.7 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2Da</xref>). Consistent with the trimerization property of the TRAF proteins via the TRAF domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Park1">[40]</xref>, this peak represents three times the size of the monomeric TRAF domain (22.6 kDa). When TRAF-6His was incubated with PI(3,4,5)P3 prior to the ESI-TOF analysis, three additional major peaks were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2Db</xref>). Interestingly, each new peak has a size shift of ∼710 Da, which corresponds to the theoretical mass of one PI(3,4,5)P3 molecule. This indicates that the TRAF domain as a trimer can directly interact with one to three PI(3,4,5)P3 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Altogether, this shows that the recombinant TRAF domain of TRAF4 is well folded and trimerizes in solution similarly to the TRAF domains of TRAF2 and TRAF6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Park1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Zheng1">[41]</xref>. In addition, it can bind up to three PI(3,4,5)P3 molecules, thus suggesting that each TRAF monomer has a binding site for one PIP molecule.</p>
<p>In addition, the ability of the TRAF domain to interact with PIPs was measured by direct binding to 100-nm large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) by flotation in a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2Ea</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Bigay1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Manneville1">[43]</xref>. All liposome preparations were labeled with a fluorescent lipid (NBD-PE), which allows for their direct visualization. Three different liposome preparations were tested: blank (no PIP), PI(4,5)P2-, and PI(3,4,5)P3-containing LUVs. Liposomes were first incubated with recombinant proteins, then mixed with sucrose, and finally allowed to float over this sucrose cushion in virtue of their lower density. After ultracentrifugation, liposomes followed by NBD-PE fluorescence were found in the top fraction of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2Eb,c</xref>). The control TAP-6His protein was never associated with liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2Eb,d</xref>). Of interest, in presence of blank liposomes, the TRAF domain of TRAF4 was not associated with liposomes and was mainly present in the bottom fraction of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2Ec</xref>). In contrast, when mixed with PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3-containing liposomes, the TRAF domain of TRAF4 was predominantly present in the top fraction in association with liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2Ec,d</xref>). These data show that the TRAF domain of TRAF4 is able to interact with PIPs in the context of a biological membrane.</p>
<p>To gain insight about the affinity between the TRAF domain and PIPs, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Ye1">[44]</xref>. ITC was done with 16 µM TRAF-6His to which 500 µM inositol-(1,3,4,5,)-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) were added incrementally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). In these conditions, the TRAF domain is a homotrimer and the calculated numbers of IP4 binding sites indicated a 3∶1 stoichiometry of IP4 to TRAF-6His trimer. The lipid binding affinity was then calculated. The dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for one lipid-binding site of the TRAF domain and one IP4 molecule was 5.68 µM. This magnitude is consistent with K<sub>D</sub> found for other PIP interacting proteins from TJs including PAR3 (K<sub>D</sub> = 8 µM), ZO-1 (K<sub>D</sub> = 1.3 µM), and ZO-2 (K<sub>D</sub> = 2.6 µM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Meerschaert1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wu2">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>Altogether, these data show that TRAF4 has the ability to bind to PIPs and PA. The protein exists as a homotrimer that binds up to three lipid molecules. This interaction is mediated by the TRAF domain and the affinity of binding is in the micromolar range, which is consistent with the K<sub>D</sub> of other PIP-binding domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wu2">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Yan1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Yu1">[46]</xref>.</p>

<title>The TRAF Domain Is a Novel <italic>Bona Fide</italic> PIP-Interacting Domain</title>
<p>Given that the TRAF domain is well conserved within the TRAF protein family, we reasoned that the other TRAF proteins might bind PIPs as well. To test this hypothesis, we produced and purified the TRAF domains of the five other human TRAF proteins (TRAF1 to 6) in fusion with a TAP and a 6His-tag. As described before, the purification of these different recombinant domains was probed by Coomassie blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g003">Figure 3Aa</xref>) and Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g003">Figure 3Ab</xref>), and they were tested using a simplified lipid overlay assay containing a negative control (PE) and the major plasma membrane localized PIPs, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. Similar to previous results, the TAP-6His negative control did not bind to any lipids. Interestingly, the TRAF domains of the other TRAF paralogs (TRAF1 to TRAF6) interacted with PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To support this finding, we performed liposome flotation assays with TRAF5 and TRAF6 TRAF domains. Consistent with lipid overlay assays, the TRAF domains of TRAF5 and TRAF6 were associated with PI(4,5)P2- and PI(3,4,5)P3-containing liposomes and not with blank liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This finding indicates that the TRAF domains of TRAF5 and TRAF6 have the ability to interact with PIPs in the context of a biological membrane. Interestingly, using lipid overlay we also found that the TRAF domain of the fly TRAF4, dTRAF1, interacts with PIPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Structural Insight on PIP–TRAF Domain Interaction</title>
<p>To get mechanistic insights about the interaction between the TRAF domain and PIPs, we determined the crystal structure of the TRAF domain of human TRAF4 (PDB 3ZJB). The structure was resolved to 1.85 Å by molecular replacement using the structure of human TRAF2 (PDB ID 1CA9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Park1">[40]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s007">Table S1</xref>). The structure was refined to convergence (R<sub>work</sub> = 0.1632, R<sub>free</sub> = 0.1995) and includes residues 283–470 of the TRAF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). No evidence was seen, however, for the presence of IP4 in the electron density maps. The most striking structural feature of the TRAF domain is the formation of a mushroom-shaped trimer with the coiled-coil domain (TRAF-N) as the stalk and the TRAF-C domain as the cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), which is similar to the described structure of the TRAF domain of TRAF2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Park1">[40]</xref> and TRAF5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Zhang1">[47]</xref>.

<p>The structure of the TRAF domain was used to further characterize structural determinants involved in the binding with PIPs and to seek out TRAF4 mutants defective in this binding. Several protein domains including PH (pleckstrin homology), PX (phox homology), ENTH (Epsin N-terminal homology), FYVE (Fab1, YotB, Vac1p, and EEA1), and PDZ (PSD95, Dlg1, and ZO-1) domains bind PIPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Shewan1">[49]</xref>. These evolutionarily unrelated domains have in common the presence of at least two positively charged residues, lysine and/or arginine, directly interacting with PIPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-RosenhouseDantsker1">[50]</xref>. Eleven lysines and 15 arginines are present within the TRAF domain of TRAF4. To identify critical residues for PIP binding within TRAF4, we focused on positively charged residues present at the surface of the TRAF domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Eight positively charged residues—K313, R319/320, K345, R384/R385, K400, K419, R452, and R459 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s004">Figure S4</xref>)—were selected and mutated independently into glutamic acid to produce and purify the corresponding recombinant proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These mutants were then tested by lipid overlay assay using a simplified lipid-coated membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). While six out of the eight mutants still bound PIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), the K313E and K345E TRAF4 mutants bound poorly and not at all to PIPs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the loss of PIP binding of both mutants was due to structural alterations, we checked their folding by circular dichroism spectroscopy, a method allowing the determination of protein secondary structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Elavazhagan1">[51]</xref>. The near far-UV CD spectra of the two mutants were highly similar to that of the wild-type (WT) TRAF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that the K313E and K345E mutations did not affect the TRAF domain secondary structure. We also verified that the overall structure of the K345E mutant was unaffected using gel filtration and dynamic light scattering and showed that this mutant had an organization similar to the WT protein corresponding to a soluble trimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This mutagenesis study showed that two positive amino acids, lysine 313 and lysine 345, are contributing and essential residues for the binding of TRAF4 to PIPs, respectively.</p>
<p>We next used this mutant analysis to build a model representing the binding of the fully deprotonated PI(3,4,5)P3-diC4 to the TRAF domain of TRAF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The GOLD program was used; indeed, this software is an automated ligand docking program broadly used to model ligand–protein binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Jones1">[52]</xref>. Hydrogen bonding of the ligand to lysines 313 and 345 atoms was set as a prerequisite. In the model, which was further refined by energy minimization of the fully hydrated protein–ligand complex, the PI(3,4,5)P3-diC4 molecule binds to the TRAF domain at the interface between two protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, the lipid interacts with lysine 313 from one protomer and lysine 345 from the adjacent protomer. Lysine 313 directly interacts with both phosphates at positions 3 and 4 of the PI(3,4,5)P3-diC4, whereas lysine 345 only binds the phosphate at position 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This model highlighted the presence of two other interacting residues, arginine 297, which interacts with the phosphate at position 4, and tyrosine 338, which binds to the phosphate at position 5. Interestingly, it has been reported in the literature that PIP-binding domains must have an aromatic residue (Tyr or His) that interacts with the lipid in addition to basic residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-RosenhouseDantsker1">[50]</xref>. Altogether, these results show that TRAF4 is a novel PIP-binding protein that uses the TRAF domain, a mushroom-shaped trimer fold, to bind up to three lipid molecules.</p>

<title>The TRAF Domain of TRAF4 Is Recruited at the Plasma Membrane Via Its Interaction with PIPs</title>
<p>Even though they are quantitatively minor components of membranes, PIPs play a crucial role in cellular compartmentalization and in protein targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Shewan1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-DiPaolo1">[53]</xref>. We hypothesized that owing to its affinity for PIPs, the TRAF domain would be targeted to PIP-enriched membranes. First, we compared the subcellular localization of the full-length TRAF4 protein to that of the TRAF domain in isolation in MCF7 MECs. To this aim, we expressed EYFP-tagged full-length TRAF4 or the TRAF domain of TRAF4 in MCF7 and labeled them with the TJ marker ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Consistent with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kedinger2">[17]</xref>, TRAF4 is mainly localized in TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6Aa</xref>). Strikingly, in isolation, the TRAF domain was distributed homogenously along the plasma membrane and was not enriched in TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6Ab</xref>). A variety of PIP species can be found along cellular membranes. We next looked at whether the localization of specific PIPs could explain the recruitment of the TRAF4-TRAF domain all along the plasma membrane in MCF7 cells. Two major plasma membrane PIPs, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, can be localized using specific probes, the GFP-tagged PH domain of phospholipase Cδ (PH-PLCδ) and the GFP-tagged PH domain of Akt (PH-Akt), respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Balla1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Vrnai1">[55]</xref>.

We therefore analyzed the localization of the TRAF domain with respect to the subcellular distribution of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 in MCF7 cells. Both the PH-PLCδ and the PH-Akt probes colocalized with the TRAF-Cherry protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that in isolation the TRAF domain of TRAF4 is localized in both PI(4,5)P2- and PI(3,4,5)P3-enriched regions that include most of the plasma membrane.</p>

Cells transiently transfected with YFP-tagged (green) complete TRAF4 protein (a) and TRAF domain (b) were labeled for endogenous ZO-1 (red) and DNA (nuclei in blue). Confocal sections are shown together with xz- and yz-scans. Schematic representation of the localization of the EYFP-tagged proteins is presented at the bottom. TRAF-EYFP exhibited recruitment all along the plasma membrane, whereas TRAF4-EYFP is specifically targeted to the TJs. (B) Colocalization between the TRAF4-TRAF domain and fluorescently tagged PIP-probes. MCF7 cells were co-transfected with the mCherry-tagged TRAF domain and EGFP-tagged PH domains of the phospholipase C protein (PH-PLC-GFP, top) and Akt (PH-Akt-GFP, bottom). Confocal sections showed that the TRAF domain of TRAF4 co-localized with PH-PLC-GFP and PH-Akt-GFP proteins that bind PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 at the apical and basolateral side of the cell, respectively. Nuclei were stained using Hoechst (blue). Insets on the right represent a 2.5× magnification. Scale bar, 5 µm. (C) Tubulation assays in COS7 cells. The recruitment of PH-PLC-Cherry (a), WT TRAF-Cherry (b), and mutant TRAF domains TRAF-K313E-Cherry (c) or TRAF-K345E-Cherry (d) on membrane tubes was studied by colocalization with BIN1/BAR-GFP (top panels) and BIN1/BAR-PI-GFP (bottom panels). Nuclei were stained using Hoechst (blue). Similarly to PH-PLC-Cherry, a known PI(4,5)P2 binding domain, TRAF-Cherry protein was specifically recruited to PIP-enriched membrane tubes. Both lysines 313 (c) and 345 (d) mutations prevent the recruitment of the TRAF domain to PIP-enriched membrane tubes.

<p>The co-localization of the TRAF domain with the major plasma membrane PIPs suggests that it is recruited to membranes owing to its interaction with PIPs. To test this hypothesis, we performed a BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) domain-induced membrane tubulation assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Lee1">[58]</xref>. In this assay, membrane tubes are induced in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells by the expression of the BAR domain of BIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Lee1">[58]</xref>. Moreover, by using the isolated BAR domain and a fusion between the BAR and the PI domains of BIN1 protein, one can initiate the formation of numerous intracytoplasmic naked- and PI(4)P/PI(4,5)P2-decorated membrane tubes, respectively. To calibrate this assay, we first studied the recruitment of the known PI(4,5)P2 interactor PH-PLCδ in both naked- and PIP-decorated BAR-induced membrane tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6Ca</xref>). Consistent with the known affinity of this sensor for PI(4,5)P2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Garcia1">[59]</xref>, the mCherry-tagged PH-PLCδ protein hardly co-localized with naked tubes induced by the BIN1/BAR construct; conversely, in cells harboring PIP-decorated membrane tubes induced by the BIN1/BAR-PI construct, the mCherry-tagged PH-PLCδ was massively recruited onto membrane tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6Ca</xref>). We next studied the recruitment of the mCherry-tagged TRAF domain in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6Cb</xref>). Remarkably, the TRAF domain was massively recruited onto PIP-decorated membrane tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6Cb</xref>, bottom panel) and did not colocalize with naked tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6Cb</xref>, upper panel). This result shows that the TRAF domain is specifically recruited onto PIP-enriched membranes and supports the notion that this interaction is necessary for its subcellular localization.</p>
<p>We then used the BAR domain-induced membrane tubulation assay to study the membrane recruitment of PIP-binding–deficient TRAF mutants, which have been previously characterized biochemically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g004">Figure 4</xref>). To this aim, the K313E and K345E mutants were constructed in fusion with the mCherry protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and expressed in COS-7 cells in the presence of either BIN1/BAR- or BIN1/BAR-PI-induced membrane tubes. In contrast to the WT TRAF domain, which colocalizes specifically with PIP-decorated tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6Cb</xref>), both mutants did not colocalize with either naked- or PIP-decorated membrane tubes and were cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6Cc–d</xref>).</p>
<p>We also looked at the subcellular localization of these two PIP-binding–deficient mutants in MCF7 cells. In these cells the WT TRAF domain is localized at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, upper panel). Consistent with the biochemical <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays that showed that the K313 and the K345 residues were contributive and essential to the binding with PIPs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g004">Figure 4</xref>), the TRAF-K313E mutant was localized both in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, middle panel, arrows), while the TRAF-K345E mutant was completely absent from the plasma membrane and exclusively present in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, bottom panel). Altogether, these data are consistent with the notion that the subcellular localization of TRAF4 at the plasma membrane is governed by its binding to membrane resident PIPs.</p>

<title>TRAF–PIP Interaction Is Crucial for TRAF4 Recruitment in TJs</title>
<p>Compared with the complete protein that localizes predominantly in TJs, the TRAF domain of TRAF4 in isolation has a broader localization all along the plasma membrane. To know whether the binding with PIPs is a prerequisite for the addressing of the complete TRAF4 protein in TJs, we studied the subcellular localization of PIP-binding–deficient TRAF4 mutants in the context of the whole protein. To this aim, sh-insensitive Flag-tagged WT or mutant TRAF4 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) were expressed in the MCF7/shT4 cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We used this experimental setting to avoid misinterpretations due to the possible trimerization of ectopically expressed TRAF4 with endogenous TRAF4 protein. The localization of the proteins to TJs was then evaluated by quantification of their colocalization with ZO-1 and the derivation of a colocalization index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). A complete colocalization between WT TRAF4 and ZO-1 was measured confirming its presence in TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Consistent with the finding that the K313 residue contributes but is not essential to the binding of TRAF4 with PIPs, the TRAF4-K313E mutant only partially localized with ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, middle panel). Interestingly, the TRAF4-K345E mutant was absent from TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Indeed, after quantification, the colocalization index was reduced by 40% and 80% for the TRAF4-K313E and TRAF4-K345E mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Taken together, these data show that PIP binding is a prerequisite for the localization of TRAF4 at TJs.</p>

The highlighted overlap (white) between TRAF4 and ZO-1 staining is shown on merge panels and alone on the right panel.

<title>TRAF4 Functions on TJs in a PIP-Binding–Dependent Manner</title>
<p>Our results indicate that TRAF4 is a negative regulator of TJs in MECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and the TRAF domain is a novel PIP-binding domain that is essential for the addressing of the protein to the plasma membrane. In addition, we showed that the PIP-binding–dependent membrane recruitment of TRAF4 is necessary for its addressing to TJs. We then wondered whether the role of TRAF4 on TJs was dependent on its association with PIPs at the membrane and moreover on its presence to TJs. To address this, the K345E PIP-binding–deficient mutant of TRAF4 was used to rescue the TJ phenotype found in TRAF4-silenced MCF10A cells (MCF10A/shT4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Both WT and mutant TRAF4 proteins were efficiently expressed in MCF10A/shT4 cells to levels above endogenous TRAF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). As previously mentioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), TRAF4-silenced cells (MCF10A/shT4+pBABE) have a ∼2-fold increase in cells with TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g007">Figure 7Ea and b,F</xref>), while cells with restored TRAF4 expression had 2-fold less TJs than the parental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g007">Figure 7Ea and c,F</xref>). In contrast, restoring TRAF4 expression by using the TRAF4-K345E mutant did not rescue the phenotype induced by TRAF4 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g007">Figure 7Ec and d,F</xref>).</p>
<p>These results provide a novel illustration of the importance of TRAF4 subcellular localization on cell biology. Indeed, they show that to act as a negative regulator on TJ formation and/or stability, TRAF4 must be addressed to the plasma membrane/TJ via a PIP-binding–dependent mechanism. Therefore, preventing or favoring its presence in the plasma membrane and in TJs represents a means to regulate its action on tissue homeostasis.</p>

<title>TRAF4 Promotes MEC Migration</title>
<p>Of interest, TJ proteins, in addition to their characterized role in mediating cell–cell adhesion and assuring an epithelial barrier, can have an active role in cell migration. The protein ZO-1 actively regulates cell migration by modulating cytoskeletal dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Huo1">[60]</xref>. Given that TRAF4 is overexpressed in breast cancer and that migration of cancer cells participates in tumor progression, we addressed the role of TRAF4 in the migration of breast cancer cells. To this aim, TRAF4 expression was modulated in MCF7 cells, and cell migration was measured using the Boyden chamber assay. We first studied cell migration in TRAF4-depleted MCF7 cells. Compared to parental (MCF7) and to a control cell line (MCF7/shCtrl), TRAF4 was expressed by less than 20% in TRAF4-silenced cells (MCF7/shT4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Migration was impaired by 40% in this line compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g008">Figure 8B,C</xref>). We next reintroduced TRAF4 expression in this silenced cell line (MCF7/ShT4+TRAF4), and TRAF4 was expressed at a level above the parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Consistently, reintroduction of TRAF4 was associated with increased cell migration similar to parental MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g008">Figure 8B,C</xref>). To complement these findings, MCF7 cells stably expressing TRAF4 were generated (MCF7/TRAF4). TRAF4 was increased 3-fold as compared to parental and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Supporting the role of TRAF4 in cell migration, compared with parental and control lines, migration was increased by 40% in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g008">Figure 8B,C</xref>). To know whether this promigratory function is linked with its ability to interact with PIPs and to localize at TJs, we then used the PIP-binding–deficient TRAF4-K345E mutant in the Boyden chamber migration assay. To this end, this mutant was reintroduced and expressed in TRAF4-silenced cells (MCF7/shT4+TRAF4-K345E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). In contrast to the WT protein, the TRAF4-K345E mutant did not restore cell migration in TRAF4-silenced MCF7 cells, indicating that a PIP-binding–deficient mutant could not rescue the migration phenotype induced by the loss of TRAF4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001726-g008">Figure 8B,C</xref>). The positive impact of TRAF4 on cell migration was also addressed in MCF10A cells. Consistent with the results obtained using MCF7 cells, TRAF4 positively regulated cell migration in this cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001726.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the normal breast, TRAF4 is predominantly localized in TJs of polarized epithelial cells. The molecular mechanism targeting TRAF4 to these adhesion structures as well as its function at these regions remained elusive. The experiments presented here provide for the first time, to our knowledge, a molecular explanation for the recruitment of TRAF4 in TJs. Indeed TRAF4 uses its TRAF domain as a novel PIP-binding domain to be addressed to the plasma membrane, an essential step for its recruitment in TJs. Moreover, they show that TRAF4 acts as a negative regulator of TJs and favors migration of breast cancer cells.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence indicate a link between TRAF4 and cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rousseau1">[24]</xref>. During development, breast epithelial cells polarize and assemble into duct and acini structures. One of the earliest manifestations of breast cancer is the loss of this cellular organization. Indeed, loss of cell–cell contact and epithelial polarity are hallmarks of carcinomas and contribute to their development as carcinomas <italic>in situ</italic> or their progression to invasive adenocarcinomas. TRAF4 expression is altered in breast carcinomas and the protein shifts from TJs to other subcellular territories, suggesting that it could be part of the mechanisms leading to the disruption of the polarized breast epithelium.</p>
<p>Of interest, the epithelial polarity program relies on several conserved cellular machineries, including the domain-identity machinery that builds a TJ fence between apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains by using specific proteins and lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Tanos1">[61]</xref>. The asymmetric distribution of lipids from the PIP family within the plasma membrane plays a key role in the establishment of cell polarity. These lipids represent optimal signaling mediators by forming docking sites for PIP-binding protein effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Shewan1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Balla1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-GassamaDiagne2">[62]</xref>. To date, 11 PIP-binding domains have been described, including PH (pleckstrin homology), PX (Phox homology), and FYVE (Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, and EEA1) domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kutateladze1">[63]</xref>. While the majority of PIP-binding modules selectively bind to one PIP depending on its phosphorylation status, it has recently emerged that some proteins bind PIPs in a promiscuous manner. It is the case for the polarity proteins PAR3, ZO-1, and α-syntrophin. They do not contain a consensus PIP-binding motif but use their PDZ or PH domains to bind PIPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Meerschaert1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wu2">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Chockalingam1">[64]</xref>. It has been proposed that the loose binding of these proteins to PIPs served to enhance their affinity for membranes and that additional factors are required to fine-tune their subcellular localizations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Shewan1">[49]</xref>. In this study, we show that TRAF4 uses its TRAF domain as a novel PIP-binding module. The TRAF domain is highly conserved within the family of TRAF proteins; consistent with this conservation we also show for the first time to our knowledge that the TRAF domains of TRAF1 to −6 also bind PIP. Therefore, the TRAF domain can be considered as a novel <italic>bona fide</italic> PIP-binding domain. Similarly to PAR3, ZO-1, and α-syntrophin, the TRAF domain of TRAF4 has a broad affinity for PIPs. Consistently, the TRAF domain in isolation localizes homogenously along the plasma membrane, while the full-length TRAF4 protein is restricted to TJs, suggesting that the binding with PIP is a prerequisite for the addressing of TRAF4 in TJs. Additional mechanisms are subsequently required to refine TRAF4 localization to TJs. Moreover, we solved the 3D structure of the TRAF domain of TRAF4 and showed that it exists as a trimer. Ligand-binding studies show that under its trimeric form TRAF4 can bind one to three lipid molecules, and thus avidity might increase its affinity to lipid membranes. These structural data suggest that the TRAF domain serves to enrich TRAF4 at the plasma membrane and its membrane association can be modulated by the local concentration in PIPs.</p>
<p>The TRAF4-TRAF trimer has a mushroom-shaped structure. The globular part defined as TRAF-C forms the cap, and the coiled-coil part known as TRAF-N is the stalk. To date, among the solved TRAF domains from TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Park1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Ni1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Ye2">[66]</xref>, all share this specific architecture. In the canonical mode of action, TRAFs are cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic tail of activated TNF and interleukin-1/Toll-like receptors to mediate a wide range of biological functions including immune and inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wang2">[67]</xref>. When the TRAF domain of TRAF2 and TRAF6 were crystallized in the presence of a peptide representing their receptor ligand, the structure showed the peptide bound to a shallow surface depression on the side of one protomer without contact to the adjacent protomer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Park1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Ye2">[66]</xref>. This mode of binding is very distinct from the PIP-binding model that we predict from the structure of the TRAF domain. In this model, each PIP molecule binds at the interface between two neighboring protomers. Very interestingly, the superimposition of the receptor peptide tail and lipid binding sites shows that they do not overlap. Therefore, a synergistic interaction between both modes of binding is possible in theory. The measured affinity constants between TRAF proteins and their receptor ligand were quite low (40–60 µM range) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Ye1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kuriyan1">[68]</xref>, and it has been proposed that the high and specific affinity for TRAF proteins with their receptors is achieved through avidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wu3">[48]</xref>. Our results suggest that, in addition, a synergistic interaction of TRAF proteins with a membrane lipid would likewise stabilize and orient the TRAF adaptors at the membrane and increase interaction with their receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Ye1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kuriyan1">[68]</xref>. This potential mechanism remains to be addressed experimentally.</p>
<p>Other novel results from this study are the function of TRAF4 on TJ and cell migration. These findings provide a rationale for most of the developmental defects that were reported in TRAF4-deficient animals. For example, it has been shown that TRAF4 is essential for neural tube closure (NTC) and neural crest cell development, two processes involving TJ remodeling prior to cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Eom1">[69]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kalkan2">[70]</xref>. Indeed, TRAF4 knock-down in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> causes neural plate-folding defects and impairs neural crest cell formation, whereas TRAF4 overexpression expends the neural crest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Mathew1">[12]</xref>. TRAF4 involvement in NTC has also been described in mice as TRAF4-deficient mice exhibit NTC defects giving rise to mild <italic>spina bifida</italic> phenotypes and embryonic lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rgnier2">[13]</xref>. In addition, it has been recently shown that TRAF4 is a direct target of Twist, a transcription factor involved in neural crest formation and fate determination in frog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Lander1">[71]</xref>. Our results are consistent with these observations and suggest that TRAF4 contributes to TJ plasticity, a key process regulating NTC and neural crest cell formation and migration. Thus, we believe that in TRAF4 knock-out animals, neural crest cells might fail to disrupt their TJs, impairing their ability to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and to achieve their proper destination contributing to the observed abnormalities. Cell–cell adhesion is an important regulator of cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-LeBras1">[72]</xref>. In our experiment we did not notice significant alteration of molecular components involved in adherens junctions and in desmosomes. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that these structures are altered by TRAF4 expression. Part of TRAF4 function might be linked with desmosomes and adherens junctions.</p>
<p>To conclude, TRAF4 acts both as a negative regulator of TJs and a cell migration promoter. To achieve its function, TRAF4 needs to interact with PIPs, which allows for its trafficking to the plasma membrane and subsequently to the TJs. This suggests that TRAF4 acts in a signaling loop involving lipids; however, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear and will be addressed in the future. Importantly, gain of TRAF4 expression and protein mislocalization have been reported in a variety of carcinoma. Notably, TRAF4 was found to be overexpressed through gene amplification in about 20% of breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Rgnier1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-CamilleriBrot1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Biche1">[73]</xref>. Interestingly, two recent reports showed that TRAF4 favors breast cancer cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Zhang2">[74]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wang3">[75]</xref>. In particular, Zhang et al. showed that TRAF4 regulates the TGF-β pathway and that TRAF4 expression favors breast cancer metastasis and is associated with a poor prognosis among breast cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Zhang2">[74]</xref>. Therefore, gain of TRAF4 function appears to be an important factor for the development and progression of breast cancer.</p>

Crystals appeared in several conditions with the best being 15% PEG 4000, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0. The crystals were briefly transferred to crystallization solution supplemented with 25% PEG 400 and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Data were collected from a single cryo-cooled crystal (100 K) on a MarMOSAIC 225 CCD detector (Marresearch) on the ID23-2 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). We collected 180° of data to 1.85 Å using 2.25° rotation and 1.55 s exposure time per image. The data were indexed and processed with XDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Kabsch1">[83]</xref> and scaled by AIMLESS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Evans1">[84]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Evans2">[85]</xref> from the CCP4 suite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-The1">[86]</xref>. The crystals belonged to the space-group P2<sub>1</sub> with unit cell parameters a = 54.625 Å, b = 85.443 Å, c = 61.646 Å, β = 108.076°.

<title>Docking of PI(3,4,5)P3-diC4 to Human TRAF4</title>
<p>The 3D structure of PI(3,4,5)P3 was obtained from a 2D sketch by Corina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Sadowski1">[95]</xref>, and its protonation state at pH 7.4 was predicted using the Filter program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-FILTER1">[96]</xref>. A fully deprotonated form (net charge of −7) was predicted to be the most abundant species and further considered for docking. Hydrogen atoms were added to the X-ray structure of human TRAF4 by means of the SYBYL X-2.0 package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-SYBYLX1">[97]</xref>.</p>
<p>The ligand was then docked into the X-ray structure of human TRAF4 with the program GOLD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-GOLD1">[98]</xref>. The active site was defined by any residue within a 10-Å-radius sphere centered at the mid-distance between Lys313A and Lys345C Cα atoms. Five residue side chains (Lys313A, Arg297C, Glu298C, Glu300C, and Lys345C) were considered flexible during the docking using the GOLD default rotamer library. Hydrogen bonding of the ligand to Lys313A and Lys345 NZ atoms was set as a prerequisite using a constraint weight of 20.0 and a minimum geometry weight of 0.005. The best docking pose of each of 20 independent docking runs was saved, therefore leading to 20 possible docking solutions, out of which the one with the best docking score was retained. The ligand topology was parameterized with the Antechamber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Wang4">[99]</xref> module of AMBER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Case1">[100]</xref>. The corresponding protein—ligand complex was embedded in a box of 23668 TIP3P water molecules and was further refined in AMBER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001726-Case1">[100]</xref> using the AMBER general atom force field (GAFF) for the ligand and the ff99 force-field for the protein. The fully hydrated complex was refined by 1,500 steps of steepest descent plus 4,000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>MCF7, COS-7, and MCF10A cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected for 24 h. Cells were then fixed for 20 min at RT with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, cells were incubated at RT with the primary antibodies rabbit anti-Flag (1∶2,000; F-7425 Sigma) and mouse anti-ZO-1 (1∶1,000; Zymed). After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with Cy3- and Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch and Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, respectively). After two washes, nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst-33258 dye. Slides were mounted in ProLong Gold (Invitrogen). Observations were made with a confocal microscope (Leica SP2 UV, 63×, NA 1.4). For TJ recruitment analysis, images were acquired using the same confocal microscope settings (laser intensity, PMT gain …). The overlapping staining between WT or mutant TRAF4 and ZO-1 was highlighted in white by the “colocalization analysis” tool from ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Pixels were considered colocalized if their intensity value was above the threshold value (50) and the ratio of their intensity higher than 50%. A colocalization index corresponding to the overlapping area between TRAF4 and ZO-1 divided by the TJ length was then calculated. Ten fields per condition were acquired for the quantification. For the measurement of TJ formation and/or stability, immunofluorescence was performed 48 h after MCF10A cell line plating as described above.</p>

<title>Boyden Chamber Assay</title>
<p>The lower Transwell chamber (Millicell, Merck Millipore) contained cell-appropriate medium (10% FCS, 2% BSA as chemoattractants). Cells in appropriate medium (0.2% BSA) were seeded onto membranes of the upper Transwell chamber (6.5 mm diameter, 8 µm pores), MCF10A (40×10<sup>4</sup> cells, 16 h) and MCF7 (10<sup>5</sup> cells, 48 h). After incubation, cells were ethanol-fixed and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst-33258 dye. Cells at the membrane upper face were scraped, and those of the lower face were counted after acquisition using an inverted microscope. A total of 36 microscopic fields from three independent experiments were used for quantification. Nuclei were counted with the “nucleus counter” ImageJ plugin.</p>
