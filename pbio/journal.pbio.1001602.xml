<p>We find that genome-wide DNA transfer by conjugation in mycobacteria affords bacteria that reproduce by binary fission the same advantages of sexual reproduction, and may explain the genomic evolution of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in bacteria generates variation and drives evolution, and conjugation is considered a major contributor as it can mediate transfer of large segments of DNA between strains and species. We previously described a novel form of chromosomal conjugation in mycobacteria that does not conform to classic <italic>oriT</italic>-based conjugation models, and whose potential evolutionary significance has not been evaluated. Here, we determined the genome sequences of 22 F1-generation transconjugants, providing the first genome-wide view of conjugal HGT in bacteria at the nucleotide level. Remarkably, mycobacterial recipients acquired multiple, large, unlinked segments of donor DNA, far exceeding expectations for any bacterial HGT event. Consequently, conjugal DNA transfer created extensive genome-wide mosaicism within individual transconjugants, which generated large-scale sibling diversity approaching that seen in meiotic recombination. We exploited these attributes to perform genome-wide mapping and introgression analyses to map a locus that determines conjugal mating identity in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Distributive conjugal transfer offers a plausible mechanism for the predicted HGT events that created the genome mosaicism observed among extant <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium canettii</italic> species. Mycobacterial distributive conjugal transfer permits innovative genetic approaches to map phenotypic traits and confers the evolutionary benefits of sexual reproduction in an asexual organism.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Bacteria reproduce by binary fission, generating two clones of the original; this restricts the genomic diversity of the population, which brings with it inherent evolutionary drawbacks. This problem can be eased by conjugation, which transfers DNA from a donor to a recipient bacterium. Understanding the potential of conjugal DNA transfer for generating genetic diversity is necessary for estimating gene flow through populations and for predicting rates of bacterial evolution. The influence of chromosomal conjugal DNA transfer on mycobacterial diversity has not been previously addressed. Here, we determine and compare the complete genome sequences of independent progeny from bacterial matings between defined donor and recipient strains of <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>. We find the resulting hybrid bacteria to be extremely diverse blends of the parental strains, reminiscent of the genetic mixing that occurs through meiotic recombination in sexual organisms. This novel mechanism of conjugation can create genome-wide mosaicism in a single event, generating segments of donor DNA that range from small (∼0.05 kb) to large (∼250 kb), widely distributed around the recipient chromosome. We exploit this mixing by using genetic tools originally developed for finding mammalian disease genes to locate the genes that confer a donor phenotype in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. We speculate that similar genomic mosaicism observed in pathogenic mycobacteria arose from conjugation between ancestral progenitor strains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes promotes genetic diversity by increasing gene flow through a population, permitting both the loss of mutant genes and the acquisition of functionally distinct gene alleles. The diversifying potential is further enhanced by crossover events that create new mosaic recombinant meiotic products, which in turn may impart new functionalities not present in either parent. In contrast, bacterial fission provides rapid clonal expansion to fill an environmental niche, but lacks the evolutionary advantages of sexual reproduction. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mitigates the diversification constraints of asexual reproduction by mediating limited gene flow through the population. The fundamental forms of HGT include transformation, transduction, and conjugation. Conjugation is considered a major contributor to HGT, as it can transfer more extensive segments of DNA between different species and even kingdoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-BuchananWollaston1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Thomas1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Conjugation describes the unidirectional transfer of DNA from a donor to a recipient, and requires cell–cell contact. Conjugal processes are traditionally plasmid encoded, or encoded by a discrete genetic element integrated into the chromosome. Transfer proteins are generally classified into those that establish and maintain mating-pair formation or those responsible for DNA transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-AlvarezMartinez1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-delaCruz1">[6]</xref>. These latter proteins recognize and nick the unique origin of transfer (<italic>oriT</italic>) on the plasmid and guide the DNA into the recipient cell. <italic>oriT</italic> is <italic>cis</italic>-acting, and thus, when recombined into the chromosome, it can mediate transfer of chromosomal DNA, as first described for <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfr strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Wollman1">[7]</xref>. DNA transfer in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> displays all of the hallmarks of conjugation: it requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain, it is DNase resistant, and the transferred DNA segments are incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Parsons1">[8]</xref>. While the process clearly meets the traditional definition of conjugation, the similarities with the classical <italic>E. coli</italic> Hfr system end there <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Firth1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Wollman3">[13]</xref>. Mycobacterial conjugation is chromosome—not plasmid—based, and bioinformatic and genetic studies have yet to identify a genetic element that might mediate transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Coros1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Flint1">[15]</xref>. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, Hfr transfer always initiates at the sole plasmid-encoded <italic>oriT</italic> site, and the DNA is transferred in a 5′ to 3′ direction, such that only genes proximal and 3′ to <italic>oriT</italic> are inherited at high frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Lloyd1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Smith1">[16]</xref>. By contrast, in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, all regions of the chromosome are transferred with comparable efficiencies as demonstrated by equivalent transfer of a kanamycin-resistance marker regardless of its chromosomal location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Wang1">[11]</xref>. This position independence is consistent with the presence of multiple, but ill-defined, initiation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Wang2">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Transposon mutagenesis screens provided initial insights into the genetic requirements of transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Coros1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Flint1">[15]</xref>. These studies established a prominent role for the Type VII secretion apparatus, ESX-1, in both donor and recipient activity. ESX-1 clearly plays different roles in each cell type. ESX-1 donor mutants are hyperconjugative, suggesting secretion plays a role in negatively regulating transfer activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Flint1">[15]</xref>. By contrast, recipient strain ESX-1 mutants do not receive donor DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Coros1">[14]</xref>. Although these studies provided novel insights into the functional roles of ESX-1, they did not provide insights on the transfer mechanism, or define what determines the mating type of a cell (either donor or recipient).</p>
<p>Here, as an alternative approach, we examined the products of DNA transfer to better understand this process and its contributions to mycobacterial evolution. We used next-generation sequencing to determine the parental inheritance profiles in transconjugant <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> progeny. The genomic sequence of each of the <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> parental strains has been determined, and the abundant single nucleotide polymorphisms between the two strains indicated that the transferred segments comprising the transconjugant genomes could be mapped with precision. We found that the parental contributions to the transconjugants were much more complex than expected, indicating a surprisingly major role for conjugal DNA transfer in generating genomic diversity. The blending of the parental genomes is reminiscent of that seen in the meiotic products of sexual reproduction. This comparison is validated by our use here of genomic approaches previously developed and applied in sexual reproduction systems to define candidate genes for conjugal mating identity.</p>

<title>Transconjugant Genomes Are Highly Mosaic</title>
<p>To provide a selectable marker for chromosomal DNA transfer, a kanamycin resistance gene (<italic>Km<sup>r</sup></italic>) was integrated in the chromosome of mc<sup>2</sup>155, the standard laboratory and conjugal donor strain of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Donor mc<sup>2</sup>155 derivatives that differed in their <italic>Km<sup>r</sup></italic> insertion site were mated to an apramycin-resistant (Ap<sup>r</sup>) recipient strain, mc<sup>2</sup>874 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). mc<sup>2</sup>874 is an independent isolate of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> that we have used as a standard recipient strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Parsons1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Mizuguchi1">[18]</xref>. Apramycin resistance was episomally encoded to avoid inheritance biases caused by selecting for this gene on the recipient chromosome. From matings between these strains, 12 independent Km<sup>r</sup>Ap<sup>r</sup> F1 progeny were isolated, and the DNA sequences of their genomes were determined (sequence data deposited in the EBI/ENA database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP002619" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP002619</ext-link>). Our comparative sequence analyses of the parental strains had shown that the circular mc<sup>2</sup>155 and mc<sup>2</sup>874 genomes are collinear, and that they contained abundant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; averaging one per 56 bp) providing a clear distinction between parental DNA origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s001">S1</xref>). Individual sequence reads from each transconjugant were aligned with the donor strain genome to identify all transferred donor segments. When evaluating transconjugant sequences, we conservatively required the presence or absence of two consecutive recipient SNPs to define a boundary between recipient and donor sequence tracts, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Donor segments replaced the corresponding recipient sequences, as evidenced by a concomitant localized loss of recipient-specific SNPs in transconjugants. Unique segments of transferred donor DNA, predicted by alignment analyses in transconjugants, were confirmed by conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s007">Table S1</xref>). Two transconjugants had 11 regions that were merodiploid (approximately equal contributions of donor and recipient SNPs). As this was a resequencing and not a <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing strategy, we cannot determine the precise architecture and location of these regions. These regions did not contain repetitive elements, though it is possible that integration occurred at nonsynonymous sites via microhomology or through mechanisms not requiring homology.</p>

<p>(A) Conjugation and genome comparison protocol. Sequence reads for each transconjugant were aligned with the reference donor genome and viewed with IGV. Columns of colored nucleotides mark informative SNPs between the recipient and donor strains, while random colored nucleotides indicate sequence errors. (B) A Circos plot depicts the mosaic nature of 12 <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> transconjugant genomes. mc<sup>2</sup>155 donor DNA segments (alternating blue and magenta, or green) replaced homologous recipient sequences (yellow). Positions of integrated kanamycin genes (<italic>Km</italic>) are shown around the periphery (green arrows), and transferred donor DNA segments containing the <italic>Km</italic> gene are shown in green. Strain nomenclature is based on the genomic location of the <italic>Km</italic> gene in Mb, thus Km0.1 is inserted at coordinate 0.1 Mb in mc<sup>2</sup>155. Strains are from outer to inner circle, respectively: Km6.9e, Km0.1f, Km6.9d, Km3.2, Km6.9c, Km0.1e, Km3.8, Km4.5b, Km2.2a, Km0.1d, Km0.1c, and Km6.4a. The innermost circle is a compilation of all segments of mc<sup>2</sup>155 DNA, showing that almost all regions of the donor chromosome were transferred despite the small sample size. (C) Microcomplexity of parental SNP profiles at some transconjugant recombination sites. Compiled sequence read landscapes are shown for mc<sup>2</sup>874 and one transconjugant (Km6.9e) aligned to the mc<sup>2</sup>155 sequence (top) for a 1 kb segment of the genome (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s008">Table S2</xref>, coordinates 470,385–471,385). The presence of informative SNPs (each color represents a different base) indicates recipient sequences, while segments lacking SNPs define donor sequence. Accordingly, parental genotype segments are shown in the schematic below with recipient (yellow) and donor (blue and magenta) genotypes interspersed throughout this 1 kb region. Note that rare cases of isolated recipient SNPs in our designated donor segments are excluded by our stringent criterion requiring two consecutive SNPs to conclusively establish parental origin. The lower panel shows the same sequences aligned to the mc<sup>2</sup>874 sequence, in which the SNPs now indicate donor sequence. This reciprocal alignment confirms the assignment of donor and recipient sequences in the schematic map.</p>

<p>The most striking observation from an alignment of our initial set of 12 transconjugant genomes with the parental genomes was that the transconjugant genomes were broadly mosaic, containing at least two, and as many as 21, separate tracts of cotransferred mc<sup>2</sup>155 DNA embedded in an mc<sup>2</sup>874 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s008">Table S2</xref>). These separate segments of DNA were acquired in a single cell–cell transfer event, as determined in earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Wang1">[11]</xref>. To our knowledge, this degree of genome-wide diversity is unprecedented in genetic transfer events between bacteria. This contrasts directly with the iconic plasmid-transfer systems in which a single segment of donor DNA linked to <italic>oriT</italic> is inherited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Lloyd1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-delaCruz2">[19]</xref>. Therefore, we refer to mycobacterial conjugation as distributive conjugal transfer to distinguish it from <italic>oriT</italic>-mediated transfer.</p>
<p>As expected, all transconjugant progeny acquired the selected <italic>Km<sup>r</sup></italic> gene, along with variable amounts of flanking mc<sup>2</sup>155 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, Km<sup>r</sup>, green segments embedded in yellow recipient DNA). Surprisingly, 5-fold more mc<sup>2</sup>155 DNA was co-inherited in segments that were not selected, and these segments were distributed around the genome with no obvious regional biases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, alternating blue and magenta improve visual discrimination between adjacent tracts; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s008">Table S2</xref>). The 12 transconjugant genomes analyzed contained from 57 kb to 679 kb (of 6.9 Mb) of mc<sup>2</sup>155-derived sequence. The sizes of the donor segments varied &gt;1,000-fold, ranging from 59 bp to 226 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s008">Table S2</xref>), with an average size of 33.8 kb, and a mean of 10 tracts per genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001602-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>DCT Facilitates a Genome-Wide Mapping Approach That Identifies a Mating Identity (<italic>Mid</italic>) Locus</title>
<p>The image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows the extent of mc<sup>2</sup>155 DNA transferred to recipients when selecting for a single event: acquisition of the gene encoding Km<sup>r</sup>. Based on the distributive nature of transfer, we reasoned that we could employ secondary screens of the transconjugants to map any additional genetic trait regardless of its linkage to the <italic>Km<sup>r</sup></italic> gene. Tracking parental SNPs within a group of individual transconjugants exhibiting a given phenotype should identify those shared SNPs (and parental genes) associated with that phenotype. We have previously observed that a subset of transconjugants become donors, suggesting that these progeny acquired a donor-conferring locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Wang1">[11]</xref>. We hypothesized that an unbiased genome-wide mapping approach would identify a shared segment of mc<sup>2</sup>155 DNA among those progeny encoding this trait. Transconjugants derived from crosses of the differentially marked donor strains were screened for donor ability, and 10 independent donor-proficient transconjugants were identified. We note that mating identity is a mutually exclusive phenotype, and transconjugants exhibit transfer efficiencies comparable to parental strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Wang1">[11]</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s009">Table S3</xref>). Genomic DNA from each donor-proficient transconjugant was prepared and its sequence determined. Comparative sequence analysis showed that all donor-proficient transconjugants, regardless of the location of the <italic>Km<sup>r</sup></italic> gene in the parent, shared only one segment of mc<sup>2</sup>155 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s010">Table S4</xref>), with the smallest region of overlap encompassing coordinates 74,522 to 119,788 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

<p>This region is not simply a hot spot for integration of acquired DNA, since the 12 recipient-proficient (i.e., did not become donors) transconjugants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g001">Figure 1B</xref> were not similarly enriched for this segment of mc<sup>2</sup>155 DNA (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g002">2A</xref>, and see below). Closer examination of the region acquired by donor-proficient transconjugants established that they all had inherited a minimal segment of DNA encompassing the mc<sup>2</sup>155 <italic>esx1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, 74,600–107,334 bp, <italic>esx1</italic><sub>D</sub>, where the subscript differentiates donor or recipient origin).

Proteins secreted by ESX-1 lack a signal peptide that would aid in their identification, and the most notable substrate is a heterodimer of two small proteins, EsxB and EsxA. Other proteins encoded within the <italic>esx1</italic> locus and elsewhere in the genome are also secreted through ESX-1, some of which are co-dependent on EsxBA secretion. The functions of most of the proteins encoded by <italic>esx1</italic> genes are unknown, but the overall composition of the <italic>esx1</italic> loci between the parental mc<sup>2</sup>155 and mc<sup>2</sup>874 strains are similar (see below). Although our previous transposon mutagenesis studies have shown that ESX-1 plays an important role in the process of DNA transfer in both donor and recipient strains, mating-type identity is not reversed in ESX-1 mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Coros1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Flint1">[15]</xref>. Therefore, the role of ESX-1 in determining mating identity was quite unexpected, and underscores the utility of a “change-of-function” mapping approach.</p>
<p>While all of the donor-proficient transconjugants inherited an intact <italic>esx1</italic><sub>D</sub> locus, none of the recipient-proficient F1 strains did. Notably, four of the F1 recipient-proficient strains were derived from the Km0.1 parent, in which only 15 kb separate <italic>esx1</italic><sub>D</sub> and the selected <italic>Km<sup>r</sup></italic> gene. Despite this tight linkage, distributive conjugal transfer readily segregated the <italic>Km<sup>r</sup></italic> gene and intact <italic>esx1</italic><sub>D</sub> locus when appropriately screened, thereby augmenting the mapping resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s008">Table S2</xref>, and below).

<title>Fine Mapping of the <italic>Mid</italic> Locus by a Backcrossing Analysis</title>
<p>In classical genetic studies, fine mapping of a genetic determinant can be achieved by performing successive backcross introgression analyses to genetically purify a locus in a recipient background. We reasoned a similar strategy would achieve two goals: (1) discard mc<sup>2</sup>155 parental genes not required for the donor transfer trait and (2) further narrow the key conjugal <italic>mid</italic> gene region. Six F1 donor recombinants were backcrossed with mc<sup>2</sup>874 recipient derivatives that were marked with a different episomally encoded antibiotic resistance gene (<italic>Hyg<sup>r</sup></italic> or <italic>Apy<sup>r</sup></italic>) in successive generations. Introgression entailed co-selection for Km<sup>r</sup> transfer and the recipient marker to identify transconjugants at each generation (N<sub>x</sub>), and then screening progeny for donor proficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Comparative analyses of genomes of three donor-proficient strains showed a purifying selection of the donor-conferring locus and <italic>Km<sup>r</sup></italic> genes in an otherwise recipient genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s010">Table S4</xref>). In each case, the majority of the F1 mc<sup>2</sup>155 DNA was lost. For example, the F1 parent of Km0.1BCb contained 19 mc<sup>2</sup>155 segments totaling over 869 kb, yet following six backcross generations this DNA was trimmed to three segments totaling 110 kb, most of which encompassed the selected <italic>mid</italic> and <italic>Km<sup>r</sup></italic> genes (79 kb, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s010">Table S4</xref>).</p>

<title>A pedigree showing the backcross introgression strategy.</title>
<p>To generate the initial F1 progeny, a kanamycin-resistant (Kan) mc<sup>2</sup>155 donor strain (blue square) was crossed with an apramycin-resistant (Apy) mc<sup>2</sup>874 recipient (yellow circle). The doubly resistant F1 transconjugants (K/A) were screened to identify donor-proficient progeny (green squares; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Donor-proficient F1 derivatives were then backcrossed with a derivative of the original mc<sup>2</sup>874 recipient strain that was marked with a plasmid encoding hygromycin resistance (Hyg). Doubly resistant transconjugants (K/H) were selected to create the N1 generation of transconjugants. As for the F1 stage, the N1 transconjugants were screened to identify donor-proficient progeny (squares) before backcrossing to the apramycin-resistant mc<sup>2</sup>874 recipient to generate the N2 generation. This process was reiterated to genetically purify the donor-determining genes in the mc<sup>2</sup>874 recipient background. Donor-proficient (square) or recipient-proficient (circle) progeny were isolated at either the N3 or the N6 stage, and their genomic DNA was isolated and the sequence determined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g005">5</xref>, respectively).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used next-generation sequencing to examine transconjugant genomes and found that mycobacterial conjugation generates highly mosaic genomes created by a robust distributive conjugal transfer process. Transconjugants acquired large amounts of donor DNA (some exceeding one-fourth of the transconjugant genome; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s010">Table S4</xref>, Km4.5a), in varied segment sizes (spanning four orders of magnitude) that were distributed around the genome. We exploited these characteristics of distributive conjugal transfer (DCT) to map mating identity genes of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>.</p>
<p>Hfr transfer in <italic>E. coli</italic> is initiated from the unique <italic>oriT</italic> and results in transfer of a single segment of the donor chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Firth1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-delaCruz2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Llosa1">[25]</xref>. Thus, while the recipient acquires new genetic information, that new information is limited to DNA immediately adjacent and 3′ to <italic>oriT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g007">Figure 7</xref>, left). Genetic analyses and an understanding of the RecBCD recombination machinery suggest that a single segment is integrated into the recipient chromosome via a recombination event occurring at each end of the transferred DNA molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Smith1">[16]</xref>. To our knowledge, whole genome sequencing has not been reported for Hfr– transconjugants, preventing a detailed comparison of the two conjugation systems. Thus, our study provides the first genome-wide analysis of bacterial conjugal transfer. In contrast to <italic>oriT</italic>-mediated transfer, the complex inheritance profiles exhibited by mycobacterial transconjugants suggest stochastic co-transfer from multiple origins, as previously predicted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Wang2">[17]</xref>. Based on our genome sequence data, we speculate that random chromosomal DNA fragments are generated in the donor, some of which are co-transferred into the recipient strain where they replace recipient sequences through homologous recombination. An alternative scenario is that a single large DNA molecule is transferred, which is processed into smaller segments before their integration into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. This scenario seems less likely as we would have expected to identify some transconjugant progeny containing exceedingly large chunks of donor DNA (3–4 Mb) integrated into the chromosome. These would have resulted from recombination close to the ends of the transferred molecule, before creation of small segments. This latter scenario is also less consistent with our previous observations, which indicated that the donor chromosome contained multiple initiation sites and that the efficiency of gene transfer was location-independent. We have considered examining boundary sequences to determine whether they provide insight on the mechanism of conjugation. However, there are multiple factors influencing boundary regions, which together prevent a unifying mechanistic insight. For example, the actual breakpoints generated by conjugation are almost certainly lost as the boundaries are driven by the requirement for homology and by different recombination mechanisms mediating integration, as evidenced by inheritance of both regions of microheterogeneity and single large integration events.</p>

<title>Graphic summary of the evolutionary and gene mapping potential of distributive conjugal transfer in comparison to <italic>oriT</italic>-mediated transfer.</title>
<p>The parental donor and recipient strains are schematically shown at the top, with their native chromosomes (blue and yellow circles, respectively) that confer different phenotypes (pink and blue backgrounds, respectively). Co-incubation of the donor and recipient strains on solid media (agar plates) or in a biofilm, permits conjugation. For <italic>oriT</italic>-mediated transfer (left), all transferred segments of DNA are linked to <italic>oriT</italic>, which limits the extent of genetic diversity among the transconjugants. This contrasts with distributive conjugal transfer (DCT), wherein random segments of the donor chromosome are transferred to the recipient, generating unique transconjugants. Each transconjugant has a novel genotype that confers a unique phenotypic profile (different colored background). Importantly, multiple rounds of <italic>oriT</italic>-mediated transfer events with different donors would be required to approach the variation observed from a single DCT event. Under certain conditions, any transconjugant phenotype may have a growth advantage over other transconjugants and the parental strains. Such evolutionary selection can give rise to emergent strains or species. Transconjugants that share a specific phenotypic trait can be sequenced to identify SNPs that mark a shared genomic region associated with that trait. An F1 transconjugant with a specific donor-derived trait can be repetitively backcrossed with the recipient strain to introgress the functional donor gene into the recipient background.</p>

<p>Mycobacteria encode multiple nonredundant recombination pathways (RecBCD, AdnAB, and nonhomologous end-joining), but are not known to encode a mismatch repair system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Gupta1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Warner1">[27]</xref>. We postulate that homologous recombination mediated by AdnAB is likely responsible for the simple crossover events, which is consistent with the absolute requirement for RecA in DCT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Wang2">[17]</xref>. However, this form of homologous recombination alone seems insufficient to explain regions of microcomplexity. The clustered proximity of recombinant tracks indicates that an imported donor segment initially encompassed the entire region, but the mechanism underlying the internal mosaicism is unclear. Characterization of the mechanism and the enzymes behind this process will require careful directed approaches using defined recombination mutants.</p>
<p>Every facet of the transfer process contributes to the genetic complexity of the transconjugants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The large number and distributive character of the transferred segments, combined with the microcomplexity in some tracts, makes each transconjugant uniquely different from the others, as well as from the parental strains. The widely varied sizes of the transferred segments allows transconjugants to acquire both major changes, potentially bringing in entire operons encoding biological pathways, and minor nucleotide substitutions that provide subtle diversity, which could, for example, modify the activity or interaction specificity of an enzyme. Multiple pan-genomic changes that typically accompany evolution of bacteria are assumed to be a serial accrual of HGT and spontaneous mutation events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g007">Figure 7</xref>). By contrast, a single step DCT event between two single cells generates a transconjugant strain that is a mosaic blend of the parental genomes, and not merely an incrementally altered derivative. Thus, distributive conjugal transfer provides an unparalleled mechanism for quickly generating tremendous genetic diversity, which rivals that seen in sexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Narra1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent genome-wide studies of naturally competent strains provide an interesting contrast between the progeny of transformation and conjugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Croucher1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Mell1">[32]</xref>. In these studies, nonselected segments of DNA were also observed around the recipient chromosome and thus contribute to variation. Microcomplexity in these segments suggested that, as for DCT, integration of transformed DNA was mediated by both recombination and/or repair machinery. However, the nonselected segments were significantly smaller (1–4 kb, depending on the species) than those described here, which average 49 kb and can be as large as 249 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s010">Table S4</xref>, Km4.5b: 6,942,375–202,798). The limitation on recombination sizes in pneumococci correlated with an underrepresentation of large insertions, which together argued that transformation led to genome reduction and was unlikely to act as a mechanism for uptake of accessory loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Croucher1">[29]</xref>. The large DNA segments acquired via DCT, in contrast, facilitates inheritance of novel operons and genes. For example, one large recombination tract introduced a contiguous stretch of ∼55 kb of nonhomologous donor-derived DNA into the transconjugant chromosome (Km6.9b). Perhaps an example more functionally pertinent to our work was an insertion–deletion exchange observed in the divergent <italic>mid</italic> candidate region of <italic>esx1</italic> in transconjugants switched to donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
<p>We have demonstrated conjugal DNA transfer in additional naturally derived <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Parsons1">[8]</xref>, indicating a broader presence for mycobacterial distributive conjugal transfer. The rough-colony morphology members of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) exhibit extremely low genetic variation, suggesting that they do not undergo HGT, are evolutionary young, and resulted from a recent clonal expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Sreevatsan1">[33]</xref>. However, there is now convincing evidence for HGT among <italic>M. canettii</italic>, and other smooth-colony MTBC strains, which display genome-wide mosaicism, although the precise mechanism(s) of HGT are unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Gutierrez1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Supply1">[35]</xref>. Based on sequence comparisons, it was proposed that <italic>M. canettii</italic> strains are extant members of a genetically diverse MTBC progenitor species, <italic>M. prototuberculosis</italic>, whose members underwent frequent HGT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Gutierrez1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Gordon1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Smith2">[37]</xref>. The unspecified HGT process underlying that mosaicism is presumed to result from a series of sequential transfer events. However, based on our studies, distributive conjugal transfer involving the ancestral <italic>M. prototuberculosis</italic> offers a plausible and parsimonious explanation for the remarkably similar mosaicism observed among the extant <italic>M. canettii</italic>. We could envision that distributive conjugal transfer in <italic>M. prototuberculosis</italic> rapidly incorporated the necessary blend of parental genotypes that drove the emergence of the pathogenic, rough-colony morphology species, like <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, allowing their subsequent clonal expansion. Moreover, if DCT drove these postulated HGT events, the evolutionary clock for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is likely much shorter because of the capacity of DCT to generate genome-wide mosaicism in a single step. Given the widespread nature of conjugation, we speculate that distributive conjugal transfer also occurs in other bacteria, conferring similar evolutionary benefits.</p>
<p>The characteristics of mycobacterial distributive conjugation suggested to us that tools developed for mammalian genetics could be applied here. Using a eukaryotic-style genome-wide association mapping approach, we mapped the mating identity locus (<italic>mid</italic>) for mycobacterial conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Similarly, we applied a backcross introgression strategy to refine the mapping and to purge extraneous mc<sup>2</sup>155 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001602-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The purifying selection of successive backcross generations effectively introgressed the mc<sup>2</sup>155 <italic>mid</italic> locus into the mc<sup>2</sup>874 background; this created a strain that was nearly isogenic to the mc<sup>2</sup>874 parent strain, but which now functioned as a conjugal donor. We note that the hybrid <italic>esx1</italic> loci produced by distributive conjugal transfer have not been disabled (as in transposon mutagenesis screens), and still encode functional ESX-1 secretory apparatuses that secrete the major ESX-1 substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The un-annotated theoretical proteins encoded by the <italic>mid</italic> candidate genes bear no overt resemblance to those known to be involved in conjugation in other bacteria. Their association with the <italic>esx1</italic> locus suggests that Mid proteins modify the ESX-1 secretion system, are secreted by ESX-1, or interact with other ESX-1–secreted substrates. The next step in their functional assessment will likely result from an extension of this work to identify which protein(s) or protein motifs are necessary and sufficient to impart conjugal sex identity. Interestingly, orthologs for the <italic>mid</italic> candidate genes are found in the sequenced genomes of other environmental mycobacteria, suggesting a possible ongoing role for distributive conjugal transfer in gene flow between mycobacteria. Orthologs of these <italic>mid</italic> candidates are not apparent in the <italic>esx1</italic> locus of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, consistent with our speculative model that the MTBC represents a clonally expanded product of distributive conjugal transfer, not necessarily an active participant in this process. Nevertheless, recent evidence from genome sequencing comparisons indicates that some form of genetic exchange has occurred between <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. canettii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Supply1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>While we applied DCT to map <italic>mid</italic> genes, in principle any genetic trait that differs between the parental strains can be mapped using this genome-wide mapping strategy. For example, mc<sup>2</sup>155 and mc<sup>2</sup>874 grossly differ in colony morphology, biofilm formation, and phage susceptibility, any of which could have been scored as a change of function in the recipient and mapped by DCT. Similarly, biochemical differences between these strains could be discerned through simple, high-throughput assays. We recognize that more traditional approaches for mutagenic loss-of-function mapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Sassetti1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Zhang1">[39]</xref> will remain important in mycobacterial studies, but this new application of conjugation now allows any phenotype that differs between a mating pair to be unambiguously mapped.</p>
<p>Our analysis of distributive conjugal transfer (DCT) in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> has practical and conceptual ramifications. It brings new tools to mycobacteriology, including those traditionally used exclusively in eukaryotic genetics. It also shows how bacterial evolutionary time scales can be compressed by generating incredible genetic diversity in a single step. Identifying the necessary components, such as <italic>esx1</italic> and <italic>mid</italic>, will help to elucidate the mechanism, to allow modification of the system, and to computationally identify bacteria that actively participate in DCT—or engineer them to do so. Our previous finding of DCT in a mixed biofilm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Nguyen1">[40]</xref> underscores the importance of predicting how prevalent DCT may be in nature, for a more accurate interpretation of metagenomic datasets and to model gene flow through bacterial populations. Regardless of these secondary ramifications, our primary finding of the tremendous genomic variation generated by DCT takes a significant step toward bringing the evolutionary benefits of sexual reproduction to bacteria.</p>

<p>Transconjugants were colony purified, and genomic DNA was prepared and then subjected to whole-genome DNA sequence analysis at the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS), U. Maryland, using paired-end Illumina technology. The sequence coverage for each genome was between 50-fold for F1 progeny and ∼1,000-fold for backcross strains. Sequence reads were mapped to the mc<sup>2</sup>155 reference sequence by IGS. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or sequence gaps were identified using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) sequence viewer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001602-Robinson1">[43]</xref> to define genomic regions of different parental origins. Boundaries of recipient- and donor-derived segments were recorded as the last recipient SNP observed with a minimum of two consecutive SNPs defining parental identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001602.s002">Figure S2</xref>). A donor segment unique to each transconjugant was identified to confirm accuracy of the aligned sequence reads.

Recipient sequence in the transconjugant is conservatively defined by the presence of two consecutive SNPs, and is indicated by the yellow bars below. The left boundary of the replacement donor sequence tract lies between the last recipient SNP present (green) and the next missing SNP (red); as intervening regions match the reference sequence (gray coloration), the donor segment is designated to extend from SNP to SNP, as indicated by the blue bar below.

<p>In/dels are transferred in DCT. Whole genome alignment analysis of the mc<sup>2</sup>155 and mc<sup>2</sup>874 parental strains by Mauve identified 694 in/dels of &gt;18 bp.

Sequence reads aligned to the donor reference viewed in IGV verified that no sequence reads from mc<sup>2</sup>874 (top alignment, yellow background) mapped to the mc<sup>2</sup>155 reference sequence in this region, consistent with in/del status.
