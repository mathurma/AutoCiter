<abstract>
<p>Learning to read is a fundamental developmental milestone, and achieving reading competency has lifelong consequences. Although literacy development proceeds smoothly for many children, a subset struggle with this learning process, creating a need to identify reliable biomarkers of a child’s future literacy that could facilitate early diagnosis and access to crucial early interventions. Neural markers of reading skills have been identified in school-aged children and adults; many pertain to the precision of information processing in noise, but it is unknown whether these markers are present in pre-reading children. Here, in a series of experiments in 112 children (ages 3–14 y), we show brain–behavior relationships between the integrity of the neural coding of speech in noise and phonology. We harness these findings into a predictive model of preliteracy, revealing that a 30-min neurophysiological assessment predicts performance on multiple pre-reading tests and, one year later, predicts preschoolers’ performance across multiple domains of emergent literacy. This same neural coding model predicts literacy and diagnosis of a learning disability in school-aged children. These findings offer new insight into the biological constraints on preliteracy during early childhood, suggesting that neural processing of consonants in noise is fundamental for language and reading development. Pragmatically, these findings open doors to early identification of children at risk for language learning problems; this early identification may in turn facilitate access to early interventions that could prevent a life spent struggling to read.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Learning to read is a chief developmental milestone with lifelong consequences; although there are effective interventions for struggling readers, an ongoing challenge has been to identify candidates for intervention at a young-enough age. We measured the precision of the neural coding of consonants in noise, and found that pre-reading children (4 y old) with stronger neural processing had superior early literacy skills; one year later they were also stronger emerging readers. We applied the same neural coding measure to a cohort of older children: in addition to predicting these children’s literacy achievement, we could reliably predict which of the children had received a diagnosis of a reading impairment. Taken together, these results suggest that the neural coding of speech in noise plays a fundamental role in language development. Children who struggle to listen in noisy environments may struggle to make meaning of the language they hear on a daily basis, which can in turn set them at risk for literacy challenges. Evaluating the neural coding of speech in noise may provide an objective neurophysiological marker for these at-risk children, opening a door to early and specific interventions that may stave off a life spent struggling to read.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Three aspects of auditory-neurophysiological processing have often been associated with literacy: variability of neural firing [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], auditory system timing [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and processing detailed acoustic features such as those found in consonants [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This neural coding is thought to play a pivotal role in reading and language development [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and may reflect the precision of neural processing in the central auditory system, which likely develops through the integrated neural coding of speech across multiple timescales, including prosodic, syllabic, and phonemic acoustic information [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although children are provided access to these sonic fundamentals in their everyday lives, these experiences often occur in adverse listening environments (classrooms, outdoors, wailing siblings) in which children need to tune out competing sounds to tune into speech. Indeed, noise places stringent demands on sensory processing, and individuals with language-based learning problems often have perceptual deficits in noise across modalities [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Background noise limits access to redundant acoustic cues that are accessible to listeners in quiet. In principle, noise may obfuscate both the neural processing of an individual acoustic event (such as a phoneme) and the formation of consistent representations of successive events (such as words or sentences); see, for example, [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Should children with poor processing in noise grow up forced to make sense of speech in these noisy environments, they may fall behind their peers in language development.</p>
<p>Auditory system precision—especially the neural processing of speech in noise—is correlated to literacy; that is, struggling readers perform poorly on behavioral tests of auditory processing [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and have reduced auditory response fidelity and impaired neural coding of rapid auditory stimuli compared to good readers [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, these brain–behavior links likely reflect neural mechanisms underlying reading in general, as opposed to a parochial deficit in clinical populations. It remains open to debate, however, what role these neural mechanisms play developmentally with respect to reading, in part because it remains debated if auditory function is consistently implicated in reading impairment at all [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Alternate accounts for the origins of reading impairment include sluggish processing in the magnocellular pathway [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], multimodal perceptual deficits grounded in inefficient short-term memory [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and poor processing in cortical “reading networks” that lead to auditory impairments [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There are likely many reasons that a child may be a poor reader, including genetic and environmental; while understanding the factors that cause reading impairment is an important goal, it is also important to predict which children will struggle when they begin to read. Thus, from a pragmatic standpoint our aim is to define a neurophysiological marker that might identify these children.</p>
<p>To date, auditory-neurophysiological markers of literacy have only been observed in children and adults who have received prolonged, formal instruction. But the process of learning to read itself may induce changes in substrate reading skills [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and their neural foundations [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further compounding the problem is the challenge of predicting future literacy skills. There have been promising experiments reporting differences between groups of children (e.g., an at-risk group versus a control group or a group of children who receive a diagnosis versus a group who does not). But substantial overlap between groups (resulting in modest effect sizes) tends to thwart clinically-meaningful predictions in individual children [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Early identification of children at risk for reading problems is crucial; interventions that are provided early enough can bring struggling pre-readers in line with their peers and offset years of reading difficulties [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, in a prospective study of language-impaired children, Bishop and Adams reported that literacy development proceeded smoothly in children whose oral language problems were resolved by age 5.5 y [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This motivates us to investigate early language skills, and their neural correlates, in preschoolers.</p>
<p>It has long been argued that reading skills are linked to the processing of rapid auditory information, meaning that struggling readers have particular problems with auditory temporal processing [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], including the perception and neural coding of dynamic speech elements [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Here, then, we evaluated neural processing of a consonant-vowel syllable in background noise. This processing in noise relies upon neural synchrony—that is, consistent and uniform neural population discharges [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In humans, neural synchrony in response to the crucial phonemic features of speech may be measured through the frequency following response (FFR, a scalp-recorded auditory evoked potential that is also known as the auditory brainstem response to complex sounds, or cABR). The neural circuitry important for language development may not engage faithfully during everyday listening experiences because of a breakdown in synchronous neural firing exacerbated by background noise. As a consequence of this poor online processing in noise, these children may lag behind their peers in language development. Previous studies in older children have established relationships between FFR properties and reading, and therefore provide empirical grounding for the current investigation [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We also evaluated children’s phonological skills because phonological processing—knowledge and manipulation of the sound structure of spoken language—is a chief pre-reading skill that is deficient in children with dyslexia [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our hypothesis is that background noise disrupts brain mechanisms involved in literacy development; we therefore predict that children with poor auditory-neurophysiological responses to speech in noise exhibit poorer early literacy skills than their peers.</p>

<title>Neural Coding of Consonants in Noise Predicts Phonological Processing (Experiment 1)</title>
<p>We constructed a statistical model incorporating three aspects of the neural coding of consonants in noise: trial-by-trial stability [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], neural timing [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and representation of spectral features that convey phonemic identity (see <xref rid="pbio.1002196.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in a cohort of 4-y-old children who had not yet learned to read (<italic>n</italic> = 37, 21 female; mean [M] age 54.41 months, standard deviation [SD] 3.56). These quantify different aspects of auditory processing and have all been linked to reading skills in older children. Although these metrics come from a single neurophysiological recording, they are not strongly intercorrelated within an individual (see <xref rid="pbio.1002196.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>); thus, each provides unique information about the coding of different linguistic and paralinguistic parameters.</p>

<p>We found that neural coding of consonants in noise strongly predicted phonological processing in pre-readers over and above demographic factors (CELF P-2 Phonological Awareness; Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.488, <italic>F</italic>[9,24] = 4.121, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003; total <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.684, <italic>F</italic>[12,36] = 4.328, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001; see <xref rid="pbio.1002196.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002196.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>; when the correlation was adjusted for test-retest variability of the behavioral test, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.757; see also <xref rid="pbio.1002196.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref> for a cross-validation of this model). For the majority of children, our model predicted scores within 2 points on the test, which is less than a 10% margin of error (difference between actual scores and model-predicted scores; median = 1.97 points; range, 0.17–5.66 points; see <xref rid="pbio.1002196.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Our results suggest that the precision and stability of coding consonants in noise parallels emergent literacy skills across a broad spectrum of competencies—all before explicit reading instruction begins.</p>

<p>Statistical model predictions from this regression were used in subsequent analyses. The idea is that model predictions reflect a “consonants-in-noise score” that may be correlated to performance cross-sectionally and longitudinally on additional behavioral tests. For Experiments 2 through 4, we measured FFRs to consonants in noise, computed the same measures of neural coding in those children, and applied regression parameters from Experiment 1 to those children’s responses. This effectively predicts performance on this test of phonological processing even though, as detailed below, we did not conduct this particular test in all children. In no cases did we refit the data with new regression models.</p>

<title>Neural Coding of Consonants in Noise Predicts Multiple Preliteracy Skills (Experiment 2)</title>
<p>Having constructed a model based on phonological processing, we explored whether model predictions generalized to multiple tests of preliteracy. We applied our predictive model from Experiment 1 to 20 3-y-olds (9 female; M = 43.35 months, SD 2.50) in whom we could not administer the test of phonological processing (see <xref rid="sec008" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) but could conduct neurophysiological testing. We used the model parameters estimated in Experiment 1 and combined these “consonants-in-noise scores” with those from the 37 children in that experiment. Neural coding of consonants in noise predicted performance on a test of rapid automatized naming, an additional key preliteracy skill that is thought to be highly predictive of future reading success across languages [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (higher predicted scores correlated with faster naming; <italic>r</italic>[55] = -0.550, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Neural coding also predicted children’s memory for spoken sentences (<italic>r</italic>[55] = 0.516, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), a test that combines auditory working memory with knowledge of grammar—an additional substrate skill that contributes to literacy development and is often deficient in children with dyslexia and/or language impairment [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
<p>We also split this cohort into the two age groups. Recall that the “consonants-in-noise score” was fit to the 37 4-y-olds from Experiment 1, and we applied these regression weights to the 20 3-y-olds in whom we could not measure phonological processing. In the 4-y-olds the “consonants-in-noise” score predicted memory for spoken sentences (<italic>r</italic>[35] = 0.555, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and trended towards predicting faster rapid naming (<italic>r</italic>[35] = -0.301, <italic>p</italic> = .070). Crucially, in the 3-y-olds the model predicted rapid naming (<italic>r</italic>[18] = -0.692, <italic>p</italic> = .001), meaning that applying the model derived in Experiment 1 generalizes both to a new cohort and a new preliteracy skill; however, it did not predict 3-y-old’s memory for spoken sentences (<italic>r</italic>[18] = 0.034, <italic>p</italic> = 0.888).

We took the “consonants-in-noise score” derived from the model in Experiment 1 and explored relations between the model’s predictions and performance on a variety of literacy tests one year after neurophysiological assessment.

<title>Neural Coding of Consonants in Noise Predicts Reading and Diagnostic Category in Older Children (Experiment 4)</title>
<p>In Experiments 1–3, we established an auditory-neurophysiological biomarker for pre-reading skills in preschoolers. We applied the regression model from Experiment 1 to a cohort of older children (<italic>n</italic> = 55, 22 female, ages 8–14 y, M = 10.82, SD = 1.7) in whom we collected identical auditory-neurophysiological responses (previously described in [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). This allowed us to ask whether the “consonants-in-noise score” derived in the 4-y-old children generalizes to a different age group, and effectively predicts how these children would have performed on the preschool tests of phonological processing, given their precision of coding consonants in noise. In school-aged children, the neural coding of consonants in noise predicted concurrent reading competence (<italic>r</italic>[53] = 0.430, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and performance on a range of literacy tests including sight word reading (<italic>r</italic>[53] = 0.408, <italic>p</italic> = .002), non-word reading (<italic>r</italic>[53] = 0.329, <italic>p</italic> = .014), spelling (<italic>r</italic>[53] = 0.327, <italic>p</italic> = .015), oral reading efficiency (<italic>r</italic>[53] = 0.319, <italic>p</italic> = .018), and phonological processing (<italic>r</italic>[53] = 0.474, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; see <xref rid="pbio.1002196.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>A subset of these children had been externally diagnosed with a learning disability (LD; <italic>n</italic> = 26); the diagnostic groups differed on their predicted scores (<italic>F</italic>[1,53] = 14.541, p &lt; .001) and model predictions reliably classified children into diagnostic categories (discriminant function analysis: 69.1% of cases correctly classified, <italic>λ</italic> = 0.785, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 12.728, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (see <xref rid="pbio.1002196.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>) revealed that the model score excelled in identifying if a child was not in the reading-impaired group (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.756; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.627, 0.885; <italic>p</italic> = .001). From a clinical standpoint, this suggests that our consonants-in-noise approach may be most effective in “clearing” children as unlikely to develop an LD, thereby motivating thorough follow-up in the remaining children.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A well-acknowledged gap in our understanding of the biology of reading is what biological constraints are instantiated in the nervous system prior to reading instruction. Ours is, to our knowledge, one of the first studies to demonstrate a physiological–phonological coupling in an age group sufficiently young to preclude confounds from prolonged and formal reading experience. In this respect our findings are consistent with the view that phonological processing is a necessary foundational skill for reading development [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. By establishing brain–behavior links in pre-readers that are carried through to school-aged children, our findings suggest a causal, and not simply correlative, role for auditory processing in learning to read. Because the integrity of neural speech processing is linked to phonological awareness (to date, perhaps the best conventional predictor of a child’s eventual reading achievement [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) we suggest that the neurophysiological markers we report here provide a biological looking glass into a child’s future literacy.</p>
<p>Indeed, we show that our model predicts performance on reading readiness tests one year after neurophysiological assessment. In many cases, behavioral tests were not standardized for children as young as we could evaluate neurophysiologically. Moreover, we show that, in school-aged children, our model predicts literacy and diagnostic category. Thus, in cases of learning disabilities, this biomarker may represent pre-existing problems with forming sound-to-meaning and/or letter-to-sound connections that cause problems for children when they begin reading instruction, an interpretation in line with converging biological evidence [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
<p>The correlations between neural coding and literacy skills were somewhat weaker in school-aged children than in pre-readers; this is consistent with the view that reading subskills mature as a function of reading experience, and that phonological processing may not play as strong a role in literacy competence for older children as it does during the early stages of reading acquisition [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, older children may have developed compensatory strategies that reduce the influence of phonological processing on reading that contributed to this developmental uncoupling. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that there was a consistent brain–behavior relationship observed from ages 3–14. Taken together with the breadth of relationships observed across preliteracy skills (i.e., both phonological processing and rapid naming), the neural coding of consonants in noise may reflect a child’s core literacy potential.</p>
<p>Pharmacological studies have suggested that the neurophysiological metrics in our model rely on inhibitory neurotransmitter function; a loss of inhibitory receptors and/or an excitatory-inhibitory misbalance in auditory midbrain is linked directly to a decrease in the synchronous neural firing necessary to encode dynamic speech features such as consonants [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], especially in adverse listening conditions. In fact, this subcortical neural synchrony is necessary for auditory processing in noise [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We therefore speculate that the biomarker revealed here may rely on the emergence of robust inhibitory function. By measuring suprathreshold responses to consonants in noise, we may have sufficiently taxed the developing auditory brain to reveal systematic individual differences in inhibitory processing. Individual differences in these functions may create challenges when children are trying to map sounds to meaning in noisy environments, potentially interfering with the development of the range of preliteracy skills correlated to auditory-neurophysiological responses here.</p>
<p>Our view is that this subcortical neural synchrony emerges and is honed through a distributed, but integrated, auditory circuit. With respect to reading, auditory cortical processing is thought to bootstrap the development of fluent speech processing; eventually, children begin to associate orthographic representations with mental representations of phonemes [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A breakdown in this integrative process may cause a reduction in corticofugal input in auditory midbrain (our biomarker’s putative generator), especially for acoustic transients in challenging listening environments (i.e., consonants in noise). This faulty processing may be due to poor phaselocking [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], abnormal thalamic and cortical cytoarchitectonics [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and/or sluggish attentional resources [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Should a child fail to learn what to pay attention to in everyday listening environments, and in turn fail to allocate appropriate attentional resources to these relevant speech cues, he or she may struggle to build robust phonemic representations. This sound-meaning disjunction may disrupt the course of auditory learning, leading to suboptimal input from corticocollicular fibers and cascading to a decrease in inhibitory function at the cost of synchronous firing by midbrain nuclei [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In turn, without the development of refined neural coding, maladaptive compensatory mechanisms may develop that stanch the development of automaticity in reading and auditory processing in a feed-forward, feed-back loop. This view is consistent with evidence that substrate reading skills (such as phonological processing) and sensory processing develop as a function of reading experience [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Of course, this is speculative; we must infer midbrain function from far-field electrophysiological recordings. Nevertheless, it is intriguing to contemplate the role of inhibitory neurotransmission, and neurochemical mechanisms more broadly, with respect to language development [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
<p>Conventional tests of early literacy can be unreliable in children this young, and to our knowledge, standardized tests of phonological processing are not available for children younger than age 4. Moreover, children who perform poorly on these tests have the least reliable scores because the fewest items are administered, thereby increasing potential bias from a false positive. Given the comorbidity between reading disorders and other LDs, compliance with paper-and-pencil tests may be even lower in the children who stand at the highest risk for a disability and are the most important cases to screen. When these evaluations are available, they are most reliable in identifying a child at risk for a LD, rather than systematically predicting a child’s position along a continuum of literacy achievement. The same may be said for previously established neurophysiological predictors of a child’s diagnosis [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We do not make these claims to denigrate the contributions of other research groups, or the obvious fact that, in many cases, simple paper-and-pencil tests and surveys can be effective in evaluating a child’s risk for a learning problem. Rather, our view is that by establishing these brain–behavior links in preschool children, our findings can pave the way for auditory-neurophysiological assessment in even younger children, in addition to children who are difficult to test using conventional means.</p>
<p>Our approach was to combine multiple measures of neural coding to see how they collectively predict preliteracy skills; although all came from the same neurophysiological recording, each provided unique information and they were only modestly intercorrelated (average <italic>r</italic> = 0.318). Future work should focus on the similarities and differences between these measures. On the one hand, we provide evidence that in combination they predict several preliteracy skills and diagnostic category. On the other hand, reading impairment can arise for a number of reasons, which may have distinct pathophysiologies [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. An intriguing possibility is that these different aspects of neural coding are uniquely linked to different etiologies of reading impairment and/or substrate reading skills.</p>
<p>These children will continue to be followed longitudinally to better understand the role this neural coding in noise plays in language development. From a theoretical perspective, we hope to elucidate how consonant processing in noise guides the development of literacy skills, especially in interactions with the distributed-but-integrated neural networks involved in auditory learning. Children with particularly poor processing of speech in noise may face challenges during critical auditory mapping experiences [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], inhibiting the development of precise neural coding. It would appear that we have established a neural correlate of preliteracy that is carried through to school age, precedes explicit reading instruction, and predicts both a child’s performance along a continuum of literacy and diagnostic category; it will be necessary, however, to replicate these findings in a larger sample. Pragmatically, our findings have the potential to facilitate both early diagnosis and interventions to improve literacy before a child begins explicit instruction. Efforts to promote literacy during early childhood can be tremendously effective, and our hope is that these results open a new avenue of early identification to provide children access to these crucial interventions.</p>

<title>Stimulus</title>
<p>Frequency-following responses were elicited to a 170 ms [da] stimulus. The [da] is a voiced (5 ms voice onset time) six-formant stop consonant constructed in a Klatt-based synthesizer at 20 kHz. Following the initial stop burst is a 50 ms consonant transition (/d/ to /a/) during which the lower three formants shift in frequency (F<sub>1</sub> 400–720 Hz, F<sub>2</sub> 1,700–1,240 Hz, F<sub>3</sub> 2,580–2,500 Hz); these formants are steady for the subsequent 120 ms vowel (/a/). The fundamental frequency and upper three formants are steady throughout the stimulus (F<sub>0</sub> 100 Hz, F<sub>4</sub> 3,300 Hz, F<sub>5</sub> 3,750 Hz, F<sub>6</sub> 4,900 Hz).</p>
<p>The stimulus was presented against a six-talker babble track at a +10 SNR. The babble track consists of six talkers (three female) speaking semantically-anomalous English sentences. The 4,000 ms babble track is looped continuously such that there is no phase synchrony between the onsets of the [da] and noise.</p>

Responses to alternating polarities were added; final averages comprised 6,000 sweeps.</p>

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Our selection of metrics from the FFRs was motivated by previous investigations that have found links cross-sectionally between the timing, stability, and magnitude of responses to consonants and literacy skills. By using the same stimulus and recording scheme, we can apply uniform neurophysiological analyses across age groups. Please see [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] for technical guidance on FFR collection and analysis.</p>

<title>Neural timing</title>
<p>Positive-going deflections in the evoked responses (see <xref rid="pbio.1002196.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>) were identified by computer algorithm using local maximum detection (Scan Edit 4.3, Compumedics, Inc., Charlotte, NC, US). Peaks were labeled according to their expected latency (for example, a peak occurring 21–22 ms after stimulus onset would be called “Peak 21”). Peaks in response to the consonant transition are called Peaks 21, 31, 41, and 51. After they are identified by the algorithm, selections were adjusted manually using two sub-averages of a given response as a guide (see [<xref rid="pbio.1002196.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). This procedure is performed blind to subject’s performance on behavioral tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec018">
<title>Neural stability</title>
<p>To evaluate the trial-by-trial stability of the evoked responses, the filtered, epoched, and artifact-rejected responses were re-averaged using random selection 300 times to compute 300 pairs of sub-averages. Each sub-average comprised 50% of the trials in a recording (Experiments 1–3: 2,000 trials/sub-average; Experiment 4: 3,000 trials/sub-average). Each of the pairs of sub-averages was correlated and the mean correlation coefficient (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>) was calculated over the response to the consonant (20–60 ms). The correlation coefficient was converted to a Fisher <italic>z</italic> coefficient for statistical purposes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec019">
<title>Representation of spectral features</title>
<p>A fast Fourier transformation (FFT) was applied on each response from 20–60 ms. The FFT was calculated with a 10 ms Hanning ramp and computed for harmonics at 400, 500, 600, and 700 Hz (40 Hz bins) to gauge the magnitude of responses to the first formant—a cue that contributes to phonemic identification. Spectral amplitudes across these four bins were averaged.</p>

<title>Behavioral Test Battery</title>
<p>A series of standardized psychoeducational tests were administered. As much as possible, these tests were selected to provide overlap between experiments; however, we were constrained by the ages for which the tests were standardized and available. Please see <xref rid="pbio.1002196.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for a summary of each behavioral test broken down by experiment. The test battery included the Children’s Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Preschool 2nd Edition (CELF-P2; Phonological Awareness and Recalling Sentences subtests; raw scores; Pearson, San Antonio, TX, US), the RAN (rapid automatized color and object naming; average naming time in seconds normalized on a log scale; PRO-ED, Inc., Austin, TX, US), the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP; 1st Edition for school-age children, 2nd Edition used for preschoolers; composite phonological awareness score used, standard score; Pearson, San Antonio, TX, US), the Woodcock-Johnson-III Tests of Achievement (WJ-III; Letter-Word Identification, Spelling, and Word Attack subtests and Basic Reading composite, standard scores; Riverside Publishing, Rolling Meadows, IL, US) and the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE, standard scores; Pearson, San Antonio, TX, US). Non-verbal intelligence was evaluated in preschoolers with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III (WPSSI-III, Object Assembly in 3-y-olds and Matrix Reasoning in 4-y-olds; scale scores; Pearson, San Antonio, TX, US) and in school-age children with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI, Matrix Reasoning and Block Design subtests, standard scores; Pearson, San Antonio, TX, US).</p>

<title>Statistical Modeling</title>
<p>Hierarchical regression was used to predict phonological processing from neurophysiological recordings. The first step comprised demographic factors (age, sex, and non-verbal intelligence) and the second step comprised neurophysiological factors; thus, the model estimates what percentage of variance in phonological processing neural coding accounts for above and beyond demographics.</p>
<p>The model constructed in Experiment 1 was applied to all subjects; on its first step there was a trend for demographics to significantly predict phonological processing (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.183, <italic>F</italic>[3,37] = 2.547, <italic>p</italic> = 0.072). In preliminary modeling, independent two-step regressions were run for each neurophysiological metric. In all cases, the neurophysiological metrics in isolation improved model fit (neural timing: Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.245, <italic>F</italic>[4,29] = 3.166, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028; representation of first formant: Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.254, <italic>F</italic>[4,29] = 3.340, <italic>p</italic> = 0.023; neural stability: Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.142, <italic>F</italic>[1,32] = 6.166, <italic>p</italic> = 0.013). These regression results are presented in <xref rid="pbio.1002196.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> as Steps 2A, 2B, and 2C, respectively. Despite these metrics coming from a single recording, the overall model had acceptable levels of collinearity (tolerance ranged from 0.383–0.994), indicating that the model was not skewed by intercorrelations between predictors. All variables met the assumptions of the general linear model (i.e., normal distribution and heterogeneity of variance) and <italic>p</italic>-values reflect two-tailed tests.</p>
