                <p><italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> is a bioenergetically flexible,
                    halophilic microorganism that can generate energy by respiration,
                    photosynthesis, and the fermentation of arginine. In a previous study, using a
                    genome-scale metabolic model, we have shown that the archaeon unexpectedly
                    degrades essential amino acids under aerobic conditions, a behavior that can
                    lead to the termination of growth earlier than necessary. Here, we further
                    integratively investigate energy generation, nutrient utilization, and biomass
                    production using an extended methodology that accounts for dynamically changing
                    transport patterns, including those that arise from interactions among the
                    supplied metabolites. Moreover, we widen the scope of our analysis to include
                    phototrophic conditions to explore the interplay between different bioenergetic
                    modes. Surprisingly, we found that cells also degrade essential amino acids even
                    during phototropy, when energy should already be abundant. We also found that
                    under both conditions considerable amounts of nutrients that were taken up were
                    neither incorporated into the biomass nor used as respiratory substrates,
                    implying the considerable production and accumulation of several metabolites in
                    the medium. Some of these are likely the products of forms of overflow
                    metabolism. In addition, our results also show that arginine fermentation,
                    contrary to what is typically assumed, occurs simultaneously with respiration
                    and photosynthesis and can contribute energy in levels that are comparable to
                    the primary bioenergetic modes, if not more. These findings portray a picture
                    that the organism takes an approach toward growth that favors the here and now,
                    even at the cost of longer-term concerns. We believe that the seemingly
                    “greedy” behavior exhibited actually consists of adaptations
                    by the organism to its natural environments, where nutrients are not only
                    irregularly available but may altogether be absent for extended periods that may
                    span several years. Such a setting probably predisposed the cells to grow as
                    much as possible when the conditions become favorable.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Living cells can produce usable energy through various means. For example,
                    animals derive energy, through respiration, from nutrients that they consume,
                    and plants from light using photosynthesis. The particular microorganism that we
                    study, <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic>, is a model organism for the
                    archaeal domain of life. It is bioenergetically flexible in that it can perform
                    both respiration and photosynthesis and in addition can also derive energy using
                    fermentation. Accordingly, it is a good model system for investigating the
                    interplay between different energy generating mechanisms. In this study, we
                    investigate these relationships as well as how energy production is linked to
                    the other processes involved in growth, including the consumption of nutrients
                    and the production of cellular material. Because <italic>Halobacterium
                    salinarum</italic> thrives in salt-saturated solutions, such as those that may
                    be found in salt lakes and solar salterns, our study yields insight on how these
                    cellular processes operate in environments that are lethal to most life on
                    Earth.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p><italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> is a halophilic archaeon that thrives in
                extremely saline environments with salt concentrations reaching 4 M or higher. The
                organism is perhaps most well known for its retinal-protein bacteriorhodopsin (BR),
                which is a light-driven proton pump. BR is the only known nonchlorophyll structure
                that allows photosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Oesterhelt1">[1]</xref>. It is currently being developed for applications
                in optical security <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Hampp1">[2]</xref>, optical data storage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Yao1">[3]</xref>, and holography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Barnhardt1">[4]</xref>.
                Accordingly, <italic>H. salinarum</italic>'s photosynthetic capabilities
                are its most well-studied aspects. For example, the 3D structure of BR has been
                resolved, and its complete catalytic cycle elucidated at the molecular level
                (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Haupts1">[5]</xref>). However, despite the focus on BR, photosynthesis is
                not the only means by which <italic>H. salinarum</italic> can generate energy.
                Respiration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Sreeramulu1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Oesterhelt2">[7]</xref> as well as the
                fermentation of arginine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Hartmann1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Dundas1">[9]</xref> are other mechanisms utilized by the organism.
                This bioenergetic flexibility makes the archaeon a good model system for
                investigating the interplay between different energy production modes. <italic>H.
                    salinarum</italic> is also one of the few reported organisms that can use
                potassium gradients for long term energy storage in a battery-like manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Wagner1">[10]</xref>.</p>
            <p>The metabolic network of an organism can be reconstructed from genomic, biochemical,
                and physiological data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Francke1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Covert1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Price1">[13]</xref>. This network consists of the known and
                hypothesized reactions that take place within the organism, and is considered to be
                on a genome-scale when most or all of the genes with known metabolic function are
                included <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Becker1">[14]</xref>. We, in a previous study, have reconstructed and
                proposed such a network for <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Gonzalez1">[15]</xref>. In
                addition to the immediate information gained from metabolic reconstructions, these
                networks can be analyzed to gain insights on emergent system properties through the
                use of appropriate computational methods. In this respect, the constraints-based
                framework has emerged as an important and convenient tool for modeling such systems
                because it does not require the detailed information typically required by full
                kinetic models. Rather, constraints-based models require only generally available
                physicochemical information such as stoichiometry, reversibility, energy balance,
                and, when available, reaction velocities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Edwards1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Edwards2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Ramakrishna1">[18]</xref>.</p>
            <p>One of the methods available under the constraints-based framework is Flux Balance
                Analysis (FBA). Essentially, FBA uses linear optimization to find a flux
                distribution that maximizes a particular objective function, e.g., growth rate or
                ATP production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Varma1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Kauffman1">[20]</xref>. It has been shown
                that such optimality principles, within limits and under defined conditions, can
                describe the operation of metabolic networks, including the prediction of internal
                fluxes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Schuetz1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Sauer1">[22]</xref>. Extensions to FBA include hybrid models that

            <p>Our aim in this study is two-fold. First, we set out to investigate the interplay
                between energy generation, nutrient utilization and biomass production under
                different bioenergetic modes. Second, we also analyzed the relationships between the
                different energy producing mechanisms of respiration, photosynthesis and
                fermentation themselves, which are typically examined individually. To achieve
                these, we used a genome-scale metabolic network that connects the different aspects.
                Our results include several findings that are contrary to assumptions which are
                typically made; particularly with respect to the utilization of nutrients, and how
                the bioenergetic modes operate. From a more methodological perspective, we also
                sought out to extend the existing framework for hybrid genome-scale metabolic models
                to handle biological systems where nutrient utilization and growth rates vary with
                time. Such changes in nutrient consumption, for example, can be the result of the
                differences between growth phases, or can arise from the interactions between the
                supplied metabolites. We demonstrate that the extended methodology not only accounts
                for such dynamics, but in several instances actually led to the identification of
                the underlying causes.</p>

                <p>Most of the reactions in the genome-scale metabolic network we use in this study
                    are taken directly from previous reconstructions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Gonzalez1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Falb1">[23]</xref>.
                    After updating some pathways, the final network is now composed of 664 reactions
                    (567 internal and 97 transport)—covering 478 genes—and 545
                    metabolites. One of the most significant pathways that was modified is the
                    respiratory chain. The proposed oxidative phosphorylation pathway is shown in
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000332-g001">Figure 1</xref>. <italic>H.
                        salinarum</italic> has analogs of all five complexes associated with
                    oxidative phosporylation found in mitochondria and <italic>E. coli</italic>
                    (complexes I through V). However, there are significant differences from its
                    better-studied counterparts. For example, the subunits of complex I that
                    comprise the NADH acceptor module (nuoEFG) could not be assigned, similar to
                    what has been observed for <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-She1">[24]</xref>.
                    Indeed, it has been experimentally excluded that NADH is oxidized by a type I
                    dehydrogenase in <italic>H. salinarum</italic>. Rather, NADH is oxidized by a
                    non-homologous type II NADH dehydrogenase that also reduces quinones but is
                    incapable of proton translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Sreeramulu1">[6]</xref>. Nevertheless,
                    the conservation of eleven complex I subunits with high levels of sequence
                    similarity make it likely that the complex is functional and translocates
                    protons. Moreover, the lack of the NADH-specific acceptor module and the
                    experimental evidences that NADH is not oxidized by complex I make it likely
                    that the complex I analog actually accepts electrons from another donor
                    molecule, which we left unspecified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000332-g001">Figure 1</xref>. In addition, the <italic>H.
                        salinarum</italic> pathway is also different in that menaquinone, rather
                    than ubiquinone, is the likely mobile carrier used to shuttle electrons from the
                    complex I analog to the complex III analog. A similar proposal has been made for

                            I to V). The boxes beneath each complex represent genes coding for
                            specific subunits, which are often encoded adjacently in the genome
                            (indicated by solid connections or by shared borders). Black broken
                            lines are used to indicate that the connected genes, while not adjacent,
                            are in the same genetic vicinity. The red broken line indicates that the

                            mitochondria. For example, genes coding for cytochrome c, which normally
                            carries electrons to the terminal oxidase, could not be found in
                                <italic>H. salinarum</italic>. Experimental evidence indicates that
                            the function is likely performed by the copper protein halocyanin.</p>

                <p>Two other important differences of the proposed pathway from the systems in
                    mitochondria and <italic>E. coli</italic> are the composition of the complex III
                    analog and the mobile carrier which carries electrons to the terminal oxidase
                    (complex IV analog). The cytochrome <italic>c1</italic> subunit
                    (<italic>petC</italic>) of <italic>E. coli</italic> complex III, responsible for
                    transfering electrons to the mobile carrier of the organism, cytochrome c, does
                    not seem to have a homolog in <italic>H. salinarum</italic>. In fact, genes
                    which code for cytochrome c could also not be assigned. Accordingly, we believe
                    that <italic>H. salinarum</italic> likely uses a different carrier. We propose
                    this to be halocyanin, which is a blue copper protein originally isolated from
                        <italic>N. pharaonis</italic>

                    A similar function has been proposed for the molecule in <italic>N.
                    pharaonis</italic>, based on its localization as a membrane protein and its
                    midpoint potential that is consistent with a mobile carrier's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Scharf1">[25]</xref>.
                    This proposed function is further supported by the fact that the halocyanin
                    gene, <italic>hcpB</italic>, is fused with the <italic>cbaD</italic> subunit of
                    complex IV in <italic>H. salinarum</italic>

                <p>Very little is known regarding the stoichiometry of the proton translocating

                    Fortunately, while information on the individual components are unavailable,
                    data on the aggregate process of respiration exists. This is very important for
                    modeling because it determines the overall energy production capability of the
                    organism. O<sub>2</sub> pulse experiments indicated an ATP to O<sub>2</sub>
                    ratio of 1∶1. Measurements of initial proton uptake during
                    phosphorylation demonstrated a ratio of 10∶1 between
                    H<sup>+</sup> and ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Hartmann2">[29]</xref>. These values are
                    consistent with the experimentally determined photosynthetic stoichiometries of
                    22 photons per ATP and 2 photons per H<sup>+</sup>, given that light
                    inhibits respiration with an observed stoichiometry of 24 photons per
                    O<sub>2</sub> molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Oesterhelt2">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Hartmann2">[29]</xref>. We fixed the

                <p>Consumption and production rates were modeled using differential equations of the
                    form of either Equation (2) or Equation (3) (<italic>cf.</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>), with the rational that the
                    production or consumption of a metabolite depends on the availability of the
                    metabolite, the population size, and the current growth rate; note that
                    growth-rate is time-varying in batch cultures. The piecewise extension of
                    Equation (2), Equation (3), was necessary because several metabolites exhibited
                    distinct modes over the growth period. For example, alanine, at some point,
                    switched from production to consumption. We obtained parameters for each
                    nutrient using both equation forms. To minimize the possibility of overfitting,
                    we used the piecewise form in the final model only if it resulted in at least a
                    reduction of 10% in residual error, which is a measure of the
                    (dis-)agreement between model and data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">methods</xref>). In such a case, the boundary parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the equation, which is optimized and automatically
                    obtained, indicates a time near where the qualitative change in the uptake

                <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000332-t001">Table 1</xref> lists the best
                    (lowest) residual error values we obtained using equations (2) and (3) for each
                    nutrient (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">methods</xref>). From the table, it
                    is clear that the piecewise form hardly makes any difference for a number of
                    metabolites, including aspartate, isoleucine, and leucine. For these three amino
                    acids, residual error values only decreased by 0.8%, 0.2%,
                    and 1%, respectively. Given that the same three amino acids, after
                    arginine, are also the ones with the highest uptake rates, it would seem that
                    they are the preferred or primary metabolites of <italic>H. salinarum</italic>
                    during aerobic growth, at least among the nutrients supplied. Unlike most of the
                    other provided metabolites, the uptake patterns of these amino acids remained
                    constant, and their consumption rates high, up until their depletion. The

                <p>In contrast to aspartate, leucine and isoleucine, the piecewise uptake equation
                    form is clearly superior over the basic definition (Equation 2) for some
                    metabolites. Most notable of these are ornithine, alanine and proline, for which
                    residual errors dropped by 98.6%, 92.4% and
                    54.5%, respectively. Each of these amino acids, at some point,
                    switches from production to consumption. For ornithine and proline, it is
                    interesting that the points at which their respective utilization patterns
                    change are close to each other, and that both occur near the time when arginine
                    is depleted. This makes sense as arginine is consumed rapidly by the cells, and
                    both ornithine and proline are downstream of its catabolic route. Flux-balance
                    simulation at a point before arginine depletion shows the situation depicted in
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000332-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Most of the
                    arginine, which at the beginning exhibits the highest uptake rate, is deaminated
                    to citrulline via the action of <italic>arginine deiminase</italic> (EC 3.5.3.6;
                    OE5208R). Citrulline is then converted to ornithine and carbamoyl-phosphate by
                        <italic>ornithine carbamoyltransferase</italic> (EC 2.1.3.3; OE5205R).
                    Ornithine is mainly transported outside through an arginine-ornithine antiporter
                    (≈95%), a process that accounts for most of the arginine taken
                    up. On the other hand, carbamoyl-phosphate, via the action of <italic>carbamate
                        kinase</italic> (EC 2.7.2.2; OE5206R), is degraded to NH<sub>3</sub> and
                        CO<sub>2</sub> in a reaction that produces ATP from ADP. In summary, most of
                    the supplied arginine is rapidly converted to ornithine through a process that
                    produces ATP. As will be discussed later, this fermentation process accounts for
                    most of the energy in the cells at the early stages of growth.</p>

                        <p>Prior to its depletion, arginine exhibits the highest uptake rate among
                            the supplied nutrients. Most of it is deaminated to citrulline, which is
                            then converted to ornithine and carbamoyl-phosphate (cbp). Most of the

                    conclude with certainty, given the resolution and quality of the current data,
                    that the acceleration of valine uptake actually precedes that of methionine, it
                    is very likely that the increased consumption rates for both are the result of
                    cells compensating for the depletion of leucine and isoleucine. Note that the
                    two depleted branched-chain amino acids seem to be preferred metabolites of
                        <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> during aerobic growth. Accordingly,
                    cells had to switch their metabolism to utilize more of the substitute sources
                    in order to sustain growth. Alternative explanations are provided as
                    supplementary information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s010">Text S1</xref>).</p>
                <p>The other supplied metabolites with utilization patterns that we found to exhibit
                    distinct modes are alanine, serine, threonine and glycine. The first switches
                    from gradual production to rapid consumption, and the latter three demonstrate
                    uptake rates that significantly accelerate. In each of these cases, the critical
                    point seems to be near <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is also near the time when proline, methionine and
                    valine are depleted. Although we believe that the increased consumption rates
                    are also compensatory measures for the depleted metabolites, it is again
                    difficult to conclude this with certainty, given the current data. Moreover, if
                    true, it is also difficult to determine whether which nutrients serves to
                    balance for what. Considering the significant qualitative interpretations that
                    the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameters carry, we performed further steps aimed at
                    analyzing the quality of the obtained values. We provide these results as
                    supplementary information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s010">Text S1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Nutrients consumed by cells can have various fates: (1) they can be incorporated
                    into the biomass with at most very minimal changes, such as in the case of amino
                    acids incorporated as protein residues or free metabolites; (2) they can be
                    converted to other biomass components, typically after partial degradation; (3)
                    they can be oxidatively degraded to CO<sub>2</sub> for the production of energy
                    through respiration; and (4) they can be secreted after conversion to another
                    metabolite, for example following partial degradation. Given that the rates at
                    which most of the supplied amino acids were consumed far exceeded the
                    requirements for biomass incorporation as described in the first fate mentioned
                    above, then at least one of the other three possible fates must also be true for
                    the relevant amino acids. The results for individual metabolites are summarized

                            been incoporated into the biomass, whether integrated into proteins or
                            as free metabolites. Clearly, for most of the supplied amino acids, the
                            rate at which they are taken up from the medium far exceeds the rate at
                            which they are directly incorporated. This implies that the pertinent
                            amino acids are, in addition, significantly catabolized for energy,
                            and/or are used to synthesize the other biomass constituents that are

                    (fates 1 and 2 mentioned above) or converted to metabolic by-products (fates 3
                    and 4). By approximating the biomass composition using measurements,
                    calculations and assumptions, and then correlating these information with the
                    observed population sizes, analysis and prediction of the latter set of fates
                    becomes possible. We took most of the biomass composition values from our
                    previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Gonzalez1">[15]</xref>, which includes the contribution of
                    individual amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, sugars, and several other
                    metabolites. However, we repeated the determination of the amino acid content,
                    which accounts for over 60% of the total organic mass, using
                    measurements at various optical densities. The results are summarized in
                    supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s002">Figure S2</xref>. While the relationships between the amino acids and the
                    optical density are not strictly linear, average errors from linear fits are
                    below 12.5% in all cases. Most of the deviations are situated in the
                    lower optical density range. With respect to the previous set of measurements
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Gonzalez1">[15]</xref>, the most significant difference of the current
                    one is that the total amino acid content is about 30% higher at
                    approximately 503 µg/OD·ml. Possible factors that could
                    have contributed to this discrepancy include differences in the conditions used,
                    including media composition, and the fact we more rigorously adapted the current
                    cultures. The discrepancy is well within the range of inaccuracy that may be
                    introduced by morphological changes in the cells to the relationship between
                    biomass and optical density. Accordingly, we also adjusted the biomass
                    requirement (composition) of the other constituents.</p>
                <p>CO<sub>2</sub> is an expected metabolic by-product of cells under aerobic
                    conditions. Indeed, if it is assumed that all carbon atoms that are taken up and
                    do not appear in the biomass are completely degraded through respiration, then
                        CO<sub>2</sub> should account for the bulk of the by-product pool. We
                    calculated the (theoretical) amount of oxygen that will be needed under such a
                    scenario at various points during growth, using flux balance analysis where we
                    set energy production as the objective function and assumed an unlimited oxygen
                    supply. Note that stoichiometric relationships between the oxidation of carbon
                    substrates and the consumption of oxygen are implicitly defined by the reactions
                    (pathways) in the metabolic network. However, comparison of these calculated
                    results with actual oxygen consumption measurements indicated that
                    respiratory-linked degradation is not the fate of most carbon atoms that are
                    consumed but do not get incorporated into the biomass. In fact, the data shows
                    that cells use only about 20% of the oxygen that they would otherwise
                    need to completely oxidize all the material. Thus, the formation and
                    accumulation of other by-products in significant quantities (in the mM range),
                    probably including those that result from forms of overflow metabolism, likely
                    occur in the preparations. In addition, the described situation already seems to
                    have been the case even before the oxygen supply became limiting at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The computations are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s003">Figure S3</xref>
                    (supplemental information). Further flux analyses show that the most efficient
                    by-products with respect to energy production are common intermediates such as
                    acetate and succinate.</p>
                <p>We observed a maximal respiratory rate of approximately 1 µmol
                    O<sub>2</sub>/OD·ml·hr during growth. At about <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the medium was reduced to
                    0%. Given that prior to this point, large amounts of nutrients that
                    are consumed but neither incorporated into the biomass nor subjected to
                    oxidative phosphorylation could already be observed, the respiratory process
                    itself is likely the bottleneck prior to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Past this point however, cells could only respire in at most
                    the rate at which oxygen dissolved into the medium. Note that a 0%
                    oxygen saturation level does not mean that oxygen is no longer available to the
                    cells because flasks were kept open. Given that growth continued well past the
                    point when the oxygen supply started to become limiting, the respiratory rate
                    dropped steadily from then on.</p>
                <p>Under aerobic conditions, cells can derive energy (ATP) through respiration and
                    substrate level phosphorylation. We calculated the maximum (theoretical) energy
                    that the system can produce as well as the fraction of this that can be
                    attributed to respiration at various points, using the observed nutrient
                    utilization. The values are reflected by the red and blue curves, respectively,
                    in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s004">Figure

                    account by the metabolic network in synthesizing the compounds included in the
                    biomass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Teusink1">[30]</xref>. In order to find flux distributions that
                    maximize energy production, we introduced an ATP hydrolysis reaction
                        (ATP+H<sub>2</sub>O = ADP+P)
                    into the network, and performed flux balance analysis with it defined as the
                    objective function. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in Equation (1) refers to the flux through this reaction.</p>
                <p>Throughout growth, the theoretical maximum energy that the system can produce
                    (red curve in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s004">Figure S4</xref>) is significantly higher than the energy produced by
                    respiration (blue curve). Although it is possible that the actual energy
                    production of the system is closer to the respiratory curve, it is clear that
                    prior to the depletion of arginine (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the earlier described fermentation process for this amino
                    acid accounts for most of the energy produced by the system. Evidently, the
                    energy generated by this process can be comparable to the two
                    “primary” modes (respiration and photosynthesis), contrary
                    to what is typically assumed. This is consistent with the fact that <italic>H.
                        salinarum</italic> can be grown with neither oxygen nor light just as
                    readily, by supplying large amounts of arginine. After the amino acid is
                    depleted, respiration accounts for most of the produced energy. The additional
                    energy that can be produced through the further non-respiratory-related
                    degradation of other (non-arginine) nutrients is significantly smaller. This
                    being the case, it is remarkable that non-respiratory-related processes account
                    for approximately 80% of the nutrients that are consumed but not
                    incorporated into the biomass. Again, we should note that the pertinent
                    metabolites include essential ones.</p>
                <p>We computed fluxes that are consistent with the observed consumption and
                    production rates during the exponential phase (specifically <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and which additionally maximize energy production. These are
                    illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000332-g005">Figure 5</xref>. In
                    it, compounds which are taken up from the medium are represented by yellow

                    Fluxes through reactions are presented using arrows, where thickness is used to
                    indicate strength. Considering that it is uncertain to what extent energy
                    production is actually the objective of cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used
                    flux variability analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Mahadevan1">[31]</xref> to complement the results by computing the
                    minimum and maximum possible fluxes through each reaction after removing all
                    optimality assumptions. Fluxes through reactions for which the values are either
                    both positive or both negative are drawn in black. Intuitively, these are
                    reactions that are constrained enough by the network stucture, pseudo-stability
                    and the observed exchange fluxes, to have non-zero activity regardless of any
                    optimality assumptions. That is, the network structure and the measured data are
                    already enough to guarantee the existence of the fluxes and their indicated

                <p>During the exponential phase <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), we found 378 (67%) of the 567 internal reactions
                    of the metabolic network to have qualitatively invariable fluxes. Of these, 246
                    carry non-zero fluxes, and 132 are blocked under the conditions. The fact that
                    measurements of a relatively few input and output fluxes already qualitatively
                    determines the fluxes through most of the reactions is related to the bow tie
                    structure of the metabolic network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Gonzalez1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Csete1">[32]</xref>.
                    Catabolic pathways, which together form one fan of the bow tie, fan-in into the
                    knot of central metabolism to supply the common intermediates. These pathways
                    are highly linear and convergent in structure. Accordingly, nutrients which are
                    taken up and not directly incorporated into the biomass will have to go through
                    the associated catabolic pathway with no variability until the level of the
                    common intermediates is reached. Similarly, biosynthetic pathways, which form
                    the other fan of the bow tie, fan-out and branch from the knot of central
                    metabolism, and are also highly linear in structure. Thus, most biosynthetic
                    routes of cellular constituents will also be invariable once past the level of
                    the metabolic core.</p>

                <title>Phototrophic Growth</title>
                <p>Phototrophic cultures were grown under conditions similar to the aerobic
                    preparations, except that oxygen was absent and they were illuminated with white
                    light. We were able to observe final optical densities well above 1.5 OD,
                    comparable to the population levels achieved by their counterparts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s005">Figure S5</xref>).
                    The most apparent difference is with respect to having slower growth rates.
                    While aerobic preparations exhibited exponential phase doubling times of only
                    roughly 11 hours, phototrophic cultures demonstrated times close to 50 hours.
                    The reason for this disparity is unclear. Representative aerobic and
                    phototrophic growth curves are provided as supplementary information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s005">Figure S5</xref>).
                    In both cases, the preparation depicted is the result of three rounds of
                    adaptation by iterative reinoculation into the respective condition.</p>
                <p>We modeled the consumption and production of nutrients during phototrophy using
                    the same procedure we employed for the aerobic case. Accordingly, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameter, when applicable, again reflects the point at which
                    qualitative change in the uptake pattern of the respective nutrient occurs. The
                    experimental data and the corresponding model simulations are provided as
                    supplementary information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Analogous to the aerobic case,
                    arginine was rapidly depleted near the start of growth, again with most of it
                    being converted to ornithine and secreted by cells into the medium. This is
                    interesting because arginine fermentation genes (<italic>arcABC</italic>) have
                    been found to be repressed during phototrophy, presumably to repress the
                    secondary energy source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Pan1">[33]</xref>. However, the rapid depletion of arginine and
                    the equally rapid accumulation of ornithine is a clear indication that the
                    fermentation process was in fact active despite the phototrophic condition of
                    the cells. Considering that we used inoculants taken from cultures already
                    growing under phototrophy, it is unlikely that the observations are only due to
                    the time (lag) that is required for regulation to take effect.</p>
                <p>Next to arginine, aspartate exhibited the highest uptake rate, and is the second
                    supplied amino acid that was depleted at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Up to that point, very little, if at all, glutamate uptake
                    could be observed. However, consumption of the amino acid either starts or
                    accelerates appreciably after the exogenous aspartate supply is exhausted.
                    Similarly, methionine uptake also seems to accelerate at this point. Some 200
                    hours later (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), phenylalanine is depleted, and threonine and serine are
                    nearly exhausted. Also at about the same time, alanine switches from production
                    to consumption, and the uptake of glycine accelerates. The three amino acids
                    glycine, serine and threonine are connected to each other through their
                    degradative pathways. Presumably, when glycine is no longer produced through the
                    degradation of excess amounts of either serine or threonine, then cells have to
                    take up more of it. This is consistent with the observation that prior to this
                    point, glycine uptake is significantly lower than the rate at which the amino
                    acid is incorporated into the biomass whether as protein residues or free
                    metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s007">Figure S7</xref>), not even considering the fact that glycine, via
                    tetrahydrofolate, is also used as methyl donor in various biosynthetic pathways.</p>
                <p>Unlike in the aerobic case, the depletion of phenylalanine coincided with a
                    number of discernable qualitative changes in the uptake patterns of the
                    nutrients. In addition to the ones stated above, consumption of the amino acid
                    serine seems to have stopped at about the same time, even though growth, albeit
                    already in the late exponential phase, could still be observed. The reason for
                    this is unclear. Serine was already nearly exhausted at about 0.2 mM by then.
                    Moreover, it is also at this point that alanine switched from production to
                    consumption. Serine and alanine are metabolically related to each other through
                    their degradative pathways, as the two can enter central metabolism through
                    pyruvate. In the aerobic case, not only were we unable to observe an arrest in
                    serine uptake, but the switch of alanine from production to consumption actually
                    conincided with the acceleration of serine consumption. While neither serine nor
                    alanine share the catabolic route of phenylalanine, it is possible that
                    phenylalanine played a more important role in the phototrophic case; that is,
                    the observed behaviors may have been indirect effects of the amino
                    acid's depletion. In this respect, we should note that the early
                    biosynthetic steps of aromatic amino acids are shared with the quinones, which
                    play critical roles in respiration.</p>
                <p>Analogous to the aerobic case and somewhat unexpectedly, the rates at which most
                    of the supplied amino acids were taken up from the medium far exceeded the rates
                    at which they were incorporated into the biomass with minimal modifications
                    (fate 1). These findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s007">Figure S7</xref>.
                    Again, the implication is that the consumed quantities of the pertinent amino
                    acids are considerably catabolized by the cells. Certainly, significant portions
                    of these are used as building blocks (carbon skeleton donors) for the production
                    of other biomass constituents (fate 2), such as nucleotides and lipid molecules.
                    However, even the substrate requirements for the synthesis of these unsupplied
                    biomass components are not enough to explain the differences. This can readily
                    be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s008">Figure S8</xref>, which shows the total carbon uptake against the total
                    carbon incorporation under the conditions. Accordingly, similar to the aerobic
                    case, other metabolites (by-products) are also likely produced and accumulated
                    in considerable quantities. This is somewhat more unexpected during phototrophy
                    than in respiration because the necessary oxidative breakdown of nutrients in
                    the latter is not present. Under phototrophic conditions, one would typically
                    expect material consumption to be only near the quantity sufficient for biomass
                    production because energy can already be derived from light, rather than from
                    the supplied metabolites. The energy yield of the non-respiratory degradation of
                    these materials should be very small compared to the energy produced through
                    photosynthesis, especially considering that arginine is the only fermentative
                    substrate of <italic>H. salinarum</italic>. Nevertheless, in retrospect, this
                    behavior is consistent with the emerging picture that the organism takes an
                    approach toward growth that is focused on the here and now, even at the cost of
                    longer-term concerns. Indeed, the essential amino acids leucine, lysine,
                    isoleucine, methionine and valine are again among the amino acids that are taken
                    up in amounts far more than required for biomass formation.</p>
                <p>When phototrophic cultures reached 1.5 OD, only about 14% of the
                    supplied carbon that had been consumed could be attributed to the amino acid
                    content of the biomass (directly measured; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s008">Figure S8</xref>).
                    This means that the total carbon incoporation rate was only about 20%
                    (accounting for the other biomass components: eg., nucleotides, lipids,
                    etc…). In comparison, when aerobic cultures reached comparable levels
                    of population (also in the late exponential phase), we could attribute about
                    13% of the consumed carbon to the amino acid content of the biomass
                    (directly measured; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which implies a total carbon
                    incorporation rate of approximately 19%. This means that about
                    80% and 81% of the consumed carbon were not incorporated
                    in the phototrophic and aerobic cases, respectively. Correcting the aerobic
                    value to account for the respiratory-related oxidative degradation of
                    nutrients—using a 1∶1 CO<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub> ratio
                    which was calculated using the stoichiometry of the parts of the metabolic
                    network that are involved in the oxidation of the relevant amino
                    acids—shows that approximately 66% of the carbon was
                    neither incorporated nor respired. Considering the fact that the growth rates
                    observed for phototrophy were nearly five-fold slower, it is remarkable that the
                    ratios of the nonincorporated, nonrespired carbon under both conditions are as
                    close to each other as they are. Indeed, aerobic cultures already reached 1.5 OD
                    after only slightly more than 80 hours, while, in stark contrast, phototrophic
                    cultures took about 450 hours to reach similar levels. It would therefore seem
                    that a large part of the nutrients that were taken up but were neither
                    incorporated into the biomass nor used as respiratory substrates has more to do
                    with growth (biomass production) than with any form of maintenance. For this
                    reason, it is likely that some as of yet uncharacterized, non-maintenance growth
                    processes are at least partially responsible for the low carbon incorporation
                    rates.</p>

                <title>Environmental Adaptations</title>
                <p>Several unexpected findings were made during the course of this study. These
                    include: (1) that essential amino acids are degraded not only during respiration
                    but even under phototrophic (anaerobic) conditions, where energy should already
                    be abundant; (2) that fermentation of arginine, which is often considered a
                    secondary, alternative energy source, occurs simultaneously with either
                    respiration or photosynthesis; (3) that considerable amounts of metabolites are
                    produced and accumulate in the medium under both conditions, as a result of
                    nutrients that are consumed but not incorporated into the biomass nor used as
                    respiratory substrates; and (4) in connection with the previous point, that the
                    total carbon incorporation rate is extremely low even under phototrophic
                    (anaerobic) conditions (approximately 20%), when one would typically
                    expect nutrient consumption to be in quantities that are only sufficient for
                    biomass production since energy is already derived from light. All of these
                    findings are consistent with the seemingly “greedy” behavior
                    demonstrated by <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> that we noted in our
                    previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Gonzalez1">[15]</xref>, which we believe actually consists of
                    adaptations to its natural environment, where nutrient availability is not only
                    irregular but can also be absent for extended periods of time.</p>
                <p>In the salt lakes and solar salterns where <italic>Halobacterium
                    salinarum</italic> may be found, life is characterized by blooms that may not
                    occur for years after a previous episode. In the Dead Sea for example, no growth
                    of the unicellular green alga, <italic>Dunaliella parva</italic>, which is
                    responsible for all of the primary productivity, is possible when the salt
                    concentration of the water column is invariably high. Blooms of
                        <italic>Dunaliella</italic> in the Dead Sea occur only after significant
                    dilution of the upper levels by the influx of freshwater. In turn, this allows
                    the archaeal community to bloom at the expense of the organic material produced
                    by the alga <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Oren1">[34]</xref>. The fact that the conditions under which
                    these blooms are possible may not be realized for years after a previous episode
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Oren2">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Oren3">[36]</xref> may have inclined
                        <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> to grow as much as possible when
                    the conditions become favorable. In connection to this, as for the times when
                    their environments are not conducive to growth, the capacity of the halobacteria
                    to survive in adverse conditions for extended periods has been well established
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Grant1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Grant2">[38]</xref>. This capacity
                    allows them to survive until the next bloom. In this respect, we should note
                    that a considerable number of the reported viable ancient cells that have been
                    recovered are at least moderately halophilic (halotolerant) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Vreeland1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Denner1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Norton1">[41]</xref>.</p>

                <p>One of the predictions of our model is that non-CO<sub>2</sub>
                    by-products/metabolites accumulate in the medium in significant amounts under
                    both aerobic and photorophic conditions, likely including partially degraded
                    forms of the supplied nutrients. Unfortunately, attempts to identify the
                    secreted molecules are complicated by the (necessary) extremely high salt
                    concentrations (4 M) in the growth media. We intend to focus on the
                    identification of these metabolites and on the elucidation of the
                    reasons/dynamics behind their accumulation in a succeeding study.</p>
                <p>Specific sets of nutrients dominate material uptake at various points during
                    growth. For example, at the early stages, highest uptake rates were observed for
                    aspartate and leucine, and, to a lesser extent, glutamate and serine. Note that
                    arginine uptake was the highest, but most of its carbon skeleton was secreted as
                    ornithine. With this information in hand, we would like to perform flux analysis
                    using labeled substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000332-Sauer1">[22]</xref> in order to obtain quantitative constraints
                    for at least a fraction of the internal fluxes. This should allow for a more
                    detailed view of the metabolic strategy used by the cells.</p>

The rational of the construction
                    is that the production or consumption of a metabolite depends on the
                    availability of the metabolite, the population size and the current growth rate.</p>
                <p>Preliminary inspection of the data revealed that the transport patterns of some
                    of the metabolites change during growth. For example, ornithine, at some point,
                    switches from being produced and accumulated in the medium to being steadily
                    consumed by cells. Accordingly, we used a simple extension of Equation (2) that
                    allows for two modes:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e031" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are optimizable parameters. Similar to the basic form, the
                    consumption or production of each metabolite still depends on the availability
                    of the metabolite, the population size and the current growth rate. However, the
                    new parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> now separates time into two intervals, and the distinct set of
                    parameters for each of these allows the utilization pattern to qualitatively
                    change in moving from the first to the second.</p>
                <p>For each nutrient <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, parameters for both Equations (2) and (3) were estimated from
                    experimental data using the <italic>fminsearch</italic> function of MATLAB.
                    Systematically defined sets of initial parameter values were used in solving the
                    inverse problems (parameter estimation). To minimize the possibility of
                    overfitting, the more sophisticated form of Equation (3) was used in the final
                    model, in favor over the simpler equation form, only if it resulted in
                    significant improvement, that is, the residual error, a measure of the
                    (dis-)agreement between the model and data, is substantially lower. In this
                    respect, it is reasuring that although Equation (3) is clearly better for some
                    metabolites, such as alanine and ornithine, it hardly makes any improvement for
                    others, such as leucine and isoleucine, which seem to be staples of the cells
                    (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref>). In cases where Equation (3) is used, the optimized parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, intuitively, corresponds to a point near where the uptake
                    pattern changes qualitatively. Note that the borders (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) need not be equal for all
                    <italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic>'s. Because the choice between the two
                    equation forms can be done automatically, the computational system we employ not
                    only accounts for changes in metabolite modes, but can actually lead to the
                    detection and identification of these modes, and, subsequently, to the
                    recognition of the biological processes behind them.</p>
                <p>A metabolic network can be conveniently represented as a stoichiometric matrix
                        <bold>S</bold>, where each row corresponds to a metabolite and each column

                <p>Strain <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> R1 (DSM 671) cells were grown in
                    chemically-defined medium, with composition defined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s009">Table S1</xref>.
                    The medium composition that we used is the simplest known for the halophile that
                    allows population levels comparable to those reached when using complex media.
                    Preparatory cultures were grown in 100 ml flasks containing 35 ml of the medium
                    to a cell density of ≈1 OD, from which 1 ml inoculants were taken to
                    start the next culture. This was done repeatedly to adapt cells to their growth
                    conditions. All cultures were prepared in flasks which had side arms to measure
                    turbidity (cell density) via a Klett photometer, and were carried out in
                    duplicates. Cell suspensions were shaken at 105 rpm at 40°C in the dark.
                    At specific points, samples were taken from the cultures so that 14–18
                    samples were collected over the growth period, and these were stored at
                    4°C. To separate the cells from the medium, the samples were centrifuged
                    for five minutes at 15,000 rpm, using a SS34 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in
                    500 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000332.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>l basal salt (medium without the amino acids) and spun down as
                    before. Amino acid analysis was performed on both the pellets and the original
                    supernatants, using an Amino Acid Analyzer (Biotronik LC3000). Oxygen saturation
                    in the medium was monitored using the “Fibox 3-trace v3, fiber-optic
                    oxygen meter” from Precision Sensing GmbH (Regensburg, Germany).
                    Calculation of the actual oxygen consumption rates is provided as supplementary
                    information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000332.s011">Text S2</xref>). Similar protocols were used for phototrophically grown
                    (anaerobic) cells, except that flasks were first flushed with nitrogen to remove
                    oxygen, and were closed using air-tight septa. To maintain the anaerobic
                    condition of cultures while taking samples, syringes with a long needle,
                    inserted through the septa, were used.</p>

            <p>We would like to acknowledge the support of our colleague, Wolfgang Strasshofer of
                the core facility, for performing the amino acid analysis of the numerous samples.
                We would like to thank Mirit Gulko and Tanja Oberwinkler for various support in the
                lab. Finally, we are also grateful to Dr. Mike Dyall-Smith for reviewing the
                manuscript.</p>
