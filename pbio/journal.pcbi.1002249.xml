        <p>Conventional methods used to characterize multidimensional neural feature selectivity, such as spike-triggered covariance (STC) or maximally informative dimensions (MID), are limited to Gaussian stimuli or are only able to identify a small number of features due to the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these issues, we propose two new dimensionality reduction methods that use minimum and maximum information models. These methods are information theoretic extensions of STC that can be used with non-Gaussian stimulus distributions to find relevant linear subspaces of arbitrary dimensionality. We compare these new methods to the conventional methods in two ways: with biologically-inspired simulated neurons responding to natural images and with recordings from macaque retinal and thalamic cells responding to naturalistic time-varying stimuli. With non-Gaussian stimuli, the minimum and maximum information methods significantly outperform STC in all cases, whereas MID performs best in the regime of low dimensional feature spaces.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Neurons are capable of simultaneously encoding information about multiple features of sensory stimuli in their spikes. The dimensionality reduction methods that currently exist to extract those relevant features are either biased for non-Gaussian stimuli or fall victim to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we introduce two information theoretic extensions of the spike-triggered covariance method. These new methods use the concepts of minimum and maximum mutual information to identify the stimulus features encoded in the spikes of a neuron. Using simulated and experimental neural data, these methods are shown to perform well both in situations where conventional approaches are appropriate and where they fail. These new techniques should improve the characterization of neural feature selectivity in areas of the brain where the application of currently available approaches is restricted.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In recent years it has become apparent that many types of sensory neurons simultaneously encode information about more than one stimulus feature in their spiking activity. Examples can be found across a wide variety of modalities, including the visual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Brenner1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Tanabe1">[12]</xref>, auditory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Atencio1">[13]</xref>, olfactory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Kim1">[14]</xref>, somatosensory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Maravall1">[15]</xref> and mechanosensory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Fox1">[16]</xref> systems. This discovery was facilitated by the development of dimensionality reduction techniques like spike-triggered covariance (STC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-deRuytervanSteveninck1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Schwartz2">[22]</xref> and maximally informative dimensions (MID) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Sharpee1">[23]</xref>. These two methods exhibit complementary advantages and disadvantages. For instance, STC can identify many relevant features for stimuli whose parameters are distributed in a Gaussian manner but can fail when natural stimuli are used, whereas MID works well for arbitrary stimuli but requires exponentially larger data sets to find more than a few features. Therefore, there is need for a method that can find relevant features from arbitrary stimulus distributions while bypassing the curse of dimensionality. Here we propose two novel techniques based on minimum and maximum mutual information; these new approaches can be seen as an extension of STC to arbitrary stimuli.</p>
      <p>Neural coding of multiple stimulus features is typically modeled as a linear-nonlinear Poisson (LNP) process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-deBoer1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Dayan1">[28]</xref>. A stimulus <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such as an image with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> pixels, as well as each of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> features <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for which a neuron is selective are represented by vectors in a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> dimensional space. The neuron extracts information about the stimulus by projecting <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> onto the linear subspace spanned by the feature vectors. The result is a stimulus of reduced dimensionality <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; this input is then passed through an nonlinear firing rate function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Spikes are then assumed to be generated by a Poisson process with a rate equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which only depends on the relevant dimensions of the stimulus space.</p>
      <p>Given a set of stimuli <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the corresponding observed neural responses <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is number of spikes, there are a few commonly used methods available to extract the stimulus features relevant to the neuron. In the STC method, the stimulus covariance matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the covariance of the spike-triggered ensemble,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula> are compared to discover the dimensions along which the stimulus variance conditional on a spike is significantly different from the stimulus variance overall. This comparison is done by diagonalizing the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The relevant features can be identified by the eigenvectors that have nonzero eigenvalues. If the stimuli are drawn from a distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which is Gaussian, then the only limitation to finding the features is having a large enough set of spike data. In practice, the STC procedure can be extended to Gaussian stimuli containing correlations by adding a whitening step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-deRuytervanSteveninck1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Bialek1">[18]</xref>, and can also include a regularization term to smooth the results (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). On the other hand, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is non-Gaussian, as is the case for natural images, then higher order stimulus correlations can greatly affect the results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Sharpee1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Paninski2">29</xref>.</p>
      <p>The use of Gaussian stimuli makes it possible to find many relevant dimensions using STC, but fully sampling the dynamic range of responses often requires a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> more similar to the non-Gaussian distributions found in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Rieke1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Simoncelli1">[30]</xref>. It has also been suggested that neural representations of stimuli may be optimized in some way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Barlow1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-vonderTwer1">[33]</xref> to the statistics of the natural environment. With this in mind, it is important that multidimensional feature extraction methods be extended to stimulus distributions with non-Gaussian statistics.</p>
      <p>The MID method is an information theoretic dimensionality reduction technique that identifies relevant features based on how much information a linear subspace contains about the observed spikes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Unlike STC, the dimensionality of the relevant subspace to be found using MID must be specified <italic>a priori</italic>, and thus to discover the number of relevant features one must search for additional dimensions until the subspace accounts for a sufficient fraction of the information carried in the neural response. The objective function in MID relies on an empirical construction of the reduced stimulus distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the corresponding conditional distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and thus suffers from the curse of dimensionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Bellman1">[34]</xref>. A related problem that occurs equally for Gaussian and non-Gaussian stimuli, and affects both the STC and MID methods, is that even if one is able to find many relevant dimensions, it is usually not possible to sample the nonlinear gain function simultaneously along all of these dimensions.</p>
      <p>Here we put forth two new dimensionality reduction techniques applicable to arbitrary stimulus distributions. These methods, much like STC, make use of pairwise correlations between stimulus dimensions and are not hindered by the curse of dimensionality in the same manner as MID. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods, we apply them to simulated neural data for two biologically inspired model cells, and to physiological recordings of the response of macaque retina and thalamus cells to time-varying stimuli.</p>

        <p>If the spiking activity of a neuron is encoding certain aspects of the stimulus, then the corresponding stimulus features must be correlated in some way with the neural response. From an experiment one can estimate specific stimulus/response correlations, such as the spike-triggered average (STA), the spike-triggered covariance (STC), or the mutual information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Cover1">[35]</xref>,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e023" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>which provides a full measure of the degree of dependence between stimulus and response. These estimates can then be used to construct a model of the conditional response probability by constraining <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to match a given set of observed correlations, as in the STA and STC methods. As there are an infinite number of models that match any given set of experimentally estimated correlations, the values of the unconstrained correlations are necessarily determined by the specific choice of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>The minimal model of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the one that is consistent with the chosen set of correlations but is otherwise as random as possible, making it minimally biased with respect to unconstrained correlations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Fitzgerald1">[36]</xref>. This model can be obtained by maximizing the noise entropy <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes an average over <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For a binary spike/no spike neuron consistent with an observed mean firing rate, as well as the correlation of the neural response with linear and quadratic moments of the stimulus, the minimal model is a logistic function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Fitzgerald1">[36]</xref><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e030" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where the parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are chosen such that the mean firing rate, STA and STC of the model match the experimentally observed values (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). If correlations between a spike and higher order moments of the stimulus are measured, the argument of the logistic function would include higher powers of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In addition to being as unbiased as possible, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> also minimizes the mutual information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Fitzgerald1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Globerson1">[37]</xref>, which only includes the contribution of the chosen constraints. We note that previously we used this minimal model framework to characterize the computation performed within the reduced relevant subspace <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Fitzgerald1">[36]</xref>, and in particular to quantify in information-theoretic terms the contribution of higher-than-second powers of relevant stimulus features to neural firing.

        <p>The minimal models of binary response systems take the form of logistic functions. This restriction can be eliminated if we look for a maximally informative second order model. To accomplish this, we extend the MID algorithm to second order in the stimulus by assuming the firing rate is a function of a quadratic polynomial, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The ability to construct an arbitrary nonlinearity allows nonlinear MID to include information contained in higher order stimulus/response correlations and to find the linear combination that captures the most information about the neural response. Unlike multidimensional linear MID, nonlinear MID is one-dimensional in the quadratic stimulus space and therefore avoids the curse of dimensionality in the calculation of the objective function.</p>

        <p>To demonstrate the usefulness of the new approaches proposed here for the analysis of real neural data, we analyzed the responses of 9 macaque retina ganglion cells (RGC) and 9 cells from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) under naturalistic stimulus conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Sincich2">[48]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). In this case, the stimulus was a spot of light filling the center of the RGC or LGN receptive field with non-Gaussian intensity fluctuations.</p>
        <p>While we cannot know the true features of these neurons as we can for the model cells, this data was previously analyzed using MID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Sincich1">[3]</xref> and it was found that two stimulus features explain nearly all of the information in the neural response (an average of 85% information explained across the 18 cells analyzed). We can therefore use the two linear MID features as a benchmark for comparing the features recovered with the new algorithms, using the subspace projection quantity in Eq. (4). Moreover, the veracity of these new algorithms can be tested by comparison with other studies that have used Gaussian stimuli and STC to investigate feature selectivity of retinal cells. For instance, it was previously shown that salamander RGCs are selective to 2 to 6 significant stimulus features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Fairhall1">[2]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Both of the methods proposed here find relevant subspaces using second order stimulus statistics and can therefore be seen as extensions of the STC method. The minimal model is forced to have a logistic function nonlinearity, which has the benefit of removing unwanted model bias regarding higher than second order stimulus moments. In contrast, nonlinear MID uses an arbitrary nonlinear gain function and is therefore able to make use of higher order statistics to maximize information. Although both methods yield models consistent with first and second order stimulus/response correlations, neither method is guaranteed to work if the underlying neural computation does not match the structure of the model or the assumptions that underlie the estimation of relevant features.</p>
      <p>In principle, the flexibility in the nonlinear MID gain function means it should perform at least as well as the minimal model. However, what we have observed is that the nonlinear MID subspace projection with these two model cells is slightly smaller than the minimal model subspace. This may be due to the differences in the nature of the optimization problems being solved in the two methods. Maximizing noise entropy under constraints is a convex optimization problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Malouf1">[49]</xref>, whereas maximizing mutual information is not convex. This means that the parameter space for nonlinear MID may contain many local maxima. Although the MID algorithm uses simulated annealing to overcome this issue, the number of iterations required to outperform the minimal model may be large. We have observed (data not shown) that minimal models can find feature spaces with extremely high dimensionality <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which corresponds to finding on the order of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values of the covariance matrix.</p>
      <p>Neurons with selectivity for only a few features that are probed with non-Gaussian stimuli, such as the model cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002249-g002">Fig. 2</xref> or the RGC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002249-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, can be characterized very well with MID, as previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Sharpee1">[23]</xref>. Thus, in such cases MID is a useful tool for estimating the relevant features. We have found that for both real and model neurons with a small number of relevant features, the minimum and maximum information models performed quite well, despite the large number of parameters that need to be estimated. In particular, both methods were able to outperform STC in the recovery of the relevant stimulus subspace. On the other hand, when the dimensionality of the feature space is larger, as for the 6 dimensional cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002249-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, linear MID cannot be used reliably due to the massive amount of data needed to construct a 6 dimensional empirical spike-conditional probability distribution. Because in the case of model cells the relevant features are known, we can verify that the minimal models and nonlinear MID approaches are able to find all of the features, whereas STC performs significantly worse. Furthermore, the fact that the second-order minimal models yielded a similar number (2–5) of relevant dimensions across the neural population as was previously described with Gaussian stimuli can be viewed as a further validation of the new method. It is our hope that these new techniques will advance the characterization of neural feature selectivity under a variety of stimulus conditions.</p>

Here <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the identity matrix and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a regularization parameter that was varied for both model cells to identify the value which gave the largest overlap. This value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was used to give a best case estimate of STC performance. We note that this procedure gives more credit to STC compared to the other methods used here because it is not possible to evaluate a cross-validation metric such as percent information explained when many dimensions are involved.</p>

However, in the limit of small time bins where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in most of the bins, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which leads to vanishing contributions from <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this case, one can optimize either <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to find the relevant features <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> along which the probability distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is most different from <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> according to the Kullback-Leibler distance, cf.

        <p>To extend the MID algorithm to nonlinear MID (nMID), the stimulus is simply transformed by a nonlinear operation. For the second order nonlinear transformation considered in this paper, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a vector whose first <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> components are the components of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the remaining components are the elements of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Due to the symmetry of the outer product matrix, this transformed stimulus dimensionality is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this new space, the MID algorithm works as before, finding a linear combination of these dimensions, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is maximized. To improve performance and cut down on runtime, the search was started from the minimal model estimate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>To prevent overfitting of the parameters, an early stopping mechanism was used whereby the data was broken into two sets: one set was used for training and the other used for testing. The training set was used to search the parameter space, while the test set was used to evaluate the parameters on independent data. The best linear combination for both data sets was returned by the algorithm. This procedure was done four times, using four different quarters of the complete data set as the test set. The resulting parameters found from these four fittings were averaged before diagonalizing and finding the relevant features. Unlike the regularization of STC models, this procedure can be used when analyzing experimental data.</p>

        <p>The model of the neural response that matches experimental observations in terms of the mean response probability, as well as correlations between the neural response with linear and quadratic moments of stimuli can be obtained by enforcing<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e108" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an average over <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an average over <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Because <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, this reduces to a set of<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e114" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>equations. Simultaneously satisfying these equations is analytically equivalent to maximizing the log likelihood of the data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002249-Malouf1">[49]</xref>, which is convex and can therefore be maximized using a conjugate gradient ascent algorithm.</p>
        <p>To prevent overfitting of the parameters, an early stopping procedure was implemented similar to that used in the MID algorithm. Each step of the algorithm increased the likelihood of the training set, but at some point began decreasing the likelihood of the test set, indicating the fitting of noise within the training set. The algorithm then returned the parameters found at the maximum likelihood of the test set. As described above, this was done four times with different quarters of the data serving as the test set and the resulting parameter vectors were averaged before diagonalizing the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>Significance testing of the eigenvalues was done by creating 500 Gaussian distributed random matrices with the same variance as that of the set of elements of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These random matrices were each diagonalized to create a random eigenvalue distribution. Eigenvalues of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002249.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were then said to be significant if they fell below the lower 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile or above the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile.</p>
