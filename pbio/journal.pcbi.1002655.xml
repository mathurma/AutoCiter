        <p>The functional significance of electrical rhythms in the mammalian brain remains uncertain. In the motor cortex, the 12–20 Hz beta rhythm is known to transiently decrease in amplitude during movement, and to be altered in many motor diseases. Here we show that the activity of neuronal populations is phase-coupled with the beta rhythm on rapid timescales, and describe how the strength of this relation changes with movement. To investigate the relationship of the beta rhythm to neuronal dynamics, we measured local cortical activity using arrays of subdural electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrodes in human patients performing simple movement tasks. In addition to rhythmic brain processes, ECoG potentials also reveal a spectrally broadband motif that reflects the aggregate neural population activity beneath each electrode. During movement, the amplitude of this broadband motif follows the dynamics of individual fingers, with somatotopically specific responses for different fingers at different sites on the pre-central gyrus. The 12–20 Hz beta rhythm, in contrast, is widespread as well as spatially coherent within sulcal boundaries and decreases in amplitude across the pre- and post-central gyri in a diffuse manner that is not finger-specific. We find that the amplitude of this broadband motif is entrained on the phase of the beta rhythm, as well as rhythms at other frequencies, in peri-central cortex during fixation. During finger movement, the beta phase-entrainment is diminished or eliminated. We suggest that the beta rhythm may be more than a resting rhythm, and that this entrainment may reflect a suppressive mechanism for actively gating motor function.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>We have long known that there are rhythmic oscillations in the mammalian brain. Although the power in these rhythms changes during behavior, their relevance for brain function has been something of a mystery. In this study, the particular role of rhythms in human motor cortex was studied both during rest and during engagement in different finger movements. Arrays of electrocorticographic electrodes were placed directly on frontal, temporal, and parietal brain surfaces to measure the electrical potential. These measurements reveal that movement of different fingers produces spatially focal and finger-specific changes in local neuronal population activity, along with spatially diffuse and finger-nonspecific decreases in 12–20 Hz β-rhythm power. Apart from these power changes, there are independent interactions between the β-rhythm and local cortical activity. During rest, 5–20% of the variation in local cortical activity is due to entrainment on the phase of the β-rhythm over the pre- and post-central gyri, but the interaction is significantly diminished during movement. This shifting entrainment suggests that the β-rhythm is not simply a background process that is suppressed during movement, but rather that the β-rhythm plays an active and important role in motor processing.</p>

      <p>Human motor behaviors such as reaching, grasping and speaking, are executed and controlled by the somatomotor regions of the cerebral cortex, which are located immediately anterior and posterior of the central sulcus. This peri-central system is known to manifest a 12–20 Hz electrical oscillation known as the beta rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Jasper1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller1">[2]</xref>, which has long been known to have an inverse relation to sensory processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Bartley1">[3]</xref> and motor production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Penfield1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Jasper2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Bates1">[6]</xref>.

      <p>Classically, diseases in the brain have been approached in terms of local pathology. For example, a stroke that abolishes the blood supply to the precentral gyrus, or a precentral tumor can produce paralysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Knapp1">[15]</xref>. However, we are beginning to understand that some are diseases of brain dynamics, which involve functionally specific brain areas, but are ultimately a result of dysfunctional interactions. Dysfunctional inter-regional dynamics have been explored using measures of cortical metabolic activity (fMRI and PET), in studies of epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Zhang1">[16]</xref>, Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Greicius1">[17]</xref>, depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Greicius2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Greicius3">[19]</xref>, and, most relevant for the present study, motor disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Calautti1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Nakamura1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Stefurak1">[22]</xref>. However, these measures of brain metabolism are tied to metabolic timescales (e.g. at least 5–10 s); in contrast, the computational neural network dynamics occur at the faster timescales over which cognition and behavior are modulated (50–250 ms). Aspects of macroscale and network physiology at these timescales in the brain can now be captured by changes in brain surface electrical potentials.</p>
      <p>Despite the association between the beta rhythm and motor function, it is not known whether the rhythm plays an active role in altering the computations taking place in somatomotor cortex, or whether it is epiphenomenon of cortical state changes determined by other mechanisms. Here we present new evidence for the role of the beta rhythm in organizing somatomotor function by quantifying the relation between rhythmic population activity on the time-scales of tens of milliseconds in sites across the lateral cerebral cortex.</p>
      <p>Recent work has shown that the phase of the beta rhythm in the local field potential is correlated with the firing time of individual neurons in primary motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Murthy1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Murthy2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Reimer1">[25]</xref>. Here we use subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) at the brain surface to examine this relationship for neural population activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g001">Figure 1</xref>). From these ECoG recordings, a correlate of mean instantaneous firing rate across the population of neurons beneath the electrode can be extracted in the form of broadband spectral power <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Manning1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller4">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller5">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Ray1">[29]</xref>.

      <p>In this study, we examined the properties of the beta rhythm at rest during simple visual fixation and during a basic finger movement task. By documenting how broadband spectral changes vary with the phase of underlying motor beta rhythm, we show that local cortical activity has a robust entrainment on the phase of the beta rhythm, specifically in peri-central motor areas. This relation of the beta rhythm to local neuronal activity is a property of the “resting brain”: it is present during fixation and when resting, and is selectively diminished during movement, along with the amplitude of the beta rhythm. We hypothesize that this phenomenon, here observed for the peri-central beta rhythm, may be one example of a general motif for cortical-subcortical circuits, and that this motif will be observed with different brain rhythms across cortical areas and behavioral states.</p>

        <p>Results were obtained from ECoG recordings in 14 human subjects (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, the averaged power spectral density (PSD) of the ECoG potential during movement and rest exhibits a general broadband 1/f<sup>χ</sup> shape, with superimposed rhythms that deviate from this 1/f<sup>χ</sup> structure at particular low frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller5">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller7">[31]</xref>. During motor behavior, these averaged PSDs commonly reveal decreases in power in the beta rhythm, and an increase in the broadband power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g001">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">2A&amp;J</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Crone1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller2">[9]</xref>. The spatial distribution of the sites showing beta rhythm change is relatively large, covering pre- and post-central cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, the broadband spectral power changes are localized to specific sites representing the digit that is moved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g001">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
        <p>To illustrate the temporal and spatial specificity of the broadband power, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the spectral changes for two finger movements observed at two adjacent cortical sites. During thumb movement (top half) the PSD shows the increase in broadband power and decrease in beta rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The PSD can be naively decoupled using a variant of principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) to show how the powers in different frequency bands vary with respect to one another. The spectra during movement and rest are reconstructed without the 2<sup>nd</sup>–4<sup>th</sup> principal spectral components (PSCs) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. This reconstruction shows that during movement power increases across all frequencies, including low frequencies. Conversely, the spectrum reconstructed for only the 2<sup>nd</sup>–4<sup>th</sup> PSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) shows that the change is specific to narrowband frequencies in the β-rhythm range. Thus, changes in the power spectrum of the ECoG potential can be understood as a combination of a band-limited (rhythmic) component and a broadband (non-rhythmic) component.</p>
        <p>The time-course of spectral changes relative to thumb movement are shown in averages aligned with movement onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2D–G</xref>). A time-varying estimate of broadband spectral change was obtained by projecting the PSD at each time point onto the coefficient vector of the first principal spectral component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g003">3</xref>). The resulting pattern of broadband change over time approximates the time-varying amplitude function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the power-law relationship: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Broadband spectral change was isolated from the continuous dynamic spectrum, applied to only the 1st PSC, and averaged with respect to the first thumb movement following each cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Note that broadband power begins to change 50–100 ms prior to the onset of thumb movement. The average time-varying PSD, scaled as a percentage of mean power at each frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) shows the inverse relation of beta and high frequency power as a function of time relative to movement. Note that the change in β activity begins prior to the broadband spectral change. The drop in beta power with movement is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2F</xref>. The specificity of this site for thumb movements is shown by the greater increase in broadband power compared to movement of other digits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). In contrast, all digit movements were associated with a similar drop in beta power relative to rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2H,I</xref>). The lower half of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g002">Figure 2</xref> documents similar results for movement of the index finger in recordings from an adjacent site, separated by 1 cm from the thumb site.</p>
        <p>While the first movement in a set is sometimes associated with the largest amount of cortical change, this was not reliably the case, likely because movement frequency varied across epochs within and across subjects. Emerging work, using primary motor and somatosensory microECoG arrays during supervised pacing of repeated finger movement, shows that cortical activity attenuation with repeated movement is robust, and is a function of movement rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Hermes1">[32]</xref>.</p>

        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g003">Figure 3</xref> demonstrates that, when examined across the cortex, broadband spectral changes during movement are highly localized and somatotopically distinct for different fingers (A). In contrast, changes in beta power are broadly distributed and essentially the same for any finger movement. The instantaneous broadband power shows a clear temporal correlation with individual finger movements (C); note that the broadband trace obtained at each site correlates with the position of only one of the fingers and not the others. The spatial overlap of changes for particular pairs of digits is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. Overlap (B) is quantified by the proportion of sites showing similar changes with movement of the two digits (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), and is larger for the beta power (near complete overlap) than broadband power (largely distinct spatially). Similar overlap patterns are documented for the other eight subjects as well (D). Broadband spectral changes show largely non-overlapping representation between digits, while the distribution of change in the beta rhythm overlaps almost completely in all cases. Digit-specific electrodes were typically 1 cm from one another (also see Figures S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Coupling between low frequency rhythm phase and amplitude of broadband spectral change</title>
        <p>The relation between the instantaneous broadband power and phase of ECoG signal at different frequencies is documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g004">Figure 4</xref>. The analysis is based on recordings obtained during finger movements and rest (B). The dynamic broadband (C) obtained from the raw ECoG potential (D) shows distinct fluctuations related to index finger movement. The ECoG can be filtered with a simple wavelet to obtain a temporally varying estimate of the narrow band-passed signal, as shown for the 3 Hz rhythm in (E). The phase of this signal can be used to extract associated snippets of the broadband signal (H) and obtain a phase-triggered average of the broadband power (I). Repeating this process for all frequencies between 1 and 50 Hz yields the “Phase coupling palette” shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g004">Figure 4J</xref>, which documents the phase relation for all frequencies. The predominant pattern for the range 10–30 Hz shows a tendency for brain activity, as measured by broadband power, to increase just prior to the surface-negative phase (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and decrease just prior to the surface positive phase (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the beta rhythm. This modulation of broadband amplitude by rhythm phase is also called “rhythmic entrainment”, “phase-amplitude coupling”, and “nested oscillation” in this and other manuscripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller4">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Canolty1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Penny1">[34]</xref>. It is important to note that, for broadband coupling to low frequency rhythm, the portions of the broadband that contribute to the coupling measurement will be those with amplitudes that can track the low frequency phase (e.g. for a 10 Hz rhythm, only the portions of broadband &gt;20 Hz will be contributing to the coupling measure between the two).</p>

        <p>To quantify how rhythmic entrainment with the beta band is modulated with behavior, we summarized the main relationship with a “coupling vector”, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g005">Figure 5</xref>. We captured the phase-amplitude coupling across a range of low-β band frequencies (12–20 Hz), rather than at a single frequency, using the Hilbert transform. As described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, a “coupling vector” in the complex plane (D) succinctly represents the magnitude, Z<sub>mod</sub>, and phase, φ<sub>c</sub>, of the broadband activity phase-coupling with the 12–20 Hz rhythm (C). This coupling vector can be derived for individual behavioral epochs consisting of specific finger movements and rest (E–G), as well as for single trials within epochs (H–J). The global distribution of trial-to-trial coupling vectors across all movement epochs (H) reveals heterogeneous coupling for the different behaviors. A mean coupling vector (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) may be obtained for each behavior, and its statistical significance computed as illustrated in (I) for rest and in (J) for thumb movement. The statistics are obtained from the distribution of the projections of individual movement or rest epoch coupling vectors onto the mean vector direction (e.g., upper right histogram in [I]). The Z<sub>mod</sub> values for the different behaviors (L) show significantly larger entrainment for rest than for any of the movements. A similar difference is seen for the values of the motor rhythm amplitudes (K). The fact that this cortical site (A) is specific for thumb representation is shown by the larger Z-score of log broadband values (M).</p>

The average coupling for each region is summarized by the histograms for the θ and β frequency bands (7C &amp; E, resp.).

        <title>The conditional relationship between β-amplitude, β-modulation of broadband, and behavior</title>
        <p>The structural relationship between modulation of local activity by the β-rhythm and β-amplitude is not simple. In subjects 1–9 (finger movement task), there are 484 electrode sites after rejecting ones with artifacts or epileptic activity. Of these, 297 sites exhibit significant coupling during rest epochs (e.g. “Z<sub>mod</sub> sites” = 297, p&lt;0.01, uncorrected for multiple comparisons - 4.8 expected by chance). There is a significant decrease in the 12–20 Hz range amplitude in 142 (e.g. “β sites” = 142, p&lt;0.01, uncorrected for multiple comparisons - 4.8 expected by chance). Amongst these 142, 98 (69%) are sites with significant coupling during rest (e.g. “β sites” that are “Z<sub>mod</sub> sites” = 98). Therefore, these two types of measurement are not spatially correlated in a simple way.</p>
        <p>These experiments pose the issue of the basic relationship (if any) between the amplitude of the β-rhythm (12–20 Hz) and the coincident strength of rhythmic modulation. On an epoch-by-epoch basis, β amplitude can be compared parametrically with strength of modulation via a standard Pearson correlation. One hypothesis would be that the degree of rhythmic modulation is determined by a simple relationship with the β-amplitude: with a task-related decrease in β-amplitude, there would be a corresponding decrease in modulation. In order to test this, the epoch-by-epoch correlation was measured between β-amplitude and (projected) modulation strength, performed independently for movement epochs and rest epochs (Illustrated in Figure S17 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>). During rest epochs, there is a clear correlation in many cases. Of the 297 “Z<sub>mod</sub> sites”, there was significant correlation at 71 sites (p&lt;0.01, uncorrected for multiple comparisons - 3.0 expected by chance; 2 were negatively correlated). Of the 142 “β sites”, 33 showed significant epoch-by-epoch correlation during rest periods (p&lt;0.01, uncorrected for multiple comparisons - 1.4 expected by chance; 3 were negatively correlated). Not surprisingly, 30 of the 33 were at “β sites” that were also “Z<sub>mod</sub> sites”. Only 3 of the 341 sites that were either “Z<sub>mod</sub> sites” or “β sites” showed significant correlation during movement epochs (p&lt;0.01, uncorrected for multiple comparisons - 3.4 expected by chance, none were at sites which were correlated for rest epochs).</p>
        <p>The conclusions that can be drawn from this are that 1) there is a parametric relationship between β amplitude and broadband modulation by β phase in the resting cortex at many loci, and 2) this relationship is not seen in the active cortex. One interpretation of this is that during movement, these cortical areas are in a lower amplitude regime of β, and that in this lower power regime, the 12–20 Hz amplitude attributed to the rhythmic activity is small compared to the stochastic 1/f portion of the signal, so any parametric relationship disappears (see illustration in Figure S17 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>). This interpretation is supported by the epoch-to-epoch correlation seen during rest at the 30 of 71 sites with modulation during rest that also show movement-associated shift in β amplitude. However, that interpretation does not account for the 41 of 71 sites with a significant correlation, selectively during rest and not movement, but without a significant movement-associated shift in β-amplitude.</p>

        <title>Phase coherence</title>
        <p>To determine the extent to which β-rhythms at neighboring cortical sites are generated by common versus independent sources, we examined the pairwise phase coherence of the β rhythms across sites. In contrast to many studies in which the absolute value of phase coherence (or mean-squared phase coherence) is used, we retain the phase-shift between sites. If there is a strong, coherent rhythm in a large fraction of the electrode array, then the act of re-referencing will introduce false phase coherence, π out of phase. When this occurs, it can be revealed by examining the phase of the phase coherence. Additionally, different motifs in phase coherence, such as those which would be found with propagating waves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Reimer1">[25]</xref>, would be revealed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g011">Figure 11A</xref> plots the phase coherence relative to a chosen reference site at which broadband power was maximally correlated with movement of the index finger. The figure shows that phase coherence of the β rhythm is spatially distributed over neighboring sites. Furthermore, by projecting each phase coherence value (i.e. each phase coherence vector in the complex plane) onto the strongest phase coherence value (i.e. a reference vector) we can measure the extent to which phases are aligned among the coherent sites. This projection procedure facilitates the identification of variation in phase across different cortical sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g011">Figure 11B&amp;C</xref>). The spatially coherent rhythms are gyrally delineated along the pre-central and post-central gyri. The phase coherence measure either decreases in magnitude, or “skips” in phase as sulci are crossed. Thus the phase coherence motifs for the motor rhythm with M1 obey sulcal boundaries. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g011">Figures 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g012">12</xref>, and in Figure S19 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>, this is true across all 9 subjects.

        <title>Entrainment of broadband power on phase of underlying rhythm</title>
        <p>The major new findings of this study show that cortical population activity, as reflected in broadband power of the ECoG potentials, is significantly modulated with the phase of different rhythmic elements of the cortical surface potential. These relations are comprehensively documented in the “phase-coupling palettes” from various sites on the lateral cortex, which show how the average value of the instantaneous broadband power varies with the phase of a wide range of low frequency rhythms. Notably, local cortical activity, revealed by broadband spectral change, is entrained on the 12–20 Hz beta rhythm in peri-central cortex. When second-to-second changes in entrainment are examined during epochs of movement and rest, there is selective decrease in rhythmic entrainment during movement epochs.</p>
        <p>The phase-coupling palettes show particularly strong phase modulation at sites in sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g006">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g008">8</xref>). Consistent with this evidence, neural recordings in monkeys show that action potentials of many motor cortex neurons tend to be entrained at particular phases of local rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Murthy1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Murthy2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Reimer1">[25]</xref>.

            <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Modulation of broadband amplitude by underlying rhythm can be thought of as population-averaged spike-field interaction. (<bold>B</bold>) “Released cortex” demonstrates a small amount of broadband power coupling to underlying rhythm phase, and the underlying spiking from pyramidal neurons is high in rate and only weakly coupled to the underlying rhythm phase. (<bold>C</bold>) “Suppressed cortex” demonstrates less broadband power but with higher modulation by the underlying rhythm, while underlying single unit spiking is low in rate but tightly coupled to the rhythm phase. (<bold>D</bold>) A simplified heuristic for how rhythms might influence cortical computation: During active computation, pyramidal neurons (PN) engage in asynchronous activity, where mutual excitation has a sophisticated spatio-temporal pattern. Averaged across the population, the ECoG signal shows broadband increase, with negligible beta. (<bold>E</bold>) During resting state, cortical neurons, via synchronized interneuron (IN) input, are entrained with the beta rhythm, which also involves extracortical circuits symbolized by the input from a synchronizing neuron in the thalamus (TN). The modulation of local activity with rhythms is revealed in the ECoG by significant broadband modulation with the phase of low frequency rhythms.

        <p>The features in phase-coupling palettes for dorsal pre- and post-central cortex are clearly more robust than those for other cortical sites, including ventral Rolandic cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g006">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g008">8</xref>). Nevertheless, the palettes averaged over each of these other regions also show similar features during baseline fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g006">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g007">7</xref>). Interestingly the palettes for the lateral brain surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g008">8A</xref>) do not show coupling in the gamma range (30–50 Hz), although phase coupling in this range has been observed with ECoG in the occipital cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller6">[30]</xref>. Also, unlike findings in occipital cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Osipova1">[35]</xref>, the α (∼8–12 Hz) range most often appears to reflect a transition between discrete motifs in beta coupling and theta coupling, rather than representing a distinct entity in and of itself. Put plainly, we do not see ubiquitous entrainment by an 8–12 Hz “mu” rhythm as might have been anticipated by EEG studies. It is worth noting that it is not necessary to extract a broadband time series in order to see these effects. The coupling motifs can also be seen, albeit less clearly, if broadband spectral change is approximated by band-pass filtered high frequency power as is common in other studies (e.g. with “high gamma” power, illustrated in Figures S3, S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Canolty1">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The neural mechanism underlying the continuous “diagonal bands” visible in the lower frequencies (δ, θ, α bands) of the phase-coupling palettes may reflect a process in which broadband power is elevated at a fixed time lag relative to the peak of a periodic voltage trace (illustrated in Figure S14 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>). This fixed time lag would then appear as a continuously varying phase lag (diagonal band) across different low-frequency ranges. The periodicity of the voltage determines the base frequency, and the “slopes” of the bands (vertical or angled) are a function of the degree to which both the potential and the broadband are sinusoidal versus a periodic “pulse train”. In other cases, the superposition of multiple rhythms, each of which has a different preferred phase, may give the appearance of a sloped palette (seen clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g008">Figure 8 E, G, and J</xref>).</p>

Comparable somatotopic organization does not exist for the beta rhythm (12–20 Hz), which is broadly distributed, spanning both the pre- and post-central gyri, and is ubiquitously reduced during movements of any of the fingers. This movement-associated decrease in the β-rhythm exhibits near-complete spatial overlap for different finger movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g001">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g008">8O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g009">9B/E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g010">10B/G</xref>).

        <title>The functional mechanisms underlying beta activity</title>
        <p>For over a century, cortical rhythms recorded from the brain surface have been known to fluctuate with behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Beck1">[38]</xref>. However, the physiological origin of these rhythms is poorly understood, and their possible role in brain function remains a topic of debate. The inverse relation between motor activity (including imagery) and the appearance of beta activity in Rolandic cortex has led to the hypothesis that beta, like alpha, is a “resting rhythm”, passively emerging when neural circuits are not actively engaged in computations that desynchronize their activity. In this paradigm, the frequency of this rhythm is determined by the resonant properties of the neural networks that are recruited; these circuits would also include subcortical networks. An alternative and potentially exciting hypothesis proposes that beta rhythms reflect an active mechanism that synchronizes neural populations and suppresses cortical information processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller6">[30]</xref>. In such a “suppression through synchronization” hypothesis the input from a “synchronizing locus” in thalamus projects diffusely to an inhibitory population of neurons that, in concert, inhibit pyramidal neurons at their basal dendrites and soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g013">Figure 13</xref>). While our data are potentially consistent with either of these hypotheses, we detail this “suppression through synchronization” hypothesis for further consideration.</p>

        <title>A “suppression through synchronization” hypothesis</title>
        <p>What might be the function of these beta rhythms in motor cortex? Perhaps they play a dynamically suppressive role as follows: feed-forward inputs to the large, computationally important pyramidal neurons of motor cortex (Betz cells) are mediated via synaptic inputs to superficial layers, although their somas are in layer 5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Shepherd1">[39]</xref>. The complex dendritic computations performed as these superficial inputs combine to influence the somatic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Weiler1">[40]</xref>, could be interrupted by peri-somatic inhibitory inputs that are rhythmically synchronized across the entire population of Betz cells. Consistent with this idea, selective blockade of inhibitory GABA-A receptors and gap-junctions in layer 5/6 abolishes the beta rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Yamawaki1">[41]</xref>, and selective GABA agonism with benzodiazepines selectively potentiates the amplitude of the peri-central beta rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Jensen1">[42]</xref>.</p>
        <p>At the macroscale of the ECoG, the motor beta-rhythm is spatially synchronized in peri-central cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g011">Figures 11</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g012">12</xref>), where it entrains neural population activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g007">Figure 7</xref>), and transiently releases this entrainment during movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Such synchronous population activity would prevent the generation of the complex spatio-temporal patterns of activity among pyramidal neurons that are necessary for the execution and coordination of movement. When present, the rhythm keeps the motor cortex in an idling, dynamically “ready”, state – the timings of cortico-cortical distal dendritic inputs are entrained on the population-synchronized GABAeric proximal interneuron input. This scenario is consistent with the fact that broadband measurement of averaged activity from the 10<sup>5</sup> neurons beneath each electrode is entrained with beta-rhythm of the ECoG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g013">Figure 13</xref>). In this way, weak but synchronized interneuron input might keep motor cortical activity in a “dynamically suppressed” state, where neural activity can quickly transition into an active “processing state” when the synchronized input stops.</p>

        <title>The circuit that regulates the synchronization of motor cortex</title>
        <p>The inputs of the synchronizing locus to motor cortex likely arise in thalamus as part of a well described cortical to sub-cortical feedback circuit (see illustration in Figure S15 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>). Motor cortex, in addition to its brainstem and spinal projections, also projects to striatum and sub-thalamic nucleus, and these loci follow “direct” and “indirect” pathways to the globus pallidus (pars interna), which, in turn, project to nuclei in the thalamus. The thalamic nuclei close a recurrent feedback loop by sending diffuse input to motor cortex in layer 5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Shepherd1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Cassidy1">[43]</xref>. Supporting this is the observation that the beta rhythm is present at each step of the circuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Crone1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Cassidy1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Mallet1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Kilavik1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Paradiso1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Courtemanche1">[47]</xref>, and physiologic or pharmacologic intervention at the level of the cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Gaynor1">[48]</xref>, striatum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Costa1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-McCarthy1">[50]</xref>, pallidum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Kuhn1">[51]</xref>, subthalamic nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-deSolages1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Kuhn2">[53]</xref>, or thalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-VanDerWerf1">[54]</xref>, disrupts the beta rhythm throughout the circuit. Furthermore, disruptions in this circuit are correlated with specific motor disease, and interruptions of these loci provide specific therapeutic improvement in the disease with concomitant decrease in beta rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Kuhn2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Chen1">[55]</xref>.</p>
        <p>But what generates and drives the beta frequency throughout this circuit? Perhaps the timescale of the beta rhythm reflects the loop time it takes for impulses to travel around the cortical-subcortical circuit, although this is challenged by fact that there are various loop times for different circuits, and also because the resonant frequency of distributed cortical oscillations is not determined by conduction times between synchronized sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Engel1">[56]</xref>. Alternatively, the beta rhythm may be a “cortically local” product of the recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons within motor cortex. This latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that carbachol applied to rodent cortical slices generates beta-range rhythms in the absence of the rest of the motor circuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Kilb1">[57]</xref>. However, there is also evidence against the local-generation hypothesis. When the motor representation of both sides of the body is re-mapped to one hemisphere following perinatal stroke (and the beta rhythm is already present at this stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Milh1">[58]</xref>), the laterality of the beta rhythm is preserved in adulthood, despite the fact that the local representation is not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller8">[59]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Finally, an intermediate hypothesis is that the beta oscillation is generated by a pacemaker at a specific subcortical site, but then appears throughout the circuit due to propagation from this site. Using modeling and carbachol injection into the intact rodent, Kopell et al provide evidence that the striatum is the origin of these rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-McCarthy1">[50]</xref>. Lesion studies in the cat suggest that the ventral tegmentum generates the beta rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Montaron1">[60]</xref>. While our study does not directly address the origin of the beta rhythm to distinguish between these hypotheses, our findings do document the functional importance of the beta rhythm as reflected by robust modulation of population-scale broadband activity with beta rhythm phase.</p>

        <title>Bridging scales of measurement</title>
        <p>Our ECoG recordings help explain why the beta rhythm is so robust in electroencephalographic recordings from outside the head; namely, it is spatially synchronous across the pre- and post-central gyri, and so this coherent beta rhythm is augmented with respect to background by spatial averaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g011">Figure 11</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g012">12</xref>). Furthermore, the different states of the surface rhythm may represent switching between stable modes observed in ongoing surface oscillations. In contrast with the beta rhythm, the broadband spectral change that accompanies movement is asynchronous at the local level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller5">[28]</xref> and unrelated across cortical regions, so it is washed out in spatial averaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Krusienski1">[61]</xref> (see heuristic illustration and back-of-the-envelope calculation in Figure S11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>). The observation that administration of a benzodiazepine GABA agonist produces an increase in magnetoencephalographic peri-central beta range power <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Jensen1">[42]</xref> is potentially consistent with our hypothesis that synchronized thalamic projections to peri-central inhibitory interneuron populations suppress motor cortex. This would suggest that the muscle relaxant effect of benzodiazepines might be mediated by augmenting the synchronizing effect underlying the beta rhythm and suppressing corticospinal output to somatic motor neurons. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the BOLD signal reflects temporally-averaged cortical metabolism of all types (excitatory, inhibitory, glial, etc). A prior study with fMRI and ECoG during simple hand movement showed that the most robust fMRI changes are parametrically associated with 65–95 Hz ECoG power (an approximation of our broadband), specifically in pre-central motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Hermes2">[62]</xref>. Outside of this central hand region, a weaker and more spatially diffuse BOLD change was found that correlated with beta-range changes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Our findings in this study may provide an explanation for this: the pre-central BOLD peak reflects the shift in local cortical activity in the engaged brain area, while the surrounding BOLD change reflects the increased metabolism in adjacent disengaged but also disinhibited cortex.</p>

        <title>The functional importance of the beta rhythm</title>
        <p>This study establishes that motor cortical populations are phase-modulated with the beta rhythm, both during long rest periods (minutes of fixation) as well as during brief (1–2 seconds) rest periods within a dynamic finger movement task. During periods of movement, the amplitude of the beta rhythm decreases and this phase-modulation is also diminished. We believe that this reflects a robust mechanism that is fundamental to brain function. Similar experiments in patients with motor disease might reveal how perturbations to this mechanism disrupt cortical function. A “suppression through synchronization” hypothesis explains how diffuse cortical inputs originating from a thalamic locus might allow large regions of the cortex to be functionally suppressed. The expected utility of selectively engaging brain areas results in the dynamic reallocation of metabolic resources, and mediates the coordinated engagement of task-relevant and task irrelevant brain circuits.</p>

          <p>To condense the range of frequencies composing a given rhythm into one measure, the Hilbert transform was applied (as described above), with frequency range chosen based upon inspection of the palette (see Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>).

Z<sub>mod</sub> is the tmagnitude of coupling between phase of the rhythm and the log-broadband amplitude (because we z-score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Z<sub>mod</sub> is roughly the amount of variation in the z-score that correlates with the phase of the rhythm concerned), and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the preferred phase of this interaction. This can be calculated on a trial-by-trial basis, breaking up the data into smaller epochs of continuous movement or reset and calculating a coupling vector for each epoch. To assess the distribution of coupling for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> trials of a given type, one cannot simply compare the contribution of trial <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the distribution of coupling values as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> because if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is not reproducible from trial-to-trial, then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can have a large value even on trials in which the preferred coupling phase is opposite to that of the majority of other trials in the distribution. In other words, the fact that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be nonnegative would strongly bias the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values so that the mean of the distribution can be significantly greater than zero even when there would be no underlying coupling of consistent phase. For this reason, the projected distribution of values <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is used, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the preferred phase of the mean coupling vector for trials of type <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The quantities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be negative or positive and can therefore have a distribution significantly overlapping with zero (indicating an absence of reliable phase modulation).

We demonstrate the significance of these measures using error bars that represent 3 times the standard error of the mean. This method has an advantage over the “large-time shift” bootstrapping approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Penny1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Canolty2">[77]</xref> because the data may be segregated into smaller time trials, and statistics may be computed by comparing the distribution of values for trials of one behavioral state versus trials of a different behavioral state. It may also be used to compare discontinuous trials of one type (or all trials concatenated) versus 0. This allows us to examine significant shifts in phase amplitude coupling during different trial types (where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = “rest”, vs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = “thumb movement”, etc.) and also to assess the significance of each independently versus zero.

          <p>The pair-wise phase coherence relative to a reference “seed” site was examined.

For measures of types <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denoting electrode), the simple dot product between the two gives a “true” overlap, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, that can be compared to surrogate distributions for quantification of magnitude and significance. The spatial overlap metric is the true overlap divided by the maximum possible overlap: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, re-sorted in ascending order. To estimate the significance of this overlap using resampling, the electrode labels are then randomly scrambled (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and a surrogate overlap is obtained <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This is done 10<sup>6</sup> times. A p-value for the significance of the overlap is the percentage of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that are greater than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (or the percentage that are less in the case that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002655.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>

            <p>In some subjects (#2,5,6) spatial somatotopy of finger movements could not be adequately documented because these had only partial coverage of the precentral gyrus.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The findings in this manuscript do not represent an independent verification of the somatotopic phenomenon reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller7">[31]</xref> because some of the recordings were from the same subjects.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Cortical rendering quality was intrinsically tied to the quality of clinical MRI. Because clinical scans often had very poor slice thickness, reconstructions in some cases were quite coarse. However, they were all sufficient to identify sulcal boundaries and appropriately segregate electrode position by anatomy.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The analysis metrics used in this paper to measure the influence of rhythms on local cortical activity in ECoG were chosen because they are felt to be intuitive and they integrate with our larger body of work. However, as demonstrated in the Figures S3, S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>, the finding of coupling of the motor rhythm to local cortical activity would also be revealed by methods that others have used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Canolty1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Penny1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Osipova1">[35]</xref>.</p>

            <p>There are likely multiple β-rhythms, and many have distinguished between a “β1” and “β2”. The 12–20 Hz β-rhythm range empirically chosen for this study based upon palettes from pre-central electrodes with robust movement-associated broadband changes (see Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>) lies in the low end of the classic 12–30 Hz β-range. Also, it is close in frequency range to the classically described “μ” rhythm found in peri-central EEG.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Spectral elements that contribute to tracking the lower frequency rhythm phase will be different for the rhythm at each frequency – so, for a 30 Hz rhythm, only the spectral elements above ∼60 Hz can reasonably track the phase at 30 Hz.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>During movement, the β-rhythm amplitude decreases in peri-central cortex, as does the magnitude of the modulation. This might lead the reader to the conclusion that the two are completely correlated, but this is not the case. This is most easily illustrated empirically – when the spatial distribution of the two is examined side-by-side (as is done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g008">Figures 8</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g010">10</xref>), they plainly have different patterns of change with movement, and the shift in the <italic>influence of the β-rhythm</italic> is clearly different than the shift in the <italic>amplitude of the β-rhythm</italic>.</p>

          <list-item>
            <p>The choice of common average reference (CAR) was used because of the generally large size of the electrode arrays, and it provides a generic approach. One could, however, have regressed out the mean (to account for varying contact impedances), used pair-wise re-referencing (which would diminish the measurement of phase-synchronized rhythms), or used a single electrode as reference (which would individually confound every channel, but in a predictable way). The conclusions of this paper are robust against such choices. The consequence for CAR in phase coherence estimate was addressed by keeping the complex value of the phase coherence, projecting all phase coherence measures onto the phase lag at the site of greatest phase coherence, and examining the resulting cortical plots for spatial clustering.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The method does not “self-consistently” produce modulation. When applied to a random-walk timeseries, no modulation is observed (see Figure S13 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>). When applied to synthetic data where broadband signal is embedded modulated by the phase of a coincident rhythm, results similar to our measurements emerge (see Figure S12 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>). As Kramer et. al. note <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Kramer1">[79]</xref>, sharp edges or severely asymmetric waveform can produce self consistent modulation; they propose four criteria in their manuscript to assess for this, and our data satisfy all four criteria.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Broadband spectral changes and β-rhythm changes happen both in of the presence or absence of a movement-onset event related potential (ERP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Miller2">[9]</xref>.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>We are spatially under-sampling. For every 1 cm<sup>2</sup> of cortex, there is only ∼0.04 cm<sup>2</sup> of platinum exposed to the cortical surface, and, within this area, there are known to be multiple functionally-specific sub-domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002655-Kellis1">[80]</xref>.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Although shifts in preferred phase of β-phase to broadband modulation are important and possibly significant, we choose to defer them to other studies. Any statistical measure comparing them will likely have built in assumptions - e.g. to generate a distribution of phases from each condition to compare, one will have to weight each phase measure by the degree of importance.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>One interesting question is: what is the relationship, spatially, between the frequencies that modulate broadband activity in an area, and the power of the signal in that frequency range? Might there be (as one reviewer posed, and with which we agree) a difference between the spatial distribution in the amplitude of a rhythm and the regional sensitivity of local cortical activity to the influence of rhythmic input? In other words, is broadband modulation by a rhythm (Z<sub>mod</sub>) in a given area simply explained by the amplitude of that rhythm? The partial spatial overlap between the changes in rhythm amplitude and the changes in phase-modulation data suggest that such an effect may be present in a subset of the electrodes we measured, but is not the general rule. In practice, this is a technically difficult question to resolve, because the brain rhythms are superimposed on a 1/f background and the amplitude of a band-pass filtered frequency range reflects this superposition. In principle, one could fit the 1/f background at high frequencies, subtract it, and then correlate the residual “rhythm amplitude” with Z<sub>mod</sub> at that site. The correlation across electrodes would then potentially address this question. However, the fact that the estimate of phase of a rhythm can be affected by the relative ratio of “residual rhythm amplitude” to superimposed 1/f power within a frequency range, sets up a potentially circular and self-consistent set of analyses. Our present study instead compares the spatial distribution of shift in rhythm amplitude to Z<sub>mod</sub>, where no simple spatial relationship is found. We defer direct comparison of extracted rhythm amplitude to Z<sub>mod</sub> to future studies which would be explicitly constructed to address this circular issue, as this would involve analysis techniques that are significantly more esoteric than those employed here. For example, one such approach might be to extract rhythm amplitude using recursive subtraction of an oscillation with assumptions about phase stability - one would first have to rigorously show that the rhythm was sinusoidal in shape.</p>

        <caption>
          <p>The supplement, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002655.s001">Text S1</xref>, contains a variety of material that is designed to provide further insight for the more curious reader, further methodology for the more technical reader, and further evidence for the more skeptical reader. It illustrates the interaction between broadband amplitude and rhythm phase using multiple alternate and independent methods of calculation (fures S1, S3, S4). The averaged coupling palette from finger-specific electrodes across many subjects shows that the most robust entrainment in pre-central motor cortex is between 12–20 Hz (Figure S2). The somatotopic representation of individual fingers, and illustrative timecourses (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g003">Figure 3</xref>) are shown in detail for 6 additional subjects (Figures S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10). The close correlation between somatotopic representation in broadband and electrocortical stimulation (ECS) is shown for the patients where ECS was performed (Figures S7, S8, S9, S10). We show simple schematics for the relationship between EEG and ECoG for the synchronous (rhythmic and ERP) and asynchronous aspects of the cortical surface potential; a back-of-the-envelope calculation is used to measure the relative contributions of these phenomena (Figure S11). We implement simple heuristics to generate simulated timeseries which have phase entrainment of a 1/f - type signal on an imposed oscillation, illustrating how our analysis techniques extract these phenomena in the expected way (Figure S12). We then apply our analysis techniques to the negative control case of simple 1/f-type colored noise to show that the methods do not self-consistently report phase entrainment (Figure S13). A simple heuristic illustration shows how, and why, the “diagonal bands” in some coupling palettes might exist, in the case where broadband power is elevated at a fixed time lag relative to the peak of a periodic voltage trace (Figure S14). We then illustrate a candidate simple large-scale mechanism for the generation of rhythmic phase-entrainment on local cortical activity (Figure S15). For those readers interested in the preferred phase of entrainment as a function of anatomic region, this is explicitly quantified in Figure S16. The conditional parametric relationship between broadband amplitude, beta (β, 12–20 Hz) amplitude, and magnitude of phase entrainment is further explored and illustrated in Figure S17. Finally, the supplemental material highlights and illustrates phase coherence in further detail, beginning with a simplified illustration of pair-wise phase coherence relative to a reference “seed” site, in Figure S18. Adding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g011">Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002655-g012">12</xref>, the pair-wise 12–20 Hz coherence between all sites, and a peri-central index-finger specific site, is shown for the remainder of the subjects, in Figure S19. Figure S20 contrasts the different (yet both gyrally constrained) spatial distributions of coherence for the theta (4–8 Hz) and beta (12–20 Hz) frequency ranges.</p>
