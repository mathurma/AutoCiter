        <p>Forkhead box p3 (Foxp3)-expressing regulatory T cells are key mediators of peripheral tolerance suppressing undesirable immune responses. Ectopic expression of Foxp3 confers regulatory T cell phenotype to conventional T cells, lending itself to therapeutic use in the prevention of autoimmunity and transplant rejection. Here, we show that adoptive transfer of polyclonal, wild-type T cells transduced with an inducible form of Foxp3 (iFoxp3) can be used to suppress immune responses on demand. In contrast to Foxp3-transduced cells, iFoxp3-transduced cells home “correctly” into secondary lymphoid organs, where they expand and participate in immune responses. Upon induction of iFoxp3, the cells assume regulatory T cell phenotype and start to suppress the response they initially partook in without causing systemic immunosuppression. We used this approach to suppress collagen-induced arthritis, in which conventional Foxp3-transduced cells failed to show any effect. This provides us with a generally applicable strategy to specifically halt immune responses on demand without prior knowledge of the antigens involved.</p>

          <p>Autoimmune diseases come in many diverse forms—such as rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease—yet all share the same underlying cause, the launch of a detrimental immune response. In healthy individuals, a specialized immune cell type called regulatory T cells prevents these undesirable immune responses. Here, we present a strategy to suppress undesirable immune responses using genetically modified proinflammatory T cells that participate in these inappropriate immune responses until they are activated with a drug. At this point, the genetic modification causes them to change their behavior to that of regulatory T cells. Using a mouse model, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to stop undesirable immune responses on demand with minimal intervention.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases ranging from rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis to inflammatory bowel disease—as diverse as they might appear—all have the same underlying problem: the launch of an undesirable immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b001">1</xref>]. Equally similar are the current approaches to treat these conditions, which are generally based on drugs that lead to systemic immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b002">2</xref>]. Thus, the induction of specific tolerance is seen as the “Holy Grail” of therapeutic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b003">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>The discovery that the immune system evolved regulatory T (T<sub>R</sub>) cells to stop undesirable immune responses, such as autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b004">4</xref>] and the rejection of the fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b007">7</xref>], is of obvious therapeutic promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b008">8</xref>]. Indeed, T<sub>R</sub> cells have already been shown to be capable of fulfilling such functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b009">9</xref>]. However, the translation of experimental findings into actual therapeutic approaches is hampered by a variety of problems. Under experimental conditions, antigen-specific tolerance can be achieved by using T<sub>R</sub> cells from TCR-transgenic animals or by ex vivo expansion of antigen-specific T<sub>R</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b011">11</xref>]. However, it is difficult to imagine how a TCR transgenic approach can be translated into a generally applicable therapy. The antigen-specific ex vivo expansion of T<sub>R</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b011">11</xref>], or in vivo conversion of helper T cells (T<sub>H</sub>) into T<sub>R</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b012">12</xref>], is more feasible, albeit still problematic. They not only rely on the knowledge of, or at least access to the antigens involved in the pathological immune response, but are also time consuming and complicated when applied in a therapeutic context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b013">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>There are also conceptual problems. The lack or malfunction of T<sub>R</sub> cells is suspected to be at the root of many autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b015">15</xref>]. In these cases, it might be impossible to obtain and expand functional, antigen-specific T<sub>R</sub> cells, as they may not exist in the host in the first place. In principle, this problem can be circumvented by the conversion of conventional T cells into T<sub>R</sub> cells, either by TGF-ß–mediated induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b018">18</xref>] or ectopic expression of the lineage factor Forkhead box p3 (Foxp3) (NP_473380) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b021">21</xref>]. However, without enriching antigen-specific “induced T<sub>R</sub> cells,” this is likely to be of limited benefit and may lead to systemic immune-suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b024">24</xref>]. A further problem with TGF-ß–induced T<sub>R</sub> cells is that their phenotype seems to be unstable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b026">26</xref>], although the presence of retinoic acid appears to stabilize the conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b028">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>Here, we present a strategy to suppress undesirable immune responses in an antigen-specific fashion without prior knowledge of the antigens involved. We accomplish this by adoptive transfer of a small number of polyclonal T<sub>H</sub> cells transduced with a genetically engineered, inducible form of Foxp3 (iFoxp3). CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> cells transduced with iFoxp3 (T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3) initially retain their “proinflammatory” phenotype. They home “correctly” into the secondary lymphoid organs and partake in immune responses. Once the T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells have expanded in an antigen-specific fashion, they can be converted to T<sub>R</sub> cell phenotype on demand by inducing iFoxp3, thereby stopping the immune response they partook in.</p>

        <title>Failure of Polyclonal T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 Cells to Suppress Collagen-Induced Arthritis</title>
        <p>Encouraged by the initial finding that polyclonal CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> T cells transduced with Foxp3 (T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3) can prevent and treat colitis in lymphopenic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b029">29</xref>], we, like others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b031">31</xref>], set out to test whether this can be used as a general strategy to prevent and treat autoimmune diseases. To test this hypothesis, we used collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), which is a well-established murine model of human rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b032">32</xref>]. To obtain T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells, we transduced CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> T cells with a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vector carrying a Foxp3-IRES-GFP cassette (m6pg[Foxp3]) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). We immunized male DBA/1 mice with chicken collagen type II (cII) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). In this model, we observe the first clinical symptoms of arthritis on day 19 after immunization, with the average clinical score reaching a plateau around day 35. Injection of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells 1 d prior to immunization did not have any significant impact on the outcome of the arthritis. It neither delayed the time of disease onset, nor did it alter disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The failure of polyclonal T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells to show any beneficial effect on the outcome of CIA under these experimental conditions is in agreement with the findings of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b031">31</xref>] and led us to reassess the approach per se. Therefore, we decided to examine the homing, expansion, and participation of T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells in immune responses.</p>

        <title>Altered Homing Behavior of T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 Cells</title>
        <p>The decision whether to launch or suppress an immune response is made within the secondary lymphoid organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b033">33</xref>]. This makes “correct” homing of the adoptively transferred cells an essential requirement for cytotherapy, as otherwise their participation in immune responses might be severely limited.</p>
        <p>We therefore compared the homing of T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells to that of m6pg[control]-transduced CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> T (T<sub>H</sub>::control) cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) and freshly isolated CFSE-labeled CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> (T<sub>H</sub>) cells or CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> (T<sub>R</sub>) cells. A total of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were injected into wild-type Balb/c mice. After 48 h, we isolated the lymphocytes from the various tissues and analyzed them by flow cytometry. The transferred cells were identified based on either their green fluorescent protein (GFP) coexpression or CFSE label. T<sub>H</sub>::control cells, like T<sub>R</sub> and T<sub>H</sub> cells, could be detected at comparable frequencies in blood, and inguinal and iliac lymph nodes, as well as the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g001">1</xref>C). In contrast, the homing of T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells into the lymph nodes appeared to be defective and their homing into the spleen slightly impaired. Instead, a large number of these cells could be found in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The data suggest that ectopic expression of Foxp3 substantially altered the homing behavior of the transduced cells.</p>

        <title>Foxp3-Mediated Regulation of CD62L</title>
        <p>The absence of T cells from the peripheral lymph nodes is one of the key features of CD62L-deficient (<italic>sell<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b034">34</xref>]. CD62L (<sc>l</sc>-selectin) plays a key role in the homing of lymphocytes into these tissues by allowing their attachment to high endothelial venules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b035">35</xref>]. Activation of T cells leads to endoproteolytic shedding of CD62L from the surface of the cells, involving the matrix-metalloprotease Adam17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b036">36</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether the altered homing behavior of T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells is due to Foxp3-mediated effects on the surface expression of CD62L.</p>
        <p>We found that the majority of freshly isolated T<sub>H</sub> and T<sub>R</sub> cells are CD62L<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g002">2</xref>B). Activation of the cells for 72 h with anti-CD3/anti-CD28/IL-2 led to a down-regulation of CD62L surface expression, which was more marked in T<sub>R</sub> than T<sub>H</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g002">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg002">S2</xref>A). To assess whether this is due to an increase in Adam17 activity in T<sub>R</sub> cells, we activated freshly isolated splenocytes with PMA and compared the surface expression of CD62L on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> (T<sub>R</sub>) and Foxp3<sup>−</sup> (T<sub>H</sub>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The rate of CD62L shedding appeared to be very similar for both cell types and could be completely blocked by the Adam17 inhibitor TAPI-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). This suggests that an additional Adam17-independent mechanism in T<sub>R</sub> cells is responsible for the difference in CD62L surface expression observed upon activation of T<sub>R</sub> and T<sub>H</sub> cells.</p>

        <p>To further investigate this, we examined CD62L expression in T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells. We transduced CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> cells with either m6p8[Foxp3] or m6p8[control]. The cells carrying the vector were identified based on their coexpression of ratCD8α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Whereas T<sub>H</sub>::control cells exhibited some down-regulation of surface CD62L upon activation with anti-CD3/IL-2, this was substantially more marked in T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g002">2</xref>F). For the first 24 h, TAPI-2 appeared to partially inhibit the loss of surface CD62L on T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells, but it did not halt the steady decrease in surface CD62L over an extended period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). The CD62L down-regulation in T<sub>H</sub>::control cells was accompanied by an accumulation of soluble CD62L in the culture supernatant. This was not the case for T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g002">Figure 2</xref>H), suggesting that in these cells, CD62L surface expression is regulated by a mechanism other than shedding. As Foxp3 is known to be a transcriptional regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b040">40</xref>], we investigated whether it affects CD62L transcription. The CD62L mRNA expression level was reduced in both T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 and T<sub>H</sub>::control cells compared to freshly isolated T<sub>H</sub> and T<sub>R</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g002">Figure 2</xref>I). However, the level of CD62L transcript was 7.2-fold lower in T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells than in T<sub>H</sub>::control cells. The data suggest that upon activation of the cells, CD62L is further down-regulated on a transcriptional level by Foxp3.</p>
        <p>It is noteworthy that retroviral transduction requires at least some degree of activation of the cell to allow for transgene integration. In this context, the expression of Foxp3 led to a very marked and sustained down-regulation of surface CD62L expression. This is likely to be a major contributor to the altered homing behavior of T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells. Although the down-regulation of CD62L upon activation is similarly more evident in thymically derived T<sub>R</sub> cells than T<sub>H</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg002">S2</xref>B), albeit less marked than in T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g002">Figure 2</xref>I), it does not appear to interfere with the cells ability to home into peripheral lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg002">Figure S2</xref>C).</p>

        <title>iFoxp3—an Engineered Inducible Lineage Factor</title>
        <p>The “incorrect” homing of polyclonal T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells might well contribute to their lack of showing any beneficial effect in CIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b031">31</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and other animal models of autoimmune disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b011">11</xref>]. However, one might question whether our initial approach had any merit in the first place, since the transfer of polyclonal T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells will only marginally increase the number of suppressive cells that recognize a particular antigen. Indeed, treatment with polyclonal T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells more or less mimics polyclonal T<sub>R</sub> cell therapy, which in contrast to approaches using antigen-specific T<sub>R</sub> cells, appears to be of limited benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b041">41</xref>].</p>
        <p>We decided to develop an alternative strategy, allowing us to convert the lineage commitment of conventional T<sub>H</sub> cells to that of T<sub>R</sub> cells after their antigen-specific expansion in vivo. To achieve this, we created an inducible Foxp3 (iFoxp3) that is constitutively expressed, but only becomes functionally active upon induction. Polyclonal, primary T<sub>H</sub> cells transduced with iFoxp3 (T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells) should act like conventional T cells, retain their homing behavior, participate in immune responses, and expand in an antigen-specific fashion. This antigen-specific in vivo expansion of T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells should allow us to specifically switch off immune responses on demand by inducing iFoxp3.</p>
        <p>We fused a modified estrogen receptor (ERT2) to the C-terminal end of Foxp3 and cloned it into the m6p vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g003">3</xref>B). ERT2 only responds to tamoxifen and its metabolites such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), but not estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b042">42</xref>]. In the absence of induction, iFoxp3 is retained in the cytoplasm and kept inactive by heat shock proteins binding to the ERT2 part of the fusion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b043">43</xref>]. To confirm the inducible nature of iFoxp3, we transduced CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> cells with m6p carrying a GFP-tagged iFoxp3 (m6p8[GFP-iFoxp3]). This allowed us to assess the induction of iFoxp3 based on the translocation of the fusion protein from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. We induced iFoxp3 in vitro by exposure to 4-OHT for 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) or in vivo after adoptive transfer of the transduced cells into wild-type Balb/c mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). In either case, iFoxp3 translocated into the nucleus in about 60%–70% of the transduced cells at the time of microscopic analysis, confirming its inducible nature.</p>

        <title>Induction of Suppressor Function in T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 Cells</title>
        <p>A key requirement for our strategy is that iFoxp3 can be used to induce T<sub>R</sub> cell phenotype on demand. We therefore tested T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells for hallmark features of T<sub>R</sub> cells such as sustained up-regulation of CD25, in vitro anergy to anti-CD3-stimulation, and suppression of target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b004">4</xref>] before and after induction of iFoxp3. Whereas T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells were anergic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g003">Figure 3</xref>E), suppressed the proliferation of cocultured CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g003">Figure 3</xref>F), and exhibited up-regulation of CD25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g003">Figure 3</xref>G), T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells did so only after induction of iFoxp3 with 4-OHT.

        <p>From our observations with T<sub>H</sub>::control cells, we already knew that transduction per se did not appear to alter the homing behavior of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g001">1</xref>C). Nevertheless, we wanted to verify that noninduced iFoxp3 neither changes the expression of CD62L nor significantly alters the homing behavior of the T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells. We found that in the absence of iFoxp3 induction, CD62L expression remained unchanged in T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 compared to T<sub>H</sub>::control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g003">Figure 3</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g003">3</xref>I).

        <title>Antigen-Specific In Vivo Expansion of T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 Cells</title>
        <p>To assess whether T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 and T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells expand upon antigenic challenge in vivo, we transferred transduced cells prepared from DO11.10xSCID/Balb/c mice that expressed an ovalbumin (ova)-specific TCR, into wild-type Balb/c mice. We transferred 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells containing a mixture of 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells and 3 × 10<sup>4</sup> nontransduced cells (transduction efficiency of 40%) with the transduced population being clearly identifiable based on the coexpression of GFP. T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells expanded upon immunization with ova in CFA by a factor of 12 in the draining lymph nodes and by a factor of 37.5 in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells only exhibited a very modest expansion, by a factor of 3.6 in the lymph nodes and 4.4 in the spleen. This could have been due to the T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells suppressing the ova-specific immune response and thereby impeding their own expansion. However, the levels of ova-specific antibodies in the serum were the same, independent of whether the mice had received T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 or T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells, suggesting this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

        <p>Next, we investigated whether the in vivo expanded ova-specific T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells can be induced to suppress the very same immune response they partook in. We isolated splenocytes from these mice and exposed them to ova ex vivo.

        <p>To assess to what degree polyclonal T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells participate in an immune response, we transferred 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> wild-type T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells into wild-type Balb/c mice. A week after immunization with ova, we analyzed the lymphocytes from various tissues by flow cytometry. Whereas the number of T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells recovered from the blood, iliac lymph nodes, liver, and spleen did not appear to change upon antigenic challenge, we observed a marked increase in the inguinal lymph nodes of the immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). This indicates that some of the T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells expanded in the draining lymph nodes (subcutaneous [s.c.] immunization into the flanks). However, the number of endogenous cells in the inguinal lymph nodes increased equally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g004">Figure 4</xref>E), suggesting that both populations expand to a similar degree with their ratio remaining constant.</p>

        <title>Specificity of the Suppression</title>
        <p>To assess whether the conversion of T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells to T<sub>R</sub> cell phenotype causes systemic immunosuppression, we compared “ex vivo recall reactions” to the antigen used prior to the induction of iFoxp3 (cII) to that of an unrelated antigen (ova) injected after induction. The collagen-specific T cell proliferation measured for mice in which iFoxp3 had been induced was significantly lower than that of mice that had received no transfer of cells, albeit still higher than that of naive mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). As we did not add tamoxifen to the ex vivo culture, this most likely reflects a lower number of cII-specific proinflammatory T cells in the animals that had received T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells and tamoxifen induction, rather than a mere ex vivo suppressive effect of T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells. Remarkably, we could not detect any difference in the T cell proliferation upon exposure to ova irrespective of whether the mice had received treatment or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). This suggests that the suppression only affects immune responses in which the T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells have had the opportunity to participate prior to induction of iFoxp3. Indeed, we were able to detect T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells in the inflamed paw of cII-immunized mice, suggesting that in the absence of induction these cells can contribute to the inflammation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg006">Figure S6</xref>) However, once converted, the T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells, despite still being present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg007">Figure S7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg007">S7</xref>B), seem to have lost the capacity to suppress further unrelated immunological challenges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). This suggests that the conversion of T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells by induction of iFoxp3 does not lead to a systemic immunosuppression.</p>

        <p>Having shown that induced T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells do not suppress further unrelated immune responses postinduction, we wanted to investigate the suppressive activity of T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells in a context in which both cII and ova are present prior to induction. We transferred 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> polyclonal T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells into wild-type DBA/1 mice 1 d before immunization with a 1:1 mixture of ova and cII in CFA. We induced iFoxp3 on day 15 after immunization and assessed the antigen-induced proliferation of splenocytes prepared from these mice on day 28. The recall proliferation against ova and cII were comparable. Equally similar was the reduction in proliferation in the cases in which iFoxp3 was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). In combination, these results suggest that this approach enables selective suppression without affecting further unrelated immune responses after induction of iFoxp3.</p>

        <p>It is noteworthy that we were able to detect T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells 52 d after their transfer, independent of the level of arthritis and whether the mice had received tamoxifen treatment or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g007">7</xref>B). An analysis of various tissues revealed that T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells in blood were only marginally reduced between day 17 and day 52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g007">7</xref>D), and could readily be detected in the auxiliary lymph nodes and spleen. Although this is likely to be of advantage with regard to actively suppressing immune responses, it poses the question whether continuous tamoxifen presence is required. Due to the long half-life of tamoxifen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b048">48</xref>], a direct assessment of this in vivo is not feasible. However, in in vitro suppression assays, T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells had completely lost their suppressive activity 72 h after withdrawal of 4-OHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g007">Figure 7</xref>E). To perform these experiments, we had to compensate for a marked reduction in the number of viable T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells that could be recovered under these conditions. To formally address the effect of the withdrawal of 4-OHT on T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cell viability, we exposed the cells to 4-OHT for 48 h from the point of transduction and then cultured them for a further 48 h in the absence of 4-OHT. The number of viable cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Withdrawal of 4-OHT had no effect on T<sub>H</sub>::control cells, but led to a marked decrease in the number of T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g007">Figure 7</xref>F to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g007">7</xref>H). This suggests, that once induced, T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells die upon tamoxifen withdrawal, but it remains unclear how this translates into an in vivo context. Indeed, it might be desirable to incorporate a suicide gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b049">49</xref>] into the retroviral vector as this allows the removal of the transduced cells if desired (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060276-sg008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we have presented an approach that allows us to stop undesirable immune responses without prior knowledge of the antigens involved. T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells participate in immune responses as conventional T<sub>H</sub> cells until iFoxp3 is induced. At this point, they change their phenotype from that of proinflammatory T cells to that of regulatory T cells and suppress the response they partook in.</p>
      <p>Ectopic expression of Foxp3 in conventional T cells leads to their conversion into cells with T<sub>R</sub>-like phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b021">21</xref>]. It was demonstrated early on that these T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells, like T<sub>R</sub> cells, could suppress the development of colitis in lymphopenic hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b029">29</xref>]. However, it was noted that in this context, the effectiveness of both polyclonal T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells and T<sub>R</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b051">51</xref>] might be due to the regulation of homeostatic expansion of the cotransferred, proinflammatory cells, rather than to a true antigen-specific suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b052">52</xref>]. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of polyclonal T<sub>R</sub> cells will only marginally increase the number of suppressive cells that recognize a particular antigen. Indeed, the use of polyclonal T<sub>R</sub> cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b022">22</xref>] or T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b023">23</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060276-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) have been of limited efficacy, unless the immune pathology was caused by an absence of functional T<sub>R</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b053">53</xref>] or the experiments were performed in lymphopenic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b011">11</xref>]. The restrictions imposed by the low frequency of antigen-specific T<sub>R</sub> or T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells in polyclonal populations can be circumvented by ex vivo expansion of antigen-specific T<sub>R</sub> cells and TCR transgenic T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b041">41</xref>]. Both approaches have been successfully exploited in mouse models to treat diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b055">55</xref>], arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b031">31</xref>], and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b056">56</xref>], as well as being used for the induction of transplantation tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b058">58</xref>]. Whereas TCR transgenic T cells are an invaluable research tool to improve our understanding of the regulation of immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b060">60</xref>], it is unclear to what degree they can be used in a therapeutic context. Ex vivo expansion of antigen-specific T<sub>R</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b011">11</xref>], or in vivo conversion of T<sub>H</sub> into T<sub>R</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b012">12</xref>], promises to be more applicable. However, these approaches are technically challenging, time consuming, and most importantly, require knowledge of or access to the antigens involved in the immune response to be suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b013">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our study of T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells revealed a further problem. Whereas T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells appear to adopt the characteristics of T<sub>R</sub> cells in vitro, we found their homing to be altered from that of endogenous T<sub>R</sub> and T<sub>H</sub> cells. This hinders the T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells from mimicking the homing behavior of endogenous T<sub>R</sub> cells, which has been shown to be important for their suppressive function in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b063">63</xref>]. Those T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells that fail to home to the secondary lymphoid organs might not receive the required antigen priming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b063">63</xref>] and thus fail to expand like endogenous T<sub>R</sub> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b064">64</xref>]. This might explain the difference in the efficacy of approaches that use polyclonal Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells and those that use antigen-selected or TCR transgenic Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells. The latter might circumvent the need for an antigen-specific expansion in vivo by ensuring that there are sufficient numbers of antigen-specific cells from the onset.</p>
      <p>The activation-induced, Foxp3-mediated down-regulation of CD62L might well be a key factor in the exclusion of T<sub>H</sub>::Foxp3 cells from the peripheral lymph nodes since T cells from CD62L-deficient mice exhibit a similar phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b035">35</xref>]. Further, it has been shown that CD62L<sup>hi</sup> polyclonal T<sub>R</sub> cells have a more potent protective effect in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b065">65</xref>]. However, we cannot exclude that ectopic expression of Foxp3 also alters the expression of other homing receptors. Indeed, we found that the activation-induced down-regulation of CD62L in thymically derived T<sub>R</sub> and T<sub>H</sub> cells was not sufficient to exclude them from the peripheral lymph nodes.</p>
      <p>Here, we present an approach that addresses these problems by transducing polyclonal, conventional T cells with a retroviral vector encoding a genetically engineered inducible form of Foxp3. T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells retain their proinflammatory character and the ability to home to the lymph nodes. Those T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells that recognize an antigen appear to participate in the immune response and expand. This in vivo expansion of antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells circumvents the need for an ex vivo expansion and does not rely on any knowledge of the antigens involved. Upon induction of iFoxp3, the in vivo expanded, antigen-specific T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells assume a T<sub>R</sub> cell-like phenotype and suppress the undesirable response they initially partook in. We were able to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by specifically halting CIA in a mouse model. Importantly, T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cell-mediated suppression appears to be restricted to the specific response, which is ongoing at the time of induction of iFoxp3. Those T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells that do not already participate in an immune response at the time of induction lose the capacity to suppress further unrelated immune responses despite still being present. Although we cannot exclude that other factors play a role, it appears that the antigen-specific expansion of the T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells prior to induction is an integral part of the observed nonsystemic suppression. In a therapeutic context, it might be desirable to limit the exposure to tamoxifen to minimize possible side effects. Although it appears that most T<sub>H</sub>::iFoxp3 cells die upon withdrawal of tamoxifen, those that do survive lose their suppressive activity. To avoid possible deleterious effects, these “revertant” cells can be removed based on the incorporation of a suicide gene into the retroviral vector used for the delivery of iFoxp3.</p>
      <p>We believe that this strategy of induced conversion of T<sub>H</sub> cells into cells with a T<sub>R</sub> cell-like phenotype using iFoxp3 is generally applicable and will allow us to stop a variety of undesirable immune responses.</p>

Alternatively, iFoxp3 was induced once the mice had reached a score of 3 (day 0) by i.p. injections with 100 μl of tamoxifen (in a 10:1 mixture of sunflower oil:ethanol [10 μg/μl tamoxifen]) on days 1, 2, 9, and 16.</p>

        <p>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> T cells were purified from 6–12-wk-old female SCIDxDO11.10 mice and transduced with Foxp3 or iFoxp3 as described above. Balb/c females received i.v. 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> of a 2:3 ratio of transduced and nontransduced cells. Three days later, each mouse was immunized s.c. with either ova (Sigma) in CFA (50 μg/mouse) or just with CFA. The mice were sacrificed and analyzed 8 d after immunization. For ova-specific suppression assays, total splenocytes were prepared as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060276-b066">66</xref>], resuspended in complete medium, and then plated into round-bottom 96-well plates (density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well). iFoxp3 was induced by adding 50 nM 4-OHT (Sigma). Ova was added to the cells 16 h after induction. After 60 h, the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine (Amersham), collected at 72 h with a Filtermate Harvester (Packard), and analyzed with a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
