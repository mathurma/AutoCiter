<p>Mouse fetal mammary cells display greater regenerative activity than do adult mammary cells when stimulated to proliferate in a new system that supports the production of transplantable mammary stem cells <italic>ex vivo</italic>.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Many normal adult tissues contain rare stem cells with extensive self-maintaining regenerative potential. During development, the stem cells of the hematopoietic and neural systems undergo intrinsically specified changes in their self-renewal potential. In the mouse, mammary stem cells with transplantable regenerative activity are first detectable a few days before birth. They share some phenotypic properties with their adult counterparts but are enriched in a subpopulation that displays a distinct gene expression profile. Here we show that fetal mammary epithelial cells have a greater direct and inducible growth potential than their adult counterparts. The latter feature is revealed in a novel culture system that enables large numbers of <italic>in vitro</italic> clonogenic progenitors as well as mammary stem cells with serially transplantable activity to be produced within 7 days from single fetal or adult input cells. We further show that these responses are highly dependent on novel factors produced by fibroblasts. These findings provide new avenues for elucidating mechanisms that regulate normal mammary epithelial stem cell properties at the single-cell level, how these change during development, and how their perturbation may contribute to transformation.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many adult tissues are maintained by a rare subset of undifferentiated stem cells that can self-renew and give rise to specialized daughter cells that have a more limited regenerative ability. The recent identification of cells in the fetal and adult mammary gland that display the properties of stem cells provides a foundation for investigating their self-renewal and differentiation control. We now show that these stem cell properties can be elicited from single mouse mammary cells placed in 3D cultures if novel factors produced by fibroblasts are present. Moreover, a comparison of the clonal outputs of fetal and adult mammary cells in this <italic>in vitro</italic> system shows that the fetal mammary cells have superior regenerative activity relative to their adult counterparts. The ability to activate and quantify the regenerative capacity of single mouse mammary epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> sets the stage for further investigations of the timing and mechanisms that alter their stem cell properties during development, the potential relevance of these events to other normal epithelial tissues, and how these processes might be involved in the genesis of breast cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The regenerative properties of individual cells within the mammary gland were first indicated by the retrovirally marked clonal outgrowths shown to develop from mouse mammary tissue fragments transplanted into the cleared mammary fat pad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Deome1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Kordon1">[2]</xref>. More recently, we and others have demonstrated that individual cells isolated from the adult mammary gland are capable of regenerating a complete new gland when transplanted in the same type of assay and most of these are confined to a distinct subset of cells with basal (CD24<sup>+</sup>/EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>+</sup>) features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Stingl1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Shehata1">[5]</xref>. The regenerated mammary glands thus produced contain the same spectrum of cell types that are present in the adult mammary gland. These include progenitor cells (referred to as colony-forming cells, or CFCs) with a luminal (CD24<sup>++</sup>/EpCAM<sup>++</sup>CD49f<sup>low/−</sup>) phenotype and other cells with either a luminal or basal phenotype that are considered to be differentiated because they lack proliferative ability. In addition, the structures produced <italic>in vivo</italic> contain cells with the same transplantable regenerative activity as the original parental input cell. The latter are thus referred to operationally as mammary repopulating units, or MRUs, based on the method used to detect them. MRUs can be quantified by limiting dilution analysis (LDA) of their ability to regenerate large branched glandular structures when transplanted into the cleared fat pad of prepubertal mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Stingl1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Shackleton1">[4]</xref>. This MRU assay has now been widely used to investigate mechanisms that regulate normal adult mammary stem cell differentiation and growth control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Visvader1">[6]</xref>, as well as the effects of various mutations that contribute to the genesis of breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Lindeman1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies of the development of the mouse mammary gland have shown that the first elements appear on embryonic day 11 (E11) as placodes of specified ectoderm. The cells in these placodes then expand in number and invaginate into the underlying mesenchyme to develop primordial branched structures that, just before birth, are found to contain cells detectable as individually transplantable MRUs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Spike1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Cowin1">[9]</xref>. Interestingly, these MRUs, like their adult counterparts, belong to a subset of cells that are CD49f<sup>+</sup> but also have phenotypic and transcriptional differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Spike1">[8]</xref>. However, whether fetal and adult MRUs have different growth and self-renewal properties, as described for stem cell populations in some other tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Harrison1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Kruger1">[11]</xref>, is not known. The higher self-renewal activity characteristic of these fetal tissues has been attributed to intrinsic molecular mechanisms operating within the stem cells, themselves, albeit in response to environmental cues, and include transcriptional regulators such as <italic>Sox17</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Kim1">[12]</xref> and Lin28 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Yuan1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Copley1">[14]</xref> in hematopoietic stem cells, and <italic>Hmga2</italic> in neural <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Nishino1">[15]</xref> and hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Copley1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>The investigation of such differences requires the availability of a robust system in which the maximum self-renewal/regenerative activity of the stem cells of interest can be elicited and quantified. Such a system has not yet been developed and validated for mammary epithelial stem cells, although a variety of candidate elements have been reported. One of these is Matrigel, a laminin-rich tumor extract that has been widely used to support mammary epithelial cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Stingl1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Spike1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Chen1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Zeng1">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, adult basal mammary cells have been found to display increased clonogenicity in Matrigel in the presence of Wnt3a and also retain some MRU activity when serially passaged under these conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Zeng1">[18]</xref>. There is also evidence that the number of MRUs detected in transplants of both basal cells and luminal cells of mouse origin is enhanced when Matrigel is injected together with the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Shehata1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Vaillant1">[19]</xref>. Some latent activity or enhanced detection of MRUs in basal and even luminal mammary cells has also been revealed in cells exposed to a Rho-associated kinase inhibitor (ROCKi) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Guo1">[20]</xref>. We now report the superior ability of fetal mammary epithelial cells to produce MRUs and CFCs as compared to their adult counterparts when they are activated in a Matrigel-based clonal culture system that requires distinct, but as yet unidentified factors produced by fibroblasts.</p>

<title>The Phenotype But Not the Ratio of MRUs to CFCs in the Mammary Epithelium Changes Between E18.5 and Adulthood</title>
<p>In a first series of experiments, we determined the number and phenotype of MRUs and CFCs in the mammary rudiment present in the E18.5 female C57Bl/6 (B6) embryo. E18.5 was chosen because it is the earliest time during the development of the mammary gland when MRUs are reproducibly detected in numbers sufficient for their characterization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Spike1">[8]</xref>. In these experiments we also found that antibody staining of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> and CD49f<sup>+</sup> cells in enzymatically dissociated viable single-cell suspensions of dissected E18.5 fetal glands [from which the associated endothelial (CD31<sup>+</sup>) and blood (CD45<sup>+</sup> and Ter119<sup>+</sup>) cells had been excluded] revealed the presence of three major subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These consisted of an EpCAM<sup>++</sup>CD49f<sup>+</sup> fraction and an EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>+</sup> fraction of the fetal mammary epithelial cells and an EpCAM<sup>−</sup> fraction that is variably CD49f<sup>+</sup> and contains the associated stromal cells. Assessment of the MRU and CFC content of the fetal mammary gland showed that the majority of both of these functionally defined primitive cell types are present in the EpCAM<sup>++</sup>CD49f<sup>+</sup> subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g002">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s003">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s004">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s005">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s006">S4</xref>), as determined using optimized assay conditions for both of these (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–D). Interestingly, the fetal gland appears to lack entirely the large population of EpCAM<sup>++</sup>CD49f<sup>low/−</sup> luminal cells present in the mammary gland of 8–12-wk-old adult virgin female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, the majority of the CD49f<sup>+</sup> cells in the fetal gland are EpCAM<sup>++</sup>, whereas the majority of the CD49f<sup>+</sup> cells in the adult gland are EpCAM<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g001">Figure 1B and D</xref>).</p>

<p>Calculation of MRU and CFC frequencies as a function of the number of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells tested allows comparisons to be made that relate exclusively to the gland itself or derived populations, even when unseparated fractions are being evaluated. Such a comparison of the MRU and CFC frequencies and content in the E18.5 fetal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) mammary gland showed that the ratio of their numbers relative to one another is already set at approximately the same value as that characteristic of the adult virgin gland, although the total size of these populations as well as the size of the gland as a whole (total number of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells) undergo an expansion of ∼100-fold over the intervening 4-mo period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Fibroblast-Containing Matrigel Cultures Support the Production of Large Numbers of CFCs and MRUs From Both Fetal and Adult Mammary Cells</title>
<p>To compare the regenerative properties of fetal and adult mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), we first undertook a preliminary survey of culture conditions that would optimize the <italic>production</italic> over a period of 7 d of adult CFCs measured in secondary 2D CFC assays. These experiments showed superior outputs of CFCs were obtained when cells were incubated in 3D Matrigel cultures as compared to 2D adherent CFC assay conditions (unpublished data). Additional experiments showed that reduced O<sub>2</sub> conditions had no effect on CFC <italic>production</italic>, regardless of the input cell source (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) and added ROCKi had a slight enhancing effect only in cultures initiated with adult luminal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Production of MRUs and CFCs in 7-d Matrigel cultures of adult and fetal mammary cells.</title>
<p>(A) General experimental design. Mammary cells were added to 50 µl of solidified Matrigel (±2.5×10<sup>4</sup> irradiated 3T3 fibroblasts) in 200 µl of medium and incubated for 7-d. Each well was then examined for the presence of one or more visible structures and the contents then fixed and stained or dissociated into a suspension of viable single cells to perform FACS, CFC, or MRU assays for comparison with corresponding starting (input) values. (B) CFC outputs from 7-d Matrigel cultures of unseparated adult mammary cells as a function of the input cell number (expressed as the number of input EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells) and the addition of irradiated fibroblasts. (C) CFC outputs from 7-d cultures of unseparated fetal cells as a function of the input cell number (expressed as the number of input EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells). Comparison of the corresponding relationship for adult cells (dotted line redrawn from (B)) shows a ∼5-fold higher CFC output by the fetal cells. (D) Comparison of increased numbers of MRUs obtained from 7-d Matrigel cultures of fetal and adult mammary cells (values determined by LDA as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s003">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s004">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s005">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s006">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s007">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s008">S6</xref> and expressed relative to 100 EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells).</p>

<p>Cultures initiated with varying inputs of unseparated adult cells showed a marked cell dose–response relationship with linearly increasing outputs of CFCs at cell input numbers below 10<sup>3</sup> EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells per 250 µl. But cultures initiated with more than 5×10<sup>3</sup> EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells became inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, we found that the addition of irradiated 3T3 cells to cultures initiated with low numbers of adult EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells greatly enhanced the number of CFCs produced in the 7-d Matrigel cultures (∼1,000-fold). Fetal mammary cells placed in the same culture conditions showed a similar input cell dose–dependent increase in CFC output, but much higher CFC outputs were obtained (∼50- to 100-fold) from the same number of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> input cells as compared to their adult counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We then assessed the ability of this culture system to support the production of MRUs. When nonsaturating numbers of input fetal or adult mammary cells were used to initiate the cultures, MRU numbers were also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s007">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s008">S6</xref>). Moreover, the output of MRUs from the same number of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells was again higher (∼4-fold) for the fetal as compared to adult cells.</p>
<p>These findings indicate the ability of fibroblast-containing Matrigel cultures to support the generation within 7 d of expanded populations of MRUs and CFCs and show that the output of both these cell types is greater for fetal mammary epithelial cells than for their adult counterparts.</p>

<title>3T3 Cells Enhancement of CFC and MRU Production in Matrigel Cultures Involves Novel Factors</title>
<p>Experiments using a transwell system suggested that the enhancing effect of the added 3T3 cells is mediated, at least in part, by soluble factors (unpublished data).

However, the activity in the CM could not be replaced by the addition of various reported single “niche” elements, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) tested at concentrations previously found to stimulate mammary cells or other cell types (16 ng/ml bFGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-AsselinLabat1">[21]</xref>, 16 ng/ml CSF-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Rosenbauer1">[22]</xref>, and 40 ng/ml HGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Gastaldi1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Niranjan1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001630-g004">Figure 4A and C</xref>).

<p>The proportion of cultures initiated with a single fetal or adult basal cell that contained CFCs was very similar to the proportion that contained a visible structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001630-t001">Table 1</xref>), consistent with the likelihood that all of the CFCs detected were present in these clonally derived structures.

<p>There are four major findings emanating from these studies.

Second, we show that the <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of latent regenerative activity is dependent on as yet undefined factors produced by fibroblasts that do not signal through the Wnt pathway, although this does not exclude the possibility of a co-operative role with Wnt signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Zeng1">[18]</xref>. Thirdly, we demonstrate a strong association of this cellular response with the formation of a visible structure in cultures initiated with single cells, although the magnitude of the response exhibited by individual cells varies over several orders of magnitude consistent with the operation of a self-renewal process that includes a stochastic component. Finally, we present the first and strong evidence of a marked superiority of the regenerative activity <italic>in vitro</italic> of primitive fetal as compared to adult mammary epithelial cells.</p>

<title>Activation of CFC and MRU Potential in the Progeny of Cells That Lack This Activity</title>
<p>A key assumption in demonstrating an induction or activation of growth and differentiation activities not initially detectable is that the conditions used to elicit this activity are not simply suboptimal. Therefore, an important component of the present studies was an examination of the conditions used to detect CFC and MRU to ensure these were optimized. Current methods widely used to detect mammary progenitors that form colonies within 7 d in low-density 2D cultures at high efficiency include the addition of irradiated 3T3 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Stingl1">[3]</xref>. We also adopted the use of a low O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Smalley1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Smalley2">[37]</xref> and the addition of ROCKi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Zhang1">[38]</xref>, which we confirmed to be important modifications that selectively enhance the detection of adult basal CFCs and have a comparable effect on fetal CFCs. Similarly, several recent studies have indicated that the frequency of both adult and fetal mammary cells detectable as MRUs is enhanced if Matrigel is co-injected with the test cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Spike1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Vaillant1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Guo1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Lim1">[39]</xref>. We confirmed this effect on both fetal and adult MRUs from C57Bl/6 mice and also implanted the recipients with E/P pellets to replicate the less consistently attainable enhancing effect of pregnancy on stimulating expansion of <italic>in vivo</italic> regenerated glands to enable their more facile visualization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-AsselinLabat1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Importantly, even using these optimized assay conditions, we found that the frequency of fetal and adult mammary cells that could generate progeny with CFC and/or MRU activity in fibroblast-containing Matrigel cultures was always higher than the frequency of freshly isolated cells with directly demonstrable CFC and/or MRU activity. Moreover, the “induction/activation” process thus inferred could be elicited from all EpCAM<sup>+</sup> subsets of cells examined and was true of fetal as well as adult mammary subsets. Particularly intriguing is the observation that MRUs could be derived from adult luminal progenitors, since these were previously thought to have irreversibly lost the bipotent, gland-generating activity of MRUs. However, it is interesting to note that evidence of persisting self-renewal of luminal cells has recently been reported based on the demonstrated presence in the adult of luminal cells derived from cells marked from postnatal day 1 by expression of the luminal marker, K8, although initiating the trace in cells expressing the basal marker, K14, in cells at E17 did result in the parallel detection of both basal and luminal phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-VanKeymeulen1">[40]</xref>. Similar studies using a different reporter, <italic>Axin2</italic>, have suggested that outcomes of such lineage-tracing experiments may vary depending on the type of gene used to “tag” different cell subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-vanAmerongen1">[41]</xref>, and have raised questions as to the unknown specificity in the embryo of lineage markers established in adult mammary epithelial tissue.</p>
<p>Adult ER<sup>+</sup> or ER<sup>−</sup> luminal cells were also recently shown to (re)activate bipotent features when “passaged” in collagen gels under the kidney capsule of transplanted mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Shehata1">[5]</xref>. The structures produced contained cells with basal features (p63 and smooth muscle actin) and MRU activity detected in subsequently injected cleared fat pads. Specific (HGF-mediated) activation of Met <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Gastaldi1">[23]</xref> and expression of Slug and Sox9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Guo1">[20]</xref> have also been found to confer MRU activity on luminal cells. Slug alone was active on CD61<sup>+</sup> luminal progenitors, whereas Slug in combination with Sox9 converted both CD61<sup>+</sup> and CD61<sup>−</sup> (differentiated luminal cells) into MRUs. Thus it is tempting to speculate that the acquisition of a cell surface luminal phenotype may sometimes precede the irreversible molecular “shut-down” of bipotency and self-renewal mechanisms that operate in MRUs that have a basal phenotype, and which can then be reactivated by factors produced by fibroblasts. Indeed evidence for such a model of alternative/latent stem cell populations in the skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Levy1">[42]</xref> and crypt of the small intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Tian1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-vanEs1">[44]</xref> that can be reactivated under defined conditions has recently been reported.</p>

<title>Fibroblasts Secrete Novel Factors Important for Stimulating the Acquisition of MRU and CFC Activity</title>
<p>Our finding that the addition of fibroblasts to Matrigel cultures strongly promotes the regenerative activity of cells in all subsets of adult and fetal mammary cells with MRU and CFC activity raises the important question as to the molecular mediators involved and the downstream mechanism by which the biological response is elicited. Recent reports have shown that induced Wnt signalling stimulates or is involved in qualitatively similar responses by developing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-vanAmerongen1">[41]</xref> or adult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Zeng1">[18]</xref> mammary or adult intestinal epithelial stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Sato1">[26]</xref>. Our CM experiments showed that some of the effects of the added 3T3 fibroblasts in our cultures could be elicited by soluble factors that they release, but this could not be mimicked by the addition of Wnt3a, bFGF, HGF, or CSF-1. On the other hand, a contribution of Wnt signaling cannot be entirely ruled out. A minor effect was in fact obtained using one of two Wnt inhibitors, although this latter experiment could also reflect nonspecific effects of the inhibitor or a role of Wnt signaling in the production or release of different factors that may mediate the effects obtained or cooperate with other factors. Additional experiments to elucidate all of these possibilities and define the numbers and type of factors involved as well as their mode of action will clearly be of great interest and of potential relevance to understanding mammary cell oncogenesis. The availability of a rapid and robust clonal assay to discriminate active agents as now described should greatly accelerate such future investigations.</p>

<title>Fetal Cells Have a Higher Induced Regenerative Activity Compared to Adult Cells</title>
<p>Our findings also provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of a greater induction of MRU activity in fetal as compared to adult mammary epithelial cells demonstrable at the single-cell level. A higher self-renewal activity of fetal stem cells has been well-documented in the hematopoietic system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Pawliuk1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Bowie1">[46]</xref> and in the neural system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Kruger1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Nishino1">[15]</xref>.

We predict that similar intrinsic programs may be operative in fetal mammary cells, given the increased potency in the regenerative behaviour of fetal cells compared with adult mammary cells as assessed under identical conditions. Reported evidence of differences in gene expression of fetal and adult mouse mammary cells that are enriched in MRUs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Spike1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Wansbury1">[48]</xref> are corroborated by our own analysis of the gene expression profiles of fetal (EpCAM<sup>++</sup>CD49f<sup>+</sup>) and adult basal (EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD49f<sup>+</sup>) B6 populations that are likely largely overlapping and shown here to be enriched in inducible as well as directly detectable MRUs. Indeed, our analyses show that ∼40% of the differentially expressed genes were also identified in the datasets analyzed by Spike et al. 2012 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001630-Spike1">[8]</xref>.

<p>To minimize multiple testing in comparing the data for the two sources of cells, we first eliminated probes that showed no/low activity in both adult basal and fetal cell datasets using a threshold for their elimination that was established by running a one-dimensional k-means algorithm (k = 3) on mean expression values for each probe in each dataset (three replicates each). The probes that fell in the lowest mean expression cluster in both datasets were thus identified and removed. This filtering left a total of 24,066 probes. Differential expression between the two datasets was then determined using the “lmFit” function in the R package “limma” and the Holm method to correct for the multiple testing methodology (R scripts available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001630.s012">Text S1</xref>).
