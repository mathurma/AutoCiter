			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The expansion of polyglutamine tracts in a variety of proteins causes devastating, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative diseases, including six forms of spinal cerebellar ataxia (SCA). Although a polyglutamine expansion encoded in a single allele of each of the responsible genes is sufficient for the onset of each disease, clinical observations suggest that interactions between these genes may affect disease progression. In a screen for modifiers of neurodegeneration due to SCA3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we isolated <italic>atx2</italic>, the fly ortholog of the human gene that causes a related ataxia, SCA2. We show that the normal activity of Ataxin-2 (Atx2) is critical for SCA3 degeneration and that Atx2 activity hastens the onset of nuclear inclusions associated with SCA3. These activities depend on a conserved protein interaction domain of Atx2, the PAM2 motif, which mediates binding of cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). We show here that PABP also influences SCA3-associated neurodegeneration. These studies indicate that the toxicity of one polyglutamine disease protein can be dramatically modulated by the normal activity of another. We propose that functional links between these genes are critical to disease severity and progression, such that therapeutics for one disease may be applicable to others.</p>

          <p>Six forms of spinal cerebellar ataxia (SCA1, −2, −3, −6, −7, and −17) are caused by dominant mutations in the respective genes. Patients suffering from these different forms of SCA have similar symptoms of progressive adult-onset neurodegeneration, and the same causative mutation, a CAG repeat expansion encoding an expanded run of polyglutamine. Although the affected proteins are distinct and share no sequence similarity beyond the polyglutamine domains, clinical and other observations hint at interactions between the genes that cause different forms of SCA. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model for human disease, we now detail an interaction between the genes associated with SCA3 and SCA2. We find that toxicity and neurodegeneration induced by pathogenic forms of SCA3 depend on the normal activity of the fly counterpart of the gene associated with SCA2, <italic>ataxin-2</italic>. This interaction depends on a conserved protein-interaction motif of Ataxin-2, and a protein that binds this motif, cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), also modulates SCA3 degeneration. These results suggest that the normal roles of Ataxin-2 and PABP, potentially to regulate the translation of select target mRNAs, are critical to SCA3 disease. These studies also highlight how a fly model can serve to enhance and extend intriguing clinical findings of the human disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The polyglutamine diseases are caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat encoding glutamine within the open reading frames of at least nine genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b001">1</xref>]. The disease state is thought to be due to a misfolded conformation of the pathogenic protein (termed an Ataxin in most forms of spinal cerebellar ataxia [SCAs]), which accumulates intracellularly in ubiquitinated inclusions along with chaperones and subunits of the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b002">2</xref>]. Among the SCAs, there is a remarkable overlap of symptoms, including progressive loss of gait and limb muscle coordination, with neurodegeneration in the cerebellum and often select brainstem nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b003">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>In addition to the shared mechanism of mutation and clinical phenotypes, there are intriguing hints of interactions between the polyglutamine genes that cause different SCAs. For example, relatively long CAG repeat lengths (still within the normal range) in the causative gene for SCA6 are correlated with an early age of onset of SCA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b004">4</xref>]. In addition, there are a number of such observations suggesting links between SCA2 and SCA3 diseases. The severity of facial muscle twitch in patients with SCA3 is correlated with the length of the CAG repeat in the normal alleles of the SCA2 gene <italic>ATXN2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b005">5</xref>]. Both SCA2 and SCA3 are unusual among the dominantly inherited ataxias in that they can manifest with parkinsonism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b006">6</xref>]. Finally, the normal Ataxin-2 (Atx2) protein can be detected in the pathogenic inclusions of SCA3 patients, and, likewise, normal Atx3 protein localizes to the inclusions formed in SCA2 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b007">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Several SCAs have been successfully modeled in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b010">10</xref>], an organism ideally suited to screen for genes that can modify the effects of protein toxicity and neurodegeneration. Moreover, up-regulation of <italic>atx2</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of the human gene that causes SCA2 disease, has been shown to enhance the toxicity of human disease forms of SCA1 and SCA3 in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b011">11</xref>]. Many genes that modify SCA1 toxicity in the fly, including <italic>atx2</italic>, have been shown to encode proteins that interact directly with pathogenic Atx1, and further, these proteins form an interaction network that includes Atx3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b012">12</xref>]. Taken together with the clinical data, this work suggests that interactions between CAG-containing genes may occur that influence disease.</p>
      <p>Despite these findings, the molecular activities of the Atx2 and Atx3 proteins do not indicate obvious functional links between these two particular CAG repeat genes. Atx2 is a cytoplasmic protein with an RNA-binding Lsm domain and a PAM2 motif that binds specifically to the PABC domain of proteins such as the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b014">14</xref>]. PABP and Atx2 directly interact in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b015">15</xref>]; and in flies and cultured cells, PABP and Atx2 also physically associate and co-sediment with polyribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b016">16</xref>]. In contrast, Atx3 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, contains ubiquitin interaction motifs and de-ubiquitination activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b020">20</xref>], and is normally neuroprotective, an activity that depends on a fully functional proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b021">21</xref>].</p>
      <p>In a screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for modifiers of degeneration induced by the human pathogenic protein causing SCA3, we identified <italic>atx2</italic>. Up-regulation of <italic>atx2</italic> synergistically enhanced SCA3 degeneration, and strikingly, we found that the endogenous activity of <italic>atx2</italic> modulates progression of neurodegeneration induced by pathogenic Atx3. Thus, toxicity of the polyglutamine disease protein Atx3 is critically dependent upon the normal activity of <italic>atx2</italic>, a second gene associated with polyglutamine disease in humans. These findings underscore the power of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system, and provide a foundation for further molecular insight into human genetic and clinical studies.</p>

        <p>Expression of pathogenic human Atx3 from the transgene <italic>UAS-SCA3trQ78</italic> in the developing eye under the control of the <italic>Gmr-Gal4</italic> driver causes degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b008">8</xref>]. We identified a transposon insertion in <italic>atx2</italic> conferring Gal4-dependent expression that greatly enhanced this toxicity (also reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b011">11</xref>]; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details of the screen). To verify that up-regulation of <italic>atx2</italic> was responsible for the effect, we coexpressed a <italic>UAS-Atx2</italic> transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b022">22</xref>] together with pathogenic Atx3 and confirmed strongly enhanced eye degeneration with loss of pigmentation and severe collapse of the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Coexpression of Atx2 with a nonpathogenic Atx3 construct bearing a normal-length polyglutamine repeat had no effect, such that the eyes looked the same as those expressing only Atx2, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g001">Figure 1</xref>C (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>Since Atx2 expression can cause developmental effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b022">22</xref>], we further examined neuronal integrity in an adult-onset situation using the driver <italic>Rhodopsin-1-Gal4</italic> (<italic>Rh1-Gal4</italic>), active selectively in differentiated photoreceptor neurons (PR). Adult flies expressing pathogenic Atx3, normal fly Atx2, or both were born with the normal complement of seven visible PR per unit eye, or ommatidium, as seen in pseudopupil preparations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Strong expression of SCA3trQ78 induced progressive degeneration, from seven PR declining to 3.7 ± 0.22 PR by 18 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">2</xref>E). Flies expressing only Atx2 also underwent retinal degeneration, but to a lesser extent (5.9 ± 0.13 PR at 18 d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">2</xref>F; and see below). Coexpression of Atx2 with Atx3, however, resulted in dramatically enhanced degeneration, such that even by 6 d, there were only 4.7 ± 0.15 PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) compared to the near-normal eyes resulting from expression of either protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">2</xref>B, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">2</xref>I). By 18 d, these flies had undergone nearly complete PR loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). At either 6 d or 18 d, PR loss due to coexpression was greater than the sum of the deficits caused by each transgene alone, indicating a synergistic interaction.</p>

        <p>These experiments were performed with a truncated version of pathogenic Atx3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b008">8</xref>]. In mouse models and in human SCA3 disease, the full-length pathogenic protein undergoes proteolysis, yielding a similarly sized fragment containing the polyglutamine tract that is thought to contribute to disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b023">23</xref>]. To determine whether Atx2 interacted with the intact as well as truncated Atx3 protein, we coexpressed Atx2 with full-length pathogenic Atx3 (SCA3Q84 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b021">21</xref>]). Under conditions where Atx2 or SCA3Q84 alone had mild effects (6.3 ± 0.16 PR and 6.97 ± 0.02 PR, respectively), coexpression of Atx2 with SCA3Q84 resulted in strikingly severe degeneration (2.9 ± 0.30 PR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>J). Thus, synergistic enhancement of degeneration by Atx2 was not limited to truncated versions of pathogenic Atx3, but extended to the full-length protein. To further determine the specificity of Atx2, we coexpressed Atx2 with two different Huntington disease transgenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b025">25</xref>]. Atx2 dramatically enhanced toxicity of an exon-1 Huntingtin (Htt) protein, but had no effect on toxicity of a longer Htt fragment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060029-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Cleavage of the Huntingtin protein contributes to disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b027">27</xref>]; Atx2 may play a role by selectively promoting toxicity of small Htt fragments.</p>
        <p>For some dominantly acting disease proteins, up-regulation of the normal version of the protein is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration clinically (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b028">28</xref>]) and in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b030">30</xref>]. We were therefore interested in the extent to which normal Atx2 could induce degeneration in the adult in the absence of developmental effects. The modest photoreceptor loss due to expression of Atx2 seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">2</xref>F was more striking with stronger expression of Atx2 from the transgenic line <italic>UAS-Atx2(s)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b022">22</xref>]; even 1-d flies had mild but significant loss of PR neurons (6.8 ± 0.06, vs. 7.0 ± 0.01 PR in flies expressing SCA3trQ78 only; <italic>p</italic> = 0.009) that progressed rapidly to 1.5 ± 0.08 PR by 18 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">2</xref>H). Therefore, up-regulation of normal Atx2 without a polyglutamine expansion causes severe, progressive degeneration.</p>

        <p>Immunoblot experiments showed similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g004">Figure 4</xref>J). At the 24-h time point, coexpression of normal Atx2 with pathogenic Atx3 caused the early appearance of SDS-insoluble Atx3 complexes that remain within the stacking gel (compare lanes 1 and 2), presumably reflecting protein accumulations that correlate with the early appearance of nuclear inclusions in cryosections. At the latter 4-d time point, insoluble Atx3 complexes were present in extracts from both groups (lanes 4 and 5). Differences in the inclusions and high molecular weight complexes were due to post-transcriptional causes, since Atx2 coexpression did not affect the transcript levels of the SCA3trQ78 transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g004">Figure 4</xref>I).</p>
        <p>Endogenous Atx2 protein was normally cytoplasmic throughout the retina. By 4 d, however, endogenous Atx2 was detectable in most Atx3-positive nuclear inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g004">Figures 4</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g004">4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060029-sg003">S3</xref>), reminiscent of the Atx2 localization to inclusions in SCA3 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b007">7</xref>]. Up-regulated Atx2 protein was not selectively recruited to inclusions, but remained punctate along the length of photoreceptor neurons; this pattern did not change over time or with coexpression of SCA3trQ78 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060029-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Notably, in both SCA2 patients and a SCA2 mouse model, pathogenic Atx2 with expanded polyglutamine is present in a similar cytoplasmic, punctate pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b033">33</xref>]. Whereas inclusions of pathogenic Atx3 co-label for chaperones such as Hsp70, no such inclusions were observed in flies expressing only high levels of Atx2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060029-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed that Atx2 protein levels were not affected by pathogenic Atx3 (unpublished data). In summary, endogenous Atx2 is recruited to nuclear inclusions formed by pathogenic Atx3, as in SCA3 patients.</p>

        <title>The Interaction between Atx2 and Pathogenic Atx3 Is Dependent on the PAM2 Motif of Atx2</title>
        <p>To provide insight into the mechanism by which Atx2 modulates polyQ toxicity, we determined whether the conserved 12-amino acid PAM2 motif of the Atx2 protein was required for enhancement of SCA3 toxicity. The PAM2 motif is required for Atx2 to associate with PABP, and together with the RNA-binding Lsm domain, it mediates the colocalization of Atx2 with PABP in polyribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b016">16</xref>]. We tested whether a construct lacking the conserved PAM2 domain, <italic>UAS-Atx2ΔP</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b016">16</xref>], could modulate Atx3 toxicity. Atx2ΔP retains partial Atx2 function, since it delays embryonic lethality caused by complete loss of <italic>atx2</italic> function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b016">16</xref>]. The Atx2ΔP transgenic line expressed the protein at a level comparable to that of the strongly expressing Atx2(s) line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060029-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Expression of Atx2ΔP driven by <italic>Gmr-Gal4</italic> caused a disrupted eye phenotype distinct from that caused by up-regulation of normal Atx2: black patches were present on the surface, and the underlying retina was disorganized although intact, showing no evidence of degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). In striking contrast to normal Atx2 protein, coexpression of Atx2ΔP failed to enhance SCA3trQ78 toxicity: the flies showed an eye phenotype identical to that caused by Atx2ΔP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g005">Figure 5</xref>B; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>

        <p>We confirmed this finding by examining interactions between Atx2ΔP and pathogenic Atx3 in the adult, uncomplicated by any developmental effects. Coexpression of Atx2ΔP and SCA3trQ78 driven by <italic>Rh1-Gal4</italic> caused a mild adult-onset photoreceptor loss at 6 d (6.7 ± 0.06 PR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g005">Figure 5</xref>D) that was similar to that caused by SCA3trQ78 alone (6.9 ± 0.02 PR; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), and strikingly less severe than that caused by coexpression of SCA3trQ78 with normal Atx2 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). The accelerated appearance of inclusions caused by up-regulated normal Atx2 was also dependent on the PAM2 domain, since coexpression of Atx2ΔP with SCA3trQ78 did not alter the time course of inclusion formation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g004">Figure 4</xref>G to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g004">4</xref>E). Moreover, coexpression of Atx2ΔP did not cause the early appearance of SDS-insoluble complexes containing Atx3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g004">Figure 4</xref>J, compare lane 3 to lane 2). Taken together, these data show that the PAM2 motif of Atx2 is required for the enhancement of pathogenic Atx3-dependent degeneration as well as for the early appearance of Atx3 inclusions and insoluble complexes.</p>
        <p>Adult-onset expression of Atx2 lacking the PAM2 motif alone also did not cause neurodegeneration: even at 18 d, flies expressing Atx2ΔP had a normal retinal structure (7.0 ± 0.01 PR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g005">Figure 5</xref>C; compare to normal Atx2 expressed at an equivalent level, which results in 1.5 ± 0.08 PR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>H). Thus the PAM2 motif is required for the inherent toxicity of Atx2 when it is up-regulated in the adult eye.</p>

Control experiments confirmed that the deletion alone, in the absence of pathogenic Atx3, did not cause neurodegeneration (unpublished data).

        <p>We then tested whether PABP could modulate the degeneration induced by strong expression of Atx2 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">2</xref>H. Decreased PABP function enhanced Atx2-dependent photoreceptor loss (from 1.7 ± 0.09 PR to 1.3 ± 0.06 PR); likewise, up-regulation of PABP protected against photoreceptor degeneration (2.9 ± 0.16 PR to 5.1 ± 0.19 PR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). These studies suggest that the toxicity of Atx2 is mitigated by physical association with PABP, and they are consistent with PABP also playing a crucial role in the Atx2–Atx3 interaction. Together with our results demonstrating the crucial role of the PAM2 motif, these data highlight the importance of the normal biological activity of Atx2 and of PABP in modulating the toxicity of pathogenic Atx3.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reveal that the toxicity of pathogenic human Atx3 is critically dependent on Atx2 activity. Reduction of endogenous Atx2 function mitigated Atx3-induced neurodegeneration, and up-regulation of Atx2 synergistically enhanced degeneration. We also reveal the roles in neural integrity played by the non-polyglutamine PAM2 motif of Atx2 and by PABP, which binds to Atx2 via this motif. These data are consistent with and expand upon clinical findings suggesting interactions between Atx2 and Atx3 in human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b007">7</xref>]. In the fly, endogenous Atx2 colocalized with pathogenic Atx3 in inclusions, as seen in human patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b007">7</xref>], with up-regulation of Atx2 enhancing Atx3 toxicity concomitant with a faster onset of inclusions and of SDS-insoluble complexes. These findings suggest that therapeutic approaches to modulate Atx2 activity may be effective against multiple disease situations, including SCA2 and SCA3.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we find that normal Atx2 is toxic, causing degeneration when up-regulated. Previous animal models have demonstrated that normal protein products associated with SCA1 and Parkinson's disease—Ataxin-1 and α-Synuclein, respectively—are also toxic when expressed at sufficiently high levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b030">30</xref>]. Expansion of the polyglutamine domain in Ataxin-1 or Parkinson disease-associated missense mutations of α-Synuclein presumably lead to increased levels of the respective proteins, sufficiently high to elicit disease. Up-regulation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Atx2 may cause degeneration for similar reasons. Our studies further reveal that neuronal toxicity of Atx2 depends on its PAM2 motif—an observation with an interesting parallel to Ataxin-1, the protein that causes SCA1: an expanded polyglutamine repeat in Ataxin-1 is not sufficient to cause neurodegeneration in mouse models for SCA1, but rather pathogenic Ataxin-1 also requires its AXH domain to cause disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b035">35</xref>].</p>
      <p>The importance of the PAM2 motif for Atx2′s toxicity and for the enhancement of Atx3 toxicity suggests a clue to the mechanism of the interaction. The PAM2 motif has been shown to bind specifically to the PABC domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b013">13</xref>], with PABP being currently the only known PABC-containing protein that interacts with Atx2. PABP is a ubiquitously expressed and essential protein that binds to the polyadenylated tails of mRNAs and is required for their translation. Furthermore, biochemical and genetic data support an interaction between Atx2 and PABP across many species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b036">36</xref>]. Data from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> indicate that loss of Atx2 can result in misregulated translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b015">15</xref>], and in yeast Atx2 negatively regulates PABP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b036">36</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, we have shown that Atx2 and PABP have opposing activities in modulating the progression of SCA3 toxicity in flies.</p>
      <p>Protein interaction studies indicate that Atx2 and Atx3 do not interact directly; in a survey of the interaction network of ataxia-associated proteins, Atx2 and Atx3 were separated by four nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b012">12</xref>]. However, the known function of PABP and the role of the PAM2 motif in localizing Atx2 to polyribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060029-b016">16</xref>] together indicate that Atx2 and PABP modulate translation of specific transcripts. Since Atx2 is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration in the absence of pathogenic Atx3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060029-g002">2</xref>H), Atx3 mRNAs cannot be the sole target of Atx2–PABP interactions, and additional transcript targets must be critical to normal neuronal integrity. </p>
      <p>Our experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> demonstrate that the fly provides an outstanding complement to clinical observations and to vertebrate disease models. In this case, the fly has highlighted the significance of intriguing interactions between the genes that cause SCA2 and SCA3 diseases that can be supported by molecular and genetic findings. More specifically, these data indicate striking crosstalk between the pathways of normal Atx2 function and pathogenic Atx3 activity. Further understanding of both the Atx2 and Atx3 pathways may reveal insight into maintenance of neuronal integrity in a number of distinct disease situations.</p>
