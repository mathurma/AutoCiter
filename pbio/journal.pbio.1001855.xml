<p>A new zebrafish model of skin inflammatory disease explains new-onset and worsening psoriasis and lichen planus in patients receiving anti-TNFα therapy.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>TNFα overexpression has been associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, lichen planus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Paradoxically, numerous studies have reported new-onset psoriasis and lichen planus following TNFα antagonist therapy. Here, we show that genetic inhibition of Tnfa and Tnfr2 in zebrafish results in the mobilization of neutrophils to the skin. Using combinations of fluorescent reporter transgenes, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry, we identified the local production of dual oxidase 1 (Duox1)-derived H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by Tnfa- and Tnfr2-deficient keratinocytes as a trigger for the activation of the master inflammation transcription factor NF-κB, which then promotes the induction of genes encoding pro-inflammatory molecules. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of Duox1 completely abrogated skin inflammation, placing Duox1-derived H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> upstream of this positive feedback inflammatory loop. Strikingly, DUOX1 was drastically induced in the skin lesions of psoriasis and lichen planus patients. These results reveal a crucial role for TNFα/TNFR2 axis in the protection of the skin against DUOX1-mediated oxidative stress and could establish new therapeutic targets for skin inflammatory disorders.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Psoriasis and lichen planus are chronic, debilitating skin diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. TNFα is a multifunctional cytokine that mediates acute and chronic inflammation. While TNFα antagonist therapy is used for autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), numerous studies have reported new-onset psoriasis and lichen planus following such therapy. We have used the unique advantages of the zebrafish embryo to identify a novel phenotype that mirrors this unexplained and paradoxical onset of psoriasis and lichen planus. We found that depletion of Tnfa or its receptor Tnfr2 caused skin inflammation and hyperproliferation of keratinocytes through the activation of a Duox1/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NF-κB positive feedback inflammatory loop. Strikingly, DUOX1 was drastically induced in the skin lesions of psoriasis and lichen planus patients, and pharmacological inhibition of Duox1 abrogated skin inflammation, placing Duox1-derived H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> upstream of this inflammatory loop. Our results suggest that therapies targeting DUOX1 and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could provide innovative approaches to the management of skin inflammatory disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a multifunctional cytokine that mediates key roles in acute and chronic inflammation, antitumor responses, and infection. TNFα binds TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1, also known as TNFRSF1A or P55) and TNFR2 (also known as TNFRSF1B or P75) for stimulation of two opposing signaling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Shalaby1">[1]</xref>. In general, TNFR1 signaling results in the trigger of a cascade that can result in apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Aggarwal1">[2]</xref>. This is dependent upon the cell type, the state of activation of the cell, and the cell cycle. In contrast, a TNFR2 signal induces cell survival pathways that can result in cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Aggarwal1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Enhanced TNFα synthesis is associated with the development of autoimmune/chronic inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, lichen planus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The inhibition of TNFα activities in these diseases has been remarkably successful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Faustman1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Palladino1">[4]</xref>. Paradoxically, however, numerous studies have reported new-onset psoriasis and lichen planus, or worsening of existing psoriasis, following TNFα antagonist therapy in adult patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Denadai1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Wendling1">[10]</xref>. Despite these clinical data pointing to an ambiguous function of TNFα in psoriasis and lichen planus, the role of TNFα, and in particular the contribution of each TNFR, in the regulation of skin inflammation has been scarcely studied. An earlier study using gene-targeted mutant mice lacking either TNFR1 or TNFR2 showed that skin inflammation induced indirectly by irritant chemicals or directly by intradermal administration of TNFα was greatly attenuated in TNFR1-deficient mice, whereas TNFR2-deficient siblings responded normally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Kondo1">[11]</xref>. In addition, mice with an arrested canonical NF-κB activation pathway in the keratinocytes develop a severe inflammatory skin disease shortly after birth, which is caused by TNFα- and macrophage-mediated, but T-cell–independent, mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Pasparakis1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-vanHogerlinden1">[16]</xref>. The characteristics of this complex disorder are strikingly similar to those associated with the human X-linked genodermatosis incontinentia pigmenti (IP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Smahi1">[17]</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, however, the role played by TNFα in the homeostasis of healthy skin has never been studied.</p>
<p>TNFα and TNFRs are conserved in all vertebrates. Recent studies have shown that in the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) Tnfa functions as a pro-inflammatory cytokine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Roca1">[18]</xref> and Tnfr signaling plays an important role in the homeostasis of endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Espin1">[19]</xref>. In the present study, we have taken advantage of the strengths of the zebrafish embryo model to study the impact of Tnfa, Tnfr1, and Tnfr2 deficiencies in a whole vertebrate organism. We found that Tnfa and Tnfr2 are both crucial, whereas Tnfr1 is dispensable, for the homeostasis of the skin. Genetic inhibition of Tnfa and Tnfr2 promotes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated skin infiltration by neutrophils, increased keratinocyte proliferation, and the local activation of the master inflammation transcription factor NF-κB, which then promotes the induction of genes encoding pro-inflammatory molecules. In addition, DUOX1 was strongly induced in keratinocytes of human psoriasis and lichen planus patients.</p>

<title>Tnfa or Tnfr2 Deficiency Results in Neutrophil Mobilization to the Skin</title>
<p>In wild-type larvae, most neutrophils (approximately 90%) were located in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Murayama1">[20]</xref> by 3 d postfertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001855-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>), which is consistent with neutrophil localization patterns described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Bennett1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-LeGuyader1">[22]</xref>. However, in Tnfa- and Tnfr2-deficient larvae, approximately 40% of neutrophils were located outside the CHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001855-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In addition, Tnfr1-deficient animals showed a normal neutrophil distribution, whereas their double deficient siblings for both Tnfr1 and Tnfr2 showed also a distribution pattern more similar to single Tnfr2-deficient fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001855-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). The specificity of this phenotype was confirmed with a dominant negative (DN) Tnfr2, which is lacking the entire intracellular signaling domain, but is identical to full-length Tnfr2 in its transmembrane and extracellular domains, and therefore, its trimerization with endogenous Tnfr2 extinguishes Tnfr2 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Espin1">[19]</xref>. The results showed that the altered neutrophil distribution of Tnfr2 morphants was phenocopied by overexpression of DN-Tnfr2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001855.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). In addition, the scattered distribution of Tnfa- and Tnfr2-deficient larvae was partially rescued by overexpression of wild-type Tnfa and Tnfr2 RNAs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001855.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). These results prompted us to examine the distribution of macrophages in TNFα- and TNFR2-deficient fish, and surprisingly, macrophage distribution was apparently normal in all cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001855.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

(B) Fluorescence intensity was measured for all the groups in the area indicated (A), which includes the CHT, where most neutrophils are located in wild-type larvae at 3 dpf. The images were converted to a fluorescence value matrix where the value obtained for each pixel transversally was the mean ± S.E.M. for all the pixels for each row (15 larvae per treatment from 3 different experiments). The area corresponding to the CHT has been labeled and highlighted. The notochord (nt) location has been indicated to facilitate the larval orientation. auf, arbitrary units of fluorescence. (C) The neutrophil mobilization from the CHT in Tnfa- and Tnfr2-deficient larvae was quantified as the percentage of neutrophils outside the CHT in 20 larvae per group from 3 different experiments.

<p>To ascertain the precise localization of neutrophils in Tnfa/Tnfr2-deficient larvae, we knocked down Tnfr2 in transgenic <italic>mpx:eGFP</italic> animals followed by whole mount immunohistochemistry (WIHC) against p63 (basal keratinocyte marker) to visualize neutrophils (GFP<sup>+</sup>) and skin keratinocytes (p63<sup>+</sup>) at the same time in whole larvae. The results revealed that although neutrophils from wild-type animals were mainly located in the CHT, a high proportion of neutrophils were seen in close contact with keratinocytes in Tnfr2-deficient animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001855-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001855.s012">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001855.s013">S2</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that deficiency of either Tnfa or Tnfr2 specifically promotes neutrophil infiltration into the skin of zebrafish during early development.</p>

<title>Tnfa or Tnfr2 Deficiency Triggers the Induction of Genes Encoding Pro-Inflammatory Mediators in Keratinocytes</title>
<p>The phenotype of Tnfa- and Tnfr2-deficient fish is reminiscent of that of <italic>spint1a</italic> and <italic>clint1</italic> mutant fish, which show chronic skin inflammation characterized by increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production and neutrophil infiltration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Dodd1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Carney1">[25]</xref>. This led us to examine the expression of three genes encoding major pro-inflammatory molecules, namely Tnfa itself, IL-1β, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2b (PTGS2b, also known as COX2b), in whole wild-type and Tnfr2-deficient larvae at 3 dpf as well as in sorted <italic>mpx:eGFP</italic><sup>+</sup> cells—that is, neutrophils. It was found that Tnfr2 deficiency triggered the expression of <italic>tnfa</italic>, <italic>il1b</italic>, and <italic>ptgs2b</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001855-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Although neutrophils highly expressed the genes encoding Tnfa and Il1b as well as both Tnfrs, they did not mediate the induction of <italic>il1b</italic> observed in Tnfr2-deficient fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001855-g002">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001855.s003">S3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001855.s004">S4A</xref>). Nevertheless, the transcript levels of <italic>tnfa</italic> were higher in neutrophils from Tnfr2-deficient fish than in neutrophils from their wild-type siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001855-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), but this might reflect a positive feedback loop in response to Tnfr2 deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Espin1">[19]</xref>. In addition, Tnfr2-deficient embryos showed higher transcript levels of <italic>il1b</italic> at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001855.s005">Figure S5</xref>), soon after the development of the first neutrophils in the zebrafish embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Bennett1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-LeGuyader1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Lieschke1">[26]</xref> and before hatching. We then sorted krt18<sup>+</sup> cells from Tnfa- and Tnfr2-deficient animals at 3 dpf and found that they show much higher transcript levels of <italic>il1b</italic> and <italic>ptgs2b</italic> than krt18<sup>+</sup> cells from wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001855-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001855.s003">S3B</xref>).

<title>Tnfa and Tnfr2 Deficiencies Induce NF-κB Activation in the Skin</title>
<p>The master regulator of inflammation NF-κB plays an essential role in the homeostasis of skin. Thus, genetic inhibition of the NF-κB pathway in keratinocytes triggers a severe inflammatory skin disease in newborn mice, which is completely rescued by Tnfa and Tnfr1 depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Pasparakis1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-vanHogerlinden1">[16]</xref>. We therefore use a NF-κB reporter line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Kanther1">[28]</xref> to visualize the dynamics of NF-κB in whole Tnfr2-deficient larvae. Injection of bacterial DNA, which activated TLR9, resulted in a drastic activation of NF-κB in the whole larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001855-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>), as expected from previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-AlcarazPerez1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Sepulcre1">[30]</xref>.

<title>DUOX1 Is Induced in Human Psoriasis and Lichen Planus Lesions</title>
<p>The crucial role of Duox1-generated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the infiltration of neutrophils into the skin and the induction of NF-κB prompted us to investigate if this inflammatory signal may also play a role in human psoriasis and lichen planus.

The results showed that although DUOX1 was expressed at low levels in healthy epidermis, mainly in the granular layer, a drastic induction of this enzyme was obvious in the keratinocytes of the spinous layer of the epidermis from both psoriasis and lichen planus lesions. In some patients, the induction was obvious in all keratinocytes of the spinous layer, whereas in others it was observed only in the upper layers of this stratum. It was noticeable the localization of DUOX1 in the plasma membrane of psoriasis and lichen planus keratinocytes and also in their cytoplasm, where it was accumulated in the upper side of these cells—that is, facing the cornified layer. Although this particular distribution deserves further investigation, these results strongly suggest a role for DUOX1 in psoriasis and lichen planus.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Increased production of TNFα is associated with the development of autoimmune/chronic inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, lichen planus, rheumatoid arthritis, and IBD. We have used the unique advantages of the zebrafish embryo for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging and cell tracking to demonstrate that the genetic depletion of Tnfa or Tnfr2, but not Tnfr1, caused the infiltration of neutrophils into the skin and hyperproliferation of keratinocytes through the activation of an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NF-κB/Duox1 positive feedback inflammatory loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001855-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Strikingly, neutrophils, but not macrophages, are rapidly attracted to the skin. However, the activation of NF-κB and the induction of the gene encoding Il1b in the skin occurred before the appearance of the first neutrophils in the developing embryo. More importantly, DUOX1 was also strongly induced in the skin lesions of psoriasis and lichen planus patients. Collectively, these results (i) indicate a critical role of TNFα/TNFR2 signaling in the protection of the skin against oxidative stress, (ii) might explain the appearance of psoriasis and lichen planus in patients treated with anti-TNFα therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Denadai1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Wendling1">[10]</xref>, and (iii) support the idea that specific inhibition of the TNFα/TNFR1 signaling axis while leaving TNFα/TNFR2 signaling unaffected would inhibit the pathological effects of TNFα and reduce the side effects associated with this therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Espin1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-VanHauwermeiren1">[36]</xref>. This apparent discrepancy with TNFα-deficient mice, which do not show skin inflammation, may be due to developmental and/or physiological compensations, which probably do not exist in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Inui1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Rudmann1">[39]</xref>.</p>

<p>One of the most intriguing observations from this study is that impaired Tnfr2 signaling led to the induction of <italic>duox1</italic> and the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by keratinocytes. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> gradient was recently shown to contribute to the early influx of neutrophils in wound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Niethammer1">[31]</xref> and tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Feng1">[32]</xref>, although it seems to be dispensable for neutrophil detection of localized infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Deng1">[33]</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing a role for Duox1-derived H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the induction of NF-κB in the skin <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> might play a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of chronic inflammatory diseases in both zebrafish and human. These observations suggest that antioxidants or inhibition of Duox1 might be therapeutic for the treatment of patients suffering from psoriasis, lichen planus, and other inflammatory diseases. Supporting this notion, several studies using psoriasis and IBD mouse models have shown that transgenic overexpression of endogenous antioxidant genes promotes protection, while antioxidant gene knockout promotes sensitization (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Zhou1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Zhu1">[41]</xref>). Even more importantly, the antioxidant levels and the oxidative stress biomarkers are usually correlated with the disease severity and the extent of inflammation in the psoriasis and IBD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Zhou1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Kim1">[42]</xref>. Therefore, all these results taken together suggest that antioxidants should be considered as part of a more specific and effective therapy for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis and lichen planus. The ability of Duox1 inhibition by pharmacological approaches, but not of IL-1β, to restore skin homeostasis in Tnfa- and Tnfr2-deficient zebrafish embryos further supports this conclusion.</p>
<p>It is known that different reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as second messengers, influencing various cellular signal transduction pathways, including NF-κB. However, there are still many inconsistencies concerning the influence of oxidative stress on NF-κB activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Siomek1">[43]</xref>, and unfortunately, most studies have been performed <italic>in vitro</italic> using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Byun1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Schreck1">[45]</xref>. Such studies have shown that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can act as an activator of IκB kinases (IKKs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Kamata1">[46]</xref> or can inactivate these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Korn1">[47]</xref>, probably depending on the cell type. More recently, it has been found that the same prolyl hydroxylases that confer oxygen sensitivity to the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, namely PHD1 and PHD2, seem to act as repressors of the canonical NF-κB pathway through mechanisms that could include direct hydroxylation of IKKβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Cummins1">[48]</xref>. Our epistasis study in zebrafish demonstrates for the first time that the absence of Tnfa/Tnfr2 signaling led to the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by keratinocytes, which, in turn, resulted in NF-κB activation and the induction of genes encoding pro-inflammatory mediators. This self-perpetuating cycle may be of clinical importance in view of the presumably key role played by oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Zhou1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Kim1">[42]</xref>, HIF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Rosenberger1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Colgan1">[50]</xref>, and NF-κB in psoriasis and IBD. It is tempting to speculate that the Tnfa/Tnfr2 axis would be required to prevent skin oxidative stress through the regulation of ROS-detoxifying enzymes, as it has been reported for oligodendrocyte progenitor cells <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Maier1">[51]</xref>. The model reported here might contribute to clarify the mechanisms involved in the regulation of oxidative stress by TNFα, the regulation of NF-κB activity by ROS, and the crosstalk between oxidative stress and inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The essential role played by NF-κB in the homeostasis of the skin is evidenced by the human X-linked genodermatosis IP, which affects the regulatory subunit of IKK (IKKγ, NEMO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Smahi1">[17]</xref>. Humans suffering from this genetic disease exhibit severe skin inflammation, paradoxically due to impaired NF-κB activation and reduced resistance to TNFα/TNFR1-mediated apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Makris1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Nenci1">[53]</xref>. Similarly, although NF-κB actively participates in the excessive inflammatory response observed in IBD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Ellis1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Schreiber1">[55]</xref>, recent studies with mice defective in NF-κB activation have revealed that epithelial NF-κB activation is essential to preserve intestinal homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Nenci2">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-KajinoSakamoto1">[57]</xref>. Therefore, a critical NF-κB signaling balance is required for skin and gut homeostasis, as both excessive and defective epithelial NF-κB activation can result in inflammation. Similarly, although the TNFα/TNFR1 axis was earlier appreciated to be involved in the apoptosis of both keratinocytes and enterocytes in the absence of NF-κB signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Makris1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Nenci1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-Nenci2">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001855-KajinoSakamoto1">[57]</xref>, our results show that TNFα signaling through TNFR2 is also critically required for skin homeostasis. Whether the TNFα/TNFR2 axis is also required for gut homeostasis will require further investigation using germ-free and gnotobiotic zebrafish larvae, as host–microbe interactions have a profound impact in gut physiology and are usually involved in IBD.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have found that Tnfa signaling through Tnfr2 is indispensably required for the protection of the skin against oxidative stress-induced inflammation in the zebrafish. Thus, the absence of this signal triggers the local production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by Duox1, which, in turn, activates NF-κB and results in the up-regulation of genes encoding pro-inflammatory mediators and neutrophil infiltration. These results, together with the induction of DUOX1 in the skin lesions of psoriasis and lichen planus patients, reveal a crucial role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and DUOX1 in skin inflammation and suggest that pharmacologic and genetic therapies that target these two key factors could provide innovative approaches to the management of psoriasis, lichen planus, and other chronic inflammatory diseases.</p>
