        <p>The nematode <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> is a popular model system in genetics, not least because a majority of human disease genes are conserved in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>. To generate a comprehensive inventory of its expressed proteome, we performed extensive shotgun proteomics and identified more than half of all predicted <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteins. This allowed us to confirm and extend genome annotations, characterize the role of operons in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>, and semiquantitatively infer abundance levels for thousands of proteins. Furthermore, for the first time to our knowledge, we were able to compare two animal proteomes (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content>). We found that the abundances of orthologous proteins in metazoans correlate remarkably well, better than protein abundance versus transcript abundance within each organism or transcript abundances across organisms; this suggests that changes in transcript abundance may have been partially offset during evolution by opposing changes in protein abundance.</p>

          <p>Proteins are the active players that execute the genetic program of a cell, and their levels and interactions are precisely controlled. Routinely monitoring thousands of proteins is difficult, as they can be present at vastly different abundances, come with various sizes, shapes, and charge, and have a more complex alphabet of twenty “letters,” in contrast to the four letters of the genome itself. Here, we used mass spectrometry to extensively characterize the proteins of a popular model organism, the nematode <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content>. Together with previous data from the fruit fly <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content>, this allows us to compare the protein levels of two animals on a global scale. Surprisingly, we find that individual protein abundance is highly conserved between the two species. So, although worms and flies look very different, they need similar amounts of each conserved, orthologous protein. Because many <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> proteins also have counterparts in humans, our results suggest that similar rules may apply to our own proteins.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The rapid lifecycle, small size, reproducible development, and ease of cultivation in the laboratory have made <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> an important experimental system for biological studies. Numerous human disease-related genes (e.g., related to cancer or neurological diseases) have orthologs in the worm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b001">1</xref>]. Sequencing and annotation of its genome has revealed more than 19,000 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b002">2</xref>] coding for more than 22,000 proteins, including splice variants. Extensive systematic studies of gene function have been performed. However, to completely understand complex biological processes such as development, aging, or disease, the analysis of the proteome—i.e., the entire set of the expressed proteins—is becoming increasingly important. Knowledge of the complete sequence of a genome is a necessary prerequisite for proteomics, but the DNA sequence itself does not reveal which proteins are actually expressed when, where, and to what level. Furthermore, in contrast to the genome, the proteome is changing under different biological conditions. Although for many years, transcriptome data (i.e., the collection of transcribed mRNAs) has been used to approximate the proteome, a number of studies have demonstrated that the correlation between mRNA and protein abundance is surprisingly low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b005">5</xref>] because of posttranscriptional regulation and variable protein half-lives. The analysis of the proteome is therefore a key method to provide systems-level information about protein function in time and space, and to obtain a concise view of biological processes. In the case of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>, previous analyses of the proteome were either limited in scope and coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b007">7</xref>], or largely focused on improving genome annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b008">8</xref>], with the biggest <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteome dataset published so far encompassing 6,779 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b008">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>To generate a comprehensive, deeply sampled <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteome database that can be used for quantitative proteome analysis, we applied subcellular and biochemical fractionation methods to the worm proteins, performed tryptic digests, separated the resulting peptides using a variety of techniques, and identified the peptides by mass spectrometry (MS). This resulted in a unique global view on the expression status of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteome. We identified a number of protein features and functions that are underrepresented in the expressed proteome, likely representing specialized functional systems expressed only in a small subset of cells and/or developmental stages. We demonstrate the importance of proteomics data towards improved genome annotation. Finally, we compared the proteome data with similar data from the fruit fly <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content>. The latter comparison provided—for the first time to our knowledge—an overview of the expressed “core animal proteome,” which should arguably become the initial focus for monitoring the basic metazoan cellular machinery in the future.</p>

        <title>Protein Identifications</title>
        <p>To identify <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteins, we collected worms at various developmental stages and homogenized whole animals and eggs to isolate the proteins. Their tryptic peptides were separated using strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX), in several cases after labeling them with isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b009">9</xref>] to reduce sample complexity, or by isoelectric focusing (applying free-flow electrophoresis and immobilized pH gradient strips). The peptides were finally identified using microcapillary liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem MS (μLC-ESI-MS/MS). With this extensive shotgun proteomics approach, we identified 10,977 different proteins, including splice variants, via 84,962 nonredundant peptide identifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-st001">Table S1</xref>; 759,320 peptide identifications were obtained in total). We identified 10,631 gene loci, corresponding to 54% of the gene loci in WormBase (WS140: 19,735 loci). Of these, 7,476 loci (38%) were detected via several distinct peptides, 580 (3%) were detected via the same peptide more than once, and 2,575 (13%) were detected only via a single peptide identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

        <p>Protein identification from MS peptide spectra is prone to false-positive assignments, and we employed strict search cutoffs using PeptideProphet (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). To independently estimate our false discovery rate (FDR), in particular for identifications based on a single peptide spectrum (“single hits”), we first took advantage of one of our experiments that used isoelectric focusing to fractionate peptides. In each peptide fraction, true-positive identifications should scatter around a narrow range of isoelectric points (pIs), whereas false-positive identifications should follow the background distribution in the database. This analysis, using computational predictions of pIs to check all peptides, yielded an estimated FDR of 35% for single hits in this particular experiment. Independently, a newly developed model based on a robust decoy search strategy yielded an upper limit for the FDR of single-hit identifications at around 63% for all combined experiments (L. Reiter, M. Claassen, S. P. Schrimpf, J. M. Buhmann, M. O. Hengartner, et al., unpublished data). By the latter method, multi-hit identifications were found to be much more reliable, resulting in an FDR of 7% in our study. Since almost half of all single-hit identifications do represent bona fide protein identifications, we chose to include single-hit identifications in our subsequent analyses. A separate analysis focusing on just these proteins alone showed that they often belonged to groups that were underrepresented in the complete dataset and are therefore presumably of low abundance in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> (short, uncharacterized proteins and in particular those with seven transmembrane domains; also see below). This means that they do represent valuable information about which proteins are expressed at low levels in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>. It should also be stressed that all conclusions reported below remained valid when single-hit identifications were excluded.</p>
        <p>To assess whether proteins from sources other than <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> were present in our preparations, we focused on the bacteria on which the worms were feeding (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content>). We tested a single, representative experiment, encompassing 67 MS/MS analyses by searching the spectra against a combined <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> database. A total of 1.3% of the protein identifications mapped to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>, among them 14 hits mapping to both organisms. However, for each of these 14 proteins, there was at least one additional <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> peptide identified, confirming that these overlapping detections did not influence the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> results.</p>

        <title>Proteins Seen and Not Seen: Features and Functions</title>
        <p>In order to characterize <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteins that were <italic>not</italic> detected, and that are therefore most likely expressed at particularly low levels, or in specialized cells or developmental stages only, we classified the entire predicted <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteome with respect to several aspects (length, pI, hydrophobicity, transmembrane topology, and functional annotation). This should reveal the nature of underrepresented proteins (with potentially more peripheral, or even worm-specific functions), and separate them from abundant proteins involved in basic cellular processes such as growth, metabolism, and information processing. It should also reveal potential technical limitations (proteins/peptides difficult to detect using our procedure), which is important to assess for future systematic uses of MS.</p>
        <p>Our bias analyses revealed an underrepresentation of proteins shorter than 400 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) and of proteins with basic pIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). A similar bias has previously been observed for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b010">10</xref>]. The underrepresentation of basic proteins was partly to be expected, due to our isoelectric focusing experiments, which centered on the pH range 3–7. The underrepresentation of short (low molecular weight) proteins might be caused by a generally higher prevalence of spurious gene predictions among short genes, and also by a lower probability of detecting one of the few tryptic peptides generated by short proteins. We observed a bimodal distribution of hydrophobicity values within the annotated set of all <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteins, and a strong underrepresentation of proteins in the second, high hydrophobicity peak in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This second peak consists mostly of multipass transmembrane proteins (∼64% of these proteins have seven or more predicted transmembrane domains). To better understand how membrane association relates to protein abundance and detectability, we globally characterized WormBase proteins with respect to their content of transmembrane segments, using Phobius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b011">11</xref>]. Overall, we found a notable underrepresentation of transmembrane proteins in our proteomics data, and decided to subdivide these proteins further according to the number of transmembrane sections and annotated functions as shown for other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g002">2</xref>E). Remarkably, we found that the strongest underrepresentation is observed for proteins with seven transmembrane regions, in particular those annotated with the function “receptor activity.” This may point to a biological (rather than technical) explanation for the relative paucity of transmembrane proteins in our data: Seven-transmembrane chemosensory receptors are widespread in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> genome, but many of these are known to be expressed only in a small number of neurons each [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b016">16</xref>]. Because we assessed whole animals, those proteins might be too rare to be successfully detected. This general underrepresentation in our proteome data suggests similar sensory functions for other transmembrane proteins of hitherto unknown function that we also found to be of too low abundance to be detected.</p>

        <p>Finally, we globally analyzed the functional classifications of all the detected proteins. We observed a clear bias towards proteins with known functions.

A possible explanation could be that some of the undetected proteins with unknown functions are actually erroneous gene predictions or pseudogenes. It could also be a testament to the biases of previous studies: abundant proteins are easier to work with biochemically, and may therefore have obtained a functional annotation more easily. In total, our proteomics approach identified proteins belonging to 125 out of the 127 Gene Ontology (GO) slim categories defined for WormBase. The global GO slim analyses confirmed the underrepresentation of proteins with receptor activity mentioned above, and of “membrane” or “integral to membrane” proteins in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g002">Figure 2</xref>F).</p>

        <title>Improving Genome Annotation</title>
        <p>Large-scale proteome analyses (such as ours) represent an important cornerstone for an improved genome annotation. In WormBase (WS160), 4,987 gene loci were still listed with the gene status “predicted” only, i.e., without any supporting transcript data (expressed sequence tag [EST], mRNA). We experimentally confirmed the protein expression of 1,062 of these predicted genes (among them, more than 40% via multiple peptide detections). As was the case for the whole proteome, this subset was enriched for proteins with GO slim annotations (45% in our dataset, as compared to 38% expected for this subset in WormBase; <italic>p</italic>-value: 4.65E−08). Apart from these gene confirmations, our <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteomics dataset contains numerous spectra originating from nonannotated regions in the worm genome. In computationally intensive analyses, we are identifying these by searching our data against six-frame translations of the genome, and filtering the results for high confidence spectra that map to nonannotated regions. For example, from one particular experiment, we identified 78 likely novel peptides. Two of these are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g003">Figure 3</xref> (the corresponding MS/MS spectra are provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). These data suggest an alternative translational start site for the protein SYN-4 (T01B11.3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g003">Figure 3</xref>A): the observed peptide is located upstream of the annotated translational start site, and only partially overlaps with the currently annotated protein sequence. The second example demonstrates a novel splice variant for the gene F47B7.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In this case, we identified a peptide that extends an existing annotated exon downstream, in the correct frame. These and similar analyses, suggesting altered or new gene models, are computationally very intensive and were not yet completed at the time of submission. Furthermore, due to the increased search space when searching proteomics against the genome, extra scrutiny is needed when interpreting each reannotation instance, and additional experimental data should probably be taken into account before fully accepting these gene annotation changes.</p>

        <title>Operons</title>
        <p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> and its relatives are unique among characterized metazoans in that a large number of their genes are organized into operons (multicistronic transcription units, containing up to eight genes that are strictly coexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b018">18</xref>]). Following transcription, the primary transcript is split up through a unique trans-splicing mechanism, and the individual open reading frames are subsequently translated separately into distinct mature proteins. In order to assess the potential influence of operon structure on the regulation and abundance of proteins, we studied the expression status of genes in operons, compared to individually transcribed genes. Although an absolute quantification of protein levels is not possible with our shotgun approach, we performed a semiquantitative analysis based on spectral counting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b023">23</xref>]. Surprisingly, we observed that proteins encoded by operons are expressed far more strongly than those encoded by individually transcribed genes: we observed 84% of the former, with a median relative abundance of 20 ppm (parts per million of total protein molecules), but only 47% of the latter with a median relative abundance of 5 ppm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The same tendency was found when analyzing publicly available transcript-abundance data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). This striking observation confirms that operons are preferentially made up of genes that are strongly transcribed, and we now establish that this is reflected also at the protein level: operon proteins, on average, are more than 3-fold more abundant than proteins from single-gene transcripts. Apart from grouping strongly expressed proteins, operons are also expected to facilitate coordinated regulation of their constituent genes. We assessed whether this is the case by searching for operons that were either fully expressed (i.e., all encoded proteins detectable) or silenced (none or very few of the encoded proteins detectable). Indeed, we found significantly more operons of both types than expected by chance, as illustrated for operons of lengths 4 to 6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). In principle, our observations could be stemming from a limited selection of tissues only, for example from the hermaphrodite germline, where operons are thought to be strongly expressed during oogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b024">24</xref>]. However, we observed that operon proteins are more abundant even in dauer and L1-stage larvae, which both should have very little germline material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). We further checked whether our observation could be explained by systematic differences in length or transmembrane segments of operon proteins. Although we did observe slight differences in length and transmembrane content—operon proteins are on average 11% longer, and transmembrane proteins are 40% less frequent—these differences were not sufficient to explain the increased abundance of operon proteins (unpublished data). Together, our observations indicate, for the first time, that operons in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> ensure the coordinated regulation of highly expressed proteins.</p>

        <p>Despite the fact that it is difficult to compare tissues and developmental stages across organisms, our analysis provides a first insight into the evolutionary behavior of animal proteins over long time scales. It is important to point out that for all six data points, several developmental stages and/or tissues had been mixed, but that these were not, of course, always directly equivalent and comparable between the two organisms. However, many of the ancient animal orthologs that we studied here can be expected to be expressed similarly across many cell types and stages, and we thus attempted to capture an organism-wide “average” proteome for both animals. That notwithstanding, we also repeated the analysis for one set of samples that is arguably more directly comparable: mixed staged embryos sampled in both <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> at the proteome and at the transcript levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Here again, we saw that protein abundances correlated far better (<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.70) across organisms than transcript abundances (<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.50).</p>
        <p>Another potential complication for our analysis lies in the technique of spectral counting. Individual tryptic peptides are known to ionize and be detected with widely differing efficiencies in mass spectrometers. Although protein conservation between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> is low (∼40% sequence identity), a higher-than-expected abundance correlation might still result if equivalent peptides in both organisms were correlated in their suitability for MS. We assessed the extent of this effect by making the spectral counts independent: For any given section in the alignment of two orthologs, only one of the proteins was allowed to generate peptide counts; these sections were alternated across the length of the alignment, effectively reducing the data by half. As expected, this lowered the abundance correlation, but not by much (<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.68). Importantly, the resulting correlation is still much higher than the correlation of transcript abundances across organisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since one of our original interests was to characterize the “core animal proteome,” we also analyzed lower-coverage datasets from two additional organisms: <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b030">30</xref>] and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Mus musculus</named-content> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b021">21</xref>]) (for the latter, we additionally included plasma data from PeptideAtlas; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.peptideatlas.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.peptideatlas.org/</ext-link>). Comparative proteomics using multiple organisms has recently become popular, for example in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b031">31</xref>], but has not yet been possible for animals. We searched for groups of orthologs that were detected in all four organisms; these would constitute the universally detectable eukaryotic proteome core. We found 847 such proteins, mostly from information-processing and metabolism genes. Conversely, we found 1,287 proteins to be detectable in all three animals, but not in yeast. This latter set might be considered the specific core of multicellular animal proteomes. However, it is clear that neither of these sets is complete, as of yet, mostly due to low coverage in mouse.</p>

        <title>Expression Levels of Duplicated Genes</title>
        <p>Our protein-abundance estimates from two organisms also allowed us to study in more detail the fate of duplicated genes. Here, of particular interest, are cases in which a gene family has duplicated in one lineage (fly or worm), but not in the other. It is known that long-term retention of duplicated gene copies requires neo- or subfunctionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b034">34</xref>], but it is unclear what consequences this has for overall protein-abundance levels. We found that when averaging over all cases of lineage-specific gene duplications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-sg006">Figure S6</xref>), the abundance of duplicated genes is significantly lower than that of their nonduplicated counterparts in the other lineage. Strikingly, however, when all the duplicated genes of a given gene family are pooled, they tend to add up again to the original abundance of the nonduplicated counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We describe here a comprehensive inventory of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteins, the functional characterization of this inventory, and the first-ever comparison of two such inventories between two model animals (“comparative proteomics”). Although some subsets of the proteome are more difficult to analyze (e.g., the membrane compartment), we achieved a relatively thorough representation of the genome, where the major exceptions can be explained biologically. For example, the systematic underrepresentation of seven-transmembrane proteins appears to be caused mainly by G protein–coupled receptors. The putative chemoreceptor gene families in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> encompass about 7% of its total genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b035">35</xref>], and many are thought to be expressed only in a few neurons each [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b016">16</xref>]. Despite their generally low abundance, we did identify 172 seven-transmembrane receptor proteins, showing that they are, in principle, amenable to high-throughput MS analysis (this is relevant, for example, for screens of putative therapeutic targets).</p>
      <p>We also demonstrated that a whole-proteome analysis of a model organism can contribute to an improved genome annotation. First, we experimentally confirmed the expression of 1,062 predicted genes for which no transcript data were available, but for which our proteome data allowed the extraction of a first rough expression pattern. Second, we identified novel peptides from spectra that could not be matched to annotated gene models, suggesting a way to more precisely map open reading frames and splice isoforms to the genome.</p>
      <p>With respect to genome organization, we found that, in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>, genes in operons are far more consistently and more strongly expressed than individually transcribed genes. In principle, this observation could be an artifact of genome annotation—if a disproportionally large number of annotated nonoperon genes were misannotations that are biologically meaningless. This is highly unlikely, however, since more than 6,000 such misannotations would be needed to reconcile the observed differences. Instead, it is likely that operons in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> indeed serve to group strongly expressed genes into coregulated transcription units. Another question that arises is whether these genes were highly expressed even <italic>before</italic> they were grouped into operons, which would hint at a possible selective advantage for the grouping (e.g., to enable more efficient, more reliable, or more uniform transcription of genes whose products are in high demand). This is difficult to address conclusively, but our comparison to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> provides some information: we observe that orthologs of operon genes are more strongly expressed even in the fly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-sg007">Figure S7</xref>), where they are not arranged in operons nor are even neighbors on the genome. If one assumes that the operons in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> are the derived state, then the corresponding genes were indeed already strongly expressed before they formed operons.</p>
      <p>The comparison of our data to the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> proteome also sheds some light on an important evolutionary puzzle, namely the surprisingly low correlation between mRNA expression levels of orthologous genes across animal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b037">37</xref>], despite evidence for strong stabilizing selection against expression changes in experimental evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b038">38</xref>]. We found that the abundances of orthologous proteins from worm and fly correlate well (<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.79), far better than the corresponding abundances of mRNA transcripts (<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic> &lt; 0.50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).</p>
      <p>There are several possible explanations for this finding: First, sweeping changes within the transcriptional machineries in one or both organisms could have resulted in global differences in transcript abundance, whereas selection would have kept protein abundances at least partially stable. One candidate for such a mechanistic change could be, for example, the unique trans-splicing mechanism of nematodes. A second possible explanation might be that posttranslational regulation may have changed systematically, for example due to differences in developmental strategies, physiology, or life styles of the two animals. Here, possibly relevant changes include the fixed cell lineage of nematodes, differences in reproductive strategies, increased endurance in nematodes (dauer stage), or the constraints imposed on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> because of its need for metamorphosis and its higher motility (flight).</p>
      <p>However, in our view, the most parsimonious explanation might be that many changes in the transcriptome might be neutral, or at least nearly neutral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b036">36</xref>]. Ultimately, it is the protein levels that are under selection. Protein levels are not only determined by mRNA abundance, but are equally affected by translation efficiencies, protein half-lives, and other factors. Genetic mutations resulting in small changes on any of these levels might persist for some time in a population, as long as their fitness effects are small (around 1/[2<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>] or less). This might be sufficient time to allow for compensatory mutations either in the same gene or elsewhere in the genome, which would reconstitute optimal protein abundance through action on the same or another factor that influences protein abundance. Thus, changes in mRNA expression could be offset by opposite changes in translation rate or protein half-life, and vice versa. Over evolutionary time scales, such small changes may accumulate, resulting in appreciable changes of mRNA abundance, whereas protein abundance would remain roughly constant. This model is a generalization of the concept of compensatory mutations that explains the rapid divergence of some <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory nucleotide sequences despite the maintenance of stable transcript levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b039">39</xref>], or the conserved expression of assembled protein complexes despite variable expression patterns of their individual components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b040">40</xref>].</p>
      <p>The presence of several interacting levels of protein-abundance regulation also would explain another two of our observations: a wide variance of the number of mature proteins per transcript, and a correspondingly low correlation between protein and transcript abundance within an organism (interestingly, the latter correlation is quite similar between our <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> data and data published in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b041">41</xref>] [<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.57]). Our data, in principle, provides an opportunity to study transcript features that would directly influence the ratio of proteins per transcript (and thereby potentially uncover novel mechanisms of translational regulation). However, when checking the influence of transcript length, GC content, or UTR length, we failed to detect correlations with protein/transcript ratios (unpublished data). We did observe a weak, but significant, positive correlation of our protein/transcript ratios and experimental protein half-life measurements of orthologous proteins in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b042">42</xref>] (unpublished data), suggesting that protein stability is indeed one of the factors determining the steady-state protein/transcript ratio.</p>
      <p>We note that the most abundant proteins (often found in central pathways like energy metabolism or protein synthesis) also tend to be the ones that show the best abundance correlation between species. This may simply be the case because of a greater relative measurement accuracy for abundant proteins. However, highly expressed genes are also more likely to be housekeeping genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b043">43</xref>], and may thus be more likely to be under the same evolutionary pressures in different organisms. Strong and constant stabilizing selection is also consistent with our observation that amino acid sequences of more highly expressed proteins evolve more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g005">Figure 5</xref>C), mirroring the analogous observation for mRNA expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b044">44</xref>].</p>
      <p>When we stratify proteins by functional categories, we find that those involved in translation and in core metabolism are those with the most highly correlated abundances across species. These functional groups are also those where the coexpression between pairs of transcripts is most highly conserved across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b045">45</xref>]. Furthermore, the same categories also tend to show the best correlation <italic>within</italic> each organism, with respect to rank-correlation between transcripts and proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-st002">Table S2</xref>). We also find that the correlation between transcript and protein levels is particularly poor for genes that are presumably heavily regulated (the categories “signal transduction” or “transcriptional regulation”), arguing for abundant posttranscriptional regulation in these functional classes.</p>
      <p>Proteins differ not only in their mean abundance, but also in the variance of this abundance among individuals (“noise”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b046">46</xref>]. Interestingly, whereas yeast proteins involved in translation also show low levels of noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b047">47</xref>], other groups of proteins found here to be conserved in their abundance between species (e.g., protein metabolism) are characterized by high protein expression noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b047">47</xref>]. Thus, it appears that abundance fluctuations on short time scales (within populations) are partially decoupled from fluctuations on long time scales (between species). However, as natural variation is the substrate of evolutionary change, we expect that changes in mRNA levels via compensatory mutations may occur faster in proteins that exhibit higher levels of noise; this remains to be tested in future studies.</p>
      <p>Our comparative analysis underlines clearly the necessity and usefulness of quantitative proteome analyses, since these better reflect the abundance of the actual effectors of biological processes. Most likely, the actual conservation of protein levels is even higher than what we report here, due to the shortcomings of a simple spectral-counting procedure. In fact, comparisons across organisms might generally provide a good test scenario to improve spectral-counting algorithms or other proteomics algorithms: the higher the abundance correlation, the more precise the measurements (due to the high number of data points, and due to the quickly changing positions of tryptic cleavages, this is difficult to “over-train” by choosing biased parameters). With respect to the transcriptomics datasets that we used, the above test argued for a better quality of the Affymetrix data, as compared to SAGE, because the latter were seen to correlate less well across organisms. This is intriguing, and it may point to additional biases in the SAGE procedure (for example, due to the added molecular biology steps of cleavage and ligation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b048">48</xref>].</p>
      <p>For those instances where orthologs were <italic>not</italic> found to be of similar abundance, one can speculate that this difference reflects differing roles (or even molecular functions) of the orthologs. Thus, these proteins are of particular interest when studying the evolutionary differences between species. Alternatively, differences in technical aspects for particular proteins might occur, such as shifted or absent trypsin cleavage sites or differences in protein solubility. Interestingly, we did not lose the observed interspecies correlation even for quite low-abundance proteins such as those involved in signal transduction (our measurements have a dynamic range of more than three orders of magnitude). This means that low-abundance measurements are still quantitative, at least to some degree.</p>
      <p>In our analysis of gene families with lineage-specific duplications, we found that duplicated proteins generally have lower abundance than their nonduplicated counterparts, whereas the summed abundances per gene family remained roughly constant. This finding might be most parsimoniously explained by a prevalence of subfunctionalization among duplicated genes, although it is also consistent with other scenarios (e.g., complementarity of tissue expression domains, functional fine-tuning, or subfunctionalization followed by neofunctionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b049">49</xref>]). Of course, protein abundances alone cannot directly inform us about any changes in the functions of duplicated genes. However, our finding does suggest that cases where an increased demand for protein product would provide the sole driving force behind gene copy retention are probably rare.</p>
      <p>With our dataset, we established an inventory of where and how proteins of interest can be specifically accessed using MS. It enables the generation of a proteotypic peptide library (i.e., peptides in a protein sequence that are most likely to be consistently and confidently observed by current MS-based proteomics methods). This library in turn can be used for targeted analyses and comparative studies of expressed proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b052">52</xref>] by spiking the samples to be analyzed with chemically synthesized proteotypic peptides, or by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) MS. Our <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteome dataset will be made publicly available within WormBase and will thus be useful for the entire <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> research community. In general, proteomics data like ours is closer to the biologically active players than transcriptomics data. It should therefore be increasingly used to investigate biological phenomena and mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis such as neuronal degeneration and cancer development, and for the identification of conserved therapeutic target proteins.</p>

For the quantitative analysis, however, such peptides were assigned fractionally (see below). From a total of 18 different experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-st003">Table S3</xref>), we identified 10,977 proteins from 10,631 gene loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-st001">Table S1</xref>).

To do this, WormBase release WS160 was used to translate each chromosome into all six reading frames.

A subset of our data (experiment 15) obtained by isoelectric focusing, comprising approximately 304,000 MS/MS spectra, was searched at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich. We allowed fully tryptic peptides with up to two missed cleavages, and specified oxidized methionine as variable modification and carbamylated cysteine as static modification. The results were further analyzed with PeptideProphet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b054">54</xref>], and 27,940 search hits with a PeptideProphet score greater than or equal to 0.95 were selected.

This analysis retrieved 4,184 loci in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>, and 4,302 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>. When working with orthology sets, each pair of orthologs was aligned with “muscle” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b056">56</xref>], available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drive5.com/muscle/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.drive5.com/muscle/</ext-link>. The protein sequences used were extracted from WormBase WS160 and from FlyBase release 5.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org" xlink:type="simple">http://flybase.org</ext-link>). Due to lineage-specific gene duplications, some proteins had several orthologs. For the interspecies abundance correlation comparison, we summed up the abundances in these cases.</p>
        <p>We independently tested another source of orthology information, InParanoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b057">57</xref>], which resulted in slightly more orthologs but also in a somewhat lower interspecies abundance correlation (<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.76 versus 0.79). Conversely, we also tested a stricter set of orthologs, to test for and exclude artifacts caused by potentially undetected paralogy. To conclusively separate orthologs from paralogs can be difficult, and this is the subject of intense study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b060">60</xref>]. Therefore, we constructed a very strict set of orthologs by searching for reciprocal best matches between worm and fly, with the additional constraint that any extra homologs within these genomes had to exhibit no more than half the alignment score than the score <italic>between</italic> these organism (plus, the score between the organisms had to be 60 bits or higher). This strict set contained only 2,001 pairs of orthologs, and resulted in an interspecies abundance correlation of 0.80. This shows that our high correlation is not caused, or affected, by the presence of paralogs in the comparison.</p>
        <p>We calculated the relative abundance of a protein by counting how often any of its amino acids had been identified in any peptide, divided by the total number of amino acids of the protein sequence. A length restriction to peptides with ≥7 and ≤40 amino acids (modified from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b022">22</xref>]) was applied.</p>

        <p>where <italic>a</italic> = protein abundance, <italic>p</italic> = identified peptides, <italic>q</italic> = tryptic peptides (in silico digest), and <italic>f</italic>(<italic>q</italic>) = peptide length correction factor.</p>
        <p>The peptide-length correction factor takes into account the technical bias of the MS instrument, which resulted in certain peptide lengths being observed more often than others. This was learned from the data by comparing the observed peptide-length spectrum with the expected, and was corrected accordingly (similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b022">22</xref>]). In our hands, peptide length proved to be the most important determinant of peptide observability, since using the original APEX implementation (“absolution protein expression profiling”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b022">22</xref>] or a retrained version of the same classifier, did not further improve the observed cross-organism abundance correlation between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> (<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.78).</p>
        <p>A relative protein abundance of 1 means that the total number of amino acids in the identified peptides equals the number of amino acids in the protein. Whenever a peptide could be assigned to several proteins (because of identical predicted tryptic peptides), the amino acids were assigned fractionally. Peptides specific for any of the splice isoforms originating from a given locus were pooled. This approach means that the unit of interest in our comparisons is the gene locus—not individual splice isoforms—consistent with the observed lack of conservation of alternative splicing at very large evolutionary distances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b061">61</xref>]. Finally, protein abundances were normalized to total amount of protein detected. To plot the data, orthologs were binned into eight groups of equal size (sorting for binning was <italic>x</italic> + <italic>y</italic>), and the means, as well as first and third quartiles, for each group were calculated. For the comparison of gene and protein expression, SAGE data for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b027">27</xref>] were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tock.bcgsc.bc.ca/cgi-bin/sage160" xlink:type="simple">http://tock.bcgsc.bc.ca/cgi-bin/sage160</ext-link>. In order to best reflect the developmental stages analyzed in our proteome data, we chose the stages SWN21, SWL12, SWL21, SWL32, SWL41, SWYA1, MIXED, SW022, and DAUER. Only entries with “source = coding_RNA” were considered, and the average of the nine columns was calculated. SAGE data for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b029">29</xref>] were obtained from Professor San Ming Wang (Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois). <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> SAGE tags were mapped to all transcripts from FlyBase release 5.3. The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> Affymetrix GeneChip data were obtained from the Genome British Columbia <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> Gene Expression Consortium at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elegans.bcgsc.bc.ca" xlink:type="simple">http://elegans.bcgsc.bc.ca</ext-link>. The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> Affymetrix GeneChip data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b028">28</xref>] were obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flyatlas.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.flyatlas.org</ext-link>. For 2,695 pairs of orthologs protein abundance, SAGE and Affymetrix data were compared (in case of several paralogs, only one of them had to have data from all three measurements). For the comparisons of different abundances, Spearman rank correlation coefficients were computed to avoid assumptions about the underlying distributions. Probabilities for the correlation coefficients were calculated as implemented in R; all corresponding <italic>p-</italic>values were better than 2.2E−16. Further supporting the validity of spectral counting as a semiquantitative measure is a comparison of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> protein abundance data against protein abundance data in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000048-b041">41</xref>]. Importantly, the latter is <italic>not</italic> based on MS, but on immunodetection of tagged open reading frames. Orthologs correlate linearly in their abundance over two orders of magnitude (<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.54; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000048-sg010">Figure S10</xref>). The correlation for sequence conservation (aligned to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>) and protein abundance was calculated for 4,013 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> proteins. Orthologs were binned into eight groups of equal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000048-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).</p>

          <title>Down-Sampling of Proteomics Data to Ensure Independence of Peptide Counts</title>
          <p>Individually aligned pairs of orthologs were scanned for residues R and K, in order to identify aligned tryptic cleavage sites (red vertical lines). Peptide identifications were then down-sampled in alternating stretches of the alignment, to make sure that orthologous peptides are counted for one of the two organisms only. The Spearman rank correlation dropped to 0.68. Intriguingly, this result is almost identical to what is expected simply due to the reduction of the data by half (<italic>R<sub>S</sub></italic> = 0.67 when randomly discarding 50% of the peptides); this shows that the strong correlation between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> is not simply due to a tendency of orthologous peptides to be detected equally well. To also exclude local effects (i.e., dependencies between neighboring peptides), an independent test was performed for which proteins were cut in half, and N-terminal and C-terminal fragments were counted separately. In this test, when comparing orthologous proteins only via nonoverlapping halves (N-terminus versus C-terminus), the cross-organism correlation dropped to 0.66. In contrast, when comparing N-termini with N-termini (or C-termini with C-termini), the correlation was higher (0.71). This indicates that there are indeed some local dependencies between peptide counts, but not enough to explain the high interorganism correlation we observe when using the full data.</p>
