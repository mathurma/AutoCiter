        <p>Thermodynamic measurements of ion binding to the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Streptomyces lividans</named-content> K<sup>+</sup> channel were carried out using isothermal titration calorimetry, whereas atomic structures of ion-bound and ion-free conformations of the channel were characterized by x-ray crystallography. Here we use these assays to show that the ion radius dependence of selectivity stems from the channel's recognition of ion size (i.e., volume) rather than charge density. Ion size recognition is a function of the channel's ability to adopt a very specific conductive structure with larger ions (K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, and Ba<sup>2+</sup>) bound and not with smaller ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>). The formation of the conductive structure involves selectivity filter atoms that are in direct contact with bound ions as well as protein atoms surrounding the selectivity filter up to a distance of 15 Å from the ions. We conclude that ion selectivity in a K<sup>+</sup> channel is a property of size-matched ion binding sites created by the protein structure.</p>

          <p>The exquisite selectivity of potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) channels in cellular membranes allows them to pass K<sup>+</sup> ions while restricting the closely related sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions, and thereby maintain the electrical potential across cellular membranes. In this study, we address the fundamental question: how does the K<sup>+</sup> channel discriminate between K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions? Past studies have relied on nonequilibrium measurements of ionic current flow. We measured heat exchange associated with ion binding to the channel under equilibrium conditions and determined crystal structures of ion-bound and ion-free forms of the channel. By studying a series of alkali metal and alkaline earth cations, we documented the effect of varying systematically the ionic charge and radius, and we discovered that the K<sup>+</sup> channel recognizes an ion's size rather than its electric field strength. By analyzing the structures, we show that the channel's ability to recognize an ion's size is a function of protein atoms that are both near to and far away from the ion binding sites. This study opens a new window into ion selectivity in channels and also contributes to our expanding knowledge of the emerging role of long-range interactions in ligand recognition.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Potassium channels conduct K<sup>+</sup> ions at nearly diffusion-limited rates, and at the same time, they prevent Na<sup>+</sup> ions from conducting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b001">1</xref>]. The ability to distinguish between K<sup>+</sup> ions (Pauling ionic radius 1.33 Å) and Na<sup>+</sup> ions (Pauling ionic radius 0.95 Å) occurs within a segment of the pore known as the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Inside the selectivity filter, K<sup>+</sup> ions are coordinated by oxygen atoms from the protein, which replace the water molecules that normally surround a hydrated ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b003">3</xref>].</p>

      <p>Several different operational definitions of ion selectivity or relative permeability exist in the electrophysiology literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b005">5</xref>]. Ion selectivity is sometimes quantified by comparing the conduction rates of different ions, which is analogous to defining the substrate specificity of an enzyme by measuring the catalytic rate with different substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b007">7</xref>]. Other times, ion selectivity is defined by a measure of the degree to which one ion will conduct relative to another (out compete) when both ions are present in solution at the same time, akin to a substrate competition assay. These different definitions are not related in any simple manner, and their physical interpretation (in terms of the interaction energy between an ion and the channel) depends on specific details of the conduction mechanism.</p>
      <p>Because ion channels generally operate far from equilibrium, it seems reasonable to define ion selectivity as electrophysiologists have, by using the nonequilibrium conditions under which channels normally function. On the other hand it should be possible to characterize ion selectivity under equilibrium conditions if one had a method for quantifying the affinities of different ions for the channel. Selectivity defined in such a way would depend not on the kinetic details of the conduction mechanism, but rather on the energy difference between the ion-bound and unbound states, which should be directly related to the atomic structures of these states.</p>
      <p>In this study, we have measured ion binding to a K<sup>+</sup> channel under equilibrium conditions using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and we have determined the structures of ion-bound and ion-free forms of the channel. These experiments permit us to correlate structural and thermodynamic properties of selective ion binding. Our aim is to understand which property of an ion (i.e., size or charge density) is recognized by the channel and which properties of the channel create an energetically favorable match for the ion.</p>

        <title>Alkali Metal Ion Binding to KcsA Using ITC</title>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g002">Figure 2</xref>A shows an ITC experiment in which a solution containing KCl is titrated into a solution containing <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Streptomyces lividans</named-content> K<sup>+</sup> channels (KcsA) in NaCl. Each downward deflection results from the heat of diluting KCl from the injection syringe solution into the reaction chamber plus the net heat of transfer of K<sup>+</sup> ions from solution to the channel. There are several points to note about this titration. First, there is a gradual decrease in the amount of heat liberated upon successive KCl injections until a constant level is eventually reached. This pattern suggests that the channel's binding sites are becoming saturated so that the final injections represent only the heat of diluting the concentrated KCl solution into the protein solution. In control experiments in which the channel protein is not present in the reaction chamber, one observes only this constant heat of dilution. Second, the binding reaction is exothermic, which means the transfer of K<sup>+</sup> ions from water to the channel is enthalpically favored. And third, the rate of heat release (and thus K<sup>+</sup> binding) is relatively slow, as evidenced by the longer duration of the deflections in the beginning compared to the end of the titration.</p>

The inset contains the same data plotted in a more familiar fashion: the fraction of total heat liberated (the transient component due to K<sup>+</sup> binding) as a function of the K<sup>+</sup> concentration. A detailed description of the ion binding model, which is based on a combination of ITC and x-ray crystallographic data, is given in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.</p>

        <title>Filter Conformational Change Underlying Ion Binding</title>
        <p>Crystal structures of KcsA show that its selectivity filter can exist in two distinct conformations associated with low and high concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b009">9</xref>]. In solutions containing less than 5 mM KCl and 150 mM NaCl, the filter adopts a nonconductive conformation, which is pinched closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, left). Crystallographic occupancy studies show that in this conformation, ions bind at the ends of the filter (sites 1 and 4), with up to a single K<sup>+</sup> ion distributed over these two sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b009">9</xref>]. As the concentration of K<sup>+</sup> in the crystallization solution is increased, a second ion enters, in association with a conformational change of the filter to the conductive form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, right). In the conductive form, two K<sup>+</sup> ions are distributed over four sites, each with approximately half occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b010">10</xref>]. The crystallographic data have thus demonstrated that the entry of a K<sup>+</sup> ion (into the middle of the filter, sites 2 and 3) is associated with a specific conformational change of the selectivity filter.</p>

        <p>Is the heat transfer associated with ion binding correlated with the filter conformational change? To address this question, we studied a mutant channel, M96V, which crystallographically remains in the nonconductive conformation at K<sup>+</sup> concentrations up to 300 mM K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In the ITC assay of this mutant channel, no detectable heat is liberated upon addition of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">3</xref>D). This mutant channel in every other respect appears like the wild-type channel at low concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>; the only difference is that as the K<sup>+</sup> concentration is raised, the channel fails to undergo the nonconductive-to-conductive conformational change (and thus fails to bind a K<sup>+</sup> ion at sites 2 and 3). These observations suggest that the heat measured in the ITC assay on the wild-type channel is liberated when the filter undergoes its conformational change and binds a K<sup>+</sup> ion at sites 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).</p>
        <p>The coupling of an ion-binding event to a conformational change of the filter can explain why the rate of ion binding is slow in the ITC assay. The readjustment of protein atoms occurs up to a distance of 15 Å from the ion pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The atomic displacements are essentially the same whether K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup><sub>,</sub> or Cs<sup>+</sup> ions bind (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050121-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). It is undoubtedly significant that the conformational change involves amino acids that are highly coupled to one another in an analysis of sequence co-evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). We suspect that these amino acids have been constrained by natural selection to enable the filter to bind K<sup>+</sup> at sites 2 and 3, but not Na<sup>+</sup>.</p>

        <p>The data discussed so far support the following conclusions. Alkali metal ions K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, and Cs<sup>+</sup> can bind to the internal sites (2 or 3) of the selectivity filter. Their binding is associated with a specific conformational change of the filter to a conductive form and an exchange of heat with the environment. Na<sup>+</sup> (and presumably Li<sup>+</sup>) does not bind to sites 2 or 3, stabilize the conductive conformation, or liberate heat.</p>

By studying the alkali metal ion series, we have documented how the ionic radius affects the ability of a +1 ion to interact with the selectivity filter.

        <p>For Ba<sup>2+</sup><sub>,</sub> Δ<italic>H</italic>° is positive (unfavorable), but a large favorable entropy term, Δ<italic>S</italic>°, results in a free energy change Δ<italic>G</italic>° for binding that is actually slightly more favorable for Ba<sup>2+</sup> than for K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050121-t001">Table 1</xref>). The important point, however, is that Ba<sup>2+</sup> binds to the filter, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> do not. This means the size cut-off for selective binding of +2 cations occurs between Ca<sup>2+</sup> (radius 0.99 Å), which does not bind, and Ba<sup>2+</sup> (radius 1.35 Å), which binds. This is the same size cut-off that is observed in the +1 alkali metal cation series. The ability of Ba<sup>2+</sup> to bind to the selectivity filter as measured using ITC is in good agreement with electrophysiological studies on the interaction of Ba<sup>2+</sup> with K<sup>+</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b012">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>Does Ba<sup>2+</sup> binding require the protein conformational change within the filter? An earlier structure of a Ba<sup>2+</sup> complex of KcsA could not address this question because it was determined at low resolution (5 Å) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b013">13</xref>]. We have determined a Ba<sup>2+</sup> structure with crystals that diffract to 2.7 Å. A 2Fo-Fc electron density map calculated after omitting the selectivity filter and ions is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, blue mesh). An x-ray anomalous signal defines unequivocally the location of Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions in the filter at site 4, as determined previously at lower resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b013">13</xref>], and near site 2 at the center of the filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, magenta mesh). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g006">Figure 6</xref>B shows in superposition the structures of the Ba<sup>2+</sup> complex (yellow), the conductive K<sup>+</sup> complex (blue), and the nonconductive (low K<sup>+</sup>) KcsA structure (red). At amino acid glycine 77, whose carbonyl oxygen atom coordinates the Ba<sup>2+</sup> ion near site 2, the carbonyl carbon resides at a location in between the conductive and nonconductive conformations. Everywhere else, protein atoms of the Ba<sup>2+</sup> complex adopt the conductive structure, as can be seen by the side chain rotamer of valine 76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g006">Figure 6</xref>B) and the superposition of aromatic amino acids surrounding the filter for the Ba<sup>2+</sup> and conductive K<sup>+</sup> structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Thus, size selective binding of +2 cations (i.e., Ba<sup>2+</sup> and not Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>) depends on the ability of the filter to adopt the conductive conformation, just as for monovalent cations.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>By studying a series of ions with different atomic radii, we observe a dependence on the ability of ions to bind to the interior of the selectivity filter. Among the alkali metal ions, K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup> bind and liberate heat, whereas Na<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> does not. Among the alkaline earth ions, Ba<sup>2+</sup> binds, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> do not. The binding events are correlated with specific protein conformational changes, which enable a selected ion to bind to sites 2 or 3 of the selectivity filter.</p>
      <p>The thermodynamic measurements of ion binding correlate in a qualitative manner with the ability of K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup><sub>,</sub> and Cs<sup>+</sup> to conduct through K<sup>+</sup> channels and the ability of Ba<sup>2+</sup> to enter the pore and cause blockage. In quantitative detail, however, the “permeability sequence” determined electrophysiologically is not the same as the binding affinity sequence determined in this study. The permeability of K<sup>+</sup> for most K<sup>+</sup> channels is slightly greater than that of Rb<sup>+</sup>, which is greater than that of Cs<sup>+</sup>, whereas the permeability of Na<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> is extremely small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b014">14</xref>]. Ba<sup>2+</sup> blocks K<sup>+</sup> conduction but itself, conducts poorly. In the setting of these significant electrophysiological differences between the ions, the equilibrium binding affinities for K<sup>+</sup>, Rb<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup><sub>,</sub> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> are fairly similar to each other (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050121-t001">Table 1</xref>). This difference between permeability (large variation) and affinity (small variation) is not a discrepancy, because permeability and binding affinity are two different entities. Permeability is a nonequilibrium quantity reporting how well an ion conducts, which depends on the depth of energy wells and the height of energy barriers encountered by ions as they diffuse through the pore. Binding affinity is an equilibrium quantity and depends on the path-independent energy difference between the reactants (channel + ion) and product (complex).</p>
      <p>How does the ion-binding event that is the focus of this study relate to ion conduction? The affinity of the K<sup>+</sup> ion for the filter (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> ∼ 0.5 mM) precludes the possibility that transport is simply the forward and backward steps of the binding reaction. The <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> places an upper limit on the rate at which an ion can dissociate (and thus be transported) because <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> × <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>. For example, if <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> were diffusion limited and had a rate of 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>; then <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> would limit <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> (and therefore the conduction rate) to about 10<sup>5</sup> ions s<sup>−1</sup>. Thus, we assume that when the filter is conducting ions at a high rate (up to about 10<sup>8</sup> ions s<sup>−1</sup>), it remains in its conductive conformation as ions flow through. This assumption is compatible with the slow rates of ion binding in the ITC assay: once binding has occurred in association with the conformational transition to the conductive form, which may be slow, K<sup>+</sup> can then diffuse through at a high rate.</p>
      <p>The above discussion implies that the ITC experiments record an ion-binding event (associated with a protein conformational change) that is not a step in the conduction process, but rather one that puts the filter into its conductive conformation. Nevertheless, the specificity of this binding event (K<sup>+</sup> and not Na<sup>+</sup> mediated) appears to be deeply rooted in the ability of the filter to select the correct ion by stabilizing a specific (conductive) structure in response to ions that satisfy a certain criterion.</p>
      <p>What is the criterion or physical property of an ion that allows it to enter the filter and stabilize the conductive conformation? Obviously ion size is important. Is this because the binding site(s) favor an ion for its size or for the strength of the electric field near its surface? The electric field strength, which is proportional to the charge density, is of course a function of an ion's size. By studying ions with different ionic radii and different charges, we find that the ability to bind and stabilize the conductive conformation depends on the same cut-off radius for both +1 and +2 cations. If the ability of an ion to bind depended on field strength as a “primary” property, then Na<sup>+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup> should be similar. This is not the case: K<sup>+</sup> and Ba<sup>2+</sup>, which have different electric field strengths at their surface but nearly the same size, bind with similar affinities. This result informs us that an ion's size, not simply through the effect of size on field strength, is an important criterion for selectivity in K<sup>+</sup> channels.</p>
      <p>How does the K<sup>+</sup> channel detect the size of an ion? The crystal structures in different ionic solutions show that the selectivity filter has the potential to adopt two distinct, well-defined conformations that we call conductive and nonconductive. The conductive conformation is associated with ion-binding sites that are each formed by eight carbonyl oxygen atoms (sites 1–3) surrounding a “hole” into which a K<sup>+</sup> ion snugly fits and satisfies its preference for six to eight coordinating oxygen atoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b015">15</xref>]. A very slight rotation of the carbon–oxygen bond permits larger ions such as Rb<sup>+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup> to fit snugly into these same sites without perturbing the conductive conformation. The sites in the conductive conformation are not compatible with the smaller radius of Na<sup>+</sup>: given only Na<sup>+</sup> in solution, we observe experimentally that the channel enters the nonconductive conformation rather than binding Na<sup>+</sup> at sites 2 and 3 (i.e., the nonconductive channel is more stable than a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound conductive channel). Thus, in answering the question how does the K<sup>+</sup> channel detect the size of an ion, we are led to conclude that the conductive conformation is associated with ion-binding sites that match the size of K<sup>+</sup> but are too large for Na<sup>+</sup>. The channel is thus able to compensate for the dehydration energy of K<sup>+</sup> but not Na<sup>+</sup>.</p>
      <p>It is the conductive conformation of the channel rather than the transition from nonconductive to conductive that confers selectivity. After all, when the nonconductive conformation is prevented by mutation, the channel still binds K<sup>+</sup> selectively over Na<sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b016">16</xref>]. However, the crystallographically observed transition is fortuitous, because it reveals to us the regions of the channel that are responsible for creating the binding sites as they are in the conductive conformation. The filter atoms and the surrounding protein atoms are important for creating the selective ion-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
      <p>The above data and conclusions are in agreement with the general ideas behind the “snug fit” hypothesis of Armstrong and Hille for ion binding in a selective channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b018">18</xref>]. The data are not in agreement with a recent study using molecular dynamic simulations of KcsA, in which it was suggested that structural constraints imposed by the channel protein are not important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b019">19</xref>]. The authors of the simulation study proposed that selectivity is a function of local chemical interactions provided by a relatively unstructured carbonyl oxygen selectivity filter (described as liquid-like), which creates a proper electrostatic environment for K<sup>+</sup>. Local interactions between carbonyl oxygen atoms and K<sup>+</sup> ions are certainly important, but the data presented here would seem to suggest that the protein structure is actually very important in the creation of size-constrained (does not mean rigid) ion binding sites. The recent structure of a cation-selective channel, called the NaK channel, reinforces this same conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b020">20</xref>]. Its selectivity filter contains two binding sites that are chemically identical (in terms of the coordinating oxygen atoms) to sites 3 and 4 in a K<sup>+</sup> channel, and yet these sites are not very selective for K<sup>+</sup> over Na<sup>+</sup>, apparently because the surrounding protein atoms are different and thus impose different constraints upon the sites.</p>
      <p>It is useful to place selectivity in the K<sup>+</sup> channel in the broader context of ion selectivity by synthetic host molecules. Cram, Lehn, and Pedersen demonstrated that ion selectivity could be achieved by constraining the size of the binding site to match the size of the ion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b023">23</xref>]. We suggest that the K<sup>+</sup> channel achieves selectivity by the very same principle, using the protein structure to create carbonyl oxygen-based ion- binding sites that are appropriately sized for K<sup>+</sup> and not for Na<sup>+</sup>. In the K<sup>+</sup> channel, we observe a new level of complexity added to this principle of size selectivity: the presence of K<sup>+</sup>-selective sites 2 and 3 is coupled to a specific conductive conformation of the selectivity filter. Consequently, K<sup>+</sup>—the ion that is to be conducted—stabilizes the conductive conformation. The K<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change represents a form of selectivity, because in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> (i.e., in the presence of only Na<sup>+</sup>, which should not be conducted), the filter goes into a nonconductive conformation.</p>

        <p>Crystal structures show two distinct conformations of the selectivity filter, nonconductive (NX), and conductive (CX<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). NX is observed at low [K<sup>+</sup>], and CX<sub>2</sub> is observed at high [K<sup>+</sup>]. Full K<sup>+</sup> titrations were carried out between these conformations using crystallography, from which we concluded that K<sup>+</sup> stabilizes the conductive conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b009">9</xref>].</p>
        <p>State N is never observed crystallographically, even at high concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup>, where the filter adopts its nonconductive conformation, which we correspond to state NX. Since we never observe state N, we assume that <italic>K</italic><sub>0</sub> is very large, so the quadratic term ([X]<sup>2</sup>) can be dropped and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0050121-e001">Equation 1</xref> is approximated by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0050121-e002">Equation 2</xref>, a rectangular hyperbola (<italic>n</italic> = 1 binding isotherm) with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = (1 + <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub>)/<italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>K</italic><sub>2</sub> (referred to as <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> in the text)..

				</p>
        <p>The ITC titration of the wild-type channel is consistent with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0050121-e002">Equation 2</xref>, since the data fit well to an <italic>n</italic> = 1 binding isotherm, and attempts to fit <italic>n</italic> ≠ 1 do not significantly improve χ<sup>2</sup>. One might wish to argue that the equilibrium process N to NX could be coming in to the mechanism, but is simply not detectable as a significant deviation from <italic>n</italic> = 1. Such an occurrence would not change the conclusions of this study.</p>
        <p>State CX is also never observed but is included, because we know from crystallography that the pore goes from its nonconductive conformation, with one ion in it at the beginning of a K<sup>+</sup> titration, to its conductive conformation, with two ions in it at the end. Mutation M96V prevents CX<sub>2</sub> (filter remains in NX) even at high [K<sup>+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Crystallographic ion occupancy studies show that NX harbors an ion near one of its entryways (referred to as binding sites 1 or 4) but not in the middle (at sites 2 or 3), whereas CX<sub>2</sub> harbors an ion near one of its entryways (sites 1 or 4) and in the middle (sites 2 or 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b009">9</xref>]. Thus, in the reaction scheme, the transition governed by equilibrium constant <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub> describes a conformational change of the filter from NX to CX and the transition governed by <italic>K</italic><sub>2</sub> describes the entry of a single K<sup>+</sup> into the middle of the conductive filter (to occupy site 2 or 3). Because only states NX and CX<sub>2</sub> are observed experimentally, we assume that <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub> favors NX and that <italic>K</italic><sub>2</sub> favors CX<sub>2</sub>.</p>
        <p>According to this scheme, upon addition of K<sup>+</sup> in our calorimetric titration the formation of the CX<sub>2</sub> state occurs in two steps. We make no assumptions about the detailed origins of the heat generated (i.e., which steps contribute). However, it is an important observation that the mutation M96V prevents the NX to CX<sub>2</sub> conformational transition as documented by crystallographic experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), and it also prevents the exchange of heat in the ITC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). In essence, the heat serves as a signal for the nonconductive-to-conductive transition, and thus enables us to investigate how different ions react with the filter under equilibrium conditions.</p>

        <title>Fitting the ITC data.</title>
        <p>The data were fit in Origin to the equations provided in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b008">8</xref>] (fix <italic>n</italic> = 1). A constant background was subtracted because the 100-mM NaCl in the cell and syringe created an environment where the heat of diluting the ions from the syringe is constant; an example of this can be seen both in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g002">Figures 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">3</xref>D, where ions do not bind to KcsA. This background was determined from the integration of the final injections and the minimization of χ<sup>2</sup> for the overall fit. Ideally, to fit <italic>n, K,</italic> and <italic>H</italic> as independent variables, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of binding sites, <italic>K</italic> is the association constant, and <italic>H</italic> is the enthalpy of the reaction, the product of the association constant and the concentration of protein in the cell (termed “c”) should be within the range of 5–500 (see Micro Calorimetry System ITC manual and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b008">8</xref>]). If c &lt; 5, such as in our case where c &lt; 0.3, it is still possible to fit <italic>K</italic> and <italic>H</italic> if outside knowledge of the stoichiometry of binding is known and if the binding sites are at least nearly saturated during the titration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050121-b024">24</xref>]. The fit and error to the fit for <italic>K</italic> and <italic>H</italic> for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g002">Figure 2</xref>B are <italic>K</italic> = 2440 ± 150 M<sup>−1</sup> and <italic>H</italic> = −1402 ± 49 cal/mol, indicating an excellent fit of the data to the model.

        <title>ITC measurements with high KCl (wild-type and M96V KcsA).</title>
        <p>No K<sup>+</sup> ion binding to M96V KcsA was seen in the experimental range described above with up to 35 mM KCl in the syringe (unpublished data). However, it is possible that K<sup>+</sup> would bind M96V with a lower affinity than wild type, requiring a higher [KCl] solution in the syringe. The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050121-g003">3</xref>D were performed with a sample cell solution containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM DM and 142 μM KcsA, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 400 mM KCl, and 5 mM DM in the injection syringe. The different salt concentrations were necessary to compensate for the heat of diluting the 400 mM KCl in the syringe, which when injected into a cell containing 100 mM NaCl, dominated the enthalpy from ion binding to the wild-type channel. To reduce this dilution effect, the NaCl concentration in the cell was adjusted to counterbalance the KCl in the syringe until significant binding of K<sup>+</sup> to wild-type KcsA was observed, which occurred at 250 mM NaCl.</p>
