</abstract><abstract>
<p>Pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are the starting point from which to generate organ specific cell types. For example, converting pluripotent cells to retinal cells could provide an opportunity to treat retinal injuries and degenerations. In this study, we used an in vivo strategy to determine if functional retinas could be generated from a defined population of pluripotent <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> cells. Animal pole cells isolated from blastula stage embryos are pluripotent. Untreated, these cells formed only epidermis, when transplanted to either the flank or eye field. In contrast, misexpression of seven transcription factors induced the formation of retinal cell types. Induced retinal cells were committed to a retinal lineage as they formed eyes when transplanted to the flanks of developing embryos. When the endogenous eye field was replaced with induced retinal cells, they formed eyes that were molecularly, anatomically, and electrophysiologically similar to normal eyes. Importantly, induced eyes could guide a vision-based behavior. These results suggest the fate of pluripotent cells may be purposely altered to generate multipotent retinal progenitor cells, which differentiate into functional retinal cell classes and form a neural circuitry sufficient for vision.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The goal of regenerative medicine is to replace dead or dying cells. Successful cell replacement depends on the ability of donor cells to differentiate into all functional cell types lost in the target organ. Blindness resulting from retinal disease or damage, for example, would require the replacement of as many as seven specialized cell types found in the retina. The most celebrated characteristic of pluripotent cells is their ability to differentiate into any adult cell type. This defining feature, however, presents the challenge of identifying the conditions for their conversion to the cell types needed for tissue repair. We asked if pluripotent cells could be directed to generate all the retinal cell types necessary to form a functional eye in the frog, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>. If left untreated, transplanted pluripotent cells only form the epidermal layer of the skin. However, when forced to express the eye field transcription factor (EFTF) genes, the cells differentiate into all seven retinal cell classes and eventually organize themselves into a functioning eye that can detect light and guide tadpoles in a vision-based behavior. Our results demonstrate that pluripotent cells can be purposely altered to generate all the functional retinal cell classes necessary for sight.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Every body organ consists of tissue groups with multiple cell types. Therefore, recovery from organ damage requires the replacement of a variety of distinct cell types. The retina is the light detecting tissue of the eye, and consists of seven major cell classes. All retinal cell classes are generated from a common multipotent retinal progenitor. The conversion of pluripotent cells to retinal progenitors would, in theory, provide a source of all the cell classes necessary for retinal repair.</p>
<p>Pluripotent cells treated with extrinsic factors express retinal markers in vitro and in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Dong1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Lamba2">[5]</xref>. When transplanted to the subretinal space of mice lacking functional photoreceptors, human embryonic stem cells directed toward a retinal lineage integrate into the outer nuclear layer, express photoreceptor markers, and restore a light response as determined by the electroretinogram (ERG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Lamba2">[5]</xref>. However, it is not known if any other functional retinal cell classes can be derived from pluripotent cells, or if these cells can form the complex neural network necessary for vision.</p>
<p>Vertebrate retina formation begins in the anterior neural plate in a region called the eye field. A group of transcription factors collectively called the eye field transcription factors or EFTFs (<italic>pax6</italic>, <italic>rx1</italic>, <italic>tbx3</italic> [or <italic>ET</italic>], <italic>nr2e1</italic> [or <italic>tailless</italic>], <italic>six3</italic>, <italic>lhx2</italic>, and <italic>six6</italic> [or <italic>optx2</italic>]) and the neural patterning gene <italic>otx2</italic> are essential for normal eye formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Zuber1">[6]</xref>. When overexpressed together in developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos by RNA microinjection, these genes can induce eye-like structures as defined by the expression of markers for some retinal cell classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Zuber2">[7]</xref>. The overall aim of this study was to determine if pluripotent cells overexpressing these transcription factors could be intentionally driven toward retinal progenitors that differentiate into multiple retinal cell classes and form a functional retina.</p>
<p>Primitive ectoderm cells isolated from the animal pole of blastula stage embryos are pluripotent. If treated with the appropriate inducer, they can form endodermal, mesodermal, or ectodermal cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Green1">[8]</xref>. Here we provide evidence that these pluripotent cells misexpressing the EFTFs differentiate into all retinal cell classes. Using both the ERG and a vision-based behavioral assay, we found that eyes generated from EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells are molecularly and functionally similar to the normal eye. These results suggest that by using the correct combination of gene products, it may be possible to reprogram more readily available pluripotent cell types to a multipotent retinal cell lineage useful in healing damaged or diseased retinas.</p>

<title>EFTFs Induce an Eye Field-Like Transcriptional Profile in Pluripotent Cells</title>
<p>Coordinated misexpression of the EFTFs (<italic>pax6</italic>, <italic>tbx3</italic>, <italic>rx1</italic>, <italic>nr2e1</italic>, <italic>six3</italic>, and <italic>six6</italic>) and <italic>otx2</italic> in developing embryos results in formation of ectopic eye tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Zuber2">[7]</xref>. One interpretation of this result is that EFTFs induce an eye field-like fate in pluripotent cells. This interpretation predicts that transcripts expressed in the eye field should also be induced in EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells. Therefore, we used microarray analysis to perform pairwise comparisons of the transcriptional profile of EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells to three regions of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo: the eye field (EF) including underlying mesendoderm, posterior neural plate (PNP) and the non-neural, flank, lateral endoderm (LE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Of approximately 14,400 transcripts evaluated by the Affymetrix GeneChip <italic>X. laevis</italic> Genome Array, 365 were induced greater than 2-fold in EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells. Of the 365 EFTF-induced transcripts, 31.5%, 8%, and 0.5% were uniquely shared with EF, PNP, or LE, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We used an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to compare the transcriptional profiles of all samples. This analysis compares the relative change of all probe sets on the array and unbiasedly groups the four tissue samples based on their similarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Eisen1">[9]</xref>. These results indicate the eye field and EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells are more closely related to each other than to either the PNP or LE tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Importantly, 25 of the 115 transcripts, shared by EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells and the EF, encode for 15 genes that are both expressed in retinal stem/progenitor cells and required for normal eye formation in frogs, fish, mice, or humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s007">Table S1</xref>). The expression levels for 13 of these transcripts were not significantly different when comparing eye field and EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 considered significant). By comparison, only two of the 15 genes were not significantly different when comparing the eye field to PNP or LE data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s007">Table S1</xref>). These results suggest EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells share a common transcriptional profile with the eye field, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the EFTFs direct nonretinal pluripotent cells to an eye field-like retinal cell lineage.</p>

<title>EFTF-Expressing Pluripotent Cells Are Directed to a Retinal Lineage</title>
<p>The EFTFs may transiently alter the pattern of gene expression in pluripotent cells, yet fail to stably direct cells toward a retinal cell fate. To test this possibility, we transplanted EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells to the flank of <italic>X. laevis</italic> embryos. To ensure that donor and host tissues could be easily distinguished, we generated EFTF-expressing cells from transgenic embryos constitutively expressing a variant of yellow fluorescent protein (Venus YFP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Sakamaki1">[10]</xref>. Transplanted control pluripotent cells isolated from Venus YFP embryos formed only sheets of epidermis (number of animals or eyes [N] = 108; unpublished data). In contrast, EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells formed YFP-expressing, pigmented spheroids in 23% of transplants (N = 566). We compared the morphology of the induced tissues to the normal eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Thirty-one transplants (24% of pigmented spheroids) had an eye-like morphology consisting of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the trilayered cup structure of a normal retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). We used immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization to detect specific retinal cell classes. All 31 expressed YFP throughout and molecular markers for two or more retinal cell classes. Markers used included Islet-1 and <italic>hermes</italic> for retinal ganglion cells, Tyrosine Hydroxylase for amacrine cells, R5 for Müller glia, XAP2 for rod photoreceptors, and Calbindin for cone photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g002">Figure 2D, 2E, 2G, and 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s009">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s010">S4</xref>). The inner nuclear layers of flank retinas were also strongly labeled for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which stains horizontal, and a subset of amacrine cells, and Calretinin, which predominantly labels bipolar cells but also subsets of amacrine and retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g002">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s009">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s010">S4</xref>). These results suggest that EFTF-expressing cells, like bona fide eye field cells, are determined, forming retinal cells and even eye-like structures, when transplanted to another region of the embryo.</p>

<p>In addition to differentiated retinal cells, the amphibian eye contains a population of self-renewing retinal stem cells located in the retinal periphery in a region called the ciliary marginal zone or CMZ. Retinal stem cells are derived from the embryonic eye field and are the source of new retinal cells throughout the life of the animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Hollyfield1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Straznicky1">[12]</xref>. To determine if mitotic cells were present in the periphery of flank eyes, tadpoles were briefly placed in a solution containing 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU). BrdU immunoreactivity was detected in all retinas tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g002">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s010">Table S4</xref>). To determine if mitotic cells were enriched in the peripheral retina, we determined the relative proportion of BrdU-positive cells in the peripheral and central retina. We found that 12.5% of peripheral cells yet only 0.6% of central cells were BrdU-labeled in flank retinas (2,063 cells from ten flank retinas were counted, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). We observed similar percentages in wild-type retinas, which contain 18.6% and 0.12% BrdU-labeled peripheral and central cells, respectively (2,672 cells counted in ten control retinas). Based on a Student's paired <italic>t</italic>-test, there was no statistically significant difference in the percentage of BrdU-labeled cells when control and flank eyes were compared (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.1).</p>
<p>Despite the remarkable ability of EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells to form eye-like structures on the tadpole flank, it was not possible to record ERGs because of the small size of the induced flank eyes (flank eye volume: 0.007±0.003 mm<sup>3</sup>; control eye volume: 0.021±0.002 mm<sup>3</sup>, at stage 41, <italic>N</italic> = 5). In addition, retinal ganglion cell axons exiting the flank eyes failed to reach their normal tectal targets. When DiI was applied to the RGC layer of induced eyes, labeled processes were observed projecting dorsocaudally along the spinal cord away from the tectum (unpublished data). Similar paths are taken by RGC axons exiting ectopic eyes generated by transplantation of eye primordia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Harris1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-ConstantinePaton1">[15]</xref>. Misrouting has been attributed to the absence of the directional cues required for normal RGC axon guidance. These observations prompted us to replace the eye field with EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells to ask if the induced retinal cells could generate a normal eye and if induced retinal ganglion cells would extend axons to and synapse with their normal tectal targets.</p>

At stage 9, pluripotent cells were removed and cultured to the equivalent of stage 15. For experiments requiring complete eye field replacement (A and B), one half of the eye field was surgically removed from wild-type, stage 15 (host) embryos, and replaced with the donor cells from one half of an explant. (C) To create mosaic eyes, approximately one-half of one eye field was removed and a size-matched fragment of donor tissue was grafted to the host eye field.

<p>YFP-expressing pluripotent cells grafted in place of the eye field never formed eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; N = 79). As expected, these cells generated only epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref>). In contrast, EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells generated YFP-labeled eyes in 63% of transplants (N = 74). The majority of transplants created mosaic eyes (55%), likely a consequence of the difficulty in surgically removing all traces of the eye field. Nevertheless, 8% of the transplants formed retinas expressing YFP throughout and were therefore completely donor derived. We focused our attention on eyes derived entirely from the EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4D–4H</xref>). We observed YFP-labeled processes exiting the induced eye at the optic nerve head that followed the expected trajectory of RGC axons to their tectal targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). We also observed some YFP-labeled cells in the epidermis, forebrain, and occasionally olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4E and 4F</xref> and unpublished data). Induced eyes contained a lens, RPE, and the trilayered structure of a normal retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Interestingly, while the retina and RPE of induced eyes were YFP-labeled, lens cells were most often not, indicating that the lens formed from host tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4G</xref>).

<p>(A–C) Control YFP-expressing pluripotent cells (YFP) form only epidermis when grafted to embryos after removal of the endogenous (left) eye field. Bright field and fluorescent images show the location of transplanted cells. (D–H) In contrast, EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells (EFTF/YFP) generate an eye. YFP fluorescence demonstrates the eye originates from donor tissue. Induced eyes grow throughout the life of the animal (E, H), and form the characteristic trilayered structure of a normal retina (G). (E) Retinal ganglion cell axons exit the eye as the optic nerve (white arrow), pass under the brain and out of view then reappear on the contralateral side (arrowhead). Donor cells are sometimes also found in forebrain (yellow arrow) and epidermis (red arrow). (F) YFP expression is detected throughout the eye, in RGC axons (arrowhead) and forebrain (arrow). (I and J) Eye fields (EF/YFP) also generate eyes. In addition to the eye, epidermis, and forebrain, some musculature and olfactory tissue are also derived from donor eye field. White arrow points to ganglion cell axons, while red arrow points to ocular muscle. Arrowhead indicates the location of YFP-positive retinal axons that have projected to the brain.

<p>These observations suggest the EFTFs can direct pluripotent cells to an embryonic eye field-like cell fate. If this hypothesis is correct, transplantation of eye fields should yield similar results. Therefore, we transplanted embryonic eye fields from YFP transgenic embryos to wild-type hosts. Embryonic eye fields formed mosaic and complete eyes at frequencies similar to those observed with EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells (mosaic eyes 68%, complete eyes 16%; N = 38; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4I and 4J</xref>). These results suggest EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells are directed to an embryonic eye field-like cell fate. Interestingly, in addition to the tissues formed by EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells, transplanted eye fields also formed muscle and head mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4J</xref> and unpublished data).</p>

<title>EFTF-Expressing Pluripotent Cells Generate All Retinal Cell Classes</title>
<p>If the EFTFs induce multipotent retinal progenitor cells, every retinal cell class, including retinal stem cells, should form in induced eyes. To better discern cell classes and determine how well donor cells integrated into the retina we deliberately generated mosaic eyes. EFTF/YFP expressing pluripotent cells were transplanted to embryos from which only one-half of one eye field had been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This allowed us to directly compare the patterns of marker expression in normal and induced retina, and identify cell classes on the basis of their distinctive morphology and location within the eye.</p>
<p>Control, YFP-only expressing pluripotent cells never generated mosaic retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g005">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s002">S2A</xref>; N = 57). This demonstrates that even though the anterior neural plate is essential for proper eye morphogenesis, cultured pluripotent cells were not directed to a retinal fate—even when grafted directly into the eye field. In striking contrast, cultured EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells generated the seven classes of differentiated retinal cells observed in the normal retina. Retinal cell classes were identified based on their morphology, location within the retina, and using cell class specific markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s006">S6</xref>). RGCs lie on the vitreal surface of the retina adjacent to the lens. RGC axons are the only neural processes that leave the retina. Consistent with the presence of donor-derived RGCs, YFP-labeled processes were detected exiting the eye at the optic nerve head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figures 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g005">5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s002">S2B</xref>).

The expression patterns of cell class-specific markers in mosaic retinas appeared the same in host and donor derived regions suggesting that donor cells generated all retinal cell classes in approximately normal ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g005">Figures 5K–5N</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s002">S2</xref>). Consistent with this idea, we observed no significant difference in retinal ganglion, inner nuclear layer, or rod photoreceptor cell density when endogenous and induced regions of mosaic retinas were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g005">Figure 5O</xref>). We did not stain every mosaic retina for all seven retinal cell classes. However, we typically stained each mosaic retina for three or four cell class-specific markers and always detected cells expressing every marker tested (three of three or four of four). In addition, every mosaic retina contained columns of YFP-positive cells that spanned the entire width of the retina—from RPE to RGCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g005">Figures 5B, 5K–5N</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000174.s002">S2B–S2J</xref> for examples). The layering within these columns was indistinguishable from the adjacent, control retina and contained cells with the appropriate morphology for their nuclear layer (rods and cones in the ONL, bipolar, amacrine, horizontal, and Müller glia in the INL, and RGCs in the GCL). These results suggest that EFTF-expressing cells are multipotent, as they differentiate into the seven retinal cell classes of the mature retina.</p>
<p>We also cultured animals in BrdU and used immunocytochemistry to detect mitotically active cells in mature retinas generated from EFTF-expressing cells. BrdU immunoreactivity was detected in the dorsal and ventral, donor-derived CMZ of every animal tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g005">Figure 5P and 5Q</xref>; N = 43). BrdU immunoreactivity is not conclusive evidence for the presence of retinal stem cells. However, when coupled with the observation that induced eyes continued to grow throughout the life of the animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4D and 4H</xref>), these results suggest EFTF-induced eyes contain a self-renewing population of retinal cells in the retinal stem cell niche of the CMZ.</p>

<title>Induced Retinal Cells Form Functional Eyes</title>
<p>Normal anatomical structure and the expression of cell class-specific markers does not demonstrate normal cellular function and connectivity. Therefore, we next measured the ERG to determine if induced cells could form the intricate neural network necessary to detect and process light stimuli. ERGs recorded from eyes wholly derived from induced retinal cells were similar to those recorded from eyes on the unoperated side of the same animals and eyes of stage-matched wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). ERG responses of control and induced eyes were similar in sensitivity and time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Rod and cone photoreceptors in the outer retina transduce light into electrical signals. Bipolar cells relay the visual information from photoreceptors to the inner retina for further processing. Activation of bipolar cells elicits the characteristic b-wave of the ERG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; arrows). In response to green (520 nm), dim flashes (0.4 photons/µm<sup>2</sup>) the b-waves are small and exhibit slow kinetics. In response to brighter flashes, b-waves were progressively larger and faster. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g006">Figure 6B</xref> shows the amplitude of the b-waves plotted as a function of flash intensity. b-waves increased progressively with intensity, saturating in response to the brightest flashes (&gt;30 photons/µm<sup>2</sup>). The b-waves of the induced eyes were slightly desensitized (approximately 30%) relative to controls, as reflected by the slight shift of the Michaelis-Menten functions fit to the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Immunostaining for YFP confirmed the eyes from which ERGs were recorded were completely derived from donor tissue (unpublished data). ERGs not only indicate the presence of mature retinal cells, but also demonstrate that light enters the eye appropriately, phototransduction takes place, synapses form between retinal neurons, and synaptic transmission is functional within the eye.</p>

<p>The ERGs and the presence of optic nerves projecting to the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) prompted us to ask if the animals could respond to a visual stimulus using the induced eye. <italic>Xenopus</italic> show a stage-dependent phototropic behavior; premetamorphic tadpoles raised in a 12-h light cycle prefer a white color background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Moriya1">[18]</xref>. When placed in a half-white/half-black test tank, sighted animals swim to and remain on the white side. In contrast, the same animals blinded by axotomy of the retinal ganglion cell axons from both eyes (double axotomy) show no color preference. We generated eyes in wild-type hosts using EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells from YFP transgenic donors, grew animals to premetamporphic stages, and tested for phototropic behavior using the Background Color Preference Assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Moriya1">[18]</xref>. The majority of transplants (12 of 13) generated mosaic eyes (24%–52% of the retina was YFP-labeled). However, a retina of one animal was entirely derived from EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells. An age-matched control and the animal with one induced eye both showed strong white background preference, spending 89%±6% and 88%±4% of swimming time on the white side of the test tank, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g006">Figure 6C and 6D</xref>). We then severed the right optic nerve, leaving the optic nerve from the induced eye intact (single axotomy). Single axotomy was also used to blind the right eye of the control animal. No statistical difference in background color preference was detected following single axotomy, suggesting the induced eye could guide behavior. To confirm this conclusion, we next severed the optic nerve from the induced eye. Double axotomy resulted in a significant reduction in the phototropic behavior of both the control and experimental animal. White background preference was reduced with axotomy of the induced eye (79%±6% to 57%±5%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009) and the age-matched wild-type control (83%±6% to 50%±2%, <italic>p</italic> = 6.1×10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g006">Figure 6C and 6D</xref>). The left eye did not contain transplanted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), while the induced retina expressed YFP throughout, confirming that it formed entirely from the transplanted donor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g006">Figure 6F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The induced retinal cells generated here are multipotent, as they differentiate into all retinal cell classes and even express markers for some retinal cell subtypes. We observed stereotypical retinal cell morphology in eyes completely derived from EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells and in mosaic retinas. Lamba and colleagues recently demonstrated that human embryonic stem cells could be directed to differentiate into photoreceptors and respond to a light stimulus as measured by ERG in <italic>crx</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (a model for Leber's congenital amaurosis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Lamba2">[5]</xref>. This important finding strongly suggests that in vitro generated cells can form functional retinal cells in a nonfunctioning retina. We show that pluripotent cells can generate all retinal cell classes. When transplanted to the anterior neural plate, these cells form eyes and a neural network capable of driving a vision-guided behavior.</p>
<p>Not all donor cells were reprogrammed to a retinal lineage by the EFTFs. Why this might be is unclear. One hypothesis is that a subset of the pluripotent cells was refractory to the effects of the EFTFs. Alternatively, some cells may not have received a sufficient dose or the appropriate relative level of each EFTF. This possibility is intriguing, since subsets of the EFTFs are coordinately expressed in specific regions of the forebrain and developing olfactory placodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Zuber2">[7]</xref>. It will be interesting to determine if specific EFTF subsets can fate pluripotent cells to other (nonretinal) neural lineages.</p>
<p>Eye fields and early optic vesicles form eye-like structures with lenses when transplanted ectopically or when cultured in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Spemann1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-King1">[26]</xref>. Similarly, EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells formed ectopic eye-like structures when transplanted to the embryonic flank. Although induced cells expressed retinal markers and exhibited retinal cell morphology in culture, morphologically normal eyes never formed. These results demonstrate fundamental differences between the induced retinal cells and the embryonic eye field. In isolation, EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells may be unable to recapitulate the complex inductive and morphological changes necessary for complete eye formation in culture. EFTFs may redirect pluripotent cells to a more restricted lineage than isolated eye fields, which may include additional tissues necessary for in vitro eye formation. Our transplantation experiments are consistent with this interpretation. While both eye fields and EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells generated epidermis, forebrain, and olfactory tissue when grafted to the anterior neural plate, transplanted eye fields also formed muscle and head mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000174-g004">Figure 4</xref> and unpublished data). A requirement for mesoderm is supported by the work of Asashima, showing that tissue recombinants including lateral marginal zone or the mesoderm inducer Activin A generates muscle as well as <italic>pax6</italic> expressing eye-like structures with lens in vivo as well as in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Asashima1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Myoishi1">[28]</xref>. The presence of lens in these tissue recombinants may also be telling as EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells very infrequently formed lens. The reduced ability of the EFTFs to induce lens in the embryonic flank may be the cause of the abnormal layering we observed, since the lens and retina are dependent on each other for their normal formation.</p>
<p>It is interesting that YFP-expressing pluripotent cells were rarely detected in the lens, yet often present in the cornea since the surface ectoderm forms both the lens and the cornea. All surgeries were performed on stage 15 embryos. At this developmental stage, the presumptive lens ectoderm lies lateral to, and outside the neural plate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Grainger1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Grainger2">[30]</xref>. Therefore, successful removal of part or the entire eye field would spare the host presumptive lens ectoderm in the majority of the animals. Following neurulation, the externally localized (YFP-negative) lens ectoderm comes to lie over the evaginating optic vesicle, they make contact, the lens placode forms, and together they invaginate to form the optic cup and lens vesicle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Donner1">[31]</xref>). We speculate, that once the YFP-negative lens vesicle separates from the surface ectoderm, the cornea forms from the remaining surface ectoderm (YFP-positive) and neural crest-derived mesenchyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Hay1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>YFP-expressing pluripotent cells did not form neural tissue (retina or brain), but were always observed in the epidermis of tadpoles. This suggests that the transplanted, control cells move from the eye field to the surface ectoderm outside the neural plate. Conversely, EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells (and transplanted eye fields) remained in the anterior neural plate. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, expression of the EFTFs <italic>pax6</italic>, <italic>rx1</italic>, as well as <italic>otx2</italic> redirect ventral progenitors normally destined to form epidermis into the eye field where they form retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Kenyon1">[20]</xref>. It will be important to identify the transcriptional targets of the EFTFs and the mechanism(s) responsible for these morphological movements.</p>
<p>Eyes generated from pluripotent cells continued to grow throughout the life of the animals and contained a population of mitotically active cells in the CMZ suggesting the presence of retinal stem cells. During early embryonic development, cells throughout the forming retina are proliferative. Progenitors of the central retina are the first to leave the cell cycle and differentiate into the six neuronal and one glial cell class of the mature retina. In some species (including <italic>Xenopus</italic>), the most peripheral cells of the retina never differentiate but form the retinal stem cells of the CMZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Zaghloul1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Moshiri1">[34]</xref>. The Wnt, Shh, BMP, Insulin/IGF, and FGF signaling pathways have all been implicated in establishing and maintaining the adult retinal stem cell niche (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Moshiri1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Yang1">[37]</xref>). Determining the effect(s) of these extrinsic factors on induced retinal cells and the formation of the CMZ in induced eyes will help define the molecular mechanisms regulating the formation and maintenance of retinal stem cells and the niche in which they reside.</p>
<p>EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells form functional retinal cells and eyes when transplanted to the developing embryo, but can these induced retinal cells also differentiate into all the functional retinal cell classes in a mature normal or damaged retinal environment? Cultured mouse, monkey, and human pluripotent cells can be driven down a retinal lineage as determined by the expression of marker genes, including the EFTFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Ikeda1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Osakada1">[4]</xref>. When transplanted to the mouse retina, human ES cells directed to a retinal lineage partially restore light-elicited ERG responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000174-Lamba2">[5]</xref>. Noggin is a key component in the cocktail used to bias human ES cells to a retinal lineage, and we found it was also sufficient to direct <italic>Xenopus</italic> pluripotent cells to retinal cell classes and eventually functional eyes. The assays presented here demonstrate a rapid and simple system for testing individual and combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic factors for their ability to direct pluripotent cells to multipotent retinal cells, with the option of testing them functionally. Future studies can now address how to maintain induced retinal cell cultures in a proliferative, multipotent state and drive them to all the retinal cell classes necessary to repair a damaged or degenerating mature retina.</p>

LE was isolated from stage 15 lateral flank at A–P coordinates midway between eye field and PNP. Samples were pipetted into microfuge tubes cooled on dry ice to quickly freeze the isolated tissues. RNA from 40 EF, PNP, LE dissected tissues (approximately 250 µm<sup>2</sup> each) or ten YFP-expressing control or YFP- and EFTF-expressing animal caps (EFTF-expressing pluripotent cells) were used for each chip analysis. Analyses were performed in triplicate on tissue from embryos on three different days from three different females. RNA extraction, probe synthesis and purification, chip hybridization, and scanning were carried out at SUNY-MAC (Syracuse, New York).
