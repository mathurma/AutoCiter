      <abstract>
        <p>Long-term memories are thought to depend upon the coordinated activation of a broad network of cortical and subcortical brain regions. However, the distributed nature of this representation has made it challenging to define the neural elements of the memory trace, and lesion and electrophysiological approaches provide only a narrow window into what is appreciated a much more global network. Here we used a global mapping approach to identify networks of brain regions activated following recall of long-term fear memories in mice. Analysis of Fos expression across 84 brain regions allowed us to identify regions that were co-active following memory recall. These analyses revealed that the functional organization of long-term fear memories depends on memory age and is altered in mutant mice that exhibit premature forgetting. Most importantly, these analyses indicate that long-term memory recall engages a network that has a distinct thalamic-hippocampal-cortical signature. This network is concurrently integrated and segregated and therefore has small-world properties, and contains hub-like regions in the prefrontal cortex and thalamus that may play privileged roles in memory expression.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Memory retrieval is thought to involve the coordinated activation of multiple regions of the brain, rather than localized activity in a specific region. In order to visualize networks of brain regions activated by recall of a fear memory in mice, we quantified expression of an activity-regulated gene (c-fos) that is induced by neural activity. This allowed us to identify collections of brain regions where Fos expression co-varies across mice, and presumably form components of a network that are co-active during recall of long-term fear memory. This analysis suggested that expression of a long-term fear memory is an emergent property of large scale neural network interactions. This network has a distinct thalamic-hippocampal-cortical signature and, like many real-world networks as well as other anatomical and functional brain networks, has small-world architecture with a subset of highly-connected hub nodes that may play more central roles in memory expression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Long-term memories are thought to be represented by changes in the strength of connections among neurons in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Bliss1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Chklovskii1">[2]</xref>. While much is understood about the molecular, cellular and structural changes that contribute to the changes in connection strength between neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Wang1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Kandel1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Segal1">[5]</xref>, it has been challenging to precisely define which subsets of neurons constitute the memory trace for at least two reasons. First, long-term memories are thought to be distributed, and depend on the collective activity of groups of neurons (or cell assemblies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Hebb1">[6]</xref>) across a broad network of cortical and subcortical brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Lashley1">[7]</xref>. Second, memory expression likely depends upon network-wide, coordinated activation of these cell assemblies, rather than an overall, net increase in network activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Buzsaki1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-McIntosh1">[9]</xref>. Electrophysiological approaches have been useful in linking regional activity and coordination of inter-regional activity to memory processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Ji1">[10]</xref>. However, they necessarily provide only a narrow window into what is appreciated to be a much more global network.</p>
      <p>Imaging-based approaches can detect coordinated activity across distributed and spatially remote brain regions, and therefore have been useful in defining functional networks (see <bold>Supplementary Note in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s021">Text S1</xref></bold>). Here we have developed a brain-wide imaging approach to study the network organization of long-term contextual fear memories in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Sustained neural activity leads to the induction of activity-regulated genes such as <italic>c-fos</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Guzowski1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Stone1">[12]</xref>. As Fos protein may be resolved at the level of the nucleus, immunohistochemical approaches may be used to generate high resolution, brain-wide maps of Fos expression induced by memory recall. Subsequent computation of inter-regional correlations allows us to identify collections of brain regions where Fos expression co-varies across mice, and presumably form components of a network that are co-active during recall of long-term fear memory. This analysis of functional connectivity suggests that expression of a long-term fear memory is an emergent property of large scale neural network interactions. This network has a distinct thalamic-hippocampal-cortical signature and, like many real-world networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Watts1">[13]</xref> as well as other anatomical and functional brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Bullmore1">[14]</xref>, has small-world architecture with a subset of highly-connected hub nodes that may play more central roles in memory expression.</p>

        <title>Fos expression is induced by contextual fear memory recall</title>
        <p>In order to characterize regional activation following long-term memory recall, we used a contextual fear conditioning task in which mice learn an association between a context and an aversive event (i.e., the delivery of a mild footshock). When returned to the same context, contextual fear memory is inferred from an increase in freezing behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Kim1">[15]</xref>. The advantage of this task is that a single training episode produces robust memory that is easily-quantifiable and long-lasting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Gale1">[16]</xref>. During training wild-type (WT) mice (F1 from a cross between C57B6/N and 129) received 5 footshocks, and then were tested either 1 day or 36 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). As expected, conditioned freezing levels in trained mice were similar at both the short and long retention delay (planned, unpaired t-test: <italic>t</italic>(14)â=â1.31, <italic>P</italic>â=â0.21), indicating that no forgetting occurred across this time period. Control groups, that underwent the same procedure but did not receive footshocks during training, showed little freezing during testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>) (2 way between subjects ANOVA; main effect of training only, <italic>F</italic>(1,28)â=â63.08, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001).</p>

            <p><bold>A.</bold> Experimental design. Mice were trained, and fear memory was assessed either 1 (short delay) or 36 (long delay) days later. Ninety minutes following this test, brains were removed and expression of the activity-regulated gene, c-fos, was evaluated immunohistochemically. <bold>B.</bold> Percent freezing at the 1 day or 36 day retention test in trained (black bars) or control (open bars) mice. <bold>CâD.</bold> Task PLS analysis of Fos expression in trained vs. control mice tested 1 or 36 days following training. These analyses identified LVs (left graph) that strongly differentiated the trained vs. control conditions at both the (<bold>C</bold>) short and (<bold>D</bold>) long retention delays. Salience scores (right) identify regions that maximally differentiate between these conditions at both the (<bold>C</bold>) short and (<bold>D</bold>) long retention delays. The hatched line reflects a salience score of 3, above which the contribution of the regions is considered reliable. At the short delay, Fos expression in the hippocampus contributed strongly to this contrast, whereas at the longer retention delay, Fos expression in multiple brain regions contributed to the contrast.</p>

Because these increases in calcium lead to the rapid upregulation of activity-regulated genes such as <italic>c-fos</italic>, measuring Fos protein levels allows for the detection of recently activated neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Guzowski1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Stone1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Ghosh1">[17]</xref> (see <bold>Supplementary Note in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s021">Text S1</xref></bold>). Therefore, in order to characterize regional activation following contextual fear testing, Fos was quantified in 84 brain regions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). These included cortical, thalamic, hippocampal, cerebral and midbrain nuclei and were defined according to a standard mouse brain atlas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Franklin1">[18]</xref> (for complete listing of brain regions, see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s016">Table S1</xref></bold>). In order to isolate changes in gene expression associated with contextual fear memory recall and control for non-specific aspects of the testing procedure, the density of Fos positive cells in each brain region in trained mice was compared to control animals that did not receive footshocks during conditioning. Importantly, multivariate task partial least squares (PLS) analyses revealed that patterns of Fos expression depended both on the training condition as well as the retention delay (significant condition Ã delay interaction (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). To better we understand the nature of the interaction we conducted separate âpost-hocâ analyses. These revealed distinct patterns of Fos expression in the trained vs. control (no shock) mice following testing at both the 1 day (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>) and 36 day (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>) delay. At the 1 day retention delay, these distinct patterns of activation were primarily driven by increases in Fos expression in the hippocampus (CA1-d, CA1-p and DG-low) in trained mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). In contrast, at the 36 day retention delay, distinct patterns of activation were associated with increases in Fos expression in distributed brain regions in trained mice. These included cortical (PrL, Cg-a), thalamic (Hb, C), hypothalamic (LH, SHy, LPO and MPA) regions, as well as the BST, Cpu-dm, AcbSh, VP, LSI, LSV and PAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>). Therefore, these data indicate that memory recall is associated with the induction of Fos, and patterns of Fos expression in trained mice are distinct from those in controls.</p>

        <title>Generation of functional networks</title>
        <p>Memory recall is thought to involve coordinated activation of multiple brain regions. Therefore, examination of how activity co-varies across brain regions has been used to study these large scale interactions in both human and experimental animal imaging studies and define functional networks engaged during memory recall. In human imaging studies regional brain activity can be assessed by measuring an electrical signal (EGG, MEG) or indirectly by measuring a metabolic signal such as blood flow (fMRI). Functional connectivity is then typically evaluated by assessing covariance of these signals across different brain regions during performance of a given task. In contrast, in experimental animal studies, neuronal activity is typically assessed post-mortem by evaluating, for example, changes in expression of the activity-regulated genes such as <italic>c-fos</italic>. As such measures provide a single index of activation per region per animal, functional connectivity is necessarily estimated by computing covariance across subjects, rather than within subjects. Both within and across subjects covariance can be used to infer interactions between neural elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-McIntosh1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Horwitz1">[19]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, we next computed a complete set of inter-regional correlations in the groups of mice tested at each retention delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>).

        <p>The structure of these network graphs varied across conditions, but, importantly, these differences were not simply an artifact of group differences in signal strength and/or variance (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>). Moreover, a number of other immediate early genes are regulated by neural activity, including <italic>egr-1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Guzowski1">[11]</xref>. In order to explore the generality of our effects we additionally quantified Egr-1 expression in a subset of brain regions in the WT/36 day group. We found that Fos- and Egr-1-derived patterns of inter-regional correlations were similar (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>), consistent with previous studies showing that immediate early genes are typically expressed in the same or largely overlapping neuronal populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Stone1">[12]</xref>. Finally, while functional connections in these networks reflect statistical (rather than physical) relationships between regions, we found that there was excellent correspondence with known neuroanatomy. For example, in the 36 day retention delay network, comparison of functional connections for one brain region (reuniens thalamic nucleus; Re) with published, anatomical data revealed that all functional connections had corresponding anatomical connections in the primary and high confidence networks (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s006">Figure S6</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s017">Table S2</xref></bold>). While direct anatomical connections are not necessary for two regions to be functionally connected (e.g., they might be co-modulated by a third region), nonetheless this finding is consistent with previous analyses indicating that there is typically good correspondence between functional and underlying structural connections in brain networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Honey1">[21]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In our matrices, Fos expression in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus consistently showed negative correlations with other brain regions. In constructing our networks we focused on only positive correlations. However, while relatively few in number, such negative correlations are interesting, and may reflect repression networks. Indeed, future studies using activity-regulated genes that have higher basal levels of expression (e.g., Egr-1) may offer greater sensitivity at detecting negative correlations (as levels can be regulated bi-directionally).</p>

        <title>Networks change with memory age</title>
        <p>Regional inactivation or lesions may disrupt expression of a previously-acquired memory. As these retrograde effects are often temporally-graded (with either newer or older memories differentially affected) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Kim1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Maviel1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Sacco1">[24]</xref>, these data provide evidence that memory organization changes with memory age (or systems consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland2">[25]</xref>). In the present experiment, we evaluated long-term contextual fear memory at two time-points after training, and this therefore provides an opportunity to track these changes in network organization at a global level. Accordingly, we categorized our 84 regions into major brain subdivisions (e.g., neocortex, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebral nuclei; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s016">Table S1</xref></bold>) and asked whether connection strength between these major subdivisions differed at the 1 day and 36 day time-points (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s018">Table S3</xref></bold>). We focused in particular, on three <italic>a priori</italic> predictions of systems consolidation models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Nadel1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Squire1">[27]</xref>: Memory aging would be expected to be associated with 1) strengthening of connections between different neocortical modules, 2) a gradual disengagement of the hippocampus and 3) an emergent role for prefrontal cortical regions in memory expression.</p>
        <p>This analysis revealed three main forms of reorganization. First, Fos expression (or activity) among cortical regions was more strongly correlated at the 36-day, compared to 1-day, retention delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g004"><bold>Figure 4AâB</bold></xref>). This pattern was particularly evident within subdivisions of the somatosensory cortex, where activity was more tightly coupled at the longer retention delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>). This increase in inter-cortical correlated activity as a function of memory age is consistent with the idea that consolidation is associated with the strengthening of functional connections between anatomically-distinct regions of the neocortex, leading to the coordination of activity across cortical cell assemblies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Hebb1">[6]</xref>. Second, previous studies suggested that subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (including, in particular, the anterior cingulate [Cg-a] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Maviel1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Miller1">[28]</xref> and prelimbic cortex [PrL] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Maviel1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-TakeharaNishiuchi1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Quinn1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Takehara1">[31]</xref>) play an increasingly important role in memory expression as a function of memory age. Consistent with this, we found an increase in correlated activity between the medial prefrontal cortex and other cortical, thalamic, and hippocampal regions at the longer retention delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g004"><bold>Figure 4DâE</bold></xref>). Third, whether the hippocampus plays a transient or more sustained role in memory expression is more controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Nadel1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Squire1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Sutherland1">[32]</xref>. While the magnitude of the hippocampal Fos signal declined with retention delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), nonetheless we found that this activity either remained tightly coupled or became more tightly coupled with Fos expression in other brain regions following recall at the remote time-point. For example, correlated activity between hippocampal regions and thalamic regions and between hippocampal regions and the midbrain were equivalent at the short and long retention delays (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s018">Table S3</xref></bold>), whereas coupling of activity between hippocampal and neocortical regions increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g004"><bold>Figure 4FâG</bold></xref>). That hippocampal activity (albeit reduced in magnitude) remains tightly coupled with activity in other thalamic and cortical regions suggests that hippocampal regions play a sustained role in the expression of contextual fear memories. Together, these changes in functional connectivity are consistent with the idea that networks supporting contextual fear evolve as a function of time. These changes in organization are unlikely to be related to changes in behavior since levels of conditioned freezing were similar at both time points. However, as we only measured freezing we cannot exclude that other indices of conditioned fear (e.g., changes in respiration or heart rate) differ at the short and long retention delays.</p>

To evaluate whether fear memory networks have similar small-world organization for each network we generated control networks with random topology (matched for node, degree and degree distribution; see <bold>Supplementary Note in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s021">Text S1</xref></bold>). To assess segregation we initially computed the clustering coefficient for each network. The clustering coefficient measures the tendency for a node's nearest neighbors to be also connected to each other (quantified as the number of connections between a node's nearest neighbors as a proportion of all possible connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Rubinov1">[33]</xref>). Using this measure, we found that fear memory networks were consistently more segregated compared to random networks. This was evident at both short and long retention delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>) and when more (râ¥0.87, Pâ¤0.0025) or less (râ¥0.79, Pâ¤0.025) conservative thresholds were used for network generation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s008">Figure S8</xref></bold>).

        <p>Integration may be evaluated by quantifying either path length (average shortest path length between all node pairs) or global efficiency (the average inverse path length between all node pairs). Using global efficiency as a measure of integration, we found that fear memory networks exhibited equivalent integration compared to random networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>), as would be anticipated for networks with small-world topology.

        <title>Fear memory network includes a densely-connected thalamic-hippocampal- cortical core</title>
        <p>Networks engaged by recall of a long-term fear memory were highly clustered. To examine this structure in more detail we next focused on the network engaged by memory recall at the long retention delay, as this network was densely-connected and fear memory was robustly expressed. We applied the Markov clustering algorithm to systematically organize nodes into discrete modules based on their common inter-connections. This analysis identified eight distinct clusters in the fear memory network, and, in particular, a large densely-connected central component containing two groupings (green and blue nodes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>).

        <p>Many of these brain regions in the green and blue clusters were highly connected, suggesting that this central core is composed of mutually-interconnected high degree âhubâ nodes. We formally evaluated this by computing assortativityâthe tendency for nodes with same or similar degree (i.e., the number of connections for a given node) to be directly connected with one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Rubinov1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Newman1">[34]</xref>.

In both networks, successive random node removal led to gradual disintegration of the network: as nodes were successively removed the size of the largest connected component declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g006"><bold>Figure 6D</bold></xref>). The rate of disintegration was similar in both networks, suggesting that the fear memory and control networks exhibit equivalent resilience to random node removal. However, the fear memory network was considerably more resilient to targeted attacks. Whereas removal of â¼37% of the most connected nodes led to complete disintegration of the control network, removal of â¼64% of the most connected nodes was necessary to see similar disintegration of the fear memory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g006"><bold>Figure 6E</bold></xref>).</p>

        <title>Identification of fear memory network hubs</title>
        <p>Our analyses reveal that expression of a long-term fear memory involves widespread interactions between brain regions. While this is consistent with the idea that these types of memories are distributed, nonetheless highly-connected regions (or hubs) may disproportionately influence network function. In order to identify specific hub regions within our fear memory network, we therefore next ranked all nodes by degree. As expected, nodes within the large, central component were highly ranked. They accounted for the vast majority of regions &gt;80<sup>th</sup> percentile rank in our primary network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g007"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>), as well as in networks generated using either more (râ¥0.87, <italic>P</italic>â¤0.0025) or less (râ¥0.79, <italic>P</italic>â¤0.025) conservative thresholds (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s012">Figure S12</xref></bold>). However, how any given node interacts with the rest of the network depends not only on the number of connections but also the nature of these connections. We therefore additionally ranked nodes using another measure of centrality, betweenness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g007"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s012">Figure S12</xref></bold>). Betweenness centrality computes the number of shortest paths between node pairs that pass through a given node, and nodes that have a large number of intermodular connections tend to have high betweenness centrality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Sporns1">[37]</xref>. Nodes ranked high in betweenness differ from those that were computed in random networks (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s013">Figure S13</xref></bold>). Of the highly-connected nodes, three regionsâCg-a, PrL, and Reâwere also ranked above the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile in terms of betweenness in each of the low, moderate and high confidence networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g007"><bold>Figure 7C</bold></xref>), suggesting that this subset of high-degree regions may function as connector hubs and facilitate global intermodular integration.</p>

        <title>Altered fear memory networks in Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice with accelerated forgetting</title>
        <p>Usually, fear memories are very stable, and can be maintained over extended periods with little decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Gale1">[16]</xref>. However, Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice exhibit accelerated forgetting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland1">[22]</xref>, and therefore provide an opportunity to contrast initial organization of functional networks for fear memories that are destined to persist with those that are destined to fade with time. Accordingly, we trained Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice (in parallel with their WT littermate controls, described above) and tested their memory 1 or 36 days later. As expected, the mutants exhibited accelerated forgetting, with freezing levels greatly reduced at the longer (12.4Â±5.2%) compared to shorter (49.5Â±10.5%) retention delay. Importantly, freezing levels at the shorter retention delay were similar to WT mice (66.5Â±8.7%; planned, unpaired t-test, <italic>t</italic>(14)â=â1.25, <italic>P</italic>â=â0.23).

        </fig>
        <p>Similar to WT mice, fear memory networks in the Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice had a non-Gaussian degree distribution and small-world topology. As in the WT networks, the majority of brain regions had relatively few connections, but a minority of nodes was highly connected (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s014">Figure S14A</xref></bold>). Moreover, compared to random control networks, mutant networks were more segregated, but equivalently integrated, at both the short and long retention delays (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s014">Figure S14B</xref>âC</bold>). Finally, network density declined (rather than increased) as a function of time most likely reflecting no (or very weak) memory expression in the mutants at the remote retention delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g008"><bold>Figure 8C</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>While general network organization was similar in WT and Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice, nevertheless there were some notable differences. In particular, at the 1-d retention delay, while WT and Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice exhibited equivalent levels of conditioned fear, functional connections differed within the neocortex (and especially the somatosensory cortex), within the hippocampus and between the hippocampus and neocortex between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002853-g008"><bold>Figure 8D</bold></xref>). These differences between WT and Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> networks at this shorter retention delay indicate equivalent behavior may be generated by distinct networks. As the Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice showed accelerated forgetting, they further suggest that such degenerate solutions may not always be so robust. Indeed, they raise the possibility that functional connections within the neocortex, within the hippocampus and between the hippocampus and neocortex are especially important for memory stability.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we used global mapping and graph theoretical approaches to characterize functional networks engaged by recall of a long-term memory in mice. These experiments yielded four principal findings. First, like many real-world networks, functional networks engaged by recall of long-term memory have a small-world topology. This type of organization ensures that networks are concurrently segregatedâallowing for specialized processing in more densely-connected clustersâand integratedâallowing for efficient information flow through the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Bullmore1">[14]</xref>. Second, while networks maintain small-world topology across time, the specific nature of functional connections changes as a function of memory age. Memory aging was associated with strengthening of inter-cortical functional connections and with strengthening of connectivity between prefrontal areas and thalamic, cortical and hippocampal areas. Third, the functional network supporting long-term fear memory had a characteristic thalamic-hippocampal-cortical signature. Many thalamic, hippocampal and cortical regions formed a central core of mutually-interconnected regions, and the dense interconnectivity of these high-degree regions likely enhances network resilience. Fourth, several regions (including the anterior cingulate cortex and prelimbic cortex) were identified as important hubs within this long-term memory network and therefore might play disproportionately important roles in network function and resilience. While previous imaging and electrophysiological studies have examined the role of specific regions and small collections of regions in expression of a long-term memory, this analysis provides global picture of how a long-term fear memory is organized in mice.</p>
      <p>In our experiments, we evaluated contextual fear memory at both short and long delays after training. We found that functional networks differed at these two time-points, consistent with the idea that memory organization changes as a function of memory age, a process known as systems consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland2">[25]</xref>. One prominent model of systems consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Squire1">[27]</xref> proposes that memories are initially encoded in hippocampal-cortical networks, and that reactivation of these networks then leads to the incremental strengthening of inter-cortical connectivity, and an emergent role for prefrontal cortical regions in memory expression coupled with disengagement of the hippocampus. Consistent with this model, we found that functional connections within the neocortex strengthened over time, and this was especially evident within the somatosensory cortex. Moreover, functional connections between prefrontal cortical regions (including Cg-a and PrL) and thalamic, posterior cortical and hippocampal regions were stronger at the longer retention delay, supporting the idea that these regions play important roles in the memory expression at remote time points after encoding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Maviel1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-TakeharaNishiuchi1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Takashima1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Goshen1">[39]</xref>. However, the picture in the hippocampus was more complex. At the remote time-point, hippocampal activity was reduced in magnitude, yet remained tightly coupled with activity in other thalamic and cortical regions. Clearly, consideration of Fos expression levels alone may have suggested that the hippocampus is not important at remote time points. However, the co-activity data paint a more nuanced picture of the role of the hippocampus in expression of remote contextual fear memory: That hippocampal activity (albeit reduced in magnitude) remains tightly coupled with activity in other thalamic and cortical regions suggests that hippocampal regions play a sustained role in the expression of contextual fear memories. This more sustained role is consistent with the finding that light-induced inactivation of CA1 neurons blocks expression of remote contextual fear memories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Goshen1">[39]</xref>, as well as conceptualizations that the hippocampus is re-engaged regardless of the age of the context memory as proposed in alternate models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Nadel1">[26]</xref> (see also: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Sutherland1">[32]</xref>).</p>
      <p>What might these changes in network organization reflect? Levels of freezing were similar at the short and long delays, and therefore distinct networks are unlikely to be directly related to different levels of fear. However, while behavioral output may be similar at these two time points, it is possible that underlying context representations differ. Such representational changes are suggested by time-dependent increases in context generalization following fear conditioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Winocur1">[40]</xref>. Indeed, using an identical training protocol, we found that mice froze more when tested in the training vs. a novel context at the short delay, but froze equivalently when tested in these two contexts at the longer delay (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s015">Figure S15</xref></bold>). Therefore, time-dependent changes in the nature of functional connections might reflect the transformation of the contextual fear memory from a precise, detailed form into a less precise, generalized form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Winocur1">[40]</xref>. A second possibility is that network changes reflect an interaction between new and existing memories. In addition to changes in the nature of connections, the density of connections also increased as a function of retention delay. This increase in connection density suggests that recall of an older fear memory involves the coordinated activation of a broader network, perhaps reflecting the engagement of a more expansive associative net. Such time-dependent network expansion is predicted by models that propose that consolidation involves, in part, the integration of new information into existing knowledge bases or schemas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Tse1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-McClelland1">[42]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Fear memory networks had a distinct thalamic-hippocampal-cortical signature, and this was most pronounced at the longer retention delay. Interestingly, electrophysiological recording studies in awake, behaving animals suggest similar networks are engaged during encoding and subsequently re-engaged during post-encoding periods such as sleep or even retrieval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Battaglia1">[43]</xref>. For example, encoding-related situations (e.g., spatial exploration or exploration-based learning) are associated with coordinated activation of the hippocampus and neocortex, with especially pronounced coupling between the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Siapas1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Benchenane1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Sirota1">[46]</xref>. Moreover, these same patterns of hippocampal and cortical activity are spontaneously replayed in subsequent âofflineâ periods such as quiet wakefulness or sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Sutherland2">[47]</xref>, and hippocampal-cortical activity remains coupled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Ji1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Peyrache1">[48]</xref>. Moreover, similar coupling of hippocampal and prefrontal activity is observed during retrieval of a contextual fear conditioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Lesting1">[49]</xref>. While hippocampal-cortical replay has been studied in most detail, post-encoding replay also been observed hippocampal-thalamic and hippocampal-striatal circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Ribeiro1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Pennartz1">[51]</xref>, suggesting that replay occurs in brain-wide networks. This brain-wide reactivation is thought to play an essential role in systems consolidation, leading to the incremental remodeling of networks for long-term memory storage. Indeed, disruption of replay impairs consolidation of spatial memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Girardeau1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-EgoStengel1">[53]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our networks, functional connections reflect statistical, rather than necessarily physical, relationships between brain regions. Accordingly, our network analyses allowed us to generate hypotheses about which brain regions may play privileged roles in memory expression, with highly-connected hub-like regions likelier to influence overall network function. In particular, our analysis revealed that the network engaged by recall of a fear memory more than one month after training contains a densely-interconnected central core of highly-connected hub-like regions. Importantly, this central core included many brain regions that have previously been implicated in the expression of contextual fear memories at such remote time-points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland2">[25]</xref> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002853.s019">Table S4</xref></bold>), consistent with the idea that hubs play more integral roles in network function. For example, loss of function manipulations (including pharmacological inactivation, cytotoxic lesions or optogenetic silencing) targeting the anterior cingulate cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Miller1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Goshen1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Vetere1">[54]</xref>, hippocampus (including CA1 and CA3 fields) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Goshen1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Sutherland3">[55]</xref>, retrosplenial cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Corcoran1">[56]</xref> and prelimbic cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Quinn1">[30]</xref> disrupt expression of contextual fear memories at extended retention delays. Similarly, loss of function manipulations targeting these regions, as well as thalamic (e.g., LD, MD, C) and orbitofrontal (DLO, VO, LO) regions affect expression of other forms of remote memory, including spatial and olfactory-based memories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Maviel1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Lesburgueres1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Lopez1">[58]</xref>. While correspondence between the predictions derived from the network analysis and these published findings provides some validation of our approach, perhaps greater value lies in using this approach for the identification of novel, candidate brain regions. In this regard, it is interesting that many thalamic regions were identified within this central core, including Re, Sub, VPM and Po. These regions, by virtue of their widespread connectivity with both the hippocampus and neocortex, are ideally positioned to influence network function. In particular, thalamic regions strongly influence cortical activity by modulating up/down states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Steriade1">[59]</xref> and therefore may play central roles in coordinating memory replay and retrieval. Indeed a recent lesion study provided evidence that Re plays a key role in remote memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Loureiro1">[60]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One interesting observation was that the same (or very similar) behavioral output was associated with distinct functional networks, suggesting that there is a degree of degeneracy at the network level (i.e., an ability of distinct constellations of neural elements to produce same output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Edelman1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Marder1">[62]</xref>). This was the case for networks engaged by recall of contextual fear memory at the short vs. long delay in WT mice. Likewise, Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice exhibited equivalent levels of conditioned freezing compared to WT littermates at the short delay, yet underlying functional networks differed considerably. Together, this suggests that a population of network solutions may support contextual fear memory, and raise two related issues. First, because of this degeneracy, pre-training manipulations of key brain regions may not necessarily prevent the formation of a contextual fear memory. For example, pre-training lesions of the hippocampus surprisingly do not always impair acquisition of a contextual fear memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland3">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Wiltgen1">[64]</xref>, and this is presumably because alternate networks can support this type of memory in the absence of an intact hippocampus at the time of training. If multiple networks can support the formation of a contextual fear memory, then a second issue is whether all networks perform equivalently under all conditions? In the case of animals trained without a hippocampus this does not seem to be the case. While hippocampal lesioned animals may form a contextual fear memory, acquisition is less efficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Wiltgen1">[64]</xref>, and the resultant memory is less precise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland3">[63]</xref> and less durable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Zelikowsky1">[65]</xref>. Similarly, in our study, the Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice were able to form a contextual fear memory, but this memory faded rapidly over time. This highlights that not all degenerate solutions necessarily have the same robustness, although it remains to be determined which specific alterations in network organization in Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice might be causally related to premature forgetting.</p>
      <p>In these studies we quantified expression of the immediate early gene, <italic>c-fos</italic>, to track changes in neural activity. Like other IEGs, Fos is induced rapidly in neurons after sustained activity and can be quantified at single-cell resolution across the entire brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Stone1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Yassin1">[66]</xref>. However, as Fos is an indirect measure of activity, there some potential limitations worth noting. Foremost, promoter-specific differences in regional and cellular expression mean that it is unlikely that there is a uniform relationship between neural activity and Fos across the brain, and regional differences in magnitude of the behaviorally-induced Fos signal inevitably would compromise mapping and subsequent network generation. However, regional differences in signal did not appear to be limiting as correlation strength (or connectivity) was not strongly influenced by Fos signal. A closely-related issue is whether networks based on different activity markers might differ markedly from one another. Accordingly, in additional analyses we quantified expression of another activity-regulated gene, <italic>egr-1</italic>, in a subset of brain regions. While there are inevitably some regional differences in Egr-1 and Fos expression following memory recall, we found that the overall patterns of inter-regional correlations derived from Egr-1 vs. Fos expression were very similar, consistent with idea that many activity-regulated genes are expressed in the same subpopulations of neurons after regional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Stone1">[12]</xref>. Future refinement of this approach might focus on improving temporal resolution (e.g., examining mRNA for single or multiple activity markers) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Guzowski1">[11]</xref> and data acquisition and analysis (e.g., optical projection tomography or 3D digital reconstruction from serial block-face scanning of activity marker expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Sharpe1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Chakravarty1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Ragan1">[69]</xref> and derivation of voxel-based, rather than region-based maps of co-activity). Indeed, a limitation of the current study was the relatively small sample sizes (â¼8 mice/group). In the future, implementation of these more high-throughput data acquisition and analysis methods, in particular, should make it is feasible to use larger sample sizes and consequently maximize the power of the approach.</p>

        <p>In these experiments, Fos and Egr-1 expression was analyzed following recall of long-term contextual fear memory at two time-points after training. A sub-analysis of these brain sections was previously published in which gene expression was quantified in six brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland1">[22]</xref>. In the current analyses, quantification was extended to 84 brain regions, and the network properties of fear memory were analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. The genetic background of all mice used in these experiments was 50% C57Bl/6NTacfBr and 50% 129Sv/J. Briefly, experimental mice were generated by crossing Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mutants that were 50% C57Bl/6NTacfBr and 50% 129Sv/J with mice that were F1 hybrids of the same genetic background. Male and female littermate WT and Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice were used in experiments. All mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Behavioral experiments were conducted during the light phase of the cycle, and mice were at least 8 weeks old at the time of training.</p>
        <p>Context fear conditioning experiments were conducted in a windowless room containing four conditioning chambers. The chambers were stainless steel (31 cmÃ24 cmÃ21 cm; Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). The shock-grid floor consisted of stainless steel shock-grid bars (diameter 3.2 mm) that were spaced 7.9 mm apart. The front, top, and back of the chamber were made of clear acrylic and the two sides made of modular aluminum. Mouse freezing behavior was monitored via four overhead cameras. Freezing was assessed using an automated scoring system (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL), which digitized the video signal at 4 Hz and compared frame by frame movement to determine the amount of time spent freezing. During training, WT and Î±-CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup>mice were placed in the conditioning chamber for seven minutes. After two minutes they were presented with five unsignalled footshocks (2 s duration, 0.75 mA, 1 minute apart). Following the last footshock mice remained in the context for an additional minute, and then were returned to their home cage. Separate groups of mice were tested either 1 day (WT mice, nâ=â8, CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice, nâ=â8) or 36 days (WT mice, nâ=â8, CaMKII<sup>+/â</sup> mice, nâ=â8) later. During testing, mice were placed back in the conditioning chamber for two minutes, and freezing was assessed. Control mice underwent the same procedure but did not receive the footshocks during the conditioning session (WT mice, 1 day delay, nâ=â8, WT mice, 36 day delay, nâ=â9).</p>
        <p>Ninety minutes following the completion of testing, mice were deeply anesthetized then perfused transcardially with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were removed, fixed overnight in PFA, then transferred to 30% sucrose solution and stored at 4Â°C. Fifty Âµm coronal cryostat sections were cut from the anterior to the posterior of the brain. Every fourth section contributed to a set, creating four sets with sections spaced 200 Âµm apart. One set was used for Fos and another for Egr-1 immunohistochemical staining. Brains were prepared for immunocytochemistry using an anti Fos (1â¶20000) or an anti Egr-1 (1â¶7500) primary rabbit polyclonal antibody. A biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1â¶2000) was used as a secondary antibody. Staining was revealed using the avidin-biotin peroxidase method (ABC kit) coupled to diaminobenzidine as a chromogen, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Frankland1">[22]</xref>.</p>

The threshold for detection of positive nuclei was set at a consistent level for each brain region, and only nuclei 25â125 Âµm<sup>2</sup> in area were counted. Immunoreactive nuclei were counted in all 84 regions of interest by an experimenter blind to the condition and expressed as the average number of Fos or Egr-1 positive cells per standard unit of area (10,000 Âµm<sup>2</sup>). For the majority of brain regions three sections were quantified bilaterally and then a mean count was computed for each animal. These sections were evenly spaced, and typically did not include the most anterior and posterior portions of a region in order to avoid sampling outside the region of interest. In a small subset of regions, counts were based on &lt;3 sections, usually because the anterior-posterior extent of the region â¤600 Âµm (e.g., VTA).</p>

        <title>Task PLS analysis</title>
        <p>PLS is a multivariate statistical technique that is used to identify optimal patterns of functional activity or connectivity that differentiate conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-McIntosh1">[9]</xref>. Task PLS is used in the analysis of brain region activity to describe the relationship between experimental conditions and functional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-McIntosh2">[70]</xref>. PLS is able to pull out similarities and differences between groups by identifying brain regions where activation varies with the experimental condition. Through singular value decomposition, PLS produces a set of mutually orthogonal latent variable (LV) pairs. One element of the LV depicts the contrast, which reflects a commonality or difference between conditions. The other element of the LV, the brain region salience, identifies brain regions that show the activation profile across tasks, indicating which brain areas are maximally expressed in a particular LV.</p>
        <p>Statistical assessment of PLS was performed by using permutation testing for LVs and bootstrap estimation of standard error for the brain region saliences. For the LV, significance was assessed by permutation testing; resampling without replacement by shuffling which condition (trained vs. control) each mouse was assigned to. Following each resampling, the PLS was recalculated. This was done 500 times in order to determine whether the effects represented in a given LV were significantly different to random noise. For brain region salience, reliability was assessed using bootstrap estimation of standard error. Bootstrap tests were performed by resampling 500 times with replacement, while keeping the subjects assigned to their conditions. This reflects the reliability of the contribution of that brain region to the LV. Brain regions with a bootstrap ratio greater than 3 (roughly corresponding to a confidence interval of 0.01) were considered as reliably contributing to the pattern. An advantage to using this approach over univariate methods is that no corrections for multiple comparisons are necessary because the brain region saliences are calculated on all of the brain regions in a single mathematical step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-McIntosh2">[70]</xref>.</p>

        <p>In order to evaluate how functional connectivity changed as a function of memory age in WT mice, we categorized our 84 brain regions into major brain subdivisions (hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebral nuclei and neocortex). We then contrasted mean correlation strength between different major subdivisions at the short vs. long retention delays. These contrasts were selected <italic>a priori</italic> according to models of systems consolidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002853-Squire1">[27]</xref> that predict time-dependent changes in the strength of hippocampal, prefrontal cortical and inter-cortical functional connections. Specifically, to assess time-dependent changes in hippocampal functional connectivity, mean correlations were calculated between hippocampal subregions (CA1-a, CA1-m, CA1-d, CA1-p, CA3, DG-up, DG-low) and the other major subdivisions of the brain (thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebral nuclei, midbrain and neocortex). To assess changes in medial prefrontal cortical functional connectivity, mean correlations were calculated between regions in the medial prefrontal cortex (Cg-a, Cg-p, IL, PrL) and the other subdivisions of the brain (thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebral nuclei, midbrain and neocortex). To assess changes in inter-cortical connectivity mean correlations were calculated within the entire neocortex, as well as within only the somatosensory cortex. Ninety-five % confidence intervals were computed by bootstrapping which involves resampling subjects with replacement 1000 times and each time recalculating the mean correlation. Differences between mean correlation coefficients at the 1 and 36 day delay were assessed by calculating the 95% confidence interval of the difference between mean correlations, and correlation differences where this confidence interval â¥0 were considered reliably different.</p>
