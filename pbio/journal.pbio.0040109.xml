				<article-title>What Does Evolution Do with a Spare Set of Genes?</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Several species of yeast, including the baker's yeast 
					<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> underwent a genome duplication roughly 100 million years ago. We analyze genetic networks whose members were involved in this duplication. Many networks show detectable redundancy and strong asymmetry in their interactions. For networks of co-expressed genes, we find evidence for network partitioning whereby the paralogs appear to have formed two relatively independent subnetworks from the ancestral network. We simulate the degeneration of networks after duplication and find that a model wherein the rate of interaction loss depends on the “neighborliness” of the interacting genes produces networks with parameters similar to those seen in the real partitioned networks. We propose that the rationalization of network structure through the loss of pair-wise gene interactions after genome duplication provides a mechanism for the creation of semi-independent daughter networks through the division of ancestral functions between these daughter networks.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Beyond its obvious potential for creating new gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b001">1</xref>], gene duplication also affects the structure of genetic networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b004">4</xref>]. Duplication initially increases the number of network interactions, but the subsequent loss of interactions can give rise to networks with novel architectures. The particular changes will depend on the type of duplication: i.e., single gene duplication versus segmental or whole genome duplication. Here we study network evolution after a whole genome duplication in the yeast 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b005">5</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b006">6</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Previous studies of network evolution have not needed to differentiate between single-gene and whole genome duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b004">4</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b007">7</xref>]. However, genome duplications are interesting because they provide networks with many simultaneously duplicated nodes. After such an event, the number of genes (nodes) in the network has doubled, while the number of interactions has quadrupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b008">8</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b009">9</xref>]. Subsequent interaction gain or loss reduces redundancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b008">8</xref>], generally rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b012">12</xref>].

          <title>Network Duplication</title>
          <p>(A) A view of network duplication illustrating our representation of these networks. Nodes (genes) directly opposite each other are paralogs resulting from WGD. Given genes 
						<italic>n<sub>1</sub>
						</italic> and 
						<italic>n<sub>2</sub>
						</italic> and their respective paralogs 
						<italic>p<sub>1</sub>
						</italic> and 
						<italic>p<sub>2</sub>,
						</italic> redundant interactions (dashed lines) are those that occur more than once in the set

          <p>(B) Two statistics used to quantify these networks. Symmetry measures the degree to which one network partition has more interactions than the other. Redundancy measures the proportion of edges which have survived in more than one copy since duplication (see main text). Example values for the extant network in (A) are also given.</p>
          <p>(C) Network randomization via subgraph replacement. Each quartet of nodes is randomly replaced by one of the possible subgraphs with the same number of edges. Subgraph frequencies are dependent on the overall edge frequencies of the nodes.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>We searched for patterns in how surviving interactions are partitioned among the duplicate genes. In particular, it is possible that specialization among the duplicates would yield a network divided into two parts, each having one copy of each pair of paralogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b015">15</xref>]. An interesting example of this possibility involving the apparent duplication of the glucosinolate synthesis pathway in 
				<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been identified by Gachon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b016">16</xref>]. After such specialization, we would expect that interactions between genes would be mostly confined within the two new subnetworks with few interactions crossing between them. Another example of this process, discussed below, concerns the glucose metabolism pathway in yeast. This pathway contains several duplicate gene pairs from whole-genome duplication (WGD) that are active under differing cellular conditions. These include genes for glucose sensing 
				<italic>(SNF3</italic> and 
				<italic>RGT2),</italic> glucose transport 
				<italic>(HXT6/HXT1)</italic> and the enzymes that catalyze the initial reaction of glycolysis (hexokinases 
				<italic>HXK1</italic> and 
				<italic>HXK2</italic>). In all three cases, the first member of the pair is involved in the metabolism of glucose at lower concentrations than is the second member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b019">19</xref>]. The idea that gene paralogs formed at WGD can associate into semi-autonomous subnetworks can be thought of as the “division of labor” over evolutionary time, with duplicate pairs specializing in a particular part of the ancestral network. It is also closely related to models of duplicate gene divergence through subfunctionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b020">20</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b021">21</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>We have studied the evolution of a subset of the yeast genetic network containing the 551 gene duplicate pairs preserved since the whole genome duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b005">5</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b022">22</xref>]. First, we show that such networks tend to display asymmetry and redundancy in their interaction distributions. We next present evidence that some of these networks have significant functional partitioning, with concomitant effects on the patterns of protein localization and gene expression. Examples of the genes found in such networks are discussed. Finally, we present models of network evolution that mimic several properties of the real networks and hence provide insight into the forces that may have driven that evolution.

      <sec id="s1a">
        <title>Central Idea and Algorithm</title>
        <p>We represent the paralogs from WGD as a graph divided into two columns with paralogs opposite each other. The order of paralogous pairs in the columns is arbitrary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Gene interaction data is overlaid as graph edges and can include protein-protein interactions, shared expression patterns, or interactions between transcription factors and their targets.
				</p>
        <p>We define two types of edge: “internal” edges connecting nodes in the same column (arcs or vertical lines in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and “crossing” edges joining nodes in different columns (diagonal lines in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Although we can speak conceptually of biologically interpretable subnetworks (such as a metabolic pathway), in practice our data will generally not give such clear-cut patterns. Our approach is conceptually similar to a pathway alignment algorithm developed by Kelley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b023">23</xref>] but focuses on a different optimality criterion and is applicable only to the particular case of WGD, both of which allow us to make stronger assumptions regarding the evolution of interactions.
				</p>
        <p>We thus require a measure on these data that allows patterns of network evolution to be studied. The definition we have used is that of a network partition. Given a set of 
					<italic>n</italic> duplicate gene pairs (2
					<italic>n</italic> genes), a partition of 
					<italic>n</italic> genes is created by selecting one member from each duplicate pair. This procedure defines the left-hand column in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and implicitly defines the complementary right-hand column. There are 2
					<italic><sup>n</sup>
					</italic><sup>−1</sup> possible unique partitionings of the duplicates. The above suggests an optimality criterion: define the best partitioning of paralogs as the one that minimizes the number of crossing edges. Our heuristic partitioning algorithm is able to optimally partition networks up to a size of 2
					<italic>n</italic> = 402 (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

        <title>Network Redundancy</title>
        <p>Because interactions between genes can be defined at varying stringencies and because not all paralogous pairs interact with other genes, our data naturally presents itself as 19 graph components drawn from six large-scale datasets (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). These components (containing subsets of the 551 duplicate pairs) will be the “networks” we refer to in our analysis below. Because these networks owe their origins to genome duplication, we searched for redundant interactions (cases where more than one interaction exists between two pairs of duplicates; see 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g001">1</xref>B) in the networks. Teichmann and Babu have previously shown in transcriptional regulatory networks that redundant interactions survive even for comparatively ancient duplicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b007">7</xref>], so it is reasonable to expect survival of some such interactions since WGD. We compared the proportion of the total network edges that were redundant to the degree of redundancy seen in random networks with the same node degree distribution. Many of the real networks have significantly more redundancy than the random ones, presumably due to genome duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g002">Figure 2</xref>A: we apply a Bonferroni correction for 19 hypothesis tests, thus 
					<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.002, with α &lt; 0.0026 to reject the null hypothesis of no redundancy).

        <p>For each dataset in 
					<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040109-t001">Table 1</xref> we searched for the optimal partitioning as described above. We then calculated the symmetry between the numbers of interactions in the resulting two partitions. Symmetry 
					<italic>(r)</italic> was defined as the ratio of the number of edges in the edge-poor partition to the number of edges in the edge-rich partition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Were edges distributed at random with respect to the partitions, we would expect approximate symmetry (
					<italic>r</italic> ≈ 1) between a partition and its complement. Instead, we find for many networks that one partition had significantly more interactions than the other (
					<italic>r</italic> &lt; 1.0, two–sided Binomial test with Bonferroni correction, 
					<italic>p</italic> ≤ 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Note that, because we have often used different thresholds to define networks, several of the networks in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g002">Figure 2</xref> are subnetworks of other networks (thus networks H075_1, H075_2, H075_3, H08_1, and H08_2 are subnetworks of H07 with higher interaction threshold values of 0.75 or 0.8). This selection procedure will tend to result in networks with some variation in the level of asymmetry (unpublished data).

        <p>As discussed, we searched for evidence for significant interaction partitioning using our algorithm. To determine if the networks showed more partitioning (fewer crossing edges) than we would expect by chance, we randomized the networks and recalculated the optimal partitioning. Randomization was carried out by selecting every possible pair of pair of paralogs (four genes). These four-node subgraphs were replaced at random by another four-node subgraph with the same number of edges (see 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The probability of subgraph replacement was made to depend on the inherent asymmetry in interaction degree between paralogs. Thus, we calculated the average fraction 
					<italic>p</italic> of the total number of interactions for a paralog pair that belonged to the interaction-rich paralog. The probability of an interaction joining two interaction-rich genes in a subgraph is then 
					<italic>p<sup>2</sup>
					</italic>, while the probability of an interaction joining an interaction-rich gene to an interaction-poor one is 2
					<italic>p(1−p)</italic> (because there are two possible interactions of this type). The subgraph replacement probabilities are calculated accordingly.
				</p>
        <p>Neither the protein-protein interaction data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b028">28</xref>] nor the transcriptional regulatory data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b029">29</xref>] showed significant network partitioning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040109-t001">Table 1</xref>), whereas there was evidence for significant partitioning in the co-expression data of Hughes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b030">30</xref>] and the shared expression change data of Gasch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b031">31</xref>]. For the co-expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b030">30</xref>] we defined interacting genes as those sharing expression similarity (Pearson's 
					<italic>r</italic>) of 0.7 or greater. As 
					<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040109-t001">Table 1</xref> shows, these data showed significant partitioning of edges when compared to randomized networks (
					<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.002). Of course, the issue of the multiple tests inherent in our approach should be considered. A standard Bonferroni correction is suboptimal for two reasons: first because many of our 
					<italic>p</italic>-values are upper bounds, and second because several of the networks are subnetworks of other networks. We can avoid the second issue by considering only the largest network in each case: we then have six comparisons, with the two gene expression networks still showing significant partitioning after this correction (
					<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for each, with α = 0.008 for the Bonferroni correction). As a further test, we considered the overall distribution of co-expression correlations for the genes in the network H07. As shown in 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>, there is a significant difference in the distribution of correlation values between the two partitions and a significantly lower mean correlation for comparing genes between partitions (likelihood ratio test [LRT], unpublished data). Moreover, the 201 duplicate pairs show an average correlation that is significantly higher than the average in either of the partitions, consistent with their recent duplication (LRT, unpublished data). The average correlation between duplicates is nonetheless much lower than our cutoff for an interaction (
					<italic>r</italic> = 0.27 as opposed to 
					<italic>r</italic> = 0.7).

        <p>An example network (H075_1) is shown in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Note the large number of internal edges and the few crossing edges and recall again that WGD paralogs are arranged opposite each other. Hence those genes without interactions are nonetheless of importance: the fact that their paralogs possess interactions indicates divergence between the two genes since WGD. Our results were robust to the exclusion of 55 pairs of ribosomal proteins from the largest subnetwork (H07) and to the random removal of 5% of interactions from this same network (unpublished data).

        <p>For the data from Gasch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b031">31</xref>], who studied the transcriptional response of yeast to 11 stress conditions, we found that because most genes did not show expression changes in most experiments, a correlation analysis similar to that above was inappropriate (many genes were highly correlated with each other because they showed no expression changes). Instead, we considered only genes with a change of expression of at least 3-fold in a stress condition relative to a control condition. Our approach is similar to that used by Wagner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b032">32</xref>]. We then connected genes that both showed expression changes in the same three (or four) conditions (datasets G3 and G4 in 
					<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040109-t001">Table 1</xref>). A few genes in these experiments showed changes in expression over many of the 11 experimental conditions, and these generalized stress response genes were thus connected to many other genes. To test for any resulting bias, we removed all genes with greater than six (G3_6 dataset) or greater than four (G3_4 dataset) responses, but in both cases the partitioning remained significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040109-t001">Table 1</xref>). The interaction definition used here can connect gene pairs where one gene is induced and one repressed in a given condition. We feel that such connections are valid because the genes in question show evidence of important associations. However, significant partitioning remains even when only genes whose direction of changes are the same are connected (
					<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
				</p>
        <p>We note that, when the two gene expression analyses (datasets G3 and H07) are combined, roughly 40% of the preserved duplicate gene pairs (230/551) appear in a network showing significant partitioning of interactions.</p>
        <p>One would expect network partitioning to leave its mark on other aspects of yeast's cellular organization. We thus examined the distribution of shared regulatory motifs and of protein localization in networks with significant partitioning. We also discuss the concordance of our inferred partitions with a well-understood part of the yeast metabolic network and their association with knockout phenotypes.</p>

        <title>Partitioning, Protein Localization, and Sequence Motifs</title>
        <p>An obvious question is whether the pairs of inferred partitions are distinct from one another in where their constituent proteins are located in the cell or in how often different regulatory motifs are found upstream of the genes in question. To test for such differences, we counted the number of proteins located in each of seven subcellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b033">33</xref>]. We then asked, using a permutation test, whether the number of genes in each compartment differs between the two partitions inferred for our largest dataset with significant partitioning (H07). An identical analysis was done with a total of 65 sequence motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b034">34</xref>]; see below for details on motifs used. Surprisingly we observe no differences in these two distributions between the partitions (unpublished data). Given our simulation results below, we suggest that, because partitioning appears to be a function of local network structure, the partitions, which consist of many duplicate genes (201), may still be grossly similar at this more global level.
				</p>
        <p>Given than our partitions did not appear to differ in global motif usage or in overall localization distribution, we next considered whether the partitions considered individually showed an excess of pairs of genes located in the same cellular compartment or with the same upstream motif compared to the set of 1,102 genes with WGD paralogs taken as a whole. This test will indicate if the partitions are enriched in functionally related genes. For the two largest networks with significant partitioning (H07 and G3), we tested whether the partitions had more co-localized proteins (i.e. proteins found in the same cellular compartment; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b033">33</xref>]) than we would expect given the overall frequency of co-localization among these 1,102 genes. In both cases the partitions showed a significant increase in co-localization (
					<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>). We further considered whether the identified network partitions were associated with DNA-level sequence motifs by studying the frequency of 71 conserved sequence motifs identified by Kellis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b034">34</xref>] in the 1,500 basepairs upstream regions of duplicate gene pairs. For these same two networks (H07 and G3), we first compared the average number of shared motifs for pairs of genes within each partition (λ
					<italic><sub>p</sub>
					</italic>, fit to a Poisson distribution using maximum likelihood; see 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>) to the average number of shared motifs for a sample of 20,000 random pairs of the 1,102 genes (λ
					<italic><sub>r</sub>
					</italic>). We also compared the values of λ
					<italic><sub>p</sub>
					</italic> between each pair of partitions. In these networks both partitions had λ
					<italic><sub>p</sub>
					</italic> &gt; λ
					<italic><sub>r</sub>
					</italic> (
					<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0003; LRT). We also saw that one partition always had significantly more shared motifs than other partition (
					<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.002; LRT). Our results indicate that the differences in gene expression patterns seen between partitions are mirrored by differences in sequence-level motifs. This result is perhaps not surprising as these motifs likely play a role in regulating expression.

        <title>Partitioning and Cellular Metabolism</title>
        <p>We have already discussed the idea of functional partitioning of gene pairs after duplication. With apologies to Adam Smith, we refer to this possibility as the division of labor, with the implication that it allows the functional specialization of duplicate genes. A known example of this concerns a WGD duplicate pair involved in glycolysis but not found in networks H07 or G3. The proteins encoded by the genes 
					<italic>CDC19</italic> and 
					<italic>PYK2</italic> both catalyze the last reaction in glycolysis, the conversion of phosophoenol-pyruvate to pyruvate. However, 
					<italic>CDC19</italic> is induced by the upstream metabolic intermediate fructose-1–6-biphosphate, while 
					<italic>PYK2</italic> is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b035">35</xref>]. This difference can be understood if it is noted that 
					<italic>PYK2</italic> is active at lower glucose concentrations than is 
					<italic>CDC19</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b035">35</xref>], conditions where the concentration of upstream metabolites may be insufficient to induce the required activity. Thus, this duplication frees the cell from having to make a trade-off between efficiency at high and at low glucose levels. Similar divisions are apparent in our networks: two high-affinity hexose transporters, 
					<italic>HXT4</italic> and 
					<italic>HXT6,</italic> are both placed in the same partition as the hexokinase gene 
					<italic>HXK1</italic> in networks H07 and H075_2, in agreement with the known roles of these genes in low-concentration glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b019">19</xref>]. Similarly 
					<italic>HXK1</italic> has many interactions in stress response network G3, while its WGD paralog 
					<italic>HXK2,</italic> active during “standard” conditions of glucose fermentation, does not. Functional differences also exist between 
					<italic>HXK1</italic> and 
					<italic>HXK2</italic>. In particular, 
					<italic>HXK2</italic> has regulatory functions including the regulation of its paralog 
					<italic>HXK1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b019">19</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b036">36</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b037">37</xref>]. Considered together, we believe the above facts constitute evidence for division of labor, with one group of glycolytic gene duplicates functioning at low glucose levels and the other at higher levels.
				</p>
        <p>In addition, the co-expression networks (H07 and H075_2) also contain some smaller gene “circuits” which may be associated with responses to growth in the absence of glucose. The duplicate gene 
					<italic>SIP3</italic> (WGD paralog: YHR155W) is part of the SNF1-complex responsible for inducing glucose-repressed genes in the absence of glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b038">38</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b039">39</xref>]. Several of the genes 
					<italic>SIP3</italic> interacts with fit plausibly into such a regulation pattern. These include the glycerol transporter 
					<italic>GUP1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b040">40</xref>], the glyoxalase 
					<italic>GLO2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b041">41</xref>], and the gene 
					<italic>DCI1</italic> involved in fatty acid oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b042">42</xref>], all genes whose metabolic activity would need to change depending on glucose levels. The paralogs of these three genes either show different phenotypes 
					<italic>(GUP2, ECI1)</italic> or are only present in the mitochondria 
					<italic>(GLO4),</italic> suggesting functional divergence.
				</p>
        <p>It is important to bear in mind that despite the attractiveness of the hypothesis of complete network duplication followed by specialization, the high levels of gene loss observed in yeast after WGD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b043">43</xref>] will hamper our ability to perceive biologically relevant patterns in these data (because the resulting single copy genes that form part of any complete biologically relevant network are not present in our analysis).

        <title>Stress Response and Knockout Phenotypes</title>
        <p>Given the high asymmetry in the stress response datasets, it is natural to ask what the role of the interaction-poor paralogs is. To do so, we examined gene knockout data from Giaever et al. and Steinmetz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b044">44</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b045">45</xref>] (curated by SGD; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b046">46</xref>]). For the largest stress response network (G3) there is no significant difference between the number of interaction-rich paralogs which have detectable knockout phenotypes when their paralogs do not and the number of interaction-poor paralogs who have such phenotypes (nine versus eight). This result argues against the interaction-rich paralogs being generally more important. Coupled with the above results, there are thus strong indicators of differences in gene function between these duplicate genes.

        <title>Simulated Network Evolution</title>
        <p>Given the existence of networks with significant partitioning, we used simulations of network evolution to help us understand the forces at work. Starting from a fully-redundant network derived from dataset H075_1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g003">Figure 3</xref>), we simulated network evolution under three models of interaction loss (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and examined the distributions of crossing edges seen among 500 simulation replicates (black bars in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In the simplest model (“uniform loss;” 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), interactions are lost at random until redundancy reaches the level seen in the real network. The second model (“poor-get-poorer;” 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) makes the probability of interaction loss inversely proportional to the number of ancestral interactions retained by the two nodes involved. The third model: “co-loss” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), makes the probability of edge loss dependent on the number of shared neighboring nodes

        <p>The performance of the three models was assessed by comparing the degree of partitioning seen in the 500 simulated networks (black bars, 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>A–C) to the partitioning seen after randomizing each of these simulated networks using the above subgraph replacement approach (grey bars). If these two distributions are similar that suggests that that model does not produce partitioned networks. The second two models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and C) have a variable parameter allowing us to tune the simulations to be similar to the real networks. For 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, separation between the simulated networks and their randomized counterparts is low, but asymmetry approaches values seen in the real data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). In 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, tuning the model gave an average proportion of crossing edges nearly identical to the real data (10.11 versus 10; arrow in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Also, although mean symmetry in these simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>D) was higher than in the real co-expression data, median symmetry was lower. Thus, the co-loss model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) provides a close approximation to real data for two parameters and gives clear separation between the simulated networks before and after randomization.
				</p>
        <p>For comparative purposes, we performed similar simulations on a network without significant partitioning, the protein-protein interactions from the database of interacting proteins (DIP core, dataset PPDC in 
					<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040109-t001">Table 1</xref>). In this case the co-loss model did not generate significant partitioning or asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>D), likely because the input network lacked the clustering needed for such patterns to emerge (note the lower clustering coefficients for this network as compared to H075_1 in 
					<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040109-t001">Table 1</xref>). The poor-get-poorer model instead provided the best fit to this network. Asymmetry was very similar to the real data, and the number of crossing edges in the simulations was not significantly different from the actual network (unpublished data). We discuss implications of these simulation results and of the division of labor among duplicates more generally below.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our analysis of the pattern of gene interactions seen among duplicate genes in 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> reveals interesting high-level features of network duplication. There has been considerable, though incomplete, loss of redundant interactions since WGD, as well as development of significant asymmetry in interactions in several cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g002">Figure 2</xref>).
			</p>
      <p>We also found evidence for the partitioning of network interactions between duplicate genes in gene expression networks. Because partitions are inferred algorithmically, it is important to be certain they have biological significance. We point to three distinct lines of evidence that this is the case. First, real networks possess more partitioning than do randomized ones. Second, partitions show a non-random distribution of shared regulatory motifs. We would not expect this were the partitions biologically irrelevant. Finally, at least some partitions show differences in the frequency of protein co-localization.</p>
      <p>Van Noort, Snel, and Huynen have previously observed that gene co-expression networks can evolve in a modular fashion, whereby, after the shared duplication of an ancestral pair of co-expressed genes, the two pairs of paralogs diverge in expression to form two new genetic “circuits.” Each circuit of two co-expressed genes contains one member of each duplicate pair but the circuits are not themselves co-expressed with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b015">15</xref>]. Our analysis allows us to study such patterns at a global scale, rather than focusing on pair-wise comparisons. Moreover, because our set of duplicate genes is known to have originated with a single event, we can make stronger conclusions regarding the evolution of the network. We thus find larger scale examples of this phenomenon, with several pairs of duplicates diverging into parallel functional groups (such as members of the glycolytic pathway). However, as 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g003">Figure 3</xref> indicates, patterns of network evolution are more complex that simple pair-wise pathway divergence.
			</p>
      <p>The obvious question raised by our analysis is whether the partitioned networks we observe formed through the degenerative partial loss of ancestral functions (subfunctionalization; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b020">20</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b047">47</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b048">48</xref>]) or the appearance of new functions (neofunctionalization). For the glycolytic genes, it seems plausible to argue for the former, as the ancestral yeast certainly expressed the glycolytic pathway genes at both high and low glucose levels. However, because we lack detailed knowledge of the regulation involved, we cannot make this claim absolutely. This difficulty is a general one, and, if we have a slight preference for the subfunctionalization hypothesis, it is simply because it is the more parsimonious one.
			</p>
      <p>Our simulations of network evolution also provide some insight into these questions. We were able to generate networks with partitioning similar to real data, based on a set of rules that make interaction loss more or less favorable depending on the local interaction environment of a duplicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).
			</p>
      <p>Our three models allow interactions to be lost through genetic drift or directional selection and to be maintained by purifying selection. The models differ in how “knowledge” of the total network is allowed to influence selection. Under the uniform loss model, nodes have no knowledge of the wider network, implying that a gene's function is independent of other genes. Given these features, it is unsurprising that this model produces symmetric, non-partitioned networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) which are most similar to the regulatory networks studied (which also show neither partitioning nor asymmetry). One can argue that the loss of a single binding site for a transcription factor may have a relatively limited impact on whether that factor will lose other interactions, which may be the reason for the similarity between these simulated networks and the regulatory data. The poor-get-poorer model allows local knowledge to affect interaction retention. The result is asymmetric but non-partitioned networks similar to real protein-interaction networks (which exhibit weak asymmetry in their interactions, see 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g002">Figures 2</xref> and 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">4</xref>D). This similarity implies that loss of a direct protein interaction would be disadvantageous but that the loss of a distant interaction in a partner protein would have a much weaker effect. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the poor-get-poorer model created simulated networks with interaction patterns very similar to the protein-protein interaction network used to seed the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040109-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). The co-loss model incorporates regional knowledge by considering how many shared neighbors two interacting genes have. Here, a gene's effectiveness depends both on direct partners and on more distant connections. Note that the nature of co-expression network evolution is inherently regional, because changes in one gene's expression pattern could simultaneously disrupt its expression correlation (and hence “interaction”) with several other genes. Thus, it is not unexpected that the co-loss model gives rise to networks similar to real co-expression networks. Partitioning arises under this model because we require all ancestral edges to be preserved in at least one copy. Thus, interaction loss in one paralog will naturally give rise to a subnetwork containing that gene's paralog which preserves the relevant interactions. Finally, it is interesting to note that the co-loss model can create partitioning by a process that is strictly degenerative and hence similar to the subfunctionalization model of Force et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b020">20</xref>]. Such a possibility belies the idea that all complexity in living systems must evolve through directional selection,

      <p>The ramifications of how genome duplication may lead to the division of labor among duplicates needs further exploration. Although it increases the complexity of a system without any necessary improvement in function, the new network layout may have other desirable features such as robustness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b049">49</xref>] or evolvability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b050">50</xref>]. Moreover, the presence or absence of partitioning in the network may be indicative of the internal dependencies of the nodes upon each other. All of these ideas will be interesting possibilities to test with future functional genomic data.

        <p>We first use a greedy search (sequential addition of paralogs minimizing the number of added crossing edges at each step) followed by local pair-wise exchanges to identify a candidate solution with few crossing edges. Using this candidate solution, we recursively search a binary tree of all possible permutations. We apply a branch and bound approach, such that at any internal node in this tree we have added 
					<italic>i</italic> paralog pairs to a “family” of potential permutations (thus if 
					<italic>n</italic> = 4, one internal node of this tree at depth 
					<italic>i</italic> = 3 would have the form 010×, where × can take on values of either 1 or 0). If the number of edges crossing in the permutation family is as large as the number seen in the best permutation so far, evaluation of that permutation family can be abandoned, as the score of any permutation in that family can be no better than the best score so far. Every such permutation family abandoned saves a total of 2
					<italic><sup>n−i</sup>
					</italic><sup>−1</sup> permutations which need not be considered. To make this 
					<italic>i</italic> as small as possible, our algorithm adds node pairs with high degree first, which causes the score to climb quickly in the initial branchings.
				</p>
        <p>We save further time by noting that genes with interactions that connect to both of a pair of paralogs must add one crossing edge to the score for any permutation. We maintain a lookup table of such instances, allowing us to determine if the final score of a partition family will exceed the current best score and so to abandon that permutation.</p>
        <p>The performance of this algorithm is such that we were able to analyze a network of

For the data of Hughes et al. (hereafter “co-expression data”), we calculated, for each pair of genes, the Pearson's correlation coefficient 
					<italic>(r)</italic> between the two genes. Only gene pairs for which both genes shared measured expression levels for at least 200 experiments were considered. The data of Gasch et al. reports the response of yeast cells to a number of stress factors. Following Wagner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b032">32</xref>], we considered data for 11 different stress conditions: heat and cold shock, oxidative stress, treatment with menadione, diamide, or dithiothrietol (DTT), hyper and hypo-osmotic stress, amino acid and nitrogen starvation, and cells in stationary phase cultures. For each gene and experiment, the absolute value of the maximal expression change (induction or repression) was found. We refer to these data hereafter as “shared expression changes.”

        <p>To assess whether cross-reactivity in the above assays was likely to confound our analysis, we examined the synonymous divergence of the 551 genes pairs. For the 19 networks in

Subsequent analysis revealed that all but four of the 21 pairs with K<sub>s</sub> &lt; 0.2 in this network were ribosomal proteins. For this reason we repeated the analysis of network H07 excluding ribosomal proteins.

        <title>Simulation of network evolution</title>
        <p>We proposed simple models of network evolution to compare to the real data. We chose to evolve networks to achieve the same redundancy as an extant network. Thus, after duplication, the network evolves strictly by loss of interactions. Although this is clearly over-simplistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b011">11</xref>], we note that previous work has suggested that loss of network interactions after duplication is indeed more common than gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b010">10</xref>].
				</p>
        <p>Simulations were initiated with a fully redundant network (i.e. all edges present in four copies). All of our models then iterate over the number of remaining redundant edges until that number is equal to that seen in the input network. At each step, the total probability of edge loss is scaled to 1.0 and a uniform random number on this interval is used to select the edge to be lost. The models differ in the probability of loss assigned to a given redundant edge.</p>

        <title>Poor-get-poorer</title>
        <p>Several types of biological networks show a power-law scaling of interaction degree (e.g. protein-protein interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b010">10</xref>] and metabolic networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b051">51</xref>]). For such networks, the preferential attachment of new interactions to nodes with many existing interactions is critical to yielding this degree distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040109-b052">52</xref>]. By analogy to this “rich-get-richer” phenomena, we propose a “poor-get-poorer” mode of interaction loss after duplication. For two nodes

Note that Group 1 in particular is enriched with high correlation values (the blue “hump” on the right of the distribution), whereas the cross-group distribution has a mean closest to zero, indicating little enrichment of co-expressed genes, but rather merely the random correlation value of 0.0, which would be expected. The duplicate gene pairs from WGD show higher correlations, which is presumably an indication of their recent common ancestry.</p>
