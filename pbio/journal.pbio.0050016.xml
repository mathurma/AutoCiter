          <p> SY contributed to the design and implementation of the clustering process, and the
            subsequent analyses of the clusters; he also contributed to and coordinated all of the
            analyses in the paper, and wrote a large portion of the paper. GS contributed to the
            design and analysis of the clustering process, contributed ideas, analysis, and also
            wrote parts of the paper. DBR identified ORFs from the assemblies, performed the
            all-against-all BLAST searches, contributed to GOS kingdom assignment, and contributed
            analysis tools and ideas. ALH performed the assembly of GOS sequences, and contributed
            analysis tools and ideas. SW contributed to the analysis of viral sequences. KR
            contributed to project planning and paper writing. JAE performed the analysis of UV
            damage repair enzymes, and also contributed to paper writing. KBH, RF, and RLS
            contributed to project planning. GM performed the profile HMM searches, carried out the
            domain analysis, and contributed to paper writing. WL and AG carried out the ORFan
            analysis and contributed to paper writing. LJ contributed to the profile-profile search
            process. PC and AG carried out the analysis of proteases and contributed to paper
            writing. CSM, HL, and DE carried out the analysis of novel clusters, the analysis of
            metabolic enzymes and contributed to paper writing. YZ contributed to the profile HMM
            searches and domain analysis. STM, MPJ, CvB, DAS, and SEB carried out the analysis of
            Pfam domain distributions in GOS and current proteins, analysis of IDO, contributed to
            GOS kingdom assignment, and also contributed to paper writing. DAS and SEB also

        <p>Metagenomics projects based on shotgun sequencing of populations of micro-organisms yield
          insight into protein families. We used sequence similarity clustering to explore proteins
          with a comprehensive dataset consisting of sequences from available databases together
          with 6.12 million proteins predicted from an assembly of 7.7 million Global Ocean Sampling
          (GOS) sequences. The GOS dataset covers nearly all known prokaryotic protein families. A
          total of 3,995 medium- and large-sized clusters consisting of only GOS sequences are
          identified, out of which 1,700 have no detectable homology to known families. The GOS-only
          clusters contain a higher than expected proportion of sequences of viral origin, thus
          reflecting a poor sampling of viral diversity until now. Protein domain distributions in
          the GOS dataset and current protein databases show distinct biases. Several protein
          domains that were previously categorized as kingdom specific are shown to have GOS
          examples in other kingdoms. About 6,000 sequences (ORFans) from the literature that
          heretofore lacked similarity to known proteins have matches in the GOS data. The GOS
          dataset is also used to improve remote homology detection. Overall, besides nearly
          doubling the number of current proteins, the predicted GOS proteins also add a great deal
          of diversity to known protein families and shed light on their evolution. These
          observations are illustrated using several protein families, including phosphatases,
          proteases, ultraviolet-irradiation DNA damage repair enzymes, glutamine synthetase, and
          RuBisCO. The diversity added by GOS data has implications for choosing targets for
          experimental structure characterization as part of structural genomics efforts. Our
          analysis indicates that new families are being discovered at a rate that is linear or
          almost linear with the addition of new sequences, implying that we are still far from
          discovering all protein families in nature.</p>

          <p>The rapidly emerging field of metagenomics seeks to examine the genomic content of
            communities of organisms to understand their roles and interactions in an ecosystem.
            Given the wide-ranging roles microbes play in many ecosystems, metagenomics studies of
            microbial communities will reveal insights into protein families and their evolution.
            Because most microbes will not grow in the laboratory using current cultivation
            techniques, scientists have turned to cultivation-independent techniques to study
            microbial diversity. One such technique—shotgun sequencing—allows random sampling of DNA
            sequences to examine the genomic material present in a microbial community. We used
            shotgun sequencing to examine microbial communities in water samples collected by the
              <italic>Sorcerer II</italic> Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition. Our analysis
            predicted more than six million proteins in the GOS data—nearly twice the number of
            proteins present in current databases. These predictions add tremendous diversity to
            known protein families and cover nearly all known prokaryotic protein families. Some of
            the predicted proteins had no similarity to any currently known proteins and therefore
            represent new families. A higher than expected fraction of these novel families is
            predicted to be of viral origin. We also found that several protein domains that were
            previously thought to be kingdom specific have GOS examples in other kingdoms. Our
            analysis opens the door for a multitude of follow-up protein family analyses and
            indicates that we are a long way from sampling all the protein families that exist in
            nature.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Despite many efforts to classify and organize proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b006">6</xref>]
        from both structural and functional perspectives, we are far from a clear understanding of
        the size and diversity of the protein universe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b009">9</xref>].
        Environmental shotgun sequencing projects, in which genetic sequences are sampled from
        communities of microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b014">14</xref>], are poised to make a dramatic impact
        on our understanding of proteins and protein families. These studies are not limited to
        culturable organisms, and there are no selection biases for protein classes or organisms.
        These studies typically provide a gene-centric (as opposed to an organism-centric) view of
        the environment and allow the examination of questions related to protein family evolution
        and diversity. The protein predictions from some of these studies are characterized both by
        their sheer number and diversity. For instance, the recent Sargasso Sea study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b010">10</xref>] resulted in 1.2 million protein
        predictions and identified new subfamilies for several known protein families.</p>
      <p>Protein exploration starts by clustering proteins into groups or <italic>families</italic>
        of evolutionarily related sequences. The notion of a protein family, while biologically very
        relevant, is hard to realize precisely in mathematical terms, thereby making the large-scale
        computational clustering and classification problem nontrivial. Techniques for these
        problems typically rely on <italic>sequence similarity</italic> to group sequences. Proteins
        can be grouped into families based on the highly conserved structural units, called
          <italic>domains,</italic> that they contain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b016">16</xref>]. Alternatively,
        proteins are grouped into families based on their full sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b018">18</xref>]. Many of these classifications, together with various expert-curated databases
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b019">19</xref>] such as Swiss-Prot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b020">20</xref>], Pfam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b021">21</xref>], and TIGRFAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b023">23</xref>], or integrated efforts such as Uniprot
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b024">24</xref>] and InterPro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b025">25</xref>], provide rich resources for protein
        annotation. However, a vast number of protein predictions remain unclassified both in terms
        of structure and function. Given varying rates of evolution, there is unlikely to be a
        single similarity threshold or even a small set of thresholds that can be used to define
        every protein family in nature. Consequently, estimates of the number of families that exist
        in nature vary considerably based on the different thresholds used and assumptions made in
        the classification process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b029">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we explored proteins using a comprehensive dataset of publicly available
        sequences together with environmental sequence data generated by the <italic>Sorcerer
          II</italic> Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) expedition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b030">30</xref>]. We used a novel clustering technique based on
        full-length sequence similarity both to predict proteins and to group related sequences. The
        goals were to understand the rate of discovery of protein families with the increasing
        number of protein predictions, explore novel families, and assess the impact of the
        environmental sequences from the expedition on known proteins and protein families. We used
        hidden Markov model (HMM) profiling to examine the relative biases in protein domain
        distributions in the GOS data and existing protein databases. This profiling was also used
        to assess the impact of the GOS data on target selection for protein structure
        characterization efforts. We carried out in-depth analyses on several protein families to
        validate our clustering approach and to understand the diversity and evolutionary
        information that the GOS data added; the families included ultraviolet (UV) irradiation DNA
        damage repair enzymes, phosphatases, proteases, and the metabolic enzymes glutamine
        synthetase and RuBisCO.</p>

        <p>None of the above-mentioned databases contained sequences from the Sargasso Sea study
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b010">10</xref>], the largest environmental
          survey to date, and so we pooled reads from the Sargasso Sea study with the reads from the
            <italic>Sorcerer II</italic> GOS expedition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b030">30</xref>], creating a combined set that we call the GOS
          dataset. The GOS dataset was assembled using the Celera Assembler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b037">37</xref>] as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b030">30</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and
            Methods</xref>). The GOS dataset was primarily generated from the 0.1 μm to 0.8 μm size
          filters and thus is expected to be mostly microbial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b030">30</xref>]. The data also included a small set of sequences from
          a viral size (&lt;0.1 μm) fraction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>We identified open reading frames (ORFs) from the DNA sequences in the PG, TGI-EST, and
          GOS datasets. An ORF is commonly defined as a translated DNA sequence that begins with a
          start codon and ends with a stop codon. To accommodate partial DNA sequences, we extended
          this definition to allow an ORF to be bracketed by either a start codon or the start of
          the DNA sequence, and by either a stop codon or the end of the DNA sequence. ORFs were
          generated by considering translations of the DNA sequence in all six frames. For ORFs from
          the PG and TGI-EST datasets, we used the appropriate codon usage table for the known
          organism. For GOS ORFs from the assembled sequences, we used translation table 11 (the
          code for bacteria, archaea, and prokaryotic viruses) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b031">31</xref>]. We did not include alternate codon translations in
          this analysis. For all datasets, only ORFs containing at least 60 amino acids (aa) were
          considered. Not all ORFs are proteins. In this paper, ORFs that have reasonable evidence
          for being proteins are called <italic>predicted proteins;</italic> other ORFs are called
            <italic>spurious ORFs</italic>.</p>
        <p>In summary, the total input data for this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t001">Table 1</xref>) consisted of 28,610,994 sequences from NCBI-nr,
          PG, TGI-EST, ENS, and GOS. All data and analysis results will be made publicly available
          (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>We used a sequence similarity clustering to group related sequences and subsequently
          predicted proteins from this grouping. This approach of protein prediction was adopted for
          two reasons. First, the GOS data make up a major portion of the dataset being analyzed,
          and a large fraction of GOS ORFs are fragmentary sequences. Traditional annotation
          pipelines/gene finders, which presume complete or near-complete genomic data, perform
          unsatisfactorily on this type of data. Second, protein prediction based on the comparison
          of ORFs to known protein sequences imposes limits on the protein families that can be
          explored. In particular, novel proteins that belong to known families will not be detected
          if they are sufficiently distant from known members of that family. This is the case even
          though there may be other novel proteins that can transitively link them to the known
          proteins. Similarly, truly novel protein families will also not be detected.</p>
        <p>As the primary input to our clustering process, we computed the pairwise sequence
          similarity of the 28.6 million aa sequences in our dataset using an all-against-all BLAST
          search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b038">38</xref>]. This required more than
          1 million CPU hours on two large compute clusters (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The sequences were clustered in four steps (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). In the first step, we identified
          a nonredundant set of sequences from the entire dataset using only pairwise matches with
          ≥98% similarity and involving ≥95% of the length of the shorter sequence. This step served
          the dual role of identifying highly conserved groups of sequences (where each group was
          represented by a <italic>nonredundant</italic> sequence) and removing redundancy in the
          dataset due to identical and near-identical sequences. Only nonredundant sequences were
          considered for further steps in our clustering procedure. In the second step, we
          identified <italic>core sets</italic> of similar sequences using only matches between two
          sequences involving ≥80% of the length of the longer sequence. We used a graph-theoretic
          procedure to identify dense subgraphs (the core sets) within a graph defined by these
          matches. While the match parameters we used in this step were more relaxed than those in
          the first step, we chose them to reduce the grouping of unrelated sequences while
          simultaneously reducing the unnecessary splitting of families. In the third step, these
          core sets were transformed into profiles, and we used a profile–profile method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b039">39</xref>] to merge related core sets into
          larger groups. In the final step, we recruited sequences to core sets using
          sequence-profile matching (PSI-BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b040">40</xref>]) and BLAST matches to core set members. We required the match to involve
          ≥60% of the length of the sequence being recruited.</p>
        <p>We identified and removed clusters containing likely spurious ORFs using two filters (see
            <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The first filter identified
          clusters containing shadow ORFs. The second filter identified clusters containing
          conserved but noncoding sequences, as indicated by a lack of selection at the codon level.
          Only clusters that remained after the two filtering steps and contained at least two
          nonredundant sequences are reported in this analysis.</p>
        <p>We examined the distribution of known protein domains in the full dataset using profile
          HMMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b041">41</xref>] from the Pfam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b015">15</xref>] and TIGRFAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b022">22</xref>] databases (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>We labeled sequences that end up in clusters (containing at least two nonredundant
          sequences) or that have HMM matches as <italic>predicted proteins.</italic> The inclusion
          of the PG ORF set allowed for the evaluation of protein prediction using our clustering
          approach. A comparison of proteins predicted in the PG ORF set by our clustering against
          PG ORFs annotated as proteins by whole-genome annotation techniques revealed that our
          protein prediction method via clustering has a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 86%
          (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The HMM profiling
          allowed for the evaluation of our clustering technique's grouping of sequences. We used
          Pfam models in two different ways for this assessment (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) and make three observations. First, using a simple Pfam
          domain architecture-based evaluation, these clusters are mostly consistent as reflected by
          93% of clusters having less than 2% unrelated pairs of sequences in them. Second, these
          clusters are quite conservative and can split domain families, with 58% of domain
          architectures being confined to single clusters and 88% of domain architectures having
          more than half of their occurrences in a single cluster. Third, the size distribution of
          these clusters is quite similar to the size distribution of clusters induced by Pfams.</p>

        <p>Of the initial 28,610,944 sequences, we labeled 9,978,637 sequences (35%) as predicted
          proteins based on the clustering, of which nearly 60% are from GOS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t002">Table 2</xref>). The HMM profiling labeled only an additional
          226,743 (0.8%) sequences as predicted proteins, for a total of 10,205,380 predicted
          proteins. This indicates that our clustering method captures most of the sequences found
          by profile HMMs. For sequences both in clusters and with HMM matches, (on average) 73.5%
          of their length is covered by HMM matches. For sequences not in clusters but with HMM
          matches, this value is only 45.3%. Furthermore, while 64% of sequences in clusters have
          HMM matches, there are 3,550,901 sequences that are grouped into clusters but do not have
          HMM matches. Most of these clusters correspond either to families lacking profile HMMs or
          contain sequences that are too remote to match above the cutoffs used. The latter is an
          indication of the diversity added to known families that is not picked up by current
          profile HMMs.</p>

        <p>Using our method, the predicted proteins constitute different fractions of the totals for
          the five datasets, with 87% for NCBI-nr, nearly 20% for both PG ORFs and TGI-EST ORFs, 92%
          for ENS, and 35% for GOS. The high rate of prediction for ENS is a reflection of the high
          degree of conservation of proteins across the metazoan genomes, whereas the prediction
          rates for PG ORFs and TGI-EST ORFs are similar to rates seen in other protein prediction
          approaches. The 13% of NCBI-nr sequences that we marked as spurious may constitute
          contaminants in the form of false predictions or organism-specific proteins. Nearly
          two-thirds of these sequences are labeled “hypotheticals,” “unnamed,” or “unknown.” This
          is more than twice the fraction of similarly labeled sequences (30%) in the full NCBI-nr
          dataset. Of the remaining one-third, half of them are less than 100 aa in length. This
          suggests that they are either fast-evolving short peptides, spurious predictions, or
          proteins that failed to meet the length-based thresholds in the clustering.</p>
        <p>Based on the clustering and the HMM profiling, there is evidence for 6,123,395 proteins
          in the GOS dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t002">Table 2</xref>). Given
          the fragmentary nature of the GOS ORFs (as a result of the GOS assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b030">30</xref>]), it is not surprising that the average length of a
          GOS-predicted protein (199 aa) is smaller than the average length of predicted proteins in
          NCBI-nr (359 aa), PG ORFs (325 aa), TGI-EST ORFs (207 aa), and ENS (489 aa). The ratio of
          clustered ORFs to total ORFs is significantly higher for the GOS ORFs (34%) compared to PG
          ORFs (19%). This could be due to a large number of false-positive protein predictions in
          the GOS dataset. However, this is unlikely for a variety of reasons. Nearly 4.64 million
          GOS ORFs (26.6%) have significant BLAST matches (with an <italic>E-</italic>value ≤1 ×
            10<sup>−10</sup>) to NCBI-nr sequences. The PG ORFs do not have a high false-positive
          rate compared to the submitted annotation for the prokaryotic genomes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Most importantly, based on the
          fragmentary nature of GOS sequencing compared to PG sequencing, the number of shadow
          (spurious) ORFs ≥60 aa is significantly reduced (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>Some pairs of GOS-predicted proteins that belong to the same cluster are adjacent in the
          GOS assembly. While some of them correspond to tandem duplicate genes, an overwhelming
          fraction of the pairs are on mini-scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b010">10</xref>], indicating that they are potentially pieces of the same protein (from the
          same clone) that we split into fragments. We estimate that this effect applies to 3% of
          GOS-predicted proteins. Sequencing errors and the use of the wrong translation table can
          also result in the ORF generation process producing split ORF fragments.</p>
        <p>The combined set of predicted proteins in NCBI-nr, PG, TGI-EST, and ENS, as expected, has
          a lot of redundancy. For instance, most of the PG protein predictions are in NCBI-nr.
          Removing exact substrings of longer sequences (i.e., 100% identity) reduces this combined
          set to 3,167,979 predicted proteins. When we perform the same filtering on the GOS
          dataset, 5,654,638 predicted proteins remain. Thus, the GOS-predicted protein set is 1.8
          times the size of the predicted protein set from current publicly available datasets. We
          used a simple BLAST based scheme to assign kingdoms for the GOS sequences (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Of the sequences that we could
          annotate by kingdom, 63% of the sequences in the public datasets are from the eukaryotic
          kingdom, and 90.8% of the sequences in the GOS set are from the bacterial kingdom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Rate of Discovery of Protein Families</title>
        <p>We examined the rate of discovery of protein families using our clustering method to
          determine whether our sampling of the protein universe is reaching saturation. We find
          that for the present number of sequences there is an approximately linear trend in the
          rate of discovery of clusters with the addition of new (i.e., nonredundant) sequences
            (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, the observed
          distribution of cluster sizes is well approximated by a power law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b043">43</xref>], and this observed power law can be used to predict the rate of growth of
          the number of clusters of a given size (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and
            Methods</xref>). This rate is dependent on the value of the power law exponent and
          decreases with increasing cluster sizes. We find good agreement between the observed and
          predicted growth rates for different cluster sizes. The approximately linear relationship
          between the number of clusters and the number of protein sequences indicates that there
          are likely many more protein families (either novel or subfamilies distantly related to
          known families) remaining to be discovered.</p>

        <title>GOS versus Known Prokaryotic versus Known Nonprokaryotic</title>
        <p>We also examined the GOS coverage of known proteins and protein families. Based on the
          cell-size filtering performed while collecting the GOS samples, we expected that the
          sample would predominantly be a size-limited subset of prokaryotic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b030">30</xref>]. We studied the content of the 17,067
          medium- and large-sized clusters across three groupings: (1) GOS, (2) known prokaryotic
          (PG together with bacterial and archaeal portions of NCBI-nr), and (3) known
          nonprokaryotic (TGI-EST and ENS together with viral and eukaryotic portions of NCBI-nr).
          The Venn diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the
          breakdown of these clusters by content (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and
            Methods</xref>). The largest section contains GOS-only clusters (23.40%) emphasizing the
          significant novelty provided by the GOS data. The next section consists of clusters
          containing sequences from only the known nonprokaryotic grouping (20.78%), followed
          closely by the section containing clusters with sequences from all three groupings
          (20.23%). The large known nonprokaryotic–only grouping shows that our current GOS sampling
          methodology will not cover all protein families, and perhaps misses some protein families
          that are exclusive to higher eukaryotes. The large section of clusters that include all
          three groupings indicates a large core of well-conserved protein families across all
          domains of life. In contrast, the known prokaryotic protein families are almost entirely
          covered by the GOS data.</p>

        <title>Novelty Added by GOS Data</title>
        <p>There are 3,995 medium and large clusters that contain only sequences from the GOS
          dataset. Some are divergent members of known families that failed to be merged by the
          clustering parameters used, or are too divergent to be detected by any current homology
          detection methods. The remaining clusters are completely novel families. In exploring the
          3,995 GOS-only clusters, 44.9% of them contain sequences that have HMM matches, or BLAST
          matches to sequences in a more recent snapshot of NCBI-nr (downloaded in August 2005) than
          was used in this study. The recent NCBI-nr matches include phage sequences from
          cyanophages (P-SSM2 and P-SSM4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b044">44</xref>]
          and sequences from the SAR-11 genome (<italic>Candidatus pelagibacter ubique</italic>
          HTCC1062) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b045">45</xref>]. We used
          profile–profile searches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b039">39</xref>] to show
          that an additional 12.5% of the GOS-only clusters can be linked to profiles built from
          Protein Data Bank (PDB), COG, or Pfam. The 2,295 clusters with detected homology are
          referred to as Group I clusters. The remaining 1,700 (42.6%) GOS-only clusters with no
          detectable homology to known families are labeled as Group II clusters.</p>
        <p>We applied a guilt-by-association operon method to annotate the GOS-only clusters with a
          strategy that did not rely on direct sequence homology to known families. Function was
          inferred for the GOS-only clusters by examining their same-strand neighbors on the
          assembly (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Similar
          strategies have been successfully used to infer protein function in finished microbial
          genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b048">48</xref>]. Despite minimal assembly of GOS reads, many
          scaffolds and mini-scaffolds contain at least partial fragments of more than one predicted
          ORF, thereby making this approach feasible. For 90 (5.3%) of the Group II clusters, and
          for 214 (9.3%) of the Group I clusters, at least one Gene Ontology (GO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b049">49</xref>] biological process term at
            <italic>p</italic>-value ≤0.05 can be inferred. The inferred functions and neighbors of
          some of these GOS-only clusters are highlighted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t005">Table 5</xref>. We observed that for Group I clusters, the
          neighbor-inferred function is often bolstered by some information from weak homology to
          known sequences. While neighboring clusters as a whole are of diverse function, a number
          of GOS-only clusters seem to be next to clusters implicated in photosynthesis or electron
          transport. These GOS-only clusters could be of viral origin, as cyanophage genomes contain
          and express some photosynthetic genes that appear to be derived from their hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b051">51</xref>]. In support of these observations, we identified five photosynthesis-related
          clusters containing hundreds to thousands of viral sequences, including psbA, psbD, petE,
          SpeD, and hli in the GOS data; furthermore, our nearest-neighbor analysis of these
          sequences reveals the presence of multiple viral proteins (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>Although the majority of GOS-only sequences are bacterial, a higher than expected
          proportion of the GOS-only clusters are predicted to be of viral origin, implying that
          viral sequences and families are poorly explored relative to other microbes. To assign a
          kingdom to the GOS-only clusters, we first inferred the kingdom of neighboring sequences
          based on the taxonomy of the top four BLAST matches to the NCBI-nr database (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). A possible kingdom was assigned
          to the GOS-only cluster if more than 50% of assignable neighboring sequences belong to the
          same kingdom. Viewed in this way, 11.8% of Group I clusters and 17.3% of Group II clusters
          with at least one kingdom-assigned neighbor have more than 50% viral neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Only 3.3% and 3.4% of random
          samples of clusters with size distributions matching that of Group I and Group II clusters

          total of 547 GOS-only clusters contain sequences collected from the viral size fraction
          included in the GOS dataset. For these clusters, 38.9% of the Group I subset and 27.5% of
          the Group II subset with one or more kingdom-assigned neighbors would be inferred as
          viral, based on the conservative criteria of having more than 50% viral assignable
          neighbors. Several alternative kingdom assignment methods were tried (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) and provide for a similar
          conclusion.</p>

              distribution as Group I; II-S, a sample from all clusters chosen to have the same size
              distribution as Group II; I-V, a subset of clusters in Group I containing sequences

              the viral size fraction; and all clusters. Notice that although predominantly
              bacterial, GOS-only clusters are assigned as viral based on their neighbors more often
              than the size-matched samples and the set of all clusters.</p>

        <p>The GOS-only clusters also tend to be more AT-rich than sequences from a random
          size-matched sample of clusters (35.9% ± 8% GC content for Group II clusters versus 49.5%
          ± 11% GC content for sample). Phage genomes with a <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> host
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b044">44</xref>] are also AT rich (37% average
          GC content). Our analysis of the graph constructed based on inferred operon linkages
          between all clusters indicates that the GOS-only clusters may constitute large sets of
          cotranscribed genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>The high proportion of potentially viral novel clusters observed here is reasonable, as
          60%–80% of the ORFs in most finished marine phage genomes are not homologous to known
          protein sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b052">52</xref>]. Viral
          metagenomics projects have reported an equally high fraction of novel ORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b053">53</xref>], and a recent marine metagenomics
          project estimated that up to 21% of photic zone sequences could be of viral origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b051">51</xref>]. It has also been reported that 40%
          of ORFans (sequences that lack similarity to known proteins and predicted proteins) exist
          in close spatial proximity to each other in bacterial genomes, and this combined with
          proximity to integration signals has been used to suggest a viral horizontally transferred
          origin for many bacterial ORFans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b054">54</xref>]. Others have noted a clustering of ORFans in genome islands and suggested they
          derive from a phage-related gene pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b055">55</xref>]. A recent analysis of genome islands from related
            <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> found that phage-like genes and novel genes cohabit
          these dynamic areas of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b056">56</xref>]. In our GOS-only clusters, 37 of the 1,700 clusters with no detectable
          similarity (2.2%) have at least ten bacterial-classified and ten viral-classified
          neighboring ORFs. This is 6.2-fold higher than the rate seen for the size-matched sample
          of all clusters (six clusters, 0.35%). This would seem to add more support to a phage
          origin for at least some ORFans found in bacterial genomes.</p>
        <p>If a sizable portion of the novel families in the GOS data are in fact of viral origin,
          it suggests that we are far from fully exploring the molecular diversity of viruses, a
          conclusion echoed in previous studies of viral metagenomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b058">58</xref>]. In studies of
          bacterial genomes, discovery of new ORFans shows no sign of reaching saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b059">59</xref>]. Coverage of many phage families in
          the GOS data may be low, given that there are inherent differences in the abundance of
          their presumed bacterial hosts. These GOS-only clusters were operationally defined as
          having at least 20 nonredundant sequences. Reducing this threshold to ten nonredundant
          sequences adds 7,241 additional clusters. Whether this vast diversity represents new
          families or is a reflection of the inability to detect distant homology will require
          structural and biochemical studies, as well as continued development of computational
          methods to identify remotely related sequences.</p>

        <title>Comparison of Domain Profiles in GOS and PG Datasets</title>
        <p>We used HMM profiling to address the question of which biochemical and biological
          functions are expanded or contracted in GOS compared to the largely terrestrial genomes in
          PG. Significant differences are seen in 68% of domains (4,722 out of the 6,975 domains
          that match either GOS or PG; <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.001, chi-square test).
          These differences reflect several factors, including differing biochemical needs of
          oceanic life and taxonomic biases in the two datasets. An initial comparison of these
          domain profiles helps shed light on these factors. 91% (964/1,056) of GOS-only domains are
          viral and/or eukaryotic specific (by Pfam annotation). Most of the remaining 92 domains
          are rare (63 domains have less than ten copies in GOS), are predominantly
          eukaryotic/viral, or are specific to narrow bacterial taxa without completed genome
          sequences. Most of the 879 PG-only domains are also rare (444 have ten or less members),
          and/or are restricted to tight lineages, such as <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> (104 matches
          to five domains) or largely extremeophile archaeal-specific domains (1,254 matches to 99
          domains). Highly PG-enriched domains also tend to belong in these categories. Many
          moderately skewed domains reflect the taxonomic skew between PG and GOS. For instance, we
          found that a set of six sarcosine oxidase-related domains are 4.8-fold enriched in GOS
            (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t006">Table 6</xref>). They are mostly found
          in α- and γ-proteobacteria, which are widespread in GOS. Normalizing to the taxonomic
          class level predicts a 1.8-fold enrichment in GOS, indicating that taxonomy alone cannot
          fully explain the prevalence of these proteins in oceanic bacteria.</p>

          Gram-positive–specific domains to be ~2.4-fold enriched in GOS. Instead, the opposite is
          consistently seen. Of 15 firmicute-specific spore-associated domains, PG has 503 members,
          but GOS has none. For another 22 firmicute-restricted domains of varying or unknown
          function, the PG/GOS ratio is 1797:77 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t006">Table 6</xref>). Hence, it appears that GOS Gram-positive lineages lack most of their

        <title>Characteristics and Kingdom Distribution of Known Protein Domains</title>
        <p>A decade ago, databases were highly biased towards proteins of known function. Today,
          whole-genome sequencing and structural genomics efforts have presumably reduced the biases
          that are a result of targeted protein sequencing. We used the Pfam database to compare the
          characteristics and kingdom distribution of known protein domains in the GOS dataset to
          that of proteins in the publicly available datasets (NCBI-nr, PG, TGI-EST, and ENS). Such
          an effort can be used to assess biases in these datasets, help direct future sampling
          efforts (of underrepresented organisms, proteins, and protein families), make more
          informed generalizations about the protein universe, and provide important context for
          determination of protein evolutionary relationships (as biased sampling could indicate
          expected but missing sequences).</p>
        <p>For this analysis we used the nonredundant datasets (at 100% identity) discussed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g001">Figure 1</xref>. We refer to the set of 3,167,979
          nonredundant sequences from NCBI-nr, PG, TGI-EST, and ENS as the public-100 set and the
          similarly filtered set of 5,654,638 sequences from the GOS data as the GOS-100
            set<italic>.</italic></p>
        <p>About 70% of public-100 sequences and 56% of GOS-100 sequences significantly match at
          least one Pfam model. The most obvious difference between the sets is that the vast
          majority of GOS sequences are bacterial, and this has to be taken into account when
          comparing the numbers. Since different Pfam families appear with different frequencies in
          the kingdoms, we considered the results for each kingdom separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We then evaluated all kingdoms together, with
          results normalized by relative abundance of members from the different kingdoms. A domain
          found commonly and exclusively in eukaryotes and abundant in public-100 would be expected
          to be found rarely in GOS-100. We used a conservative BLAST-based kingdom assignment
          method to assign kingdoms to the GOS sequences (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>

            <p>The public-100 sequences are annotated using the NCBI taxonomy and the source public

              fraction of sequences with ≥1 Pfam match are shown, while the ten largest Pfam

              are smaller than the ten largest are binned together in each column's bottom section.
              Pfam covers public-100 better than GOS-100 in all kingdoms, with the greatest
              difference occurring in the viral kingdom, where 89.1% of public-100 viral sequences
              match a Pfam domain, while only 27.5% of GOS-100s have a sequence match.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>In each kingdom, sequences in GOS-100 are less likely to match a Pfam family than those
          in public-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g005">Figure 5</xref>). For the
          cellular kingdoms, these differences are comparatively modest. While diversity of the GOS
          data accounts for some of this difference, it might also be explained in part by the
          fragmentary nature of the GOS sequences. Viruses tell a dramatic and different story. Of
          public-100 viral sequences, 89.1% match a Pfam domain, while only 27.5% of GOS-100 viral
          sequences have a match. This tremendous difference appears to be due to heavy enrichment
          of the public data for minor variants of a few protein families, indicated by the sizes of
          the ten most populous Pfams in each kingdom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Sequences from three Pfam families (envelope glycoprotein GP120,
          reverse transcriptase, and retroviral aspartyl protease) account for a third of all public
          viral sequences. By contrast, the most populous three families in the GOS-100 data
          (bacteriophage T4-like capsid assembly protein [Gp20], major capsid protein Gp23, and
          phage tail sheath protein) account for only about 7% of public-100 sequences. Such a
          difference may be due to intentional oversampling of proteins that come from
          disease-causing organisms in the public dataset.</p>
        <p>While the total proportion of proteins with a Pfam hit is fairly similar between
          public-100 (70%) and GOS-100 (56%) datasets, there are considerable differences with
          regard to the distributions of protein families within these two datasets. The most highly
          represented Pfam families in GOS-100 compared to public-100 are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t007">Table 7</xref>. Notably, we found that while
          many known viral families are absent in GOS-100, viral protein families dominate the list
          of the families more highly represented in GOS-100; this is presumably because of biases
          in the collection of previously known viral sequences. Surprisingly few bacterial families
          were among the most represented in GOS-100 compared with public-100. By contrast, we also
          observed that those families found more rarely in GOS-100 than public-100 were frequently
          bacterial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t007">Table 7</xref>). This appears to
          be a result of the large number of key bacterial and viral pathogen proteins in public-100
          that are comparatively less abundant in the oceanic samples and/or less intensively
          sampled.</p>

Numbers of observed matches to these Pfams in public-100 are also indicated according to kingdom. A number of Pfams highly represented in GOS-100 appear to occur exclusively or almost exclusively in a particular kingdom in public-100.

        <title>GOS-100 Data Suggest That a Number of “Kingdom-Specific” Pfams Actually Are
          Represented in Multiple Kingdoms</title>
        <p>Of the 7,868 Pfam models in Pfam 17.0, 4,050 match proteins from only a single kingdom in
          public-100. The additional sequences from GOS-100 reveal that some of these families
          actually have representatives in multiple kingdoms. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t008">Table 8</xref> shows 12 families that have a Pfam match to at
          least one GOS-100 protein with an <italic>E-</italic>value ≤ 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, and
          which we confidently assigned to a kingdom different from that of all the public-100
          matches. Because our criteria for a “confident” kingdom assignment are conservative, there
          are only one or a few confident assignments for each Pfam domain to a “new” kingdom. Our
          “confident” criteria are especially difficult to meet in the case of kingdom-crossing, due
          to the votes contributed by the crossing protein (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Thus, many scaffolds have no confident kingdom
          assignment. Our examination of each of the scaffolds responsible for a determination of
          kingdom-crossing confirms that each one had both a highly significant match to the Pfam
          model in question and an overwhelming number of votes for the unexpected kingdom. These
          scaffold assemblies were also manually inspected. No clear anomalies were observed. In
          most instances, the assemblies in question were composed of a single unitig, and as such
          are high-confidence assemblies. Mate pair coverage and consistent depth of coverage
          provide further support for the correctness of those assemblies that are built from
          multiple unitigs. Examples of kingdom-crossing families include indoleamine
          2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), MAM domain, and MYND finger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b015">15</xref>], which have previously only been seen in eukaryotes,
          but we find them also to be present in bacteria. These Pfams now cross kingdoms, due
          either to their being more ancient than previously realized or to lateral transfer.</p>

        <p>We explored the IDO family further. This family has representatives in vertebrates,
          invertebrates, and multiple fungal lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b061">61</xref>] in public-100.
          Members of the IDO family are heme-binding, and mammalian IDOs catalyze the rate-limiting
          step in the catabolic breakdown of tryptophan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b062">62</xref>], while family members in mollusks have a myoglobin
          function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b063">63</xref>]. In mammals, IDO also
          appears to have a role in the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b064">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b066">66</xref>]. The IDO Pfam has matches to 66 proteins in
          public-100, all of which are eukaryotic. However, it also has matches to ten GOS-100
          sequences that we confidently labeled as bacterial proteins and matches to 206 GOS-100
          sequences for which a confident kingdom assignment could not be made (many of these are
          likely bacterial sequences due to the GOS sampling bias). To reconstruct a phylogeny of
          the IDO family, we searched a recent version of NCBI-nr (March 5, 2006) for IDO proteins
          that were not included in the public-100 dataset. The search identified two bacterial
          proteins from the whole genomes of the marine bacteria <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Erythrobacter litoralis</named-content>
          and <italic>Nitrosococcus oceani,</italic> and 24 eukaryotic proteins (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The phylogeny shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows 54% bootstrap support for a
          separation of the clade containing exclusively public-100 and NCBI-nr 2006 eukaryotic
          sequences from a clade with the GOS-100 sequences as well as the two NCBI-nr
            <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E.
            litoralis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">N. oceani</named-content> sequences. We confirmed this feature of
          the tree topology with multiple other phylogeny reconstruction methods. Curiously, there
          is considerable intermixing of bacterial and eukaryotic sequences in the clade of GOS-100
          sequences and the two NCBI-nr bacteria. A manual inspection of the scaffolds that contain
          the ten GOS-100 sequences (containing the IDO domain) that we confidently labeled as
          bacterial, overwhelmingly supports the kingdom assignment. However, a manual inspection of
          the scaffolds that contain the ten GOS-100 sequences (containing the IDO domain) that we
          confidently labeled as eukaryotes presents a less convincing picture. These scaffolds are
          short, with most of them containing only two voting ORFs. Since the NCBI-nr version used
          in the public-100 set has IDO from eukaryotes only, the ORF with the IDO domain itself
          would cast four votes for eukaryotes. Thus, these GOS-100 eukaryotic labelings are not
          nearly as confident as the ones labeled bacterial.</p>

        <title>Structural Genomics Implications</title>
        <p>Knowledge about global protein distributions can be used to inform priorities in related
          fields such as structural genomics. Structural genomics is an international effort to
          determine the 3-D shapes of all important biological macromolecules, with a primary focus
          on proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b072">72</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that an efficient
          strategy for covering the protein structure universe is to choose protein targets for
          experimental structure characterization from among the largest families with unknown
          structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b074">74</xref>]. If the structure of one family member is determined,
          it may be used to accurately infer the fold of other family members, even if the sequence
          similarity between family members is too low to enable accurate structural modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b075">75</xref>]. Therefore, large families are a
          focus of the production phase of the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI), the National
          Institutes of Health–funded structural genomics project that commenced in October 2005
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b076">76</xref>].</p>
        <p>In March 2005, 2,729 (36%) of 7,677 Pfam families had at least one member of known
          structure; these families could be used to infer folds for approximately 51% of all
          pre-GOS prokaryotic proteins (covering 44% of residues) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b074">74</xref>]. The Pfam5000 strategy is to solve one structure from
          each of the largest remaining families, until a total of 5,000 families have at least one
          member with known structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b073">73</xref>]. As
          this strategy is similar to that being used at PSI centers to choose targets, projections
          based on the Pfam5000 should reflect PSI results. Completion of the Pfam5000, a tractable
          goal within the production phase of PSI, would enable accurate fold assignment for
          approximately 65% of all pre-GOS prokaryotic proteins. In the GOS-100 dataset, we observed
          that 46% of the proteins might currently be assigned a fold based on Pfam families of
          known structure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).
          Completion of the Pfam5000 would increase this coverage to 55%.</p>
        <p>The GOS sequences will affect Pfam in two ways: some will be classified in existing
          protein families, thus increasing the size of these families; others may eventually be
          classified into new GOS-specific families. Both of these will alter the relative sizes of
          different families, and thus their prioritization for structural genomics studies. We
          calculated the sizes for all Pfam families based on the number of occurrences of each
          family in the public-100 dataset. Proteins in GOS-100 were then added and the family sizes
          were recalculated. A total of 190 families that are not in the Pfam5000 based on
          public-100 are moved into the Pfam5000 after addition of the GOS data. The 30 largest such
          families are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t009">Table 9</xref>. As 20
          of the 30 families are annotated as domains of unknown function in Pfam, structural
          characterization might be helpful in identifying their cellular or molecular functions.
          Reshuffling the Pfam5000 to prioritize these 190 families would improve structural
          coverage of GOS sequences after completion of the Pfam5000 by almost 1% relative to the
          original Pfam5000 (from 55.4% to 56.1%), with only a small decrease in coverage of
          public-100 sequences (from 67.7% to 67.5%).</p>

        <title>Known Protein Families and Increased Diversity Due to GOS Data</title>
        <p>Several protein families serve as examples to further highlight the diversity added by
          the GOS dataset. In this paper, we examined UV irradiation DNA damage repair enzymes,
          phosphatases, proteases, and the metabolic enzymes glutamine synthetase and RuBisCO (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t010">Table 10</xref>). The RecA family (unpublished

          also been explored in the context of the GOS data. There are more than 5,000 RecA and
          RecA-like sequences in the GOS dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t010">Table 10</xref>). An analysis of the RecA phylogeny including the GOS data reveals
          several completely new RecA subfamilies. A detailed study of kinases in the GOS dataset
          demonstrated the power of additional sequence diversity in defining and exploring protein
          families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b077">77</xref>]. The discovery of
          16,248 GOS protein kinase–like enzymes enabled the definition and analysis of 20 distinct
          kinase-like families. The diverse sequences allowed the definition of key residues for
          each family, revealing novel core motifs within the entire superfamily, and predicted
          structural adaptations in individual families. This data enabled the fusion of choline and
          aminoglycoside kinases into a single family, whose sequence diversity is now seen to be at
          least as great as the eukaryotic protein kinases themselves.</p>

        <title>Proteins Involved in the Repair of UV-Induced DNA Damage</title>
        <p>Much of the attention in studies of the microbes in the world's oceans has justifiably
          focused on phototrophy, such as that carried out by the proteorhodopsin proteins.
          Previously, in the Sargasso Sea study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b010">10</xref>] it was shown that shotgun sequencing reveals a much greater diversity of
          proteorhodopsin-like proteins than was previously known from cloning and PCR studies.
          However, along with the potential benefits of phototrophy come many risks, such as the
          damage caused to cells by exposure to solar irradiation, especially the UV wavelengths.
          Organisms deal with the potential damage from UV irradiation in several ways, including
          protection (e.g., UV absorption), tolerance, and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b078">78</xref>]. Our examination of the protein family clusters
          reveals that the GOS data provides an order of magnitude increase in the diversity (in
          both numbers and types) of homologs of proteins known to be involved in pathways
          specifically for repairing UV damage.</p>
        <p>One aspect of the diversity of UV repair genes is seen in the overrepresentation of
          photolyase homologs in the GOS data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t010">Table 10</xref>). Photolyases are enzymes that chemically reverse the UV-generated
          inappropriate covalent bonds in cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6–4 photoproducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b079">79</xref>]. The massive numbers of homologs of
          these proteins in the GOS data (11,569 GOS proteins in four clusters; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t010">Table 10</xref>) is likely a reflection of
          their presence in diverse species and the existence of novel functions in this family. New
          repair functions could include repair of other forms of UV dimers (e.g., involving altered
          bases), use of novel wavelengths of light to provide the energy for repair, repair of RNA,
          or repair in different sequence contexts. In addition, some of these proteins may be
          involved in regulating circadian rhythms, as seen for photolyase homologs in various
          species. Our findings are consistent with the recent results of a comparative metagenomic
          survey of microbes from different depths that found an overabundance of photolyase-like
          proteins at the surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b051">51</xref>].</p>
        <p>A good deal was known about the functions and diversity of photolyases prior to this
          project. However, much less is known about other UV damage–specific repair enzymes, and
          examination of the GOS data reveals a remarkable diversity of each of these. For example,
          prior to this project, there were only some 25 homologs of UV dimer endonucleases (UVDEs)
          available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b080">80</xref>], and most of these
          were from the <italic>Bacillus</italic> species. There are 420 homologs of UVDE (cluster
          6239) in the GOS data representing many new subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and
            Methods</xref>). A similar pattern is seen for spore lyases (which repair a UV lesion
          specific to spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b081">81</xref>]) and the
          pyrimidine dimer endonuclease (DenV, which was originally identified in T4 phage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b082">82</xref>]). We believe this will also be true
          for UV dimer glycosylases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b083">83</xref>], but
          predictions of function for homologs of these genes are difficult since they are in a
          large superfamily of glycosylases.</p>

        <p>Our analysis of the kingdom classification assignments suggests that the diversity of
          UV-specific repair pathways is seen for all types of organisms in the GOS samples. This
          apparently extends even to the viral world (e.g., 51 of the UVDE homologs are assigned
          putatively to viruses), suggesting that UV damage repair may be a critical function that
          phages provide for themselves and their hosts in ocean surface environments. Based on the
          sheer numbers of genes, their sequence diversity, and the diversity of types of organisms
          in which they are apparently found, we conclude that many novel UV damage–repair processes
          remain to be discovered in organisms from the ocean surface water.</p>

        <title>Evidence of Reversible Phosphorylation in the Oceans</title>
        <p>Reversible phosphorylation of proteins represents a major mechanism for cellular
          processes, including signal transduction, development, and cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b084">84</xref>]. The activity of protein kinases and
          phosphatases serve as antagonistic regulators of the cellular response. Protein
          phosphatases are divided into three major groups based on substrate specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b085">85</xref>]. The Mg<sup>2+</sup>- or
            Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphoserine/phosphothreonine protein phosphatase family,
          exemplified by the human protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), represents the smallest group in
          number. An understanding of their physiological roles has only recently begun to emerge.
          In eukaryotes, one of the major roles of PP2C activity is to reverse stress-induced kinase
          cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b086">86</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b089">89</xref>].</p>
        <p>We identified 613 PP2C-like sequences in the GOS dataset, and they are grouped into two
          clusters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t010">Table 10</xref>). These sequences
          contain at least seven motifs known to be important for phosphatase structure and function
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b090">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b091">91</xref>]. Invariant residues involved in metal binding
          (aspartate in motifs I, II, VIII) and phosphate ion binding (arginine in motif I) are
          highly conserved among the GOS sequences.</p>
        <p>Using the catalytic domain portion of these sequences we constructed a phylogeny showing
          that despite the overall conserved structure of the PP2C family of proteins, the known
          bacterial PP2C-like sequences group together with the GOS bacterial PP2C-like sequences
            (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g007">Figure 7</xref>B, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Furthermore, the eukaryotic PP2Cs display a much
          greater degree of sequence divergence compared to the bacterial PP2C sequences.</p>
        <p>We also examined the combined dataset of PP2C-like phosphatases further for potential
          differences in amino acid composition between the bacterial and eukaryotic groups. We
          observed a striking distinction between the eukaryotic and bacterial PP2C-like
          phosphatases in motif II, where a histidine residue (His62 in human PP2Ca) is conserved in
          more than 90% of sequences, but not observed in the bacterial group. The bacterial PP2C
          group contains a methionine (at the corresponding position) in the majority of the cases
          (70%). This histidine residue is involved in the formation of a beta hairpin in the
          crystal structure of human PP2C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b091">91</xref>].
          Furthermore, His62 is proposed to act as a general acid for PP2C catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b092">92</xref>]. Both amino acids lie in the
          proximity of the phosphate-binding domain, but at this time it is unclear how the
          difference at this position would contribute to the overall structure and function of the
          two PP2C groups. Nonetheless, the large number of diverse PP2C-like phosphatases in this
          dataset allowed us to identify a previously unrecognized key difference between bacterial
          and eukaryotic PP2Cs.</p>
        <p>Bacterial genes that perform closely related functions can be organized in close
          proximity to each other and often in functional units. Linked Ser/Thr kinase-phosphatase
          genetic units have been described in several bacterial species, including
            <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis,</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium
            tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b093">93</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b096">96</xref>]. Two major neighboring clusters are
          found to be associated with the set of PP2C-like phosphatases in the GOS bacterial group.
          We observed that one of these clusters contained a protein serine/threonine kinase domain
          as its most common Pfam domain. An additional neighboring cluster found to be associated
          with the GOS set of bacterial PP2Cs was identified as a set of sequences containing a
          PASTA (penicillin-binding protein and serine/threonine kinase–associated) domain. This
          domain is unique to bacterial species, and is believed to play important roles in
          regulating cell wall biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b097">97</xref>].</p>
        <p>Our identification of a conserved group of unique PP2C-like phosphatases in the GOS
          dataset significantly increases the number and diversity of this enzyme family. This
          analysis of the NCBI-nr, PG ORFs, TGI-EST ORFs, and ENS datasets along with the sequences
          obtained from the GOS dataset significantly increases the overall number of PP2C-like
          sequences from that estimated just a year ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b098">98</xref>]. The presence of genes encoding bacterial
          serine/threonine kinase domains located adjacent to PP2Cs in the GOS data supports the
          notion that the process of reversible phosphorylation on Ser/Thr residues controls
          important physiological processes in bacteria.</p>

      <sec id="s2q">
        <title>Proteases in GOS Data</title>
        <p>Proteases are a group of enzymes that degrades other proteins and, as such, plays
          important roles in all organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b099">99</xref>]. On the basis of their catalysis mechanism, proteases are divided into six
          distinct catalytic types: aspartic, cysteine, metallo, serine, threonine, and glutamic
          proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b099">99</xref>]. They differ from each
          other by the presence of specific amino acids in the active site and by their mode of
          action. The MEROPS database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b100">100</xref>] is
          a comprehensive source of information for this large divergent group of sequences and
          provides a widely accepted classification of proteases into families, based on the amino
          acid sequence comparison, and then into clans based on the similarity of their 3-D
          structures.</p>
        <p>We identified 222,738 potential proteases in the GOS dataset based on similarity to
          sequences in MEROPS (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).
          According to our clustering method, 95% of these sequences are grouped into 190 clusters,
          with each cluster on the average containing more than 1,100 GOS sequences. These sequences
          were compared to proteases in NCBI-nr. There are groups of proteases in NCBI-nr that are
          highly redundant. For example, there are a large number of viral proteases from HIV-1 and
          hepatitis C viruses that dominate the NCBI-nr protease set. Thus, we computed a
          nonredundant set of NCBI-nr proteases and, for the sake of consistency, a nonredundant set
          of proteases from the GOS set using the same parameters. The majority of proteases in both
          sets are dominated by cysteine, metallo, and serine proteases. The GOS dataset is
          dominated by proteases belonging to the bacterial kingdom. That is not surprising, given
          the filter sizes used to collect the samples. In NCBI-nr the proteases are more evenly
          distributed between the bacterial and the eukaryotic kingdoms.</p>
        <p>Our comparison of the protease clan distribution of the bacterial sequences in the
          NCBI-nr and GOS sets reveals that the distribution of clans is very similar for metallo-
          and serine proteases. However, the distribution of clans in aspartic and cysteine
          proteases is different in the two datasets. Among aspartic proteases, the most visible
          difference is the increased ratio of proteases of the AC clan and the decreased ratio in
          the AD clan. Proteases in the former clan are involved in bacterial cell wall production,
          while those in the latter clan are involved in pilin maturation and toxin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b099">99</xref>]. Among cysteine proteases, the most
          apparent is the decrease in the CA clan and an increase in the number of proteases from
          the PB(C) clan. Bacterial members of the CA clan are mostly involved in degradation of
          bacterial cell wall components and in various aspects of biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b099">99</xref>]. It is possible that both activities
          are less important for marine bacteria present in surface water. Proteases from the PB(C)
          clan are involved in activation (including self-activation) of enzymes from
          acetyltransferase family. In fungi this family is involved in penicillin synthesis, while
          their function in bacteria is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b099">99</xref>].</p>
        <p>We were unable to detect any caspases (members of the CD clan) in the GOS data. This is
          consistent with the apoptotic cell death mechanism being present only in multicellular
          eukaryotes, which, based on the filter sizes, are expected to be very rare in the GOS
          dataset.</p>

          carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), two key enzymes in nitrogen and carbon metabolism.</p>
        <p>GS is the central player of nitrogen metabolism in all organisms on earth. It is one of
          the oldest enzymes in evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b101">101</xref>]. It converts ammonia and glutamate into glutamine that can be utilized by
          cells. GS can be classified into three types based on sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b101">101</xref>]. Type I has been found only in bacteria, and it
          forms a dodecameric structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b103">103</xref>]. Type II has been
          found mainly in eukaryotes, and in some bacteria. Type III GS is less well studied, but
          has been found in some anaerobic bacteria and cyanobacteria. There are 18 active site
          residues in both bacterial and eukaryotic GS that play important roles in binding
          substrates and catalyzing the enzymatic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b104">104</xref>].</p>
        <p>We found 9,120 GS and GS-like sequences in the GOS data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t010">Table 10</xref>). Using profile HMMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b105">105</xref>] constructed from known GS sequences of different types, we were able to
          classify 4,350 sequences as type I GS, 1,021 sequences as type II GS, and 469 sequences as
          type III GS (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>The number of type II GS sequences found in the GOS data is surprisingly high, since
          previously type II GS were considered to be mainly eukaryotic and very few eukaryotic
          organisms were expected to be included in the GOS sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and
            Methods</xref>). We used gene neighbor analysis to classify the origin of GS genes by
          the nature of other proteins found on the same scaffold. Using this approach, most of the
          neighboring genes of the type II GS in the GOS data are identified as bacterial genes. The
          neighboring genes of the type II GS include nitrogen regulatory protein PII, signal
          transduction histidine kinase, NH<sub>3</sub>-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> synthetase,
          A/G-specific adenine glycosylase, coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein c, pyridoxine
          biosynthesis enzyme, aerobic-type carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, etc. We were able to
          assign more than 90% of the type II GS sequences in the GOS data to bacterial scaffolds
          based on a BLAST-based kingdom assignment method (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Both neighboring genes and kingdom assignments suggest
          that most of the type II GS sequences in the GOS data come from bacterial organisms. In
          comparison, the same type II GS profile HMM detects only 12 putative type II GS sequences
          from the PG dataset of 222 prokaryotic genomes. Within these, there are only seven unique
          type II GS sequences and six unique bacterial species represented. The reason why bacteria
          in the ocean have so many type II GS genes is unclear.</p>
        <p>Two hypotheses have been raised to explain the origin of type II GS in bacterial genomes:
          lateral gene transfer from eukaryotic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b106">106</xref>] and gene duplication prior to the divergence of
          prokaryotes and eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b101">101</xref>]. The
          type II GS sequences in the predominantly bacterial GOS data are not only abundant, but
          also diverse and divergent from most of known eukaryotic GS sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g007">Figure 7</xref>C). This makes the hypothesis of
          lateral gene transfer less favorable. If the GS gene duplication preceded the
          prokaryote–eukaryote divergence according to the gene duplication hypothesis, it is
          possible that many oceanic organisms retained type II GS genes during evolution.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, we found 19 cases where a type I GS gene is adjacent to a type II GS gene
          on the same scaffold. Both GS genes seem to be functional based on the high degree of
          conservation of active site residues. The same gene arrangement was observed previously in
            <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Frankia
            alni</named-content> CpI1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b107">107</xref>].
          The functional significance of maintaining two types of GS genes adjacent to one another
          in the genome remains to be elucidated. Most of the sequences of these GS genes are highly
          similar. We examined the geographic distribution of these adjacent GS sequences across all
          the GOS samples. They are mainly found in the samples taken from two sites. Their
          geographic distribution is significantly different from the distributions of types I and
          II GS across the samples. The high sequence similarity among the adjacent GS pairs and
          their geographic distribution suggest that these adjacent GS sequences may come from only
          a few closely related organisms. This is consistent with the protein sequence tree of type
          II GS, where the type II GS sequences from the GS gene pairs mainly reside in two distinct
          branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g007">Figure 7</xref>C).</p>
        <p>The active site residues are very well conserved in all GS sequences in the GOS data,
          except one residue, Y179, which coordinates the ammonium-binding pocket. We observed
          substitutions of Y179 to phenylalanine in about half of the type II GS sequences. The
          activity of type I GS in some bacteria is regulated by adenylylation at residue Tyr397. In
          the GOS data, Tyr397 is relatively conserved in type I GS, with variations to
          phenylalanine and tryptophan in about half of the sequences. This indicates that the
          activity of some of the type I GS is not regulated by adenylylation, as shown previously
          in some Gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b108">108</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b109">109</xref>].</p>
        <p>RuBisCO is the key enzyme in carbon fixation. It is the most abundant enzyme on earth
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b110">110</xref>] and plays an important role
          in carbon metabolism and CO<sub>2</sub> cycle. RuBisCO can be classified into four forms.
          Form I has been found in both plants and bacteria, and has an octameric structure. Form II
          has been found in many bacteria, and it forms a dimer in <italic>Rhodospirillum
            rubrum.</italic> Form III is mainly found in archaea, and forms various oligomers. Form
          IV, also called the RuBisCO-like protein (RLP), has been recently discovered from
          bacterial genome-sequencing projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b111">111</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b112">112</xref>]. RLP represents a
          group of proteins that do not have RuBisCO activity, but resemble RuBisCO in both sequence
          and structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b111">111</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b113">113</xref>]. The functions of RLPs are largely
          unknown and seem to differ from each other.</p>
        <p>Contrary to the large number of GS sequences, we identified only 428 sequences homologous
          to the RuBisCO large subunit in the GOS data. The small number of RuBisCO sequences may
          partly be due to the fact that larger-sized bacterial organisms were not included in the
          sequencing because of size filtering. However, it could also indicate that CO<sub>2</sub>
          is not the major carbon source for these sequenced ocean organisms.</p>
        <p>The RuBisCO homologs in the GOS data are more diverse than the currently known RuBisCOs
            (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g007">Figure 7</xref>D, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Six of 19 active site residues—N123, K177, D198,
          F199, H327, and G404—are not well conserved in all sequences, suggesting that the proteins
          with these mutations may have evolved to have new functions, such as in the case of RLPs.
          From the studies of the RLPs from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Chlorobium tepidum</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b111">111</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b114">114</xref>], it has been shown that the active site of RuBisCO
          can accommodate different substrates and is potentially capable of evolving new catalytic
          functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b114">114</xref>]. On the other hand, two sequence motifs, helices αB
          and α8, that are not involved in substrate binding and catalytic activity are well
          conserved in the GOS RuBisCO sequences. The higher degree of conservation of these
          nonactive site residues than that of active site residues suggests that these motifs are
          important for their structure, function, or interaction with other proteins.</p>
        <p>We found 47 (31 at 90% identity filtering) GOS sequences in the branch with known RLP
          sequences in a phylogenetic tree of RuBisCO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). In this phylogenetic tree, in addition to the clades for each of the
          four forms of RuBisCO, there are also new groups of 65 (58 at 90% identity filtering) GOS
          sequences that do not cluster with any known RuBisCO sequences. This indicates that there
          could be more than one type of RuBisCO-like protein existing in organisms. The novel
          groups of RuBisCO homologs in the GOS data also suggest that we have not fully explored
          the entire RuBisCO family of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g007">Figure
            7</xref>D).</p>

        <title>GOS Data and Remote Homology Detection</title>
        <p>The addition of GOS sequences may help greatly in defining the range and diversity of
          many known protein families, both by addition of many new sequences and by the increased
          diversity of GOS sequences. Our comparison of HMM scores for GOS sequences with those from
          the other four datasets shows that GOS sequences consistently tend to have lower scores,
          which indicates additional diversity from that captured in the original HMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The addition of GOS data into
          domain profiles may broaden the profile and allow it to detect additional remote family
          members in both GOS and other datasets. As a trial, we rebuilt the Pfam model PF01396,
          which describes a zinc finger domain within bacterial DNA topoisomerase. The original
          model finds 821 matches to 481 proteins in NCBI-nr. Our model that includes GOS sequences
          reveals 1,497 matches to 722 sequences, an increase of 50% in sequences and 82% in domains
          (most topoisomerases have three such domains, of which one is divergent and difficult to
          detect). Of these new matches, 104 are validated by the presence of additional
          topoisomerase domains, or they are annotated as topoisomerase, while most others are
          unannotated or similar to other DNA-modifying enzymes not previously thought to have zinc
          finger domains.</p>

        <p>HMM profiles can be further exploited by using matches beyond the conservative trusted
          cutoff (TC) used in this study. For instance, the Pfam for the poxvirus A22 protein family
          has no GOS matches above the TC, but 137 matches with <italic>E-</italic>values of 1 ×
            10<sup>−3</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, containing a short conserved motif overlap with
          A22 proteins. Alignment of these matches shows an additional two short motifs in common
          with A22, establishing their homology, and using a profile HMM, we found a total of 269
          family members in GOS and eight family members in NCBI-nr. Many members of this new family
          are surrounded by other novel clusters, or are in putative viral scaffolds, suggesting
          that these weak matches are an entry point into a new clade of viruses.</p>

        <title>ORFans with Matches in GOS Data</title>
        <p>Further evidence of the diversity added by GOS sequences is provided by their matches to
          ORFans. ORFans are sequences in current protein databases that do not have any
          recognizable homologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b117">117</xref>]. ORFan
          sequences (discounting those that may be spurious gene predictions) represent genes with
          organism-specific functions or very remote homologs of known families. They have the
          potential to shed light on how new proteins emerge and how old ones diversify.</p>
        <p>We identified 84,911 ORFans (5,538 archaea, 35,292 bacteria, 37,427 eukaryotic, 5,314
          virus, and 1,340 unclassified) from the NCBI-nr dataset using CD-HIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b116">116</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b117">117</xref>] and BLAST (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Of these, 6,044 have matches to GOS sequences using

          bacterial, archaeal, eukaryotic, and viral ORFans, respectively. While most of these
          ORFans have very few GOS matches, 626 of them have ≥20 GOS matches. The similarities

          sequences and noneukaryotic ORFans. The average sequence identity between eukaryotic

        <p>GOS sequences can play an important role in identifying the functions of existing ORFans
          or in confirming protein predictions. For example, we found that the hypothetical protein
          AF1548, which is a PDB ORFan, has matches to 16 GOS sequences. A PSI-BLAST search with
          AF1548 as the query against a combined set of GOS and NCBI-nr identified several
          significant restriction endonucleases after three iterations. With the support of 3-D
          structure and multiple sequence alignment of AF1548 and its GOS matches, we predict that
          AF1548 along with its GOS homologs are restriction endonucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g010">Figure 10</xref>). When combined with an established consensus
          of active sites of the related endonucleases families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b118">118</xref>], we predicted three catalytic residues.</p>

        <p>With respect to protein exploration and novel family discovery, microbial sequencing
          offers more promise compared to sequencing more mammalian genomes. This is illustrated by
            <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g011">Figure 11</xref><bold>,</bold> where the
          number of clusters that protein predictions from various finished mammalian genomes fall
          into was compared to the number of clusters that similar-sized random subsets of microbial
          sequences fall into (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). As
          the figure shows, the rate of protein family discovery is higher for microbes than for
          mammals. Indeed, the rate of new family discovery is plateauing for mammalian sequences.
          This is not surprising, as mammalian divergence from a common ancestor is much more recent
          than microbial divergence from a common ancestor, which suggests that mammals will share a
          larger core set of less-diverged proteins. Microbial sequencing is also more cost
          effective than mammalian sequencing for acquiring protein sequences because microbial
          protein density is typically 80%–90% versus 1%–2% for mammals. This could be addressed
          with mammalian mRNA sequencing, but issues with acquiring rarely expressed mRNAs would
          need to be considered. There are, of course, other reasons to sequence mammalian genomes,
          such as understanding mammalian evolution and mammalian gene regulation.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>The rate of protein family discovery is approximately linear in the (current) number of
          protein sequences. Additional sequencing, especially of microbial environments, is
          expected to reveal many more protein families and subfamilies. The potential for
          discovering new protein families is also supported by the GOS diversity seen at the
          nucleotide level across the different sampling sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b030">30</xref>]. Averaged over the sites, 14% of the GOS sequence
          reads from a site are unique (at 70% nucleotide identity) to that site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b030">30</xref>].</p>
        <p>The GOS data provides almost complete coverage of known prokaryotic protein families. In
          addition, it adds a great deal of diversity to many known families and offers new insights
          into the evolution of these families. This is illustrated using several protein families,
          including UV damage–repair enzymes, phosphatases, proteases, glutamine synthetase,
          RuBisCO, RecA (unpublished data), and kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b077">77</xref>]. Only a handful of protein families have been
          examined thus far, and many thousands more remain to be explored.</p>
        <p>The protein analysis presented indicates that we are far from exploring the diversity of
          viruses. This is reflected in several of the analyses. The GOS-only clusters show an
          overrepresentation of sequences of viral origin. In addition, our domain analysis using
          HMM profiling shows a lower Pfam coverage of the GOS sequences in the viral kingdom
          compared to the other kingdoms. At least two of the protein families we explored in detail
          (UV repair enzymes and glutamine synthetase) contain abundant new viral additions. The
          extraordinary diversity of viruses in a variety of environmental settings is only now
          beginning to be understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b119">119</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b121">121</xref>]. A separate analysis of GOS microbial and viral
          sequences (unpublished data) shows that multiple viral protein clusters contain
          significant numbers of host-derived proteins, suggesting that viral acquisition of host
          genes is quite widespread in the oceans.</p>
        <p>Data generated by this GOS study and similar environmental shotgun sequencing studies
          present their own analysis challenges. Methods for various analyses (e.g., sequence
          alignment, profile construction, phylogeny inference, etc.) are generally designed and
          optimized to work with full sequences. They have to be tailored to analyze the mostly
          fragmentary sequences that are generated by these projects. Nevertheless, these data are a
          valuable source of new discoveries. These data have the potential to refine old hypotheses
          and make new observations about proteins and their evolution. Our preliminary exploration
          of the GOS data identified novel protein families and also showed that many ORFan
          sequences from current databases have homologs in these data. The diversity added by GOS
          data to protein families also allows for the building of better profile models and thereby
          improves remote homology detection. The discovery of kingdom-crossing protein families
          that were previously thought to be kingdom-specific presents evidence that the GOS project
          has excavated proteins of more ancient lineage than that previously known, or that have
          undergone lateral gene transfer. This is another example of how metagenomics studies are
          changing our understanding of protein sequences, their evolution, and their distribution
          across the various forms of life and environments. Biases in the currently published
          databases due to oversampling of some proteins or organisms are illuminated by
          environmental surveys that lack such biases. Such knowledge can help us make better
          predictions of the real distribution patterns of proteins in the natural world and
          indicate where increased sampling would be likely to uncover new families or family
          members of tremendous diversity (such as in the viral kingdom).</p>
        <p>These data have other significant implications for the fields of protein evolution and
          protein structure prediction. Having several hundreds or even tens of thousands of diverse
          proteins from a family or examples of a specific protein fold should provide new
          approaches for developing protein structure prediction models. Development of algorithms
          that consider the alignments of all these family members/protein folds and analyze how
          amino acid sequence can vary without significantly altering the tertiary structure or
          function may provide insights that can be used to develop new ab inito methods for
          predicting protein structures. These same datasets could also be used to begin to
          understand how a protein evolves a new function. Finally, this large database of amino
          acid sequence data could help to better understand and predict the molecular interactions
          between proteins. For example, they may be used to predict the protein–protein
          interactions so critical for the formation of specific functional complexes within
          cells.</p>
        <p>The GOS data also have implications for nearly all computational methods relying on
          sequence data. The increase in the number of known protein sequences presents challenges
          to many algorithms due to the increased volume of sequences. In most cases this increase
          in sequence data can be compensated for with additional CPU cycles, but it is also a
          foreshadowing of times to come as the pace of large-scale sequence-collecting accelerates.
          A related challenge is the increase in the diversity of protein families, with many new
          divergent clades present. With more protein similarity relationships falling into the
          twilight zone overlapping with random sequence similarity, the number of false positives
          for homology detection methods increases, making the true relationships more difficult to
          identify. Nevertheless, a deeper knowledge of protein sequence and family diversity
          introduces unprecedented opportunities to mine similarity relationships for clues on
          molecular function and molecular interactions as well as providing much expanded data for
          all methods utilizing homologous sequence information data.</p>
        <p>The GOS dataset has demonstrated the usefulness of large-scale environmental shotgun
          sequencing projects in exploring proteins. These projects offer an unbiased view of
          proteins and protein families in an environmental sample. However, it should be noted that
          the GOS data reported here are limited to mostly ocean surface microbes. Even with this
          targeted sampling a tremendous amount of diversity is added to known families, and there
          is evidence for a large number of novel families. Additional data from larger filter sizes
          (that will sample more eukaryotes) coupled with metagenomic studies of different
          environments like soil, air, deep sea, etc. will help to achieve the ultimate goal of a
          whole-earth catalog for proteins.</p>

          NCBI-nr also contains protein predictions from DNA sequences from both finished and
          unfinished genomes in GenBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b125">125</xref>],
          EMBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b126">126</xref>], and DNA Databank of Japan
          (DDBJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b127">127</xref>]. The nonredundancy in
          NCBI-nr is only to the level of distinct sequences, and any two sequences of the same
          length and content are merged into a single entry. NCBI-nr contains partial protein
          sequences and is not a fully curated database. Therefore it also contains contaminants in
          the form of sequences that are falsely predicted to be proteins.</p>
        <p>Expressed sequence tag (EST) databases also provide the potential to add a great deal of
          information to protein exploration and contain information that is not well represented in
          NCBI-nr. To this end, assemblies of EST sequences from the TIGR Gene Indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b034">34</xref>], an EST database, were included in
          this study. To minimize redundancy, only EST assemblies from those organisms for which the
          full genome is not yet known, were included. The protein predictions on metazoan genomes
          that are fully sequenced and annotated were obtained by including the Ensembl database
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b036">36</xref>] in this study.</p>
        <p>Both finished and unfinished sequences from prokaryotic genome projects submitted to NCBI

          the purpose of evaluating our approach and also for the purpose of identifying any
          proteins that were missed by the annotation process used in these projects.</p>
        <p>Thus, for this study the following publicly available datasets, all downloaded on

        <title>Assembly of the GOS dataset.</title>
        <p>Initial assembly (construction of “unitigs”) was performed so that only overlaps of at
          least 98% DNA sequence identity and no conflicts with other overlaps were accepted. False
          assemblies at this phase of the assembler are extremely rare, even in the presence of
          complex datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b128">128</xref>]. Paired-end (also known as
          mate-pair) data were then used to order, orient, and merge unitigs into the final
          assemblies, but only when two mate pairs or a single mate pair and an overlap between
          unitigs implied the same layout. In one respect, mate pair data was used more aggressively
          than is typical in assembly of a single genome in that depth-of-coverage information was
          largely ignored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b010">10</xref>]. This
          potentially allows chimeric assemblies through a repeat within a genome or through an
          ortholog between genomes. Thus, a conclusion that relies on the correctness of a single
          assembly involving multiple unitigs should be considered tentative until the assembly can
          be confirmed in some way. Assemblies involved in key results in this paper were subjected
          to expert manual review based on thickness of overlaps, presence of well-placed mate pairs
          across thin overlaps or across gaps between contigs, and consistency of depth of
          coverage.</p>

        <title>Identification of nonredundant sequences.</title>
        <p>Given a set of sequences <italic>S</italic> and a threshold <italic>T</italic>, a
          nonredundant subset <italic>S′</italic> of <italic>S</italic> was identified by first
          partitioning <italic>S</italic> (using the threshold <italic>T</italic>) and then picking
          a representative from each partition. The set of representatives constitutes the
          nonredundant set <italic>S′</italic>. The process was implemented using the following
          graph-theoretic approach. A directed graph <italic>G</italic> = (<italic>V, E</italic>) is
          constructed with vertex set <italic>V</italic> and edge set <italic>E</italic>. Each
          vertex in <italic>V</italic> represents a sequence from <italic>S</italic>. A directed
          edge (<italic>u</italic>,<italic>v</italic>) ∈ <italic>E</italic> if sequence
            <italic>u</italic> is longer than sequence <italic>v</italic> and their sequence
          comparison satisfies the threshold <italic>T;</italic> for sequences of identical length,
          the sequence with the lexicographically larger id is considered the longer of the two.
          Note that <italic>G</italic> does not have any cycles. Source vertices (i.e., vertices
          with no in-degree) are sorted in decreasing order of their out-degrees and (from largest
          out-degree to smallest) processed in this order. A source vertex <italic>u</italic> is
          processed as follows: mark all vertices that have not been seen before and are reachable
          from vertex <italic>u</italic> as being redundant and mark vertex <italic>u</italic> as
          their representative.</p>
        <p>We used two thresholds in this paper, 98% similarity and 100% identity. The former was
          used in the first stage of the clustering and the later was used in the HMM profile
          analysis. For the 98% similarity threshold, two sequences satisfy the threshold if the
          following three criteria are met: (1) similarity of the match is at least 98%; (2) at
          least 95% of the shorter sequence is covered by the match; and (3) (match score)/(self
          score of shorter sequence) ≥ 95%.</p>

        <title>Description of the clustering algorithm.</title>
        <p>The starting point for the clustering was the set of pairwise sequence similarities
          identified using the all-against-all BLASTP compute. Because of both the volume and nature
          of the data, the clustering was carried out in four steps: redundancy removal, core set
          identification, core set merging, and final recruitment.</p>
        <p>A set of nonredundant sequences (at 98% similarity) was identified using the procedure
          given in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> (Identification of
          nonredundant sequences). Only the nonredundant sequences were considered in further steps
          of the clustering process.</p>
        <p>The aim of the core set identification step was to identify <italic>core sets</italic> of
          highly related sequences. In graph-theoretic terms, this involves looking for dense
          subgraphs in a graph where the vertices correspond to sequences and an edge exists between
          two sequences if their sequence match satisfies some reasonable threshold (for instance,
          40% similarity match over 80% of at least one sequence and are clearly homologous based on
          the BLAST threshold). Dense subgraphs were identified by using a heuristic. This approach
          utilizes <italic>long</italic> edges. These are edges where the match threshold is
          computed relative to the longer sequence. This was done to prevent, as much as possible,
          unrelated proteins from being put into the same core set. If all the sequences were full
          length, using long edges would have offered a good solution to keeping unrelated proteins
          apart. However, the situation here is complicated by the presence of a large amount of
          fragmentary sequence data of varying lengths. This was dealt with somewhat by working with
          rather stringent match thresholds and a two-stage process to identify the core sets. We
          used the concept of <italic>strict</italic> long edges and <italic>weak</italic> long
          edges. A strict long edge exists between two vertices (sequences) if their match has the
          following properties: (1) 90% of the longer sequence is involved in the match; (2) the
          match has 70% similarity; and (3) the score of the match is at least 60% of the self-score
          of the longer sequence. A weak long edge exists between two vertices (sequences) if their
          match has the following properties: (1) 80% of the longer sequence is involved in the
          match; (2) the match has 40% similarity; and (3) the score of the match is at least 30% of
          the self-score of the longer sequence. Core set identification had two substages:
            <italic>large core initialization</italic> and <italic>core extension.</italic> The
          large core initialization step identified sets of sequences where these sets were of a
          reasonable size and the sequences in them were very similar to each other. Furthermore,
          these sets could be extended in the core extension step by adding related sequences. In
          the large core initialization step, a directed graph <italic>G</italic> was constructed on
          the sequences using strict long edges, with each long edge being directed from the longer
          to the shorter sequence. For each vertex <italic>v</italic> in <italic>G</italic>, let
            <italic>S</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) denote the friends set of <italic>v</italic>
          consisting of <italic>v</italic> and all neighbors that <italic>v</italic> has an
          out-going edge to.</p>
        <p>Initially all the vertices in G are unmarked. Consider the set of all friends sets in the
          decreasing order of their size. For <italic>S</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) that is
          currently being considered, do the following: (1) initialize <italic>seed set A</italic> =
            <italic>S</italic>(<italic>v</italic>); (2) while there exists some <italic>v</italic>′
          such that |<italic>S</italic>(<italic>v</italic>) ∩
          <italic>S</italic>(<italic>v</italic>′)| ≥ <italic>k</italic>, set <italic>A</italic> =
            <italic>A</italic> ∪ <italic>S</italic>(<italic>v</italic>′). (Note: <italic>k</italic>
          = 10 is chosen); (3) output set <italic>A</italic> and mark all vertices in
            <italic>A</italic>; and (4) update all friends sets to contain only unmarked
          vertices.</p>
        <p>In the core extension step, we constructed a graph <italic>G</italic> using weak long
          edges. All vertices in seed sets (computed from the large core initialization step) were
          marked and the rest of the vertices unmarked. Each seed set was then greedily extended to
          be a core set by adding a currently unmarked vertex that has at least <italic>k</italic>
          neighbors (<italic>k</italic> = 10 is chosen) in the set; the added vertex was marked.
          After this process, a clique-finding heuristic was used to identify smaller cliques (of
          size at most <italic>k</italic> − 1) consisting of currently unmarked vertices; these were
          also extended to become core sets. A final step involved merging the computed core sets on
          the basis of weak edges connecting them.</p>
        <p>In the core set merging step, we constructed an FFAS (Fold and Function Assignment
          System) profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b039">39</xref>] for each core
          set using the longest sequence in the core set as query. FFAS was then used to carry out
          profile–profile comparisons in order to merge the core sets into larger sets of related
          sequences. Due to computational constraints imposed by the number of core sets, profiles
          were built on only core sets containing at least 20 sequences.</p>
        <p>Final recruitment involved constructing a PSI-BLAST profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b040">40</xref>] on core sets of size 20 or more (using the longest
          sequence in the core set as query) and then using PSI-BLAST (–z 1 × 10<sup>9</sup>, –e 10)
          to recruit as yet unclustered sequences or small-sized clusters (size less than 20) to the
          larger core sets. For a sequence to be recruited, the sequence–profile match had to cover
          at least 60% of the length of the sequence with an <italic>E-</italic>value ≤ 1 ×
            10<sup>−7</sup>. In a final step, unclustered sequences were recruited to the clusters
          using their BLAST search results. A length-based threshold was used to determine if the
          sequence is to be recruited.</p>

        <title>Identification of clusters containing shadow ORFs.</title>
        <p>A well-known problem in predicting coding intervals for DNA sequences is shadow ORFs. The
          key requirement that coding intervals not contain in-frame stop codons requires that
          coding intervals be subintervals of ORFs. Long ORFs are therefore obvious candidates to be
          coding intervals. Unfortunately, the constraints on the coding interval to be an ORF often
          cause subintervals and overlapping intervals of the coding interval to also be ORFS in one
          of the five other reading frames (two on the same strand and three on the opposite
          strand). These coincidental ORFs are called shadow ORFs since they are found in the shadow
          of the coding ORF. In rare cases (and more frequently in certain viruses) coding intervals
          in different reading frames can overlap but usually only slightly. Overwhelmingly distinct
          coding intervals do not overlap. However, this constraint is not as strict for ORFs that
          contain a coding interval, as the exact extent of the coding interval is not known.
          Prokaryotes predominate in these data and are the focus of the ORF predictions. Their 3′
          end of an ORF is very likely to be part of the coding interval because a stop codon is a
          clear signal for the termination of both the ORF and the coding interval (this signal
          could be obscured by frameshift errors in sequencing). The 5′ end is more problematic
          because the true start codon is not so easily identified and so the longest ORF with a
          reasonable start codon is chosen and this may extend the ORF beyond the true coding
          interval. For this reason different criteria were set for when ORFs have a significant
          overlap depending on the orientation (or the 5′ or 3′ ends) of the ORFs involved. Two ORFs
          on the same strand are considered overlapping if their intervals overlap by at least 100
          bp. Two ORFs that are on the opposite strands are considered overlapping either if their
          intervals overlap by at least 50 bp and their 3′ ends are within each others intervals, or
          if their intervals overlap by at least 150 bp and the 5′ end of one is in the interval of
          the other.</p>
        <p>ORFs for coding intervals are clustered based on sequence similarity. In most cases this
          sequence similarity is due to the ORFs evolving from a common ancestral sequence. Due to
          functional constraints on the protein being coded for by the ORF, some sequence similarity
          is retained. There are no known explicit constraints on the shadow ORFs to constrain drift
          from the ancestral sequences. However, the shadow ORFs still tend to cluster together for
          some obvious reasons. The drift has not yet obliterated the similarity. There are implicit
          constraints due to the functional constraints on the overlapping coding ORF. There are
          also other possible unknown functional constraints beyond the coding ORF. At first it was
          surmised that within shadow ORF clusters the diversity should be higher than for the
          coding ORF, but this did not prove to be a reliable signal. The apparent problem is that
          the shadow ORFs tend to be fractured into more clusters due to the introduction of stop
          codons that are not constrained because the shadow ORFs are noncoding. What rapidly became
          apparent is that the most reliable signal that a cluster was made up of shadow ORFs is
          that the cluster was smaller than the coding cluster containing the ORFs overlapping the
          shadow ORFs.</p>
        <p>The basic rule for labeling a cluster as a shadow ORF cluster is that the size of the
          shadow ORF cluster is less than the size of another cluster that contained a significant
          proportion of the overlapping ORFs for the shadow ORF cluster. A specific set of rules was
          used to label shadow ORF clusters based on comparison to other clusters that contained
          ORFs overlapping ORFS in the shadow ORF cluster (called the overlapping cluster for this
          discussion). First, the overlapping cluster cannot be the same cluster as the shadow ORF
          cluster (there are sometimes overlapping ORFs within the same cluster due to frameshifts).
          Second, both the redundant and nonredundant sizes of the shadow ORF cluster must be
          smaller than the corresponding sizes of the overlapping cluster. Third, at least one-third
          of the shadow ORFs must have overlapping ORFs in the overlapping cluster. Fourth, less
          than one-half of the shadow ORFs are allowed to contain their overlapping ORFs (this test
          is rarely needed but did eliminate the vast majority of the very few obvious false
          positives that were found using these rules). Finally, the majority of the shadow ORFs
          that overlapped must overlap by more than half their length.</p>
        <p>When using this rule, 1,274,919 clusters were labeled as shadow ORF clusters, and
          6,570,824 singletons were labeled as shadow ORFs. The rules need to be somewhat
          conservative so as not to eliminate coding clusters. To test these rules, clusters
          containing at least two NCBI-nr sequences were examined. Two sequences were used instead
          of one because occasional spurious shadow ORFs have been submitted to NCBI-nr. There were
          989 shadow ORF clusters containing at least two NCBI-nr sequences and with more than
          one-tenth as many NCBI-nr sequences as the overlapping cluster. This was 0.86% of all
          clusters (114,331 in total) with at least two NCBI-nr sequences. Of these 989, a few were
          obvious mistakes, and the others involved very few NCBI-nr sequences of dubious curation,
          such as “hypothetical.” Just to be conservative, all of these 989 clusters were rescued
          and not labeled as shadow ORF clusters.</p>

        <title>Ka/Ks test to determine if sequences in a cluster are under selective
          pressure.</title>
        <p>For a cluster containing conserved but noncoding sequences, it is expected that there is
          no selection at the codon level. We checked this by computing the ratio of nonsynonymous
          to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks test) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b130">130</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b131">131</xref>] on the DNA
          sequences from which the ORFs in the cluster were derived. For most proteins, Ka/Ks ≪ 1,
          and for proteins that are under strong positive selection, Ka/Ks ≫ 1. A Ka/Ks value close
          to 1 is an indication that sequences are under no selective pressure and hence are
          unlikely to encode proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b134">134</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b135">135</xref>]. Weakly selected
          but legitimate coding sequences can have a Ka/Ks value close to 1. These were identified
          to some extent by using a model in which different partitions of the codons experience
          different levels of selective pressure. A cluster was rejected only if no partition was
          found to be under purifying selection at the amino acid level.</p>
        <p>The Ka/Ks test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b130">130</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b131">131</xref>] was run only on those clusters
          (remaining after the shadow ORF filtering step) that did not contain sequences with HMM
          matches or have NCBI-nr sequences in them. Only the nonredundant sequences in a cluster
          were considered. Sequences in each of the clusters were aligned with MUSCLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b134">134</xref>]. For each cluster, a strongly
          aligning subset of sequences was selected for the Ka/Ks analysis. The codeml program from
          PAML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b135">135</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b136">136</xref>] was run using model M0 to calculate an overall
          (i.e., branch- and position-independent) Ka/Ks value for the cluster. Clusters with Ka/Ks
          ≤ 0.5, indicating purifying selection and therefore very likely coding, were considered as
          passing the Ka/Ks filter. In addition, the remaining clusters were examined by running
          codeml with model M3. This partitioned the positions of the alignment into three classes
          that may be evolving differently (typically, a few positions may be under positive
          selection while the remainder of the sequence is conserved). A likelihood ratio test was
          applied to select clusters for which M3 explained the data significantly better than M0
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b136">136</xref>]. If a cluster was thus
          selected, and if one of the resulting partitions had a Ka/Ks ≤ 0.5 and comprised at least
          10% of the sequence, then that cluster was also considered as passing the Ka/Ks filter.
          All other clusters were marked as containing spurious ORFs.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of protein prediction via clustering.</title>
        <p>Our evaluation of protein prediction via the clustering shows a very favorable comparison
          to currently used protein prediction methods for prokaryotic genomes. We used the PG
          dataset for this evaluation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t002">Table
          2</xref>). Of the 3,049,695 PG ORFs, 575,729 sequences (19%) were clustered (the
            <italic>clustered set</italic>). Of the 614,100 predictions made by the genome projects,
          600,911 sequences could be mapped to the PG ORF set (the <italic>submitted set</italic>);
          93% of the unmapped sequences were &lt;60 aa (recall that the ORF calling procedure
          only produced ORFs of length ≥60 aa). The clustered set and submitted set had 493,756 ORFs
          in common. Of the 107,155 sequences that were only in the submitted set, 24,217 sequences
          (23%) had HMM matches. As with other unclustered HMM matches, most were weak or partial.
          These sequences had an average of only 48% of their lengths covered by HMMs. Of the
          remaining 82,938 sequences that did not have an HMM match, 13,724 (17%) were removed by
          the filters used, and the rest fell into clusters with only one nonredundant sequence (and
          thus were not labeled as predicted proteins by the clustering analysis). Based on NCBI-nr
          sequences in them, these clusters were mostly labeled as “hypothetical,” “unnamed,” or
          “unknown.” Our clustering method identified 81,973 ORFs not predicted by the genome
          projects, of which 16,042 (20%) were validated by HMM matches (with average HMM coverage
          of 69% of sequence length) and an additional 27,120 (33%) had significant BLAST matches
            (<italic>E-</italic>value ≤ 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>) to sequences in NCBI-nr. Thus, if the
          submitted set is considered as truth, then protein prediction via clustering produces
          493,756 true positives (TP), 81,973 false positives (FP), and 107,155 false negatives
          (FN), thereby having a sensitivity (TP/[TP + FN]) of 83% and specificity (TP/[TP + FP]) of
          86%. However, if truth is considered as those sequences that are common to both the
          clustered and submitted sets in addition to those sequences with HMM matches, then our
          protein prediction method via clustering has 95% sensitivity and 89% specificity, while
          protein prediction by the prokaryotic genome projects has 97% sensitivity and 86%
          specificity.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of protein clustering.</title>
        <p>We used Pfams to evaluate the clustering method in two ways. For both evaluations the
          clustering was restricted to only those sequences with Pfam matches. It should be kept in
          mind that there are redundancies among Pfams in that there can be more than one Pfam for a
          homologous domain family (for instance, the kinase domain Pfams—PF00069 protein kinase
          domain and PF07714 protein tyrosine kinase), and these redundancies can affect the
          evaluation statistics reported below.</p>
        <p>For the first evaluation, each sequence was represented by the set of Pfams that match
          it. This is referred to as the <italic>domain architecture</italic> for a sequence. While
          Pfams provide a domain-centric view of proteins, the domain architecture attempts to
          approximate the full sequence-based approach used here, and thus could be used to shed
          light on the general performance of the clustering. We measured how often unrelated
          sequences were present in a given cluster. Two sequences were defined to be unrelated if
          their domain architectures each had at least one Pfam that was not present in the other's
          domain architecture. Note that this measure did not penalize the case when the domain
          architecture of one sequence was a proper subset of the domain architecture of the other
          sequence. This was done to allow fragmentary sequences in clusters to be included in the
          evaluation as well (and also because it is not always easy to determine whether an amino
          acid sequence is fragmentary or not). For each cluster, we computed the percentage of
          sequence pairs that are unrelated under this measure. A total of 92% of the clusters had
          at most 2% unrelated pairs. Then we carried out an assessment of how many instances of a
          given domain architecture appear in a single cluster. A total of 58% of the domain
          architectures were confined to single clusters (i.e., 100% of their occurence is in one
          cluster), and 88% of the domain architectures was such that &gt;50% of their
          occurences is in one cluster.</p>
        <p>For the second evaluation, we selected all sequences with Pfam matches, and each sequence
          was assigned to the Pfam that matches it with the highest score. With this assignment, the
          Pfams induce a partition on the sequences. The distribution of the number of sequences in
          clusters induced by the Pfams was compared to those of clusters from the clustering
          method. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g012">Figure 12</xref>A shows comparison as
          a log–log plot of the number of sequences versus the number of clusters with at least that
          many sequences for the two cases. The plot shows that cluster size distributions are quite
          similar, with both the methods having an inflection point around 2,500. The difference
          between the two curves is that there are more big clusters (and also fewer small clusters)
          induced by the Pfams as compared to the clustering method. This can be explained by noting

            <p>(A) Plot comparing the sizes of clusters produced by our clustering approach (red) to
              those of clusters produced by Pfams (green). The curves track each other quite well,
              with both of them having an inflection point around cluster size 2,500 (approximately
              3.4 on the <italic>x</italic>-axis). Each sequence is assigned to the highest scoring
              Pfam that it matches. Two sequences that are assigned to the same Pfam can
              nevertheless be assigned to different clusters by the full-sequence–based clustering
              approach if they differ in the remaining portion. This is especially true for commonly
              occurring domains that are present in different multidomain proteins. Thus, there
              tends to be a larger number of big clusters in the Pfam approach as compared to the
              full-sequence–based approach. Hence, the green curve is above the red curve at the
              higher sizes.</p>
            <p>(B) Plot of the cluster size distributions for core sets (green) and for final

              (approximately 3.4 on the <italic>x</italic>-axis). Note that these plots give the
              cumulative distribution function (cdf), while the power law exponents reported in the
              text are for the number of clusters of size <italic>X</italic> (i.e., the probability

        <p>Our clustering also shows a good correspondence with HMM profiling on the phylogenetic
          markers that we looked at. The clustering identifies 7,423, 12,553, and 13,657 sequences,
          respectively, for RecA (cluster ID 1146), Hsp70 (cluster ID 197), and RpoB (cluster ID
          1187). HMM profiling identifies 5,292, 12,298, and 12,165 sequences, respectively, for
          these families. For each of these families, there are at least 94% of sequences (relative
          to the smaller set) in common between clustering and HMM profiling.</p>

        <title>Difference in ratio of predicted proteins to total ORFs for the PG set and the GOS
          set.</title>
        <p>The ratio of clustered ORFs to total ORFs is significantly higher for the GOS ORFs
          (0.3471) compared to the PG ORFs (0.1888). This can be explained by the fragmentary nature
          of the GOS data. For the large majority of the GOS data, the average sequence length is
          920 bp compared to full-length genomes for the PG data. For the PG data, clustered ORFs
          have a mean length of 325 aa and a median length of 280 aa. Unclustered ORFs have a mean
          length of 119 aa and a median length of 87 aa. Assuming that the genomic GOS data has a
          similar underlying ORF structure to PG data, the effect that GOS fragmentation had on ORF
          lengths is estimated. Each reading frame will have a mixture of clustered and unclustered
          ORFs, but on average there will be 2 ORFs per reading frame per 920-bp GOS fragment, and
          both ORFs will be truncated. Assuming the truncation point for the ORF is uniformly
          distributed across the ORF, the truncated ORF will drop below the 60-aa threshold to be
          considered as an ORF with a probability of 60/(length of the ORF). Using the median
          length, the percentage of clustered ORFs dropping below the threshold due to truncation is
          21%; for unclustered ORFs, it is 69%. Accounting for this truncation, the expected ratio
          of clustered ORFs to total ORFs for the GOS ORFs based on the PG ORFs would be 0.3708,
          which is very close to the observed value.</p>

        <title>Kingdom assignment strategy and its evaluation.</title>
        <p>We used several approaches to assign kingdoms for GOS sequences. They are all
          fundamentally based upon a strategy that takes into account top BLAST matches of a GOS
          sequence to sequences in NCBI-nr, and then voting on a majority.</p>
        <p>We evaluated a simple strict-majority voting scheme (of the top four BLAST matches) using
          the NCBI-nr set. First, the redundancy in NCBI-nr was removed using a two-staged process.
          A nonredundant set of NCBI-nr sequences was computed involving matches with 98% similarity
          over 95% of the length of the shorter sequence (using the procedure discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> [Identification of nonredundant
          sequences]). This set was made further nonredundant by considering matches involving 90%
          similarity over 95% of the length of the shorter sequence. The nonredundant sequences that
          remained after this step constituted the evaluation dataset <italic>S</italic>. For each
          sequence in <italic>S</italic>, its top four BLAST matches to other sequences in
            <italic>S</italic> (ignoring self-matches) were used to assign a kingdom for it (based
          on a strict majority rule). This predicted kingdom assignment for the sequence was
          compared to its actual kingdom. A correct classification is obtained for 93% of the
          sequences. The correct classification rate per kingdom is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050016-t013">Table 13</xref>.</p>

        <p>While this evaluation shows that the BLAST-based voting scheme provides a reasonable
          handle on the kingdom assignment problem, there are caveats associated with it. The
          kingdom assignment for a set of query sequences is greatly influenced by the taxonomic
          groups from each kingdom that are represented in the reference dataset against which these
          queries are being compared. If certain taxa are only sparsely represented in the reference
          set, then, depending on their position in the tree of life, queries from these taxa can be
          misclassified (using a nearest-neighbor type approach based on BLAST matches). This
          explains why the archaeal classification rate is quite low compared to the others. Thus,
          the true classification rate for the GOS dataset based on this approach will also depend
          on the differences in taxonomic biases in the GOS dataset (query) and the NCBI-nr set
          (reference).</p>
        <p>The kingdom proportion for the GOS dataset reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g001">Figure 1</xref> is based on a kingdom assignment of scaffolds.
          Those GOS ORFs with BLAST matches to NCBI-nr were considered, and the top-four majority
          rule was used to assign a kingdom to each of them. Using the ORF coordinates on the
          scaffold, the fraction (of bp) of a scafffold assigned to each kingdom was computed. The
          scaffold was labeled as belonging to a kingdom if the fraction of the scaffold assigned to
          that kingdom was &gt;50%. All ORFs on this scaffold were then assigned to the same
          kingdom.</p>

        <title>Cluster size distribution, the power law, and the rate of protein family
          discovery.</title>
        <p>Earlier studies of protein family sizes in single organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b137">137</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b139">139</xref>] have suggested that <italic>P</italic>(<italic>d</italic>), the frequency
          of protein families of size <italic>d,</italic> satisfies a power law: that is,
            <italic>P</italic>(<italic>d</italic>) ≈ <italic>d <sup>−</sup></italic>
          <sup>β</sup> with exponent β reported between 2.68 and 4.02. Power laws have been used to
          model various biological systems, including protein–protein interaction networks and gene
          regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b043">43</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g012">Figure 12</xref>B illustrates the distribution of the cluster
          sizes from our data on a log–log scale, a scale for which a power law distribution gives a
          line. In contrast to family size distributions reported in single organisms, the cluster
          sizes from our data are not well described by a single power law. Rather, there appear to
          be different power laws: one governs the size distribution of very large clusters, and
          another describes the rest. This behavior is observed both in the distribution of the core
          set sizes and also in the distribution of the final cluster sizes. We identified an
          inflection point for both the core set distribution and the final clusters at around size
          2,500, and estimated the power law exponent β via linear regression separately in each
          size regime. For the core set distribution, the exponent β = 1.99
            (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.994) for clusters of size ≤ 2,500, and β = 3.34
            (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.996) for clusters of size &gt; 2,500. For the
          final cluster sizes, the exponent β = 1.72 (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.995) for
          clusters of size ≤ 2,500, and β = 2.72 (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.995) for
          clusters of size &gt; 2,500. The estimates for β are different for the core clusters
          compared to the final clusters, reflecting a larger number of medium and large clusters in
          the final clustering as a result of the cluster-merging and additional recruitment steps.
          A similar dichotomy between the size distributions of large and small protein families was
          observed in a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b140">140</xref>] of protein
          families contained in the ProDom, Protomap, and COG databases, where the exponent β
          reported was in the range of 1.83 to 1.98 for the 50 smallest clusters and 2.54 to 3.27
          for the 500 largest clusters in these databases.</p>
        <p>Our clustering method was run separately on the following seven datasets: set 1 consisted
          of only NCBI-nr sequences; set 2 consisted of all sequences in NCBI-nr, ENS, TGI-EST, and
          PG; sets 3 through 6 consisted of set 2 in combination with a random subset of 20%, 40%,
          60%, and 80% of the GOS sequences, respectively; set 7 consisted of set 2 in combination
          with all the GOS sequences. On each of the seven datasets, the redundancy removal (using
          the 98% similarity filter) was run, followed by the core set detection steps. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the number of core sets of
          varying sizes (≥3, ≥5, ≥10, and ≥20) as a function of the number of nonredundant sequences
          for each dataset.</p>
        <p>The observed linear growth in number of families with increase in sample size
            <italic>n</italic> is related to the power law distribution in the following way. We
          model protein families as a graph where each vertex corresponds to a protein sequence and
          an edge between two vertices indicates sequence similarity between the corresponding
          proteins. Consider a clustering (partitioning) of the vertices of a graph with
            <italic>n</italic> vertices such that the cluster sizes obey a power law distribution.
          Let C<italic>
            <sub>d</sub>
          </italic>(<italic>n</italic>) [respectively,
            C<sub>≥<italic>d</italic></sub>(<italic>n</italic>)] denote the number of clusters of
          size <italic>d</italic> (respectively, ≥<italic>d</italic>). Since the distribution of
          cluster sizes follows a power law, there exist constants α<italic>,</italic> β such that
          for all <italic>x</italic> ≤ <italic>n</italic>,
            <italic>C<sub>x</sub></italic>(<italic>n</italic>) =
            α<italic>x<sup>−</sup></italic><sup>β</sup>.</p>

        <p>Note that while the observed distribution of protein family sizes is fit by two different
          power laws, one for clusters of size less than 2,500 with β = 1.99 and another for
          clusters of size greater than 2,500 with β = 3.34 for the current number of (nonredundant)
          sequences, the contribution of large families to the rate of growth is negligible compared
          to the small families.</p>

        <title>Neighbor functional linkage methods.</title>
        <p>For the sequences in each GOS-only cluster, we determined if neighboring ORFs occurring
          on the same strand had a similar biological process in the GO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b049">49</xref>]. If this shared biological process of the neighbors
          occurred statistically more often than expected by chance, that inferred a potential
          operon linkage and a biological process term for the GOS-only cluster. This approach
          weighted ORFs by sequence similarity to reduce the skewing effect of sequences from highly
          related organisms.</p>
        <p>For definition of linked ORFs, we collected pairs of same-strand ORF protein predictions
          with intergenic distances less than 500 bp. Negative distances were possible if the 5′ end
          of the downstream ORF in the pair occurred 5′ to the 3′ end of the upstream ORF. We used a
          probability function to estimate the probability that two putative genes belong to the
          same operon given their intergenic distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b047">47</xref>]. Because sequences come from a variety of unknown organisms, the probability
          distribution was created by averaging properties of 33 randomly chosen divergent genomes.
          The exact choice of genomes did not greatly affect the ability of the distribution to
          separate experimentally determined same-operon gene pairs from adjacent, same-strand gene
          pairs in different known operons annotated in a version of RegulonDB downloaded on March
          29, 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b141">141</xref>].</p>
        <p>We measured the functional linkage between two protein clusters by searching for all
          occurrences of nearby pairs of ORFs belonging to the two clusters of interest.
          Sufficiently close pairs were more likely to be encoded in the same operon. We devised a
          scoring mechanism to reward those pairs of clusters for which many divergent examples of
          likely operon pairs existed in the set of ORF pairs. For each pair of clusters, a weight
          was applied to the contribution of each pair of ORFs, and this was proportional to how
          similar the pair of ORFs was to other example pairs. Thus, many near-identical pairs of
          ORFs, likely from the same or similar species, are not overrepresented in the final
          cluster pair score, while conserved examples of neighboring position from more divergent
          sequences contribute an increased weight. The score for each cluster pair is calculated
          as: <disp-formula id="pbio-0050016-e004"><graphic mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050016.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <mml:math display='block'><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy='false'>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>1</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>2</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mtext>)</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&equals;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>&minus;</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle='true'><mml:munderover><mml:mo>&Pi;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>&equals;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>&equals;</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&lsqb;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>&minus;</mml:mo><mml:mi>Pr</mml:mi><mml:mo></mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy='false'>(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Og</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>g</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mtext>dist)</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&lowast;</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>&lowast;</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&rsqb;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math> --></disp-formula>where <italic>S</italic>(C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>) is the linkage score

          described below, for all example pairs <italic>i</italic>. </p>
        <p>We calculated sequence weights in a manner similar to that used in progressive multiple
          sequence alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b142">142</xref>]. Briefly,
          neighbor-joining trees were built for all clusters using the QuickJoin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b143">143</xref>] and QuickTree programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b144">144</xref>] based on a distance matrix
          constructed from all-against-all BLAST scores within a cluster, normalized to self-scores.
          For those few clusters with more than 30,000 members, trees were not built. Instead, equal
          sequence weights for all members were assigned because of computational limitations. The
          root of each tree was placed at the midpoint of the tree by using the retree package in
          PHYLIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b145">145</xref>]. The individual sequence
          weights were then computed by summing the distance from each leaf to the root after
          dividing each branch's weight by the number of nodes in the subtree below it. Weights were
          normalized so that the sum of weights in any given tree was equal to 1.0. This weighting
          scheme is superior to one in which weights are normalized to the largest weight in the
          tree, one that does not weight sequences according to divergence, and one that only
          considers the number of example pairs seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g014">Figure 14</xref>). To compare the different scoring methods, pairs of clusters
          annotated with GO terms that contained adjacent ORFs in the data were gathered. These
          pairs were divided into into functionally related and unrelated clusters based on a
          measure of GO term similarity (<italic>p</italic>-value ≤ 0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b146">146</xref>]. We evaluated scoring methods for the ability to
          recover functionally similar pairs. In all analyses, linkages between clusters were
          ignored if there were fewer than five examples of cluster member ORFs adjacent to each
          other on a scaffold.</p>

        <p>Function for novel families was inferred as follows. (1) Assignment of GO terms to
          clusters. We downloaded the GO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b049">49</xref>]
          database on September 21, 2005, from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.geneontology.org</ext-link>, along with the files
          gene_association.goa_uniprot and pfam2go.txt dated July 12, 2005. Only the biological
          process component of the ontology was considered. If a cluster had at least 10% of its
          redundant sequences annotated by the most abundant Pfam domain for that cluster, and that
          Pfam domain had a GO biological process term provided by the pfam2go mapping, then we
          assigned a cluster the GO term of its most abundant Pfam annotation. In addition, if a
          cluster contained at least 20% of its Uniprot GO annotations the same, it was assigned
          that GO term. For each cluster, redundant GO terms found on the same path to the root were
          removed. (2) Identification of neighbors to GOS-only clusters. Neighbors of GOS-only
          clusters were defined as those clusters that had a cluster linkage score above a
          predetermined threshold (1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) and had at least five examples of cluster
          members adjacent to each other in the data. These neighbors were then screened for those
          that had been annotated with a GO term by the process described above. (3)
          Overrepresentation of neighbor GO terms. We attempted to define GO terms for a set of
          GOS-only neighbors that were statistically overrepresented. Because of the highly
          dependent nature of the terms in the GO, a simulation-based approach was chosen to
          determine which terms might be overrepresented. Annotated neighbors to a cluster of
          unknown function were identified as described above. For each annotated neighbor, counts
          for the associated GO term and all terms on the path to the root of the ontology were
          incremented. A total of 100,000 simulated neighbor lists of the same size as the true
          neighbor list were computed by selecting without replacement from those clusters with
          annotated GO terms, and an identical counting scheme was performed for each simulation.
          Overrepresentation of neighbor terms was calculated for each term on the ontology by
          asking how many times out of the 100,000 simulations the count for each GO term in the
          ontology met or exceeded the observed count for the actual neighbors. This fraction of
          simulations was interpreted as a <italic>p-</italic>value. If a term is unusually
          prevalent in the true observed neighbors, it should be relatively infrequent in the
          simulated data. For the purpose of the metric used here, “is-a” and “part-of”
          relationships were treated equally. In cases where a cluster had more than one GO term
          assigned to it, any redundant terms occurring on each other's path to the root were first
          removed. For any remaining clusters with nonredundant, multiple GO annotations, all
          possible lists of functions for each list of neighbor clusters were enumerated, and one
          function from each cluster was chosen. Each node in the ontology was assigned the maximum
          count observed from the enumerated function lists. We consistently applied this rule for
          the observed and simulated data.</p>
        <p>The following descriptive measures of the novel GOS-only cluster set were obtained.
          Transmembrane helix prediction was carried out with the programs TMHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b147">147</xref>] and SPLIT4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b148">148</xref>]. GC content was calculated as (G + C)/(G + C + A +
          T) bases for each ORF in a cluster, and averaged for each cluster within a set. The GC
          content, reported as the mean and standard deviation of the cluster averages, is as
          follows for each cluster set: Group I, 36.7% ± 8.0%; Group II, 35.9% ± 7.9%. Group I
          size-matched sample, 48.8% ± 11.1%; Group II size-matched sample, 49.5% ± 11.2%; Group I
          viral fraction, 37.8% ± 5.1%; Group II viral fraction, 37.3% ± 4.6%. To address the
          interconnectivity of the novel clusters within the context of all operon linkages, we
          constructed a graph with clusters as nodes and inferred operon linkages (with score ≥ 1 ×
            10<sup>−6</sup>) as edges. We then asked for every node in the set of novel clusters
          what was the cumulative fraction of novel nodes that could be reached within a varying
          edge distance from the starting node. The expectation of this fraction was calculated at
          each distance, and the procedure was repeated for the set of size-matched clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g015">Figure 15</xref>).</p>

        <p>We tried three different BLAST-based approaches for kingdom assignment of ORFs. The first
          method, used in the analysis, required a majority of the four top BLAST matches to vote
          for the same kingdom (archaea, bacteria, eukaryota, or viruses; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> [Kingdom assignment strategy and its evaluation]).
          The second method required all eight top BLAST matches to vote for the same kingdom. The
          last method we used was the scaffold-based kingdom assignment described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> (Kingdom assignment strategy and
          its evaluation). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g016">Figure 16</xref> shows the

GOS-only clusters were assigned a kingdom only if &gt;50% of their
          neighboring ORFs were assigned the same kingdom. The general trends observed are the same
          for each method, though the coverage decreases slightly for the more stringent
          methods.</p>

            <p>For each panel, clusters are as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050016-g004">Figure 4</xref>. For (A–C), a kingdom is assigned to each neighboring ORF within
              each cluster set; the percentage of all neighboring ORFs with a given kingdom
              assignment is plotted. For (D–F), a kingdom is assigned to each cluster if more than
              50% of all that cluster's neighbors with a kingdom assignment share the same
              assignment; the percentage of clusters in each set with a given assignment is plotted.
              In (A) and (D), a kingdom is assigned to a neighboring ORF by a majority vote of the
              top four BLAST matches to a protein in NCBI-nr (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). In (B) and (E), a kingdom is assigned if all eight
              highest-scoring BLAST matches agree in kingdom. In (C) and (F), all ORFs on a scaffold
              are assigned the same kingdom by voting among all ORFs with BLAST matches to NCBI-nr
              on that scaffold (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). In all

        <title>Characteristics and kingdom distribution of known protein domains.</title>
        <p>For these analyses we used the predicted proteins from the public (NCBI-nr, PG, TGI-EST,
          and ENS) and GOS datasets. The public dataset contains multiple identical copies of some
          sequences due to overlaps between the source datasets. For example, many sequences in PG
          are also found in NCBI-nr. We filtered the public set at 100% identity to avoid
          overcounting these sequences. Because this filtering was necessary for the public dataset,
          the GOS dataset was also filtered at 100% identity. If two or more sequences were 100%
          identical at the residue level, but were of different lengths, only the longest sequence
          was kept. The resulting datasets of nonredundant proteins are referred to as public-100
          and GOS-100.</p>
        <p>We assigned each protein in public-100 to a kingdom based on the species annotations
          provided in the source datasets (NCBI-nr, Ensembl, TIGR, and PG). The NCBI taxonomy tree
          was used to determine the kingdom of each species. Of 3,167,979 protein sequences in
          public-100, 3,158,907 can be annotated by kingdom. The remaining 9,072 sequences are
          largely synthetic.</p>
        <p>Determining the kingdom of origin of an environmental sequence can be difficult; while an
          unambiguous assignment can be made for some sequences, others can be assigned only
          tentatively or not at all. Therefore, we took a probabilistic approach (kingdom-weighting
          method), calculating “weights” or probabilities that each protein sequence originated from
          a given kingdom.</p>
        <p>The top four BLAST matches (<italic>E-</italic>value &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>) of
          GOS ORFs to NCBI-nr were considered. The kingdom of origin for each match was determined.
          We pooled these “kingdom votes” for each scaffold, since (presuming accurate assembly)
          each scaffold must come from a single species and hence from a single kingdom. Each ORF on
          a scaffold contributed up to four votes. If an ORF had fewer than four BLAST matches with
          an <italic>E-</italic>value &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, then it contributed fewer
          votes. ORFs with no BLAST matches contributed no votes.</p>
        <p>In many cases, the votes were not unanimous, indicating that some uncertainty must be
          associated with any kingdom assignment. An additional source of uncertainty is the finite
          number of votes. We accounted for these statistical issues by applying the following
          procedure to each scaffold. First, two pseudocounts were added to the votes for the
          “unknown” kingdom to represent the uncertainty that remains even when votes are unanimous
          (especially when there are few votes). The frequency of votes for each kingdom was
          calculated. The vote frequency for a kingdom provides the maximum likelihood estimate of
          the kingdom probability (i.e., the vote frequency that would have been observed on a
          scaffold of similar composition but with infinitely many voting ORFs). However, that
          estimate may not be accurate or precise. Therefore, the multinomial standard deviation was
          calculated for each vote frequency <italic>p</italic> as SQRT [<italic>p</italic> × (1 −
            <italic>p</italic>)/(<italic>n</italic> − 1)], where <italic>n</italic> is the number of
          votes. A distance of two standard deviations from the mean corresponds roughly to a 95%
          confidence interval. Thus, two standard deviations were subtracted from each vote
          frequency, and called the result (or zero, if the result was negative) the “kingdom
          weight.” This “kingdom weight” is a conservative estimate. There is 95% chance that the
          actual kingdom probability is greater.</p>
        <p>The kingdom weights do not sum to one because of the standard deviation penalty. The
          difference between the sum of the kingdom weights and unity is a measure of the total
          uncertainty about the kingdom assignment. This is called the “unknown weight.”</p>
        <p>Finally, we assigned each ORF the kingdom weights calculated for the scaffold as a whole.
          This procedure assigned kingdom weights to many ORFs with no BLAST matches. Overall,
          4,745,649 (84%) of the 5,654,638 proteins in GOS-100 receive nonzero kingdom weights.</p>
        <p>The kingdom weights calculated in this way provide a basis for estimating the proportion
          of sequences originating from each kingdom, <italic>p</italic><sub>
            <sc>GOS</sc>
          </sub>(<italic>K</italic>). The weights over all sequences in GOS-100 were summed for each
          of the known kingdoms, and divided by the sum of the weights for all kingdoms (excluding
          the unknown weight). This procedure suggested that 96% of the sequences are bacterial, a
          somewhat higher proportion than is estimated by the method described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> (Kingdom assignment strategy and
          its evaluation). Similarly, kingdom proportions,
            <italic>p</italic><sub><sc>GOS</sc>–Pfam</sub>(<italic>K</italic>), were calculated for
          the subset of GOS-100 sequences that have a significant Pfam hit, and 97% are found to be
          bacterial.</p>
        <p>We used the kingdom weights directly in the analyses where possible (e.g., to calculate
          the expected kingdom distribution of a given set of proteins by summing the weights).
          However, it was necessary in some cases to use discrete assignments of a single kingdom to
          each ORF. A tentative assignment can be made for a given scaffold by choosing the kingdom
          with the highest weight. The possibility remains, in this case, that a fraction of the
          “unknown” weight should rightfully belong to a different kingdom. However, if a kingdom
          weight is greater than 0.5, then this danger is averted, and a “confident” assignment of
          the scaffold and its constituent ORFs to that kingdom can be made.</p>
        <p>Given the uncertainty penalty above, achieving a kingdom weight greater than 0.5
          generally requires overwhelming support for one kingdom over the others. In particular, on
          a given scaffold, at least eight unanimous votes for a kingdom are needed (i.e., two ORFs
          contributing four votes each) to make a confident assignment to that kingdom. Any
          disagreement between the votes increases the required number rapidly: for instance, 15
          votes for a single kingdom are required to override four votes for other kingdoms.</p>
        <p>“Confident” kingdom assignments were made for 2,626,178 (46%) of the 5,654,638 proteins
          in GOS-100.</p>
        <p>In the analysis that identified new multi-kingdom Pfams, we used the subset of
          confidently kingdom-annotated proteins. Here, a Pfam model was designated as
          “kingdom-specific” in public-100 if there were only matches to proteins in one particular
          kingdom, and no “unknown” matches. A Pfam model that was kingdom specific in public-100
          was further designated as newly “multi-kingdom” if it had matches to one or more GOS-100
          proteins that were confidently labeled as belonging to a kingdom different from that found
          in the public-100 matches. Also, we filtered Pfam matches with an <italic>E-</italic>value
          cutoff of 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>. In every case, the bit score is at least five bits greater
          than the trusted cutoff for the model. In addition to passing the “confident” criteria,
          the kingdom assignments were all confirmed by visual inspection of the BLAST kingdom vote
          distributions for the respective scaffolds. Because the criteria for a “confident” kingdom
          assignment were conservative, there were only one or a few confident assignments for each
          domain to a “new” kingdom. The “confident” criteria are especially difficult to meet in
          the case of kingdom-crossing due to the votes contributed by the crossing protein. For
          instance, because the IDO domain itself always contributes four votes for “Eukaryota,” at
          least 15 votes for “Bacteria” were required to call a scaffold “bacterial.” Thus, many
          scaffolds have no confident kingdom assignment.</p>
        <p>We compared the relative diversities of protein families between GOS-100 and public-100
          as represented by Pfam sequence models. In order to do this, the number of matches
          expected to be found for each Pfam model in the GOS-100 data was computed, assuming that
          the matches were distributed among the models in the same proportions that they were in
          the public-100 data. These “expected” match counts were compared with the observed counts
          to identify domains that are more diverse in GOS-100 than in public-100 and vice
          versa.</p>
        <p>Because kingdoms differ in their protein usage, Pfam models match sequences from
          different kingdoms with different frequencies, and some models match sequences exclusively
          from one kingdom. Thus, to calculate the expected number of matches to a given Pfam in
          GOS-100 based on the number of matches observed in public-100, we corrected for the
          radically different kingdom composition of the two datasets.</p>
        <p>The expected proportion of all Pfam matches in GOS-100 that are to a given model
            <italic>M</italic> was calculated as follows. First, we made a simplifying assumption
          that sequences from different kingdoms were equally likely to have a Pfam hit, and thus
          that the Pfam matches in GOS-100 would be distributed among the kingdoms according to the
          kingdom proportions calculated using the weighted method above (for instance, it is
          assumed that 97% of the matches would be to bacterial sequences). Probability that a Pfam
          hit in GOS-100 is from <italic>K</italic> ≈
            <italic>p</italic><sub>GOS-Pfam</sub>(<italic>K</italic>) (for sequences in GOS-100 with
          at least one Pfam hit) for kingdoms <italic>K</italic> in {Archae, Bacteria, Eukaryotes,
          Viruses}.</p>
        <p>Second, we assumed that Pfam models match with the same relative rates within each
          kingdom in GOS-100 as they do in public-100. For instance, since twice as many SH3 domains
          as SH2 domains are found in public-100 eukaryotic sequences, the same ratio is expected to
          be found in GOS-100 eukaryotic sequences. Using the public-100 data, we calculated the
          frequency of matches for each Pfam model <italic>M</italic> within each kingdom, relative
          to the total number of Pfam matches to that kingdom. Pseudocounts of one were added to
          both the “match” and “no match” counts (i.e., using a uniform Dirichlet prior), to allow
          proper statistical treatment of families with few or no matches in the public databases
          for some kingdom. In Equation 5 below, Obs<sub>public</sub>(<italic>M,K</italic>) is the
          observed number of public-100 hits to <italic>M</italic> in <italic>K,</italic> and

        <p>Relatively fewer GOS-100 sequences than public-100 sequences have a Pfam hit (likely
          because Pfam is based on sequences in the public databases). To avoid systematically
          overestimating the number of GOS-100 hits for each Pfam model due to this global effect,
          the predicted counts were based on the observed total number of Pfam matches to all models
          in GOS-100, and an attempt was made to predict only how these matches are distributed
          among models. Thus, the expected number of Pfam hits to a given model in GOS-100 is equal
          to the expected proportion of hits to that model, as calculated above, multiplied by the

          measure of the relative diversity of that Pfam family in GOS-100 compared to public-100,
          corrected for the differing kingdom proportions in the two datasets. We computed the
          significance of this ratio using the CHITEST function in Excel, which implements the
          standard Pearson's Chi-square test with one degree of freedom and expresses the result as
          a probability. For many protein families, the difference in diversity between the two
          datasets was so pronounced that Excel reports a probability of zero due to numerical
          underflow, indicating a <italic>p</italic>-value less than 1 × 10<sup>−303</sup>.</p>

        <p>The GOS-100 and public-100 sequences selected for the IDO family alignment matched the
          PF01231 Pfam fs model with a score above the trusted bit-score cutoff at the sequence
          level. In addition, the sequences were required to have the width of their matching region
          spanning over 50% of the Pfam IDO HMM model length. Next, all sequence matches to the Pfam
          IDO model from the NCBI-nr database downloaded on March 6, 2006, were added (these also
          satisfied the trusted score cutoff and model alignment span criteria). An additional 26
          IDO sequences were found in the new sequence database relative to the GOS public sequence
          data freeze after filtering for identical and 1 aa different sequences and presence of
          first and last residues in the final trimmed alignment. Jevtrace (version 3.14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b149">149</xref>] was used to assess alignment
          quality, to remove sequences problematic for alignment, to remove sequence redundancy (at
          the 0-aa and 1-aa difference levels) while allowing for redundant nonoverlapping
          sequences, to trim the alignment to a block of aligned columns, to delete columns with
          more than 50% gaps, and to remove sequences with missing first or last residues. One
          sequence (GenBank ID 72038700) was likely a multidomain protein problematic for alignment
          and was removed manually. This set of procedures produced a block sequence alignment of
          144 sequences and 231 characters. We aligned sequences with MUSCLE (version 3.52) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b134">134</xref>] using default parameters. The final
          alignment was used to reconstruct phylogenies with a series of phylogeny reconstruction
          methods: PHYML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b150">150</xref>], Tree-Puzzle

          Bootstrapping was performed with the protpars program using 1,000 bootstrap replicates,

        <p>The Pfam5000 families used in this study were chosen from among the manually curated
          (Pfam-A) families in from Pfam version 17. We added 2,932 families with a structurally
          characterized representative as of October 27, 2005, to the Pfam5000 in descending order
          by family size, followed by 2,068 additional families without a structurally characterized
          representative, in descending order by family size. Pre-GOS family size was calculated as
          the number of sequences in public-100 that had a match to the Pfam family. Post-GOS family
          size was calculated as the number of sequences in public-100 and GOS-100 that matched each

        <p>For the type II GS family, sequences in GOS and NCBI-nr were searched with a type II GS

        <p>For the RuBisCO family, matching RuBisCO sequences from GOS and NCBI-nr were filtered

        <title>Identification of ORFans in NCBI-nr.</title>
        <p>ORFans are proteins that do not have any recognizable homologs in known protein
          databases. A straightforward way to identify ORFans is through all-against-all sequence
          comparison using relaxed match parameters. However, this is not computationally practical.
          An effective approach is to first remove the non-ORFans that can be easily found, and then
          to identify ORFans from the remaining sequences.</p>
        <p>We identified non-ORFans by clustering the NCBI-nr with CD-HIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b116">116</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b117">117</xref>], an ultrafast sequence clustering program. A multistep iterated clustering
          was performed with a series of decreasing similarity thresholds. NCBI-nr was first
          clustered to NCBI-nr90, where sequences with &gt;90% similarities were grouped.
          NCBI-nr90 was then clustered to NCBI-nr80/70/60/50 and finally NCBI-nr30. After each
          clustering stage, the total number of clusters of NCBI-nr was decreased and non-ORFans
          were identified. A one-step clustering from NCBI-nr directly to NCBI-nr30 can be
          performed. However, the multistep clustering is computationally more efficient.</p>
        <p>At the 30% similarity level, all the NCBI-nr proteins were grouped into 391,833 clusters,
          including 259,571 singleton clusters. The proteins in nonsingleton clusters are by
          definition non-ORFans. However, proteins that remain as singletons are not necessarily
          ORFans, because their similarity to other proteins may not be reported for two reasons:
          (1) significant sequence similarity can be &lt;30%; and (2) in order to prevent a
          cluster from being too diverse, CD-HIT, like all other clustering algorithms, may not add
          a sequence to that cluster even if the similarity between this sequence and a sequence in
          that cluster meet the similarity threshold.</p>
        <p>The 259,571 singletons were compared to NCBI-nr with BLASTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050016-b038">38</xref>] to identify real ORFans from them. The default
          low-complexity filter was enabled in the BLAST comparisons, and similarity threshold in
          the form of an <italic>E-</italic>value was set to 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. In the end, 84,911
          proteins with at least 100 aa are identified as ORFans. About 100,000 short ORFans less
          than 100 aa were removed from this study, because they may not be real proteins.</p>
