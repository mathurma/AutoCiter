</abstract><abstract>
<p>Aberrant protein aggregation is a hallmark of many age-related diseases, yet little is known about whether proteins aggregate with age in a non-disease setting. Using a systematic proteomics approach, we identified several hundred proteins that become more insoluble with age in the multicellular organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. These proteins are predicted to be significantly enriched in Î²-sheets, which promote disease protein aggregation. Strikingly, these insoluble proteins are highly over-represented in aggregates found in human neurodegeneration. We examined several of these proteins in vivo and confirmed their propensity to aggregate with age. Different proteins aggregated in different tissues and cellular compartments. Protein insolubility and aggregation were significantly delayed or even halted by reduced insulin/IGF-1-signaling, which also slows aging. We found a significant overlap between proteins that become insoluble and proteins that influence lifespan and/or polyglutamine-repeat aggregation. Moreover, overexpressing one aggregating protein enhanced polyglutamine-repeat pathology. Together our findings indicate that widespread protein insolubility and aggregation is an inherent part of aging and that it may influence both lifespan and neurodegenerative disease.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, specific proteins escape the cell's quality-control system and associate together, forming insoluble aggregates. Until now, little was known about whether proteins aggregate in a non-disease context. In this study, we discovered that the aging process itself, in the absence of disease, leads to the insolubilization and increased aggregation propensity of several hundred proteins in the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. These aggregation-prone proteins have distinct structural and functional proprieties. We asked if this inherent age-dependent protein aggregation impacts neurodegenerative diseases. We found that proteins similar to those aggregating in old worms have also been identified as minor components of human disease aggregates. In addition, we showed that higher levels of inherent protein aggregation aggravated toxicity in a <italic>C. elegans</italic> Huntington's disease model. Inherent protein aggregation is a new biomarker of aging. Understanding how to modulate it will lead to important insights into the mechanisms that underlie aging and protein aggregation diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The regulation of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) plays an essential role in preventing protein aggregation. As organisms age, the tightly regulated balance of gene expression levels, quality control, and protein disposal is disrupted. For example, cellular systems responsible for protein degradation become less efficient with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Cuervo1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Tonoki1">[2]</xref>. In addition, chaperone levels change in older animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Lund1">[3]</xref>. Aging is also associated with increased oxidative stress, leading to irreversible oxidation and nitration of proteins, which impairs their degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Poon1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Squier1">[5]</xref>. These age-dependent changes in proteostasis are thought to facilitate the aberrant aggregation of specific proteins in the context of neurodegeneration and amyloidoses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Balch1">[6]</xref>. However, it is not clear to what extent this altered cellular environment also leads to protein aggregation during normal aging, in a non-disease context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Morimoto1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although protein aggregation has mainly been associated with disease, a wide variety of proteins have the capacity to aggregate under extreme conditions in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Chiti1">[8]</xref>. Recent evidence suggests that partial unfolding of globular proteins can occur under physiological conditions and is sufficient to lead to protein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Chiti2">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, almost all proteins contain buried self-complementary sequences that could promote the assembly of identical proteins into aggregates if exposed at the protein surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Goldschmidt1">[10]</xref>. The aggregation of recombinant proteins is commonly observed in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-deGroot1">[11]</xref>, and these inclusion bodies consist at least partly of amyloid-like structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Wang1">[12]</xref>. Soluble proteins are found to aggregate in both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and mammalian cells when these cells are challenged by inhibition of the proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kaganovich1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Salomons1">[14]</xref>. The eukaryotic cell has a built-in mechanism to deal with misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins, which becomes activated when the protein disposal system becomes impaired or overwhelmed. This mechanism involves the formation of the aggresome, an inclusion body located at the microtubule-organizing center that actively sequesters insoluble proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kopito1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>The fact that proteostasis mechanisms decline with age suggests that normal cellular proteins might become more prone to aggregation. Furthermore, various proteins have been found to co-aggregate, albeit at low levels, together with major disease-aggregating proteins during age-dependent neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Liao1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Xia1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Wang2">[18]</xref>. However, a systematic evaluation of inherent protein aggregation during normal aging has been lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Morimoto1">[7]</xref>. In this study, we used a global proteomics approach to investigate the extent of age-dependent protein insolubility, a hallmark of protein aggregation, in wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We identified several hundred proteins that became more insoluble with age, and as predicted, almost all of the proteins we tested in vivo formed aggregates. We found that inhibiting the insulin/IGF-1 system, which slows aging, decreased the rate and extent of inherent protein insolubility and aggregation. Intriguingly, a significantly large fraction of RNAi clones that increase lifespan are predicted to target mRNAs encoding aggregation-prone proteins, raising the possibility that decreasing aggregation levels could prolong lifespan.</p>
<p>As misfolded proteins could potentially enhance disease-protein aggregation by disrupting proteostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Gidalevitz1">[19]</xref>, we also asked whether age-dependent inherent protein aggregation would modify the course of aberrant disease-related protein aggregation. We found that increased expression of an aggregation-prone protein aggravated the paralysis caused by polyglutamine repeat aggregation, in spite of the fact that the two proteins did not co-aggregate. Moreover, a large fraction of proteins previously identified in a genome-wide screen for factors that influence polyglutamine repeat aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Nollen1">[20]</xref> consisted of proteins that we identified as insoluble. Especially strikingly was our finding that homologs of 31%â54% of the proteins previously identified in human disease aggregates were identified in our study. These findings reveal, for the first time, the large extent and the nature of age-dependent protein insolubility and aggregation in a non-disease context. Our results suggest that inherent protein aggregation has the potential to influence lifespan and protein aggregation disease.</p>

<title>Proteomic Identification of Detergent-Insoluble Proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>Proteins known to aggregate in disease, such as tau protein and amyloid-Î², remain insoluble in strong-detergent buffers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Lee1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kawarabayashi1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kraemer1">[23]</xref> but can be solubilized by formic acid or urea and analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels. We used similar conditions to look for proteins that might be prone to aggregate during the normal aging process. We observed that a significant fraction of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteome remained insoluble in a strong-detergent buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Many of these insoluble proteins were present at a higher level in old animals, suggesting that aging potentiates the tendency of proteins to become insoluble. Specifically, the mean fold change of proteins that became more insoluble with age in sterile [gonad-less <italic>gon-2(â)</italic>] animals was â¼3.5Â±0.8 (SD). The patterns of bands on the SDS-PAGE gel in the total and insoluble fractions were not the same, indicating that the propensity to become insoluble with age does not affect all proteins equally. Some insoluble protein bands were present at similar levels in young and aged animals, suggesting these include proteins that are not aggregation-prone but rather proteins such as tubulin and cuticular collagen proteins that are functional in an insoluble state. </p>

<p>(A) Total and detergent-insoluble protein staining of <italic>gon-2(â)</italic>/gonad-less extracts using Sypro Ruby. Total protein fraction was diluted 1â¶3 compared to the insoluble fraction. Quantification of insoluble proteins in the red outlined areas revealed a fold change of 3.5Â±0.8 (SD) on average between young and aged animals (two biological and two experimental repeats). (B) Distribution of the fold change shown in logarithm base 2 in levels of insoluble proteins identified in aged animals (when half the population is alive) compared to young animals (Day 3 of adulthood at 25Â°C). Each dot represents the fold change for one insoluble-prone protein. Red bar indicates the mean. The fold changes of proteins that were identified in both independent experiments are shown for each strain in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. These results show that proteins identified in the formic acid soluble fraction have a tendency to accumulate with age. 711 proteins were present in all four samples (defined as having an iTRAQ peak above 25 counts in young and/or in old animals) (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2). Of these, some were excluded from the fold change calculations because their iTRAQ peak was too low (â¤25 counts) in young animals. Fold changes were calculated in Experiment 1 for 698 of 711 insoluble proteins in <italic>fem-1(â)</italic> animals and 670 of 711 insoluble proteins in <italic>gon-2(â)</italic> animals and in Experiment 2 for 692 of 711 insoluble proteins in <italic>fem-1(â)</italic> and 695 of 711 insoluble proteins in <italic>glp-1(â)</italic>. (CâD) Changes in insolubility with age in the two independent biological replicates were strongly correlated.

<p>To determine the identity of the insoluble proteins, we collected young and old animals and adapted a stringent sequential protein solubilization protocol established previously to extract disease-aggregated proteins. Briefly, following removal of dead worms by sucrose separation, we repeatedly removed cytosolic-soluble proteins in high-salt buffer and membrane proteins in a detergent buffer containing both strong anionic and nonionic detergents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The remaining, insoluble, proteins were solubilized with formic acid. Some proteins, such as those associated with the worm cuticle, remained in the pellet. This acid soluble fraction was digested with trypsin, and multidimensional LC-MS/MS was used to identify 1,125 and 856 proteins in two biological replicates. Sixty-four percent of the proteins identified in the insoluble fraction in the first biological experiment were also found in the second experiment, and conversely 85% of the proteins identified in the second experiment were identified in the first experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). This overlap between biological replicates is comparable to previously published proteomic data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Trinidad1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Ruppen1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Murphy1">[26]</xref>. For comparison, if we sampled randomly 1,125 and 856 proteins in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteome (consisting of 7,826 proteins previously detected by mass spectrometry), we would expect to detect at most 123 proteins in both samples (11% and 14%, respectively) by chance. The cumulative hypergeometric probability of detecting 725 or more proteins in both experiments is less than 1E-100. For further analysis, we focused on 711 proteins that were identified in both experiments and passed a stringent set of mass spectrometry related quality-control criteria (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s009">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Protein Insolubility Increases with Age in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>To quantify changes with age in both of the two biological replicates described above, we compared the levels of insoluble proteins extracted from young adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Day 3 of adulthood) to those extracted from an aging population (determined as the time point when half of the population remained alive). To obtain a large synchronized population of aged animals, we used temperature-induced sterility mutants (described below), which were maintained at 25Â°C. The extent of age-dependent insolubility in these strains was quantified by conducting quantitative mass spectrometry using the stable-isotope iTRAQ reagents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Ross1">[27]</xref>, which allowed us to analyze four different samples simultaneously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In each of the two experiments, we analyzed <italic>fem-1(â)</italic> mutants, which are defective in sperm production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Doniach1">[28]</xref>. We found that 691 proteins (Experiment 1) and 710 proteins (Experiment 2) out of the 711 insoluble proteins accumulated by 1.5-fold or more with age. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, we used a logarithm base 2 scale to represent the wide distribution of age-dependent changes in the levels of insoluble forms of the different insoluble-prone proteins. Because <italic>fem-1(â)</italic> mutants accumulate unfertilized oocytes, as do wild-type animals to a lesser extent, we hypothesized that the extent of insolubility could be explained partially by decreased oocyte quality with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Andux1">[29]</xref>. To control for this, we also analyzed changes in insolubility with age in mutant strains lacking oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). For added stringency, we chose to analyze two different strains as biological replicates: the gonad-less mutant <italic>gon-2(â)</italic>, and the germline-deficient mutant <italic>glp-1(â)</italic>. In these two strains without oocytes, we found that 621 proteins (Experiment 1) and 486 proteins (Experiment 2) out of the 711 insoluble proteins present in both samples accumulated by 1.5-fold or more with age. Conversely, the levels of only two insoluble proteins (CSQ-1 and PAT-10) decreased by over 1.5-fold with age in both strains without oocytes. Combining the quantification of both experiments (examining insoluble proteins from animals with and without oocytes), we have found a set of 461 proteins that consistently become 1.5-fold or more insoluble with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s009">Table S1</xref>). We will refer to these 461 proteins as the âage-dependent insolubleâ set. Overall, these results show that the aging process is associated with a large increase in protein insolubility.</p>
<p>To ask whether individual proteins behave in a reproducible fashion between experiments, for each protein, we plotted the fold change in insolubility with age for both biological repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). We found a highly significant correlation between fold changes in insolubility measured by iTRAQ in both replicate analyses of <italic>fem-1(â)</italic> animals (<italic>r</italic>â=â0.8, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). The correlation between fold changes in insolubility in <italic>gon-2(â)</italic> and <italic>glp-1(â)</italic> animals was slightly lower but still very significant (<italic>r</italic>â=â0.6, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). This reproducibility indicates that age-dependent protein insolubility is not a stochastic process, but rather that certain proteins have properties that make them more prone to insolubility with age.</p>
<p>In somatic tissues (assayed using either <italic>gon-2(â)</italic> or <italic>glp-1(â)</italic> animals), we observed a group of 250 insoluble-prone proteins that were not more insoluble with age, which we will refer to as the âage-independent insolubleâ set. Among these, 60 insoluble-prone proteins remained at similar levels with age in both strains. This group contains the majority of the cytoskeleton proteins identified (with the notable exception of intermediate filaments and lamin-1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s010">Table S2</xref>). Some cytoskeletal proteins such as gamma-tubulin have been shown to be present in an insoluble but functional state in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Salas1">[30]</xref>. We note that under specific conditions, tubulin can also assemble irreversibly into non-specific polymers (i.e. aggregates) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Weis1">[31]</xref>. Interestingly, intermediate filaments form cages delimiting the aggresome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Johnston1">[32]</xref> and therefore their accumulation with age may represent an effort to segregate age-related aggregating proteins. By extrapolation, other proteins present in our insoluble set may be functional and yet insoluble. Conversely, we predict that misfolded proteins that assemble together to form aggregates will also be found in our insoluble fraction, as shown for disease aggregated proteins. The tendency of â¼2/3 of the insoluble proteins identified to become more insoluble with age in all strains examined strongly suggests that protein insolubility is facilitated by the aging process. In experiments described below, we found that, when fluorescently tagged, all but one (very small) protein we examined formed insoluble aggregates in the animal. Therefore, we will refer to these insoluble proteins provisionally as aggregation-prone proteins.</p>
<p>Overall, we have identified a reproducible set of several hundred insoluble proteins predicted to include aggregation-prone proteins that become more insoluble with age.</p>

<title>Age-Dependent Aggregation Occurs in Different Tissues</title>
<p>To better understand inherent protein aggregation in vivo, we selected two proteins, RHO-1 and KIN-19, for more detailed analysis. These proteins became 2-fold or more insoluble with age in all the strains as quantified by mass spectrometry. Both proteins are highly conserved in mammals: their mammalian homologs are transforming protein RhoA and casein kinase 1 isoform alpha (CK1Î±). Interestingly, CK1Î± is found tightly associated with pathological intracellular inclusions in Alzheimer's disease that mainly contain tau protein, as well as in sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kuret1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kannanayakal1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our proteomic analysis identified a considerable increase in insolubility with age in strains that contained oocytes. To test whether aggregation occurs in the reproductive tissue, we examined the aggregation-prone protein RHO-1 tagged with GFP under the control of the germline-specific <italic>pie-1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Motegi1">[35]</xref>. In disease models for aberrant protein aggregation, protein aggregation is characterized by the assembly of the misfolded protein into microscopically visible aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Soto1">[36]</xref>. We found that GFP::RHO-1, localized to the oocyte membranes in young adults, accumulated with age in dense patches in the sclerotic oocytes of older animals (Day 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). Another hallmark of protein aggregation is the transition from a soluble to an insoluble state, resulting in reduced mobility of the aggregated protein. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is a standard method for visualizing this transition to a state of aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Brignull1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Iliev1">[38]</xref>. FRAP analysis indicated that GFP::RHO-1 became immobile in these sclerotic structures, consistent with its aggregating with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figure 2D and 2E</xref>). In contrast, GFP::RHO-1 remained mobile in the membranes of the germline stem cells both in young and aged animals (respectively, t<sub>1/2</sub>â=â35 s and t<sub>1/2</sub>â=â17 s). Thus, RHO-1 aggregation is restricted to the oocytes. This finding supports the idea that oocyte-specific aggregation could explain the difference between the relatively high levels of age-dependent insolubility in <italic>fem-1(â)</italic> animals (which contain oocytes) versus the lower levels present in <italic>glp-1(â)</italic> and <italic>gon-2(â)</italic> animals (which do not). Thus, degenerating oocytes in wild-type animals may create a favorable environment for protein aggregation. Consistent with this interpretation, as in wild type, the oocytes acquired a sclerotic appearance in old <italic>fem-1(â)</italic> animals, when viewed with Normarski optics.</p>

In our proteomic analysis, we identified RHO-1 as a protein prone to aggregate with age both in the reproductive and somatic tissues. GFP::RHO-1, expressed in the germline, was localized to germline stem cell (open arrowhead) and oocyte (full arrowhead) membranes in young animals.

<p>To evaluate somatic tissue aggregation, we expressed KIN-19 tagged with the recently developed monomeric fluorescent protein âtagRFPâ using its endogenous promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Merzlyak1">[39]</xref>. We found that this fusion protein was most highly expressed in the pharynx and in a pair of neuronal processes identified by their position as BDU neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). We determined that the level of transgenic KIN-19::tagRFP in the whole animal was similar to that of endogenous KIN-19, as measured by Western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Transgenic animals showed no notable defects and had a lifespan similar to that of wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). With age, we observed the formation of fluorescent-KIN-19 puncta throughout the anterior pharyngeal bulb, indicative of KIN-19 aggregation (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figure 2K</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figure 2F and 2G</xref>). KIN-19::tagRFP puncta were found throughout the cytoplasm in pharyngeal muscle and marginal cells. We evaluated KIN-19::tagRFP puncta formation in the pharynx at different time points throughout life in a population of animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). A small proportion of the population started to accumulate puncta at Day 3 of adulthood, implying a critical threshold for aggregation at this time point. Thereafter, the number of animals displaying pharyngeal KIN-19 puncta increased rapidly until Day 9, when over 80% of the population contained puncta. To test whether the proteins within the KIN-19::tagRFP puncta were immobile, we measured FRAP in defined areas of individual punctae. Even after 270 s, we observed no recovery in fluorescence in the majority of puncta examined, demonstrating that KIN-19::tagRFP could not diffuse back into the bleached area and consistent with a state of aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figure 2L and 2M</xref>). A small proportion of the KIN-19::tagRFP puncta were composed of mobile protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000450-t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, control animals expressing only the tagRFP reporter formed only a few puncta with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figure 2I and 2J</xref>), and all these puncta contained mobile tagRFP as determined by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figure 2M</xref>). We also performed FRAP on two KIN-19::tagRFP punctate-like structures in the base of the pharynx that were always present in Day 1 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). We observed partial recovery of KIN-19::tagRFP fluorescence after photobleaching with a recovery half-life of 107 s in young animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figure 2M</xref>). The relatively slow recovery rate of KIN-19::tagRFP compared to the rapid recovery rate of GFP::RHO-1 fluorescence in young animals suggests that a fraction of KIN-19::tagRFP is already immobile in these animals, consistent with our Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Insoluble but not total levels of four aggregation-prone proteins increased with age.</title>
<p>(A and C) Western blot detection of KIN-19 (CK1Î±), RHO-1, DAF-21 (Hsp90), and PAR-5 (14-3-3) in young and aged animals containing either somatic and germline tissue [<italic>fem-1(â)</italic>, (A)] or containing only somatic tissues [<italic>gon-2(â)</italic>, (C)]. The total fraction (Urea and SDS buffer) contains all proteins and the detergent-insoluble fraction contains aggregation-prone proteins. The total protein fraction was diluted 1â¶3 compared to insoluble fraction. Arrowheads mark the protein bands corresponding to the aggregation-prone candidates. Overall, Western blot analysis confirms our mass spectrometry results demonstrating a large increase in insolubility with age. With age, we noted a slight decrease in the size of full-length DAF-21 (less than 10 kDa). (B and D) Quantification of the fractional increase in aggregated levels compared to total levels of each candidate evaluated by Western blot. These results demonstrate that age-dependent insolubility for each of the four proteins we examined occurs independently of an increase in total protein levels. Extracts from two biologically independent experiments were evaluated. Error bars indicate SEM.</p>

<p>In addition, we measured KIN-19::tagRFP mobility in the BDU neurons, where it was relatively highly (and uniformly) expressed compared to other neurons. We did not observe the formation of distinct KIN-19::tagRFP puncta in these processes in young or in aged animals, but nevertheless FRAP analysis showed that KIN-19::tagRFP becomes immobile in older BDU neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figures 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s004">S4A</xref>). In young animals (Day 3), we found partial recovery after photobleaching at a rate similar to that observed in the young pharynx (t<sub>1/2</sub>â=â151 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figures 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s004">S4B</xref>). The generally low expression levels of KIN-19::tagRFP in other neuronal processes prevented us from conducting sufficient FRAP analysis to determine whether their KIN-19::tagRFP was mobile or not.</p>
<p>Overall, our in vivo data confirm that proteins prone to insolubility with age that were identified by our proteomic analysis have the potential to aggregate in different tissues in an age-dependent manner in the animal.</p>

<title>Age-Dependent Protein Aggregation Is Not Correlated with a Change in Total Protein Levels</title>
<p>The overall increase in aggregation propensity with age could be enhanced by a proportional increase in the total levels of these aggregation-prone proteins. To test this hypothesis, we chose four proteins for which antibodies were available, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of casein kinase I alpha, CK1Î± (KIN-19), Rho1, Hsp90 (DAF-21), and 14-3-3 (PAR-5), and asked whether their levels increased with age. Young and aged animals were solubilized either in Urea/SDS buffer to obtain total protein extracts or sequentially extracted in RIPA followed by Urea/SDS buffer to isolate insoluble proteins in the pellet. Quantification of total protein for each candidate showed that levels remained either constant or decreased slightly with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). We observed the largest change for total DAF-21 levels, which were reduced on average by 1.47-fold with age. [The reduction in DAF-21 levels was correlated with a small shift in molecular weight and the appearance of a cleavage product in the total and RIPA-soluble fraction in the aged population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s005">S5C</xref>)]. Quantification of the insoluble levels relative to total levels of these candidates revealed a significant increase in insolubility with age in animals with and without reproductive tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g003">Figure 3</xref>, Mann Whitney test, <italic>fem-1(â)</italic>, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.003; <italic>gon-2(â)</italic>, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.01). Our results demonstrate that, at least for these four proteins, increased protein levels are not the direct cause of age-dependent protein aggregation. Interestingly, our analysis also showed that only a fraction of the total amount of protein available will become insoluble in aged animals. Averaging our Western blot results for all four candidates examined, we found that 10.4% of the protein available in <italic>gon-2(â)</italic> animals and 35.9% of the protein available in <italic>fem-(â)</italic> animals is insoluble in aged animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that the majority of the pool of aggregation-prone proteins remains detergent-soluble.</p>
<p>Although we did not observe higher total KIN-19 protein levels in the whole animal with age, we found a 1.6-fold up-regulation of <italic>kin-19</italic> promoter-directed expression in the pharynx, as measured by quantification of the transcriptional <italic>Pkin-19::</italic>tagRFP fluorescent reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To exclude the hypothesis that KIN-19 aggregation in the pharynx was caused solely by an increase in the level of KIN-19, we reduced KIN-19::tagRFP levels using RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and asked whether the protein would still aggregate with age. Adult-only <italic>kin-19</italic>-RNAi treatment reduced the levels of KIN-19::tagRFP in 6-day-old adults to a level similar to that measured in 2-day-old controls. Under these conditions, we still observed significantly more KIN-19::tagRFP aggregation in older animals than in young animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>). We confirmed by FRAP that aggregates in 6-day-old <italic>kin-19</italic> RNAi-treated animals were formed by immobile KIN-19::tagRFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). These findings show that preventing protein levels from increasing does not abrogate KIN-19 aggregation.</p>

<title>Protein Insolubility in Young Animals</title>
<p>Whole-protein staining shows that many of the insoluble proteins detected in aged animals are also present in relatively young animals (Day 3 of adulthood at 25Â°C) at a time when no obvious signs of aging are visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Overall, the presence of insoluble proteins in the younger animals, albeit at relatively low levels, suggests that protein aggregation is not limited to mid-life or old animals but already occurring in healthy young animals.

(DâE) The strong mutation <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> prevented KIN-19::tagRFP aggregation in the pharynx. (D) <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic>; <italic>Pkin-19::kin-19::tagrfp</italic> animals had significantly fewer KIN-19::tagRFP puncta in their anterior pharyngeal bulbs than did wild-type animals expressing <italic>Pkin-19::kin-19::tagrfp</italic> (Day 6: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, Day 12: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, Yates' Chi-square test). No further increase in the number of puncta was observed after Day 12 in the <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> background, suggesting that reduced insulin/IGF-1-like signaling somehow caps the process of KIN-19::tagRFP puncta formation. The number of animals is indicated in the bars. (E) KIN-19::tagRFP puncta remained mostly soluble in a <italic>daf</italic>-2 mutant background. FRAP analysis of a KIN-19::tagRFP puncta in the anterior pharyngeal bulb of <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic>; <italic>Pkin-19::kin-19::tagrfp</italic> animal, Day 38 (Laser setting: 10% in 0.8 Âµm<sup>2</sup>). As with this example, most KIN-19::tagRFP puncta present in a <italic>daf</italic>-2 mutant background uniformly lost fluorescence in the whole punta when bleached in a restricted area (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000450-t001">Table 1</xref>). These results suggested that KIN-19::tagRFP does not aggregate in these puncta. Scale bar: 2 Âµm.</p>

<p>The differences between protein insolubility in <italic>daf-2(RNAi)</italic> and control-RNAi animals could potentially have been caused by different levels of total protein available to aggregate. However, we found no change in KIN-19 or PAR-5 total levels and a slight increase in RHO-1 and DAF-21 total levels in aged <italic>daf-2(RNAi)</italic> animals compared to aged control animals (1.4-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that reduced levels of protein insolubility produced by <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi treatment was the result of less total protein. Overall, these results suggest that reduction in insulin/IGF-1 signaling specifically prevents the increase in protein insolubility that normally occurs with age without affecting the pattern of protein insolubility already present (in gel-based detectable amounts) in younger animals.</p>
<p>We also examined the effect of <italic>daf-2</italic> inhibition on protein aggregation in vivo, focusing on KIN-19. A relatively strong <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation, <italic>e1370</italic>, significantly delayed KIN-19::tagRFP puncta formation in the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g002">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g005">5D</xref>). At Day 12, relatively few puncta were present in the long-lived mutants, whereas nearly all of the <italic>daf-2(+)</italic> animals had high levels of puncta. Unexpectedly, reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling protected these animals against the formation of any further puncta after Day 12, even to Day 31, at which time all wild-type animals were dead and the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants were beginning to die. Moreover, the puncta in the <italic>daf-2(â)</italic> mutant tended to contain mobile KIN-19 (even in very old Day 38 animals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g005">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000450-t001">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, FRAP analysis of 12- to 15-d-old animals revealed mobile KIN-19::tagRFP protein in 28 out of 34 puncta examined in the <italic>daf-2(â)</italic> mutant background compared to only 11 out of 36 puncta in the <italic>daf-2(+)</italic> animals (Fisher's exact test <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). These findings imply that the <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> insulin/IGF-1-receptor mutation protects against KIN-19 aggregation not only by slowing the rate of aging but also by preventing the aggregation process itself.</p>
<p>Although inhibition of DAF-2 signaling did not lead to a reduction in total aggregation-prone protein levels, by comparing our list of insoluble proteins to lists of genes identified in microarray analysis of long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants versus slightly short-lived <italic>daf-16</italic>; <italic>daf-2</italic> double mutants (<italic>daf-16</italic> encodes a FOXO-family transcription factor required for the longevity of <italic>daf-2</italic>-pathway mutants) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Shaw1">[47]</xref>, we found that <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutants had relatively low levels of transcripts encoding certain aggregation-prone proteins. In particular, we found that proteins prone to age-dependent insolubility were significantly over-represented among genes down-regulated in <italic>daf-2(â)</italic> mutants and under-represented among genes up-regulated in <italic>daf-2(â)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s011">Table S3</xref>, chi-square test <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0002). Together, our findings suggest that reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling could prevent protein aggregation in two ways: by promoting protein solubility and, for certain proteins, by modulating transcription.</p>

<title>Protein Aggregation Occurs at Diverse Subcellular Localizations</title>
<p>To examine the subcellular localization of inherent protein aggregates, we expressed a selection of candidates in the same cell type, the body-wall muscle cells, using the <italic>myo-3</italic> myosin promoter. <italic>C. elegans</italic> body-wall muscle has been the tissue of choice for the expression of disease-aggregating proteins such as amyloid-Î² and polyglutamine repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Morley1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Link1">[48]</xref> and is relatively easy to visualize without considerable autofluorescence build-up with age. We observed the presence of puncta during development and adulthood of the aggregation-prone candidates KIN-19, arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RRT-1), a ribosomal subunit (RPS-8), and a proteasomal protein (RPT-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g006">Figure 6AâD</xref>). These puncta contained immobile protein, as analyzed by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). We note that both ribosomal proteins and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been shown to have a relatively low mobility when present within the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kaminska1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Chen1">[50]</xref>. However, we observed no recovery 240 s after photobleaching, a time frame that should allow full recovery for a low-mobility protein. It was noteworthy that these proteins all formed insoluble puncta during development when overexpressed in muscle. This finding indicates that these proteins are capable of aggregating in very young animals, at least in this tissue. Similarly, disease-aggregating proteins such as expanded pathological polyglutamine repeats (over 35 polyglutamine repeat expansions) aggregate in the muscle during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Brignull1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Morley1">[42]</xref>. The lack of aggregation of the fluorescent tag alone when over-expressed in the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) suggests that this early aggregation is related to the aggregation propensity of the candidates examined. We also expressed the aggregation-prone protein dynein light-chain 1 (DLC-1) fused to tagRFP in the muscle, but this fusion protein remained soluble. Because DLC-1 is a very small protein (only 10.3 kDa), it is possible that the much larger fluorescent tagRFP (27 kDa) masked the aggregation propensity of this protein.</p>

To obtain sufficient resolution with Normarski, we examined animals either at the last stage of development (L4) or as young adults. Comparison of Normarski and fluorescent photographs show that KIN-19 and RRT-1 formed puncta in the cytoplasm (A and B), whereas RPS-8 and RPT-2 aggregated in the nucleolus (C and D). Control tagRFP expressed alone in the muscle was diffusely localized throughout the muscle cells (E). (F) FRAP assay in puncta formed by the muscle-expressed aggregation-prone candidates demonstrated that these puncta contained immobile protein consistent with a state of aggregation. Muscle tagRFP remained mobile. Five puncta were evaluated in four to five young animals by FRAP for each aggregation-prone candidate.</p>

Therefore, early aggregation in the muscle gave us the opportunity to employ differential-interference contrast microscopy to determine the positions of the puncta in the cell. We observed KIN-19 aggregation throughout the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). RRT-1/tRNA-synthetase was located diffusely throughout the muscle and accumulated in regions adjacent to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) possibly in the proximity of the endoplasmic reticulum or in the aggresome. [We note that several known components of the aggresome, such as intermediate filaments (IFA-1, IFA-3, IFB-2), dynein (DLC-1, DLC-2, DHC-1), and 14-3-3 (PAR-5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-GarciaMata1">[53]</xref> were identified among the proteins prone to aggregate with age.] RPS-8 was present at low levels throughout the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm and accumulated to form a bright mass in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Ribosomal subunits localize to the nucleolus to assemble with rRNA and other subunits to form the mature ribosome. Therefore, aggregation at the nucleolus suggests that ribosomal subunits could be aggregating as FRAP-insoluble pre-ribosomal particles. Finally, we found that the proteasomal 19S protein RPT-2 formed FRAP-insoluble ring-like structures in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Under normal conditions, proteasomes are found in the nucleoplasm and are not localized to the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Scharf1">[54]</xref>. Therefore, their aggregation could lead to their mislocalization to the nucleolus. It is possible that the cellular sites of aggregation differ between young and old animals. However, we observed a very similar pattern of intracellular KIN-19 puncta localization during development (in muscles) and in old animals (in the pharynx), suggesting that aggregation may occur in the same cellular locations in young and old animals.</p>
<p>Overall, our results suggest that inherent protein aggregation is not restrained to a single subcellular localization such as the aggresome but that multiple centers of aggregation exist, potentially affecting different cellular processes.</p>

<title>Muscle KIN-19 Aggravates Paralysis Caused by Polyglutamine Repeats</title>
<p>Expressing disease-associated aggregation-prone proteins such as polyglutamine-repeat proteins in the muscle paralyzes the animal as it ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Morley1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Link2">[55]</xref>. As described above, fluorescent-tagged KIN-19 aggregated abundantly throughout the muscle cells in a similar fashion to polyglutamine repeats or amyloid-Î² <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Morley1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Link3">[56]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Therefore we asked whether these animals would become paralyzed with age. However, we found that the increased levels of KIN-19 aggregation in these animals did not cause paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Therefore it was particularly interesting to test whether KIN-19 aggregation in muscle cells also containing polyglutamine-repeat proteins could enhance polyglutamine-repeat-related pathology. To examine this possibility, we expressed <italic>Pmyo-3::kin-19::tagrfp</italic> in animals expressing 35 polyglutamine repeats (Q35) under the control of the muscle-specific <italic>unc-54</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Morley1">[42]</xref>. Q35 transgenic animals exhibited an age-dependent paralysis beginning on Day 6 of adulthood. As KIN-19 formed aggregates in the muscle before the onset of Q35 aggregation, we asked whether KIN-19 aggregation could act as a seed for Q35 aggregation. However, we found that Q35 and KIN-19 puncta were distinct, so the two proteins clearly did not co-aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g007">Figure 7CâF</xref>). Another possibility was that high levels of aggregation-prone KIN-19 would inhibit the cellular proteostasis systems, thereby increasing the number of Q35 aggregates, as appears to occur when misfolded temperature-sensitive mutant proteins are co-expressed with Q35 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Gidalevitz1">[19]</xref>. We evaluated the numbers of large visible Q35 aggregates in 3-d-old adult Q35 transgenic animals containing KIN-19 aggregates compared to Q35 control animals over-expressing tagRFP alone. Surprisingly, we found a slight, albeit statistically significant, decrease in Q35 aggregates in animals with the aggregation-prone protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s006">Figure S6</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). Despite no large changes in levels of polyglutamine-repeat aggregation, increased levels of KIN-19 aggregation in the muscle caused at least twice as many Q35 transgenic animals to become paralyzed by Day 6 in several trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s012">Table S4</xref>). No significant difference in paralysis was observed at the advanced disease-state 2 days later. Taken together, the data suggest that KIN-19 specifically modulates the initial paralysis threshold in Q35-containing animals. As a consequence, increasing the level of this aggregation-prone protein impacts the pathology caused by disease aggregating polyglutamine-repeats.</p>

<title>Specific Functional Protein Categories Are Prone to Aggregate with Age</title>
<p>In addition to examining the properties of several insoluble-prone proteins in vivo, we looked within the entire set of aggregation-prone proteins for common functional or structural features. Using the NIH-DAVID software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Dennis1">[57]</xref>, we found that many of the proteins present in our insoluble fraction were proteins that are known to function early in life, where they play an important role in embryonic development, growth, translation, and protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000450-t002">Table 2</xref>). These categories could potentially represent proteins aggregating more specifically in the oocytes.

Furthermore, DAVID analysis of SwissProt and PIR terms revealed a significant over-representation of the proteasome (21 proteins, EASE <italic>p</italic>â=â3.8E-10), ribosomal proteins (62 proteins, EASE <italic>p</italic>â=â6.6E-28), and chaperones (17 proteins, EASE <italic>p</italic>â=â3.2E-5), including HSP90/DAF-21, an HSP70 (HSP-1), several small heat shock proteins (HSP-16.11, HSP-16.49, and SIP-1), as well as six chaperonin subunits. These cellular components ensure proteostasis in young animals and thus explain in part the over-representation of growth and translation GO categories among aggregation-prone proteins.</p>

<p>Interestingly, we found an over-representation of the GO âdetermination of adult life spanâ term, suggesting that aggregation-prone proteins tend to play a role in the aging process. If the presence of aggregation-prone proteins is detrimental to the organism, we should also observe an over-representation of these candidates in RNAi screens previously carried out to identify factors whose inhibition increases lifespan. We observed a significant overlap between genes found to prolong lifespan when inhibited after development and genes encoding proteins prone to aggregate with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s014">Table S6</xref>, 11 out of 56 genes, cumulative hypergeometric probability: <italic>p</italic>(Xâ¥11)â=â0.0003) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Curran1">[58]</xref>.

<p>Overall, functional similarities among aggregation-prone proteins, in particular proteins related to proteostasis regulation, show that the process of aggregation is not random.

<title>Aggregation-Prone Proteins Are Distinct in Structure from the Proteome</title>

Conversely, several amino acids were significantly under-representedâin particular, proline, which disrupts secondary structures such as Î²-sheets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). Next, we predicted the secondary structure for each protein using PSIPRED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Jones1">[67]</xref>. We observed a highly significant increase in Î²-sheet content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s007">Figure S7B</xref>) but no difference in Î±-helical content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s007">Figure S7C</xref>) in aggregation-prone proteins relative to the proteome. Additional scanning window analysis showed that aggregation-prone proteins are significantly enriched in long stretches of Î²-sheet propensityâin particular, 20â30 amino acid stretches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000450-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>

<p>To identify any biases in the aggregation-prone proteins toward particular tertiary structures, we assigned fold classifications to each <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein with significant sequence homology to a known structure in the CATH database, which is a comprehensive hierarchical classification of protein domain structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Orengo1">[68]</xref>.

In particular, we found a small enrichment in proteins containing mixed Î±-helix and Î²-sheet folds as well as Î²-barrel folds. Conversely, proteins with orthogonal bundle folds (CATH 1.10), which are Î±-helix rich, were under-represented among aggregation-prone proteins.</p>
<p>Finally, we evaluated whether age-dependent insolubility was linked to a different profile in amino acid composition or predicted secondary structure compared to age-independent insolubility. We found that structural differences identified in the whole insoluble set were conserved in both the age-dependent and age-independent insoluble set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s015">Table S7</xref>). In general, these structural enrichments tended to be slightly less significant in the age-dependent compared to the age-independent insoluble set. In particular, age-dependent insoluble proteins had significantly less glycine compared to age-independent insoluble proteins.</p>
<p>Together, our analysis indicated that protein insolubility and age-dependent aggregation propensity is correlated with an enrichment of specific residues and increased Î²-sheet propensity.</p>

<title>Widespread Protein Insolubility Occurs in a Multicellular Organism</title>
<p>A small number of aberrant aggregating proteins have been associated with disease. Our results demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that several hundred proteins become insoluble during normal aging in the multicellular organism, <italic>C. elegans</italic>. A few of these proteins, such as gamma-tubulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Salas1">[30]</xref>, are known to be functional in the cell in an insoluble state. However, the majority of the proteins that we identified are functional in a soluble state. Therefore, we believe that they are becoming misfolded with age and aggregating. Indeed, studies have shown that many proteins have the potential, when misfolded, to aggregate via self-complementary sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Chiti2">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Goldschmidt1">[10]</xref>. Consistent with this, we observed the aggregation of five out of six fluorescently tagged proteins that we examined in vivo (the exception being a protein that was much smaller than the fluorophore). Conversely, the majority of age-insoluble proteins were maintained as soluble by reducing <italic>daf-2</italic>/insulin/IGF-1 signaling, which also extends lifespan, again arguing against these proteins' being functional in the insoluble state.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Inherent Protein Aggregation Increases with Age</title>
<p>Temperature-sensitive mutant proteins are prone to misfold even in healthy young animals; thus a decline in proteostasis begins at a relatively early age in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-BenZvi1">[40]</xref>. Likewise, we observed large numbers of insoluble protein species in relatively young animals (Day 3 of adulthood at 25Â°C). Quantitative mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis revealed a considerable increase in protein insolubility in older animals. We found that an increase in the overall level of a protein is not necessary to induce age-dependent protein insolubility and aggregation. Future experiments will be required to learn whether age-dependent protein aggregation is caused by increased levels of damage in long-lived proteins over time and/or by a change in the cellular environment.</p>
<p>Our analysis of four candidates suggests that approximately 10% of the aggregation-prone protein available becomes highly insoluble in aged somatic tissues. Our extraction method does not distinguish soluble and membrane-bound proteins from soluble oligomers, which could potentially nucleate the formation of large, insoluble aggregates. Further investigation into the oligomer levels of these proteins will be needed to give a better estimate of the proportion of non-functional aggregation-prone proteins in the cell.</p>

<title>Inherent Protein Aggregation Is Modulated by the Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling Pathway</title>
<p>Reducing insulin/IGF-1 signaling is known to trigger the expression of many cell-protective proteins and processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Murphy2">[69]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Melendez1">[70]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Lee2">[71]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-HenisKorenblit1">[72]</xref> that prevent the collapse of proteostasis. Reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling also improves the paralysis phenotype caused by disease-aggregating proteins such as polyglutamine repeats and amyloid-Î² <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Morley1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Cohen1">[43]</xref>. Suppression of insulin/IGF-1 signaling by RNAi was sufficient to prevent or greatly reduce age-dependent protein insolubility in aged animals at a time point when half the control animals are dead. Life-long and stronger suppression of insulin/IGF-1 signaling changed the nature of the aggregation process, as we found the majority of KIN-19::tagRFP-labeled puncta to contain mobile protein even near the end of these long-lived animals' lives. Interestingly, these results suggest that at least for KIN-19, the puncta could be delimited by a structure such as membrane or intermediate filament network to prevent diffusion of mobile KIN-19 away from the puncta. One intriguing possibility is that conditions that inhibit insulin/IGF-1 signaling stimulate the recruitment of cellular factors to these puncta that maintain physically associated aggregation-prone proteins in a soluble state.</p>
<p>Another possibility to explain the decrease in protein insolubility mediated by reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling is that the transcription of the corresponding genes is down-regulated, thereby reducing the total levels of protein available to aggregate. When grown at 25Â°C, <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutants enter the dauer state during development, which is associated with reduced protein synthesis. However, we showed previously that the global rates of protein synthesis are not reduced in <italic>daf-2</italic>(<italic>e1370</italic>) mutants grown at 20Â°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Hansen2">[60]</xref>, where the animals do not become dauers. <italic>daf-2(RNAi)</italic> animals grown at 25Â°C do not become dauers, thus resembling <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> animals grown at 20Â°C. We did not observe a change in total protein levels detected by Sypro ruby in <italic>daf-2(RNAi)</italic> animals grown at 25Â°C (unpublished data). Moreover, none of the proteins we examined individually by Western blot was present at lower levels in <italic>daf-2(RNAi)</italic> animals than in control animals. Thus mechanisms that do not involve reductions in the levels of specific aggregation-prone proteins levels must influence their aggregation. Nevertheless, it was intriguing to find that <italic>daf-2(â)</italic> mutants preferentially down-regulate the transcription of certain genes encoding proteins prone to insolubility with age. This finding raises the novel possibility that part of the longevity of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants is due to the reduced level of aggregation of certain proteins, rather than simply to the reduced levels of their normal cellular functions. Mechanistically, it would be particularly interesting to investigate whether autophagy, which increases in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, protects against specific protein aggregation, as is the case for Î²-amyloid aggregation in these mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-FlorezMcClure1">[73]</xref>. It will also be interesting to learn whether mutants whose lifespans are extended for other reasons, such as reduced TOR or respiration levels, also have reduced levels of aggregated proteins.</p>

<title>Aggregation-Prone Proteins Regulate Proteostasis and Prevent Disease Protein Aggregation</title>
<p>Interestingly, we found that age-dependent protein insolubility affects a wide variety of systems involved in maintaining proteostasis. We identified major chaperones such as HSP90/DAF-21 and an HSP70 (HSP-1), several small heat shock proteins, and several chaperonin subunits. We also found that a significant fraction of the proteasome subunits are prone to aggregate with age. Chaperones and the proteasome play a major role in preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins and are directly implicated in preventing protein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kaganovich1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Jakob1">[74]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Tam1">[75]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kitamura1">[76]</xref>.</p>
<p>We also identified a significant fraction of ribosomal proteins among our aggregation-prone proteins. Subcellular localization showed that ribosomal proteins aggregate in the nucleolus. This aggregation could potentially reduce the number of mature ribosomes available to perform translation. Indeed, ribosomal protein aggregation caused by reductive stress is associated with decreased protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Rand1">[77]</xref>. In addition, we found an over-representation of mitochondrial proteins, among which were several ATP synthase subunits, although these tended not to become more insoluble with age. The significance of this insolubility is not completely clear. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-David1">[78]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Mattson1">[79]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Hashimoto1">[80]</xref> and maintaining ATP levels has been suggested to protect against Î±-synuclein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Lee3">[81]</xref>. Conversely, inhibiting respiration and ATP synthase activity can have the beneficial effect of extending lifespan.</p>
<p>It remains unclear why so many essential proteins involved in proteostasis become aggregation-prone during the aging process. One possibility is that these proteins aggregate as a consequence of their interaction with misfolded aggregation-prone protein substrates. However, it has been demonstrated previously that chaperones can interact transiently with polyglutamine aggregates without aggregating themselves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kim1">[82]</xref>. Furthermore, the proteasome remains active even if associated with aggregated proteins at the aggresome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Fabunmi1">[83]</xref>.</p>
<p>As multiple aggregation-prone proteins play an important role in maintaining proteostasis, their aggregation could potentiate the aggregation of other proteins, including disease-aggregating proteins. Indeed, subunits of the proteasome, ribosome, and chaperonin were identified among the RNAi clones in a genome-wide screen that were reported to increase polyglutamine aggregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Nollen1">[20]</xref>. In fact, we found 69 of the 156 proteins (44.9%) identified in this RNAi screen and represented in our compiled mass spectrometry proteome were among our set of aggregation-prone proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s016">Table S8</xref>, cumulative hypergeometric probability <italic>p</italic>(Xâ¥69)â0). Forty-six of these proteins were age-dependent aggregation-prone proteins. The overlap between aggregation-prone proteins and suppressors of polyglutamine aggregation supports the notion that inherent age-dependent protein aggregation would impact protein-aggregation disease.</p>

<title>Inherent Protein Aggregation Aggravates the Pathology Caused by Polyglutamine-Repeat Aggregation</title>
<p>In this study, we analyzed the age-dependent aggregation of KIN-19, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of casein kinase (CK)1Î±, which has been identified in tau deposits in both Alzheimer's disease and sIBM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kuret1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Kannanayakal1">[34]</xref>. Our results shed new light on this observation by implying that CK1Î± could itself be aggregating with age in the nervous system and the muscle, as occurs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found that KIN-19 was capable of influencing disease-aggregation protein toxicity even in the absence of any detectable co-aggregation. Specifically, we found that animals co-expressing KIN-19 and Q35 did not have increased Q35 aggregate levels and yet displayed increased paralysis. Why might this be? Many recent studies show that low-MW oligomers formed by disease-misfolded proteins are at least as, if not more, toxic as high-MW, visible, aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Cohen1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Arrasate1">[84]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Walsh1">[85]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Chiti3">[86]</xref>. The presence of aggregation-prone KIN-19 in the muscle could enhance the formation of toxic low MW intermediate species of Q35 in at least two ways: First, misfolded KIN-19 could sequester chaperones and/or impair the degradation system. Second, misfolded aggregation-prone KIN-19 could overload a system that favors aggregate formation, such as the aggresome, or it could sequester a pro-aggregation factor. Both possibilities would result in more toxic low-MW oligomers, causing enhanced paralysis. Finally, KIN-19 could influence Q35 paralysis through its enzymatic function as a protein kinase. However, over-expression of KIN-19 in the muscle did not cause increased paralysis, indicating that it is not toxic in otherwise normal animals. Moreover, in mammalian cells, CK1Î±/KIN-19 promotes cellular survival and enhances the response to certain stressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Xu1">[87]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Beyaert1">[88]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Zhao1">[89]</xref>. Therefore, factors associated with KIN-19 aggregation may be more relevant in this situation, especially as the property of aggregation is prominent and shared between KIN-19 and Q35.</p>

<title>Aggregation-Prone Proteins Tend to Modulate Lifespan</title>
<p>In principle, increased protein aggregation with age could have a beneficial effect by sequestering damaged proteins and toxic low-MW oligomers. Alternatively, they could contribute to the aging process by reducing the cell's capacity for proteostasis, triggering a vicious cycle that leads to further protein misfolding and aggregation. Intriguingly, we found a highly significant overlap between our aggregation-prone proteins and proteins whose reduction increases lifespan. These included (but were not restricted to) proteins involved in translation and mitochondrial respiration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Curran1">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Hansen1">[59]</xref>.

<title>Structural Characteristics of Aggregation-Prone Proteins</title>
<p>Disease-related protein aggregation is characterized by amyloid fibrils consisting of a cross-Î² structure formed by the association of identical proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Chiti3">[86]</xref>. Hydrophobic residues and Î²-sheets are known to be critical determinants of amyloid formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Chiti3">[86]</xref>, and both were over-represented in the insoluble proteins identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The over-representation of the hydrophobic residue valine could in part explain the increased levels of predicted Î²-sheets in these proteins. In addition, we found a highly significant under-representation of prolines in aggregation-prone proteins. Proline functions as an important structural modulator by disrupting secondary structures such as Î²-sheet strands. Therefore the longer stretches of Î²-sheets observed in aggregation-prone proteins could in part be the result of fewer prolines in the primary sequence. Although we cannot conclude whether inherently aggregated proteins are in an amorphous or structured aggregated form, our results are compatible with the idea that some aggregation-prone proteins may transition into an amyloid state. Indeed, these extended Î²-sheets could promote protofibrils that then could nucleate to form amyloid aggregates. Furthermore, for one of the candidates we examined on Western blots, DAF-21, we detected the presence of urea-insoluble material, indicative of a highly structured aggregate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s005">Figure S5C</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent study showed that self-complementary sequences with high aggregation propensity are enriched in valine, alanine, isoleucine, and serine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Goldschmidt1">[10]</xref>. In addition, short sequences of six to eight residues have been shown to promote fibril formation in disease-aggregating proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Teng1">[90]</xref>, some of which are enriched in glycine, alanine, and valine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Du1">[91]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Lansbury1">[92]</xref>. Therefore, the overrepresentation of glycine, alanine, and valine residues in our insoluble protein set could promote their aggregation.</p>
<p>We note that the structural features that distinguish aggregation-prone proteins from other proteins were overrepresented in both age-dependent and age-independent insoluble proteins identified in somatic tissues. Because nearly all insoluble proteins became more insoluble with age in animals with oocytes, it is possible that all these proteins are prone to misfolding and aggregation with age. Therefore it would not be unexpected to find similar structural features. However it is also possible that age-dependent aggregation propensity can be explained by a structural or other characteristic yet to be discovered.</p>

<title>Aggregation-Prone Proteins Identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic> Are Overrepresented in Human Disease Aggregates</title>
<p>An important question is whether age-related protein aggregation is an evolutionarily conserved process that also occurs in higher organisms and, if so, to what extent inherent protein aggregation can influence diseases related to aggregation. In the context of disease, aggregates are mainly composed of hallmark proteins such as Î²-amyloid, tau protein, huntingtin, and Î±-synuclein. However, mass spectrometry analysis of amyloid structures from neurodegenerated human brain tissue has shown that other proteins are present at lower amounts in these aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Liao1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Xia1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Wang2">[18]</xref>.

Similarly, we observed that homologs of 11 out of 35 proteins discovered in Lewy bodies from patients with a Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease were aggregation-prone in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<italic>p</italic>(Xâ¥11)â=â0.0002) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000450.s019">Table S11</xref>). In addition, detergent-insoluble proteins enriched in a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) showed striking overlap with <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins with a propensity for insolubility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Basso1">[93]</xref>.

These results raise the possibility that inherent protein aggregation might directly influence the aggregation and pathology of the main disease-aggregating proteins in humans.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, we have found that several hundred proteins, many of which are associated with cell growth, become aggregation-prone in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as it ages. Our findings suggest that the aging process itself can be a causative factor for protein aggregation and that reducing the rate of aging can prevent aggregation. Our results open a new field of research into the role of inherent protein aggregation in normal aging and in disease-related aggregation. Further investigation into the factors influencing the cell's normal protein-aggregation landscape will be important to understand the process of inherent protein aggregation and could lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for disease intervention. In addition, levels of inherent protein aggregation could be used as a new biomarker to evaluate the changes in proteostasis with age or in disease conditions.</p>

<title>Sequential extraction for proteomic analysis</title>
<p>The entire extraction procedure was carried out on ice and centrifugation steps were at 4Â°C. Because of losses during grinding, we choose to normalize by sample weight. If the young and old worms are the same size, then this does not cause any distortion. However, the older worms are very slightly smaller (see below) and assuming that they have not lost insoluble protein during the shrinkage (rather, for example, water or fat), then our estimation of the increase in insolubility with age is slightly higher than it should be. Indeed, measurements of length and width (at vulva) of Day 3 young adults compared to aged adults show that the width of the animal does not change with age, but the length decreases very slightly. <italic>gon-2(â)</italic>: aged adult lengthâ=â94.5%Â±6.9% of young adult length (Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>â=â0.04), widthâ=â101.5%Â±12.9% of young adult width (Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>â=â<italic>ns</italic>), <italic>n</italic>â=â15; <italic>glp-1(â)</italic>: aged adult lengthâ=â91.2%Â±6.8% (Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>â=â0.002), widthâ=â103.8%Â±9.9% (Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>â=â<italic>ns</italic>), <italic>n</italic>â=â15; <italic>fem-1(â)</italic>: aged adult lengthâ=â87.5%Â±5% (mean Â± SD) (Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), widthâ=â95%Â±13% (Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>â=â<italic>ns</italic>), <italic>n</italic>â=â15. 300 mg of young or aged animals were solubilized in two volumes of RAB (0.1 M MES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.75 M NaCl, 0.02 M NaF) with Roche Complete Inhibitors 2Ã, DNaseI and RNaseI, and extracted using a syringe (27G1/2, Becton-Dickinson, Fischer scientific, Cincinnati, OH, USA). Cytosolic soluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 g. The pellet was reextracted in RAB with 1 M sucrose to help remove lipids. The resulting pellet was extracted in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% SDO, 1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, Roche Complete Inhibitors 1Ã) three times using a syringe and centrifuged each time at 20,000 g to remove membrane proteins. This final pellet was solubilized in 70% formic acid and centrifuged at 50,000 g to remove worm cuticlar debris.

<p>For the total protein fraction, we solubilized 50 mg of the frozen animals from the sucrose separation directly into 225 Âµl 8 M Urea, 2% SDS, 50 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4. Levels of specific aggregating candidates were analyzed using the NuPAGE invitrogen gel system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 4%â12% gradient gels. We chose six candidates for which antibodies were available and we detected bands of the appropriate size for the antibodies against 14-3-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), RHO-1 (gift from Asako Sugimoto), HSP90 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and casein kinase I-Î± (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). Absolute intensity of each band was quantified using Photoshop (Adobe Photoshop CS) by subtracting the mean intensity from the background intensity and multiplied by the total pixels. Total protein levels were detected on the PVDF membrane, after transfer, by Sypro Ruby blot staining (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence was detected using a Typhoon 9400 imager (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and quantified using Photoshop. To account for any differences in protein loading, we normalized the total levels of each protein detected by Western blot with whole lane protein levels measured by Sypro Ruby. As the overall levels of RIPA-insoluble proteins changed with age, we chose to normalize to four bands at â¼45, 90â95, and 200 kDa visible by Sypro Ruby that remained relatively constant with age. To estimate the fractional change in insolubility with age, we quantified the levels of protein in the insoluble fraction and divided this by the total protein levels for each candidate detected by Western blot, accounting for differences in extraction volumes and in quantities loaded on each gel. To determine the overall fold change with age in insoluble protein levels in <italic>gon-2(â)</italic> mutants subjected to control RNAi or <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi, we quantified the Sypro Ruby staining between â¼45 and 80 kDa and below â¼45 kDa.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were visualized using Analyst QS software (version 1.1), and MS/MS centroid peak lists were generated using the Mascot.dll script (version 1.6b18). The MS/MS spectra were searched against the entire UniprotKB <italic>C. elegans</italic> database release 15.9 (downloaded 2009.10.13) using Protein Prospector v.5.3.2. Initial peptide tolerances in MS and MS/MS modes were 200 ppm and 0.2 daltons, respectively. Two missed cleavages were allowed for trypsin digestion. Carbamidomethylation and iTRAQ labeling of lysine residues were searched as fixed modifications. The peptide amino termini were fixed as either iTRAQ-modified or protein N-terminal acetylated. We allowed the following variable modifications: methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation, N-terminal acetylation and oxidation, N-terminal pyro-glutamate, and N-terminal methionine loss with or without acetylation. Other than N-terminal or methionine oxidation, we did not search specifically for oxidation of other amino acids, glycation, or nitrosylation. Therefore it is possible that we are missing some damaged peptides in our analysis, but the detection of the non-modified peptide as well as other peptides from the same protein should allow us to identify the majority of potentially damaged proteins. All high scoring peptide matches (expectation value&lt;0.01) from individual LC-MS/MS runs were then used to internally recalibrate MS parent ion <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values within that run. Recalibrated data files were then searched with a peptide tolerance in MS mode of 50 ppm. For each peptide MS/MS spectra, the raw area of the peaks at m/z 114.1, 115.1, 116.1, and 117.1 (Â±0.1 m/z) was determined by Protein Prospector from the raw data files. We kept only peptides that had at least one iTRAQ peak area over 25 counts. We performed a stringent quality control of the proteomic data by eliminating all proteins identified by one single peptide with an expectation value higher than 1E-3. For proteins identified by two or more peptides, we discarded peptides with an expectation value higher than 1E-2. The false positive rates were estimated by conducting the search using a concatenated database containing the original UniProt database as well as a version of each original entry where the sequence has been randomized. Using this stringent cut-off, we did not identify any proteins in the decoy-randomized database. For our list of aggregation-prone proteins, we kept only proteins identified in both experiments. In this list, we examined the MS/MS spectra manually for every protein quantified by a single iTRAQ-labeled peptide. Of these 38 proteins, 14 were discarded either because of poor quality spectra or due to the presence of a peptide other than the one of interest that was fragmented simultaneously. To determine the relative level of each protein in young or aged animals, we averaged the ratio of (peak area in young)/(peak area in young+peak area in aged) and, respectively, the ratio of (peak area in aged)/(peak area in young+peak area in aged) for all peptides identified for each protein. To measure the fold change in levels of aggregation-prone proteins with age, we divided the ratio for aged-animal proteins by the ratio for young-animal proteins.</p>

Statistical significance was determined as a difference greater than 0.3%, * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 between amino acid composition in the insoluble set versus the proteome. Alanine (A), glycine (G), and valine (V) were significantly over-represented (unequal variance <italic>t</italic> test: A, <italic>p</italic>â=â2.4E-26; G, <italic>p</italic>â=â1.7E-26 and V, <italic>p</italic>â=â1.9E-18) and cysteine (C), phenylalanine (F), methionine (M), asparagine (N), proline (P), and serine (S) were significantly under-represented in the aggregation-prone set (unequal variance <italic>t</italic> test: C, <italic>p</italic>â=â1.8E-11; F, <italic>p</italic>â=â8.7E-7; M, <italic>p</italic>â=â5.4E-15; N, <italic>p</italic>â=â5.8E-9; P, <italic>p</italic>â=â1.3E-8, and S, <italic>p</italic>â=â1.6E-26). (B) We found a significant increase in predicted Î²-sheets content in aggregation-prone proteins (unequal variance <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic>â=â6.2E-6). We note that the difference in Î²-sheets content is distributed throughout the range, suggesting that this enrichment is not caused by a small class of proteins. (C) We found no significant difference in levels of Î±-helical content (unequal variance <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.35). (D) Our aggregation-prone protein set was enriched in proteins with mixed Î±-helix and Î²-sheet folds (in particular 3.40 and 3.50 CATH folds) and proteins with Î²-sheet folds (in particular 2.40 CATH fold) but contains fewer proteins with Î±-helix rich (in particular 1.10 CATH folds). The number of proteins per fold observed in the aggregation-prone protein set and the respective number of proteins expected in the proteome are shown (only folds identified in at least 12 proteins are displayed). Significance was evaluated by chi-test comparing all folds identified in the aggregation-prone protein set to expected numbers in the proteome: <italic>p</italic>â=â1.9E-5.</p>

(#): Between the times we performed experiments 3 and 6, we carried out two experiments that showed no difference in paralysis between the experimental and control animals. We noted that the paralysis in the control animals was higher than average, which could explain why we saw no difference. However it remains unclear which experimental variable could account for these results. Furthermore, variability in the phenotype of polyglutamine-repeat transgenics has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000450-Gidalevitz1">[19]</xref>.</p>
