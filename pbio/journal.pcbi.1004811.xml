<abstract>
<p>Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) catalyzes the first committed step in the diaminopimelate pathway of bacteria, yielding amino acids required for cell wall and protein biosyntheses. The essentiality of the enzyme to bacteria, coupled with its absence in humans, validates DHDPS as an antibacterial drug target. Conventional drug design efforts have thus far been unsuccessful in identifying potent DHDPS inhibitors. Here, we make use of contemporary molecular dynamics simulation and Markov state models to explore the interactions between DHDPS from the human pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and its cognate substrate, pyruvate. Our simulations recover the crystallographic DHDPS-pyruvate complex without <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the final bound structure. The highly conserved residue Arg140 was found to have a pivotal role in coordinating the entry of pyruvate into the active site from bulk solvent, consistent with previous kinetic reports, indicating an indirect role for the residue in DHDPS catalysis. A metastable binding intermediate characterized by multiple points of intermolecular interaction between pyruvate and key DHDPS residue Arg140 was found to be a highly conserved feature of the binding trajectory when comparing alternative binding pathways. By means of umbrella sampling we show that these binding intermediates are thermodynamically metastable, consistent with both the available experimental data and the substrate binding model presented in this study. Our results provide insight into an important enzyme-substrate interaction in atomistic detail that offers the potential to be exploited for the discovery of more effective DHDPS inhibitors and, in a broader sense, dynamic protein-drug interactions.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Interactions between proteins and ligands underpin many important biological processes, such as binding of substrates to their cognate enzymes in the process of catalysis. These interactions are complex, often requiring several intermediate steps to fully transition into the bound state. Here, we have used computational simulation to study binding of pyruvate to Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), an enzyme in the bacterial diaminopimelate pathway. In bacteria, such as the human pathogen <italic>S. aureus</italic>, DHDPS functions to make building blocks necessary for protein and bacterial cell wall biosyntheses. As the enzyme is absent in humans, yet essential for bacterial growth, DHDPS is a valid target for broad-range antibiotics. However, known DHDPS inhibitors show poor potency. One avenue that has not yet been taken into consideration for inhibitor design is the dynamics of DHDPS’s interaction with its reaction substrates (e.g. pyruvate). Using molecular dynamics simulation, we find that pyruvate binding to DHDPS must pass through a transition intermediate ‘hotspot’ in which the substrate is held in place by a dense network of noncovalent bonds. Given that many of the protein residues involved in this interaction are also shared by DHDPS from many pathogenic bacteria, this binding intermediate ‘hotspot’ may help in development of better broad-range DHDPS inhibitors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) catalyzes the first and committed step in the diaminopimelate (DAP) biosynthesis pathway of bacteria and plants, namely the condensation of pyruvate and (<italic>S</italic>)-aspartate-<italic>β</italic>-semialdehyde (ASA) to (4<italic>S</italic>)-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(2<italic>S</italic>)-dipicolinic acid (HTPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref004">4</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). (4<italic>S</italic>)-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(2<italic>S</italic>)-dipicolinic acid (HTPA) is then converted via a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions to yield <italic>meso</italic>-diaminopimelate (<italic>meso</italic>-DAP) and (<italic>S</italic>)-lysine, which are important metabolites for cell wall and protein biosyntheses. Gene knock-out studies demonstrate that <italic>dapA</italic>, which encodes dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), is an essential gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref009">9</xref>]. Given its essentiality to bacteria and plants, but absence in humans, DHDPS has gained considerable traction as a promising target for both antimicrobial drugs and herbicides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref011">11</xref>]. Despite sustained interest in DHDPS, potent inhibitors of the enzyme have not yet been realized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref011">11</xref>]. The most effective inhibitors discovered to date are predominantly derived by analogy to HTPA, which nonetheless show poor (low millimolar) inhibitory potency. There is thus a need to consider other factors in the rational design of DHDPS inhibitors. One such factor is the dynamics of the DHDPS-substrate interaction. Herein, we explore this phenomenon with a view to providing insight into the design of more effective DHDPS inhibitors.</p>

<p>Functionally, DHDPS exists as a homo-oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref012">12</xref>]. Two DHDPS monomers self-associate to form a ‘tight-dimer’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref012">12</xref>], with the articulating surface between monomers capturing a significant proportion (10–13%) of the total subunit surface area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref012">12</xref>]. Dimerization of DHDPS is crucial to enzyme function since monomeric DHDPS mutants demonstrate attenuated enzyme activity and decreased substrate binding affinity, particularly for pyruvate, which is the first substrate to bind DHDPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref015">15</xref>]. Each DHDPS monomer adopts a classical TIM-barrel fold that encloses a 30 Å-long cavity where the enzyme active site is encapsulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref017">17</xref>]. Several key catalytic residues have been identified using X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref019">19</xref>]. A catalytic triad of two tyrosines (Tyr109, Tyr135, <italic>S. aureus</italic> numbering) and a threonine (Thr46, <italic>S. aureus</italic> numbering) function as a proton relay during catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref020">20</xref>]. Dimerization of DHDPS allows for Tyr109 to interdigitate across the dimer interface, completing the catalytic triad of the adjacent monomeric unit and concomitantly creating two equivalent active sites per DHDPS dimer. Another residue, Lys163 (<italic>S. aureus</italic> numbering), forms a Schiff-base with pyruvate during catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref018">18</xref>]. These residues are virtually indispensable for enzyme function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref022">22</xref>]. Crossing the lip of the active site cavity is the solvent-exposed residue Arg140 (<italic>S. aureus</italic> numbering), which has been implicated in the role of stabilizing the catalytic triad and presumably binding of substrates, particularly ASA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref023">23</xref>]. However the precise mechanism of Arg140’s role in DHDPS remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has emerged as a useful tool for gaining insight into various biological phenomena, such as enzyme allostery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref024">24</xref>], protein dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref025">25</xref>], and binding of small molecules to their cognate protein receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref028">28</xref>]. Multiple independent simulations can be performed that follow the unbiased motion of ligands in and around the binding site, allowing for identification of various factors that contribute to the interaction, such as residue bonding networks and protein conformational change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref026">26</xref>]. Large ensembles of trajectories from such simulations can be pooled and clustered into microstates based on criteria such as root-mean square deviation (RMSD). The statistics of transitions between microstates across the trajectory ensemble can then be used to create a Markov state model (MSM) that captures the essential dynamics of the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref030">30</xref>]. These models can capture the kinetics of binding events and allow for thermodynamic quantities to be calculated.</p>
<p>In this work, we present a detailed description of the binding dynamics of the substrate pyruvate and of the enzyme DHDPS. We use all-atom MD simulations to completely recapitulate the entire pyruvate binding process from bulk solvent to the crystallographic bound pose. By means of MSMs, we find that there are several key and metastable intermediates in this pathway defined as ‘hotspots’. Addressing the results from this study, the long-term goal of this project is to design DHDPS inhibitors that incorporate the targeting of this binding intermediate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To date, approximately 80 structures of DHDPS have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/" xlink:type="simple">www.rcsb.org/pdb/</ext-link>). Several of these structures have been co-crystallized with ligands including the first substrate to bind in the active site: pyruvate. However, comparison of the apo (i.e. unliganded) and pyruvate-bound structures provides only start and end points for understanding ligand binding, leaving a void of structural information defining the binding dynamics of pyruvate to the active site of DHDPS. To build a complete picture of substrate binding, a dynamic approach is required. Accordingly, we have employed all-atom MD simulation to describe the binding dynamics of DHDPS towards its first substrate, pyruvate, with a view to bridging this gap.</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Starting Structure</title>
<p>The choice of starting structure is an important decision in any MD simulation study. We employed the structure of DHDPS from the bacterium <italic>S. aureus</italic> (PDB ID 3DAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref012">12</xref>]. The rationale for selecting <italic>S. aureus</italic> DHDPS as the subject of this study was made on the basis of two considerations. Firstly, it adopts a non-canonical dimeric assembly that is in contrast to tetrameric orthologs from the majority of other plant and bacterial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref032">32</xref>]. This provides a considerable cost-saving in computational time (i.e. approximately two-fold reduction in the number of protein non-hydrogen atoms required). Secondly, DHDPS from <italic>S. aureus</italic> has been well-characterized structurally, providing both pyruvate-bound and apo structures as reference points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref033">33</xref>]. The availability of these structures provides both start and end configurations of DHDPS against which we can make direct comparisons with our own computational results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>MD Simulations of DHDPS and Pyruvate</title>
<p>We investigated pyruvate binding to DHDPS using all-atom MD simulation. The process of ligand binding to an enzyme active site must inherently be dynamic, requiring small-scale (e.g. residue side chain motion) and potentially large-scale receptor motions (e.g. conformational dynamics). Sampling the entirety of these motions within a single extended trajectory is both impractical and computationally inefficient. Thus, to broaden our coverage of the conformational landscape of DHDPS we generated an ensemble of different DHDPS configurations by sampling from a 100 ns MD simulation. Each of these configurations were used as starting points for new rounds of minimization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Binding of Pyruvate</title>
<p>For each of our systems we simulated DHDPS with two molecules of the substrate pyruvate. We placed each of these ligands at locations distal to the crystallographic binding site (i.e. the DHDPS active site) using a randomized placement protocol (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Methods</xref> for details). This step was included to alleviate imposing a bias on the binding pathway. We first conducted pilot MD simulations of the system and observed evidence of pyruvate binding into the DHDPS active within 10–100 ns. Thus we extended the simulation data set by performing 80 MD simulations ranging between 10 ns and 100 ns for a total simulation time of 8.4 <italic>μ</italic>s per molecule of pyruvate, yielding a mean simulation length of 52.4 ns (± 30 ns).</p>
<p>Many of our simulations capture ligand binding events. We track binding by calculating the root-mean square deviation (RMSD) of pyruvate heavy atoms (i.e non-hydrogen atoms) against a reference structure of pyruvate in complex with DHDPS (PDB ID 3DI1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref033">33</xref>], correcting first for translational and rotational protein motions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In 5 of our simulations the RMSD converges upon a value of less than 2.3 Å(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In some simulations this is achieved after as little as 12 ns of simulation time. Transitions from this converged position are rare (i.e. the vast majority of simulations remain in this state for the remainder of the simulation). Some simulations show remarkable agreement with the reference structure, achieving conformations that deviate by as little as 1.85 Å. These findings suggest that our simulations are able to recover the crystallographic ‘bound pose’ with reasonable resolution in the absence of <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the binding trajectory.</p>

<p>Furthermore, our MD simulations identify several pyruvate interaction ‘hotspots’ (assessed by spatial residence of pyruvate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Mapping out the regions of high pyruvate density (‘hotspots’) relative to DHDPS, we find that many of these appear spatially proximal to key active site residues such as Thr46, Tyr109, Tyr135, Arg140, and Lys163 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Similar clustering patterns are observed when comparing other 2-dimensional planes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s002">S1 Fig</xref>).

<title>Markov State Model</title>
<p>We submitted our MD simulation data to more exhaustive analysis of pyruvate binding kinetics by building a MSM. The first step in this process involved assigning structurally-related pyruvate conformations into clusters. In brief, we found that partitioning our simulation data set (over 5.5 million conformations) into 738 clusters provided sufficient resolution for the resulting model, with the mean cluster radius calculated as 2.6 ± 0.4 Å. By measuring the time-dependence of relaxation time-scales in our model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s003">S2 Fig</xref>), we found that the Markov property was satisfied using lag times at and beyond 3 ns. Thus, we built an initial fine-grained MSM using a lag time of 4 ns. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s004">S3 Fig</xref> shows that the states comprising this fine-grained model are densely interconnected.</p>
<p>Such fine-grained models, while a resource of quantitative information, suffer from a high degree of complexity that makes analysis difficult. With this in mind, and with a view to providing a more readily-interpretable representation of our model, we grouped states from our fine-grained model into a series of long-lived and metastable states (S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We used a Bayesian approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref034">34</xref>] to assign kinetically-related states into a metastable MSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The resulting metastable MSM identifies 17 states (S0–S16), each describing components of the pyruvate binding pathway. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g003">Fig 3C</xref> we make use of a network diagram to show the most highly populated of these states (i.e. those with equilibrium probabilities in excess of 4%). These states correspond to S2, S6, S7, S9, S10, S12, S13, and S14.

<p>The starting point for pyruvate binding in the coarse-grained model is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref> as two states: S2 and S6. These represent unbound states of pyruvate, given that ligand conformations within S2 and S6 are distal to the active site and lack any substantial points of interaction with DHDPS residues. We next evaluated the relevance of other metastable states in our model (S0–S1, S3–S5, and S7–S17) to pyruvate binding by making comparisons with available experimental data, using structural similarity to the pyruvate-bound DHDPS crystal structure (PDB ID 3DI1). For this we used two measures: (i) the average RMSD of pyruvate heavy atoms relative to key active site residues, and (ii) intermolecular bonding patterns between protein and ligand. Under these conditions we find that S13 best captures the bound pose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), since this state demonstrates the best agreement with the pyruvate-bound enzyme structure (RMSD 3.69 ± 0.72 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Moreover, S13 includes the formation of a hydrogen bond network with key active site residues, namely Thr46, Tyr109, and Tyr135, in a remarkably similar geometry to the X-ray structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref033">33</xref>].

<title>Pyruvate Binding Pathways</title>
<p>From our metastable MSM we made use of transition path theory (TPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref036">36</xref>] to investigate pathways of pyruvate binding. The output of such analyses is a collection of paths that describe the routes by which the system can unidirectionally traverse from unbound states, S2 and S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>), to the bound state S13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>), which are then ranked according to reactive flux. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s005">S4 Fig</xref> we show that the top six pathways capture almost three quarters of the total binding flux.</p>
<p>We first examine the dominant binding pathway, comprising four transitions. We label each of these transitions sequentially from T1 to T4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In the first transition (T1) pyruvate partitions from bulk solvent (S6) to an interacting surface of DHDPS (S7). Here, pyruvate is stabilized by the establishment of a salt bridge between the carboxylate moiety of pyruvate and the guanidinium group of the solvent-exposed Arg140 residue of DHDPS. In the second transition (T2), the side chain of the interacting Arg140 demonstrates a high degree of flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Specifically, Arg140 flips away from the bulk solvent towards the active site cavity, carrying pyruvate deeper into the entryway of the active site (S12). The carboxylate-guanidinium salt bridge between pyruvate and Arg140 is sacrificed in the third transition step (T3) as pyruvate migrates further into the active site cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The loss of this interaction with Arg140 in the penultimate step is balanced by the establishment of a new hydrogen bond network with several active site residues such as Thr46, Tyr135, and Lys163, allowing the substrate to enter into a ‘pre-bound’ pose (S9). It is from this ‘pre-bound’ pose that pyruvate undergoes a twisting and flipping motion (T4) to assume the pyruvate-DHDPS complex, or bound pose (S13)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref033">33</xref>].</p>

<title>The major pyruvate-binding pathway is multi-step.</title>
<p>(A) Pyruvate, indicated using green carbon atoms, must successively pass through several binding intermediates to reach the crystallographic bound pose. From bulk solvent, pyruvate forms a transient interaction with an arginine residue at the entryway to the active site (T1), moves into the active site cavity (T2), and in the penultimate step penetrates deeper into the active site to assume a ‘pre-bound’ pose (T3). Finally, from the ‘pre-bound’ pose pyruvate undergoes a twisting motion (T4) and achieves the crystallographic DHDPS-pyruvate complex. (B) Multiple sequence alignment of bacterial DHDPS enzymes. Several interacting residues from the binding pathway depicted in (A) are absolutely conserved across species.

<p>Alternative pathways show noteworthy deviations from the dominant pathway shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. Many of these alternative paths allow for pyruvate to transition to the bound state whilst boycotting the ‘pre-bound’ intermediate S9, suggesting that this may not be an essential requirement for pyruvate binding. Likewise some of the highest flux pathways boycott the binding intermediate S12. Other paths allow for greater flexibility at the entryway to the active site, instead relying on transient non-covalent interactions with other residues proximal to the active site (e.g. Ile248). Compellingly however, the six highest flux pathways have a strict requirement for the formation of the pyruvate-Arg140 salt bridge intermediate (S7), suggesting the S7-intermediate is a highly-favorable event towards pyruvate binding. Consistent with these findings, an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DHDPS mutant incorporating alanine at the equivalent position of Arg140 demonstrates ~1000-fold reduced enzyme activity and decreased affinity for substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref023">23</xref>]. This may be expected, given the absolute conservation of Arg140, and other key catalytic residues (Thr46, Tyr109, Tyr135, Lys163) in bacterial DHDPS sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Umbrella Sampling</title>
<p>Umbrella sampling was used to determine the relative free energies of metastable binding states using a simple one-dimensional coordinate along the axis of the pyruvate binding pathway (depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). This coordinate was mostly sampled in windows of 1 Å, while windows centered on 8, 9, 14 and 19 Å experienced unacceptably long de-correlation times (≈1 ns). Thus, these windows required a finer sampling of 0.5 Å with a greater biasing force to reduce this the de-correlation time to no greater than 200 ps. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows that 5 ns of simulation time for each window was sufficient to converge a potential of mean force (PMF) curve along this coordinate. Error estimates, de-correlation times, and force constants for each window are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s010">S1 Table</xref> for reference, and histograms shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s007">S6 Fig</xref>. The PMF profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows that the local energy minimum corresponding to S10 has an associated free energy difference of (-0.5 ± 0.2 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>), while a similar energy minimum is observed for the <italic>Z</italic>-coordinate equivalent to S7 (-0.2 ± 0.2 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) which, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows, is en route to the binding intermediate S12 (-3.0 ± 0.2 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>). S12 presents as a relatively higher-energy intermediate between states S4 (-8.6 ± 0.2 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>) and S5/S9 (-9 ± 0.2 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>), the latter of which forms the global minimum of the PMF profile.

<title>Gross Motions Are Not Induced By Pyruvate Binding</title>
<p>Large-scale changes to protein structure and dynamics upon ligand binding are not uncommon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref039">39</xref>]. Thus, we considered whether similar large-scale dynamic motions were at play in the case of DHDPS pre- and post-binding pyruvate. Comparison of apo and pyruvate-bound crystal structures of several bacterial DHDPS enzymes reveals only minor structural differences (.12–.19 Å; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s011">S2 Table</xref>). Thus, it was not anticipated that DHDPS would undergo substantial structural changes after transitioning from the apo to pyruvate-bound form. Indeed, there remained no substantial perturbation of DHDPS conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s008">S7A Fig</xref>) or residue fluctuations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s008">S7B Fig</xref>) up to 60 ns after transitioning into the bound form (S13). Previous MD simulations performed using the crystal structure of DHDPS (PDB ID 3DAQ) over longer time-scales indicate that while the enzyme is afforded a degree of inter-subunit flexibility (so called “enzyme-breathing”), intra-subunit motions remain minimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref040">40</xref>]. Thus, our results are consistent with these earlier reports. We reason that these data provide compelling evidence that macroscopic, intra-subunit protein motions play a limited role in pyruvate binding. It remains to be seen whether this is the case for subsequent catalytic steps to product formation, such as binding of the second DHDPS substrate, ASA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DHDPS is a promising antibacterial drug target. However, despite decades of conventional rational drug design and the determination of more than 80 DHDPS structures, potent inhibitors remain elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref011">11</xref>]. We suggest that a major shortcoming of previous studies is a lack of dynamic information describing ligand binding to druggable sites of DHDPS. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to identify and characterize the dynamics of ligand binding to the potentially druggable active site of DHDPS. More specifically, we set out to map the binding pathway for the DHDPS substrate pyruvate in atomistic detail using MD simulation. Importantly, our simulations recover the bound pose observed in the crystallographic structure with remarkable precision, allowing for robust conclusions to be articulated concerning the binding trajectory. We find that (i) Arg140 side chain motion correlates with the recruitment of pyruvate from solvent in a role we define here as a ‘gateway’ residue; (ii) the majority of binding passes through a transient state involving a salt bridge between the carboxylate and guanidinium moieties of pyruvate and Arg140, respectively; (iii) pyruvate binding, independent of catalysis, is a dynamic phenomenon with several distinct metastable states described here as ‘hotspots’; and (iv) pyruvate binding is an energetically favorable event with discrete thermodynamic intermediates.</p>
<p>Firstly, with regards to Arg140’s role as a ‘gateway’ residue, it is interesting to compare our <italic>in silico</italic> findings with previous structural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref016">16</xref>] and kinetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref023">23</xref>] reports <italic>in vitro</italic>. Structural studies by Mirwaldt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref016">16</xref>] put forward a potential role for Arg140 in substrate recruitment given the positioning this residue at the ‘gateway’ to the active site. Whereas mutation of the Arg140 equivalent in <italic>E. coli</italic> DHDPS was shown to markedly reduce catalytic activity (i.e. decreased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) and increase the apparent Michaelis constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) for ASA by ~50-fold, only a subtle increase in the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> was found for pyruvate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref023">23</xref>]. However, what remains to be explained is the molecular mechanism that underpins the ~50-fold increase in the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for ASA. We propose a similar, but more pronounced, ‘gateway’ role for Arg140 during the subsequent step of the DHDPS-catalyzed reaction, when ASA is recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g001">Fig 1</xref>). It would thus be of interest in future studies to explore the binding dynamics of DHDPS with ASA using similar <italic>in silico</italic> approaches to those reported here for DHDPS-pyruvate interactions.</p>
<p>Secondly, to validate our second conclusion regarding the crucial transition intermediate involving the carboxylate of pyruvate and the guanidinium of Arg140, future studies could explore the importance of this phenomenon by substituting the side chain and/or ligand moieties with uncharged equivalents. For example, MD simulations could be performed on a mutant <italic>S. aureus</italic> DHDPS structure incorporating alanine at position 140, which would replace the positively-charged guanidinium moiety with a shorter-chain methyl group. Indeed, this mutation has already been explored kinetically <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref023">23</xref>]. Alternatively, the carboxylate group of pyruvate could be replaced by an electrostatically neutral aldehyde group. Either of these chemical transmutations would provide further insight into the chemical requirements of this transition.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we recover similar binding energies for pyruvate in our <italic>in silico</italic> model compared to those experimentally determined <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, we calculate that the relative energy difference between the apo- and pyruvate-bound state correlates to approximately -10 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This agrees well with isothermal titration calorimetry measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref022">22</xref>]. Importantly, these data imply that intermediate states observed in our model are indeed thermodynamically metastable and are not likely attributable to short-lived artifacts.</p>
<p>Defined thermodynamically-metastable ligand binding/unbinding intermediates appear to be broadly applicable to many protein-small molecule interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref041">41</xref>]. For example, in a thematically related computational study Da et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref041">41</xref>] indicated that egress of inorganic pyrophosphate from the active site of yeast RNA polymerase II adheres to a four-state model. In this model Da et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref041">41</xref>] showed that transitions between these kinetically metastable ‘hotspots’ is principally mediated by mutable electrostatic interactions between protein lysine or histidine residues and the ligand pyrophosphate. Furthermore, <italic>in silico</italic> mutation of these residues was found to retard product release from the RNA polymerase II active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref041">41</xref>]. Relating this back to our current study, it would be a worthwhile endeavour for future studies to measure whether transmuting residues involved in the pyruvate binding transition states, such as Thr46, Tyr109, Tyr135, Arg140, Lys163, or Ile248, alter the kinetics of substrate entry to the DHDPS active site.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study sheds light on the binding pathways of an important enzyme-substrate interaction that has identified several metastable binding intermediates with distinct protein-ligand interaction profiles (i.e. ‘hotspots’). We suggest that rational drug design can be augmented for next-generation DHDPS-inhibitors by considering the outcomes of this study.</p>

Two ligand molecules were randomly placed in each of these systems using Packmol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref051">51</xref>], imposing a distance limit of 6 Å from any protein atom and at least 15 Å from the <italic>ζ</italic>-nitrogen atom of Lys163 of protein chain B. Overlapping waters were removed. A restraint was placed on the carbon atom of the ligand carboxylate group such that the upper limit of searchable space in the system was restricted to a radius of less than 26 Å from Lys163-N<italic>ζ</italic>. A schematic of the simulation set-up is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s009">S8 Fig</xref>. Simulations were run for between 10 ns to 100 ns as computing resources allowed.</p>

<title>Clustering</title>
<p>553,200 conformations were obtained from the simulation data set. These conformations were clustered using the hybrid k-centers k-medoids algorithm implemented within MSMBuilder2 2.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref052">52</xref>], using a reduced selection of the total simulation data set sub-sampled at intervals of 250 ps. Clustering was performed based upon the RMSD of pyruvate heavy atoms to produce a fine-grained, 738-state model. Protein backbone alignment using both protein chains was carried out prior to clustering. Clustering was performed using MSMBuilder2 2.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref052">52</xref>]. Following clustering, the remaining conformations from the simulation data set were assigned to these clusters. The average cluster radius in the fine-grained model (± standard deviation) was found to be 2.6 ± 0.4 Å, indicating that clusters are sufficiently tight to provide a high degree of resolution.</p>

<title>Markov State Models</title>
<p>MSMs in this study were constructed based upon methods described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref026">26</xref>], using a lag time of 4 ns (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004811.s012">S1 Text</xref> for details), allowing us to construct a highly detailed microstate representation of the binding pathway. Such microstate representations are useful for examining kinetic properties of MSMs, but are often too complex to be readily understandable. To address this shortcoming we coarse-grained the microstate model into a simpler, 17-state model. The number of states was selected by examination of the Bayes factor using similar principles reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref053">53</xref>]. Observations made from coarse-grained MSMs are useful in that they can allow for comparison with experiment. For this study, we used a Bayesian method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref034">34</xref>] as implemented in MSMBuilder2 2.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref052">52</xref>] to perform coarse-graining.</p>

<title>Transition Path Theory</title>
<p>The major flux pathways connecting the unbound state to the bound state were investigated using TPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref036">36</xref>] as implemented within MSMBuilder2 2.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref052">52</xref>].

<title>Umbrella Sampling</title>
<p>PMF profiles were obtained using umbrella sampling methods with the collective variable module within NAMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref046">46</xref>]. A one-dimensional binding coordinate (<italic>Z</italic>-coordinate) was defined using two arbitrary reference points designed to create an axis that encompassed the binding pathway depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004811.g004">Fig 4</xref>. The binding, or <italic>Z</italic>-coordinate, was sampled in windows of 0.5 Å or 1 Å, using harmonic force constraints of 10.0 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> and 7.5 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The geometric center of non-hydrogen pyruvate atoms was restricted to within a radius of 7.5 Å by a boundary force of 10.0 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> from the <italic>Z</italic>-axis. This was imposed to reduce the degrees of freedom. Additionally, the C<italic>α</italic> of the protein were constrained to within 0.5 Å of their starting positions by a 10.0 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> force constraint to prevent rotational and translation drifts that may affect the definition of the <italic>Z</italic>-coordinate.</p>
<p>PMF curves were calculated using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004811.ref054">54</xref>]). <italic>Z</italic>-coordinate measurements were captured every 0.2 ps. Convergence of the dataset was assessed by segmentally truncating the simulation data within each window to reduce the sample size. Reported free energies were calculated from the final 2.5 ns of simulation time and errors attributed using 100 Monte Carlo bootstraps with time correlation values equal to the time taken for an autocorrelation to decay to 1/<italic>e</italic>.</p>
