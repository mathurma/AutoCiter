<abstract>
<p>Leptin is a well-known adipokine that plays a critical role in immune responses. To further explore the immunological roles of leptin, we developed a transgenic leptin pig controlled by the pig leptin (pleptin) promoter to overexpress leptin. Symptoms typically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were evident in this transgenic pig strain, including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia as well as kidney and liver impairment. Histologically, there were increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, elevated antiplatelet antibody (APA) levels, and deposition of immune complexes in the kidney and liver. In addition, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (dsDNAs), antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), and antinucleosome antibodies (ANuAs) were all significantly increased in serum immunological examinations. These findings were also accompanied by repression of the regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio. Significantly, glucocorticoid experimental therapies partially relieved the autoimmune responses and bleeding symptoms observed in these transgenic leptin pigs. Together, these results indicate that leptin plays a critical role in the development of autoimmune disorders and demonstrate that our transgenic leptin pigs can act as a valuable model of SLE.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Obesity is associated with many human diseases, including autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, and inflammation. Leptin is one of the most thoroughly investigated cell-signaling molecules secreted by the fat tissues and is typically elevated in patients diagnosed with lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system attacks healthy tissues in many organs. Studies using leptin-deficient mice have also demonstrated that leptin is involved in modulating immune cells. However, transgenic leptin mice do not develop SLE-like symptoms, which is probably due to differences between the immune systems of humans and mice. We show that, consistent with the human data, our transgenic leptin pig model develops a number of pathophysiological changes with multiorgan injuries resembling SLE. Our work supports an association between leptin and SLE-like symptoms as observed in human patients and implies a crucial role for leptin in promoting the development of SLE.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a type of complex disease that can be caused by both genetic and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref001">1</xref>]. The incidence rate for this disease varies between 2.9–5.1/100,000 per year, and the prevalence rate varies from 26.2–52.2/100,000 per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref002">2</xref>]; however, these rates are dependent upon the type of population being studied and can be influenced by age, gender, and racial background. Multiple genomic loci have been reported to be associated with SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref007">7</xref>], and various environmental factors, such as obesity, sunlight, infection, and exogenous estrogen, have also been shown to contribute to its development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Leptin is one of the most thoroughly investigated adipokines and is typically elevated in patients diagnosed with SLE. Studies using leptin-deficient mice have also demonstrated that leptin plays a role in modulating immune cell homeostasis under pathophysiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref009">9</xref>]. However, SLE-like symptoms were not found in transgenic leptin mice, which is likely due to differences between the immune systems of humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref010">10</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for better model systems to further identify the roles of leptin in SLE.</p>
<p>The role of leptin in immunology has also been extensively studied, specifically in T-cell activation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref011">11</xref>]. Leptin has been shown to decrease the proliferation and suppress the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref012">12</xref>] while also increasing the proliferation of naïve T cells. Additionally, it promotes the switch towards a helper T (Th)1-cell immune response and stimulates the survival of thymic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref013">13</xref>]. Recent studies have revealed that neutrophils play an important role in autoimmune diseases and that leptin also mediates their migration and metabolism as well as inhibiting their apoptosis, among other roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>There is a rapidly increasing number of biomedical pig models that have been developed and published in recent years, including those used for cancer, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, immunological, and ophthalmological diseases. Because of a similarity between human and pig immune reactions, transgenic porcine models have been utilized to mimic human autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref015">15</xref>]. Cystic fibrosis is the first human genetic disease to benefit from the directed engineering of three different species of animal models, including mice, pigs, and ferrets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref016">16</xref>]. A pig model with an interleukin-2 receptor subunit-gamma (<italic>IL2RG</italic>) deletion was successfully developed with T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in the absence of a thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref017">17</xref>] in order to mimic human Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). Furthermore, genetically modified pigs can complement and extend disease modeling beyond transgenic mice, particularly for diseases with slowly progressing pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In the SLE-like leptin mouse model, the production of autoantibodies were reported, but other major symptoms in human patients cannot be observed in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref019">19</xref>]. However, SLE patients demonstrate more complicated clinical patterns; thus, there is no single symptom/molecular marker that can independently serve as a “gold standard” for SLE diagnosis, and it is recommended by the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of SLE to examine a combination of multiple markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref020">20</xref>]. The transgenic leptin pigs satisfy these guidelines for characterizing human SLE. Additionally, leptin pigs present time-dependent progressive SLE similar to what is observed in human patients, including initial erythema and multiple-organ damage as the disease progresses over time. These two aspects of the leptin pig model highlight its value for preclinical research of SLE above mouse models. One way that this model may be utilized in the future is for molecular profiling in the different stages of SLE in order to optimize therapeutic strategies throughout the disease progression.</p>

<title>Generation of leptin transgenic pigs</title>
<p>The somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technique was used to generate transgenic leptin pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Specifically, the pig leptin (pleptin) open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from a cDNA library generated from mRNA purified from a fetal pig brain and inserted into pMD18-T with a leptin promoter using the Original TA Cloning. This construct was then transfected into the fetal fibroblasts, and the leptin-positive cells were selected for SCNT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005354.s001">S1 Protocol</xref>). Transgenic leptin pigs (<italic>n</italic> = 6) were observed for up to six months of age in order to identify the immunological roles of leptin. Nontransgenic pigs served as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The expression of leptin was verified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005354.s002">S1 Fig</xref>, upper panel), and serum leptin levels were determined by ELISA. The expression of transgenic leptin was confirmed as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To further identify the activation of leptin signaling pathways, phospho-STAT3, a transcription factor downstream of leptin, was measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref021">21</xref>]. Up-regulation of phospho-STAT3 confirmed the activation of leptin signaling after transgenic leptin expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005354.s002">S1 Fig</xref>, lower panel). Other markers, including ERK2, STAT3, JAK2, and STAT5, were also measured to demonstrate the activation of leptin signaling in the transgenic leptin pigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005354.s003">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Transgenic leptin pigs exhibit small body sizes and subcutaneous bleeding</title>
<p>To identify the phenotype of the transgenic leptin pigs, all pigs were physically examined twice a week. Specifically, body weights were measured, and behaviors were observed. We found that the transgenic leptin pigs had significantly lower body weights than the control pigs (34 ± 8.8 kg versus 96.1 ± 12.4 kg, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) at 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Because leptin is crucial for glucose metabolism, we measured blood glucose levels in all pigs. Although basal glucose levels were similar between the controls and the transgenic leptin pigs, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) demonstrated a greater increase in blood glucose level after glucose stimulation in the leptin pigs versus the controls. Specifically, the blood glucose level increased to 8 mM/L within 15 minutes and was sustained at this level for more than 1 hour. In contrast, the control pigs responded to glucose stimulation with a slight increase in blood glucose concentration after 30 minutes, which quickly returned to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Leptin has also been shown to suppress insulin and thus impact glucose homeostasis in both mice and humans. Therefore, we detected insulin levels in circulating blood and found that there was a statistically significant reduction of insulin levels in the leptin pigs compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005354.s003">S2C Fig</xref>). These results confirmed the role of leptin in glucose metabolism in the transgenic pig model and indicated that it may be involved in the underlying mechanism behind the observed smaller body sizes and slower growth rates in the transgenic leptin pigs.</p>
<p>Additionally, at 6 months of age, the transgenic leptin pigs showed widespread subcutaneous bleeding spots, especially on the ears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g001">Fig 1H</xref>) and backs, after strong exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The bleeding spots progressed to erythema after two additional weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). Eventually, all transgenic pigs died at 7.5 ± 0.3 months age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g001">Fig 1J</xref>) because of acute inflammation of the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g001">Fig 1K</xref>) and gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005354.s002">S1L Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Hematologic changes in transgenic leptin pigs</title>
<p>To identify the mechanisms underlying the observed subcutaneous bleeding in the transgenic leptin pigs, we performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of the dermis to examine the histological changes that occurred. We found that there was erythrocyte leakage from the blood vessels in the dermis of transgenic leptin pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To further characterize the bleeding disorder observed, we measured whole red blood cells (RBCs) and found that there were fewer RBCs (5.45 ± 0.36 × 10<sup>12</sup>/L versus 8.05 ± 0.73 × 10<sup>12</sup>/L, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) and significantly fewer platelets (68.5 ± 27.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L versus 326 ± 20.7 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) in the transgenic pigs compared to the control pigs, which may be the result of an RBC abnormality. Additionally, coagulation tests were performed to further diagnose the transgenic leptin pigs with leucopenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). However, despite these observed abnormalities in the transgenic leptin pigs, they had a normal level of C-reactive protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the prothrombin times (PTs), international normalized ratios (INRs), and activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) between the transgenic leptin pigs and control pigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005354.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). These results excluded a coagulation pathway as the cause of the subcutaneous bleeding in the transgenic leptin pigs. However, the transgenic leptin pigs had a lower level of fibrinogen protein (3.67 ± 0.16 g/L versus 4.44 ± 0.21 g/L, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g002">Fig 2G</xref>) and consistently longer thrombin times (42.6 ± 3.7 s versus 20.5 ± 3.9 s, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g002">Fig 2H</xref>) compared to the control pigs.</p>
<p>To identify whether the RBCs were diluted or there was a reduction in the number of RBCs contributing to the bleeding, we measured the average hemoglobin (HGB) content/concentration to determine the HGB volume in RBCs, as well as the RBC distribution width Coefficient of Variation (CV)/Standard Deviation (SD) in order to characterize the RBC morphologies. There was no significant difference in either of these markers between the transgenic leptin pigs and control pigs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005354.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). All together, these results confirmed that a dilution of RBCs was involved in the development of thrombocytopenia. To further explain the reduced platelet number, we performed H&amp;E staining of the bone marrow in order to exclude leukemia as the cause of the platelet numbers. There were no indications of leukemia or other pathological changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005354.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). Meanwhile, antiplatelet antibody (APA) levels were significantly higher in the transgenic leptin pigs than in control pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). Based on these results, the transgenic leptin pig model expressed a combination of markers and symptoms that fulfilled the 1999 American College of Rheumatology SLE classification criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g002">Fig 2J</xref>).</p>

<title>Impairment of liver and kidney function in transgenic leptin pigs</title>
<p>Multiple organ injuries, especially involving the kidney, commonly occur in SLE patients. Thus, to further confirm our diagnosis of SLE in our transgenic leptin pigs, we performed serum biochemical analyses to assess the functions of the liver and kidney in the transgenic leptin pigs. Specifically, the bilirubin levels—including both direct and indirect bilirubin—and aspartate amino transferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) levels were significantly higher in the transgenic leptin pigs than in control pigs.

<p>To further confirm the injuries to the liver and kidney in the transgenic leptin pigs, histological analyses were performed on these organs, including H&amp;E, Masson, Periodic Acid–Schiff (PAS), and Periodic Acid–Silver Methenamine (PASM). The kidneys of the transgenic leptin pigs exhibited a diffuse (&gt;90%) glomerular involvement, including mesangial proliferation and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The livers of the transgenic leptin pigs had enlarged hepatic cell sizes compared to the controls as well as constricted hepatic sinusoids at low magnification. Significantly, at high magnification, the hepatocytes in the transgenic leptin pigs were characterized by hydropic degeneration and balloon-like changes in 70% of the hepatocytes, which was indicative of severe liver cell damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).

<title>Deposition of immunocomplexes detected in transgenic leptin pigs</title>

The peripheral blood of the transgenic leptin pigs did in fact contain autoantibodies, including anti-antinuclear antibody (ANA) antibodies, anti-double-stranded–DNA antibodies (dsDNAs), and anti-antinucleosome antibodies (ANuAs). The levels of anti-dsDNA, anti-ANuA, and anti-ANA antibodies were all significantly elevated compared to the control pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<title>Repression of Tregs in transgenic leptin pigs</title>
<p>To better understand the global immunologic changes occurring in the transgenic leptin pigs, we profiled the circulating immune cells using flow cytometry. Interestingly, leptin affects several types of immune cells, including CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD21+ B cells at the pre-disease stage, but it has minimal effects on NK cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005354.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005354.s010">S9 Fig</xref>). The largest differences in immune cells between the transgenic leptin pigs and the controls were observed in the Tregs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by various autoantibodies that affect multiple organs and systems. Leptin is also frequently elevated in SLE patients, and previous SNP analyses of leptin and the leptin receptor (LR) have revealed that there is an association between leptin/LR mutations and SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref025">25</xref>]. Consistent with human data, our leptin transgenic pig model developed a number of pathophysiological changes with multiorgan injuries resembling SLE. Our work not only corroborates the association between leptin with SLE-like symptoms observed in human patients but more importantly implies a crucial role for leptin in promoting the development of SLE. Together, our data demonstrate that our transgenic leptin pig may be used as a novel porcine SLE model.</p>
<p>A series of clinical manifestations and immunological abnormalities characteristic of SLE were diagnosed in our transgenic leptin pigs. Three of those are consistent with the 1999 criteria for diagnosing SLE proposed by the American Rheumatism Association and involve both clinical and immunological aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref020">20</xref>]. These symptoms include 1) a decrease in leukocyte and platelet count in the whole blood; 2) histopathological changes in liver, kidney, and other organs resembling the multiorgan injuries elicited by SLE; and 3) a marked increase of ANAs and anti-dsDNAs. In addition, clinical and biochemical characteristics of our transgenic leptin pigs also corresponded with the 2009 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) revised criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref026">26</xref>], including the previously mentioned abnormalities and renal pathological changes.</p>
<p>It is important to note that hematological systems are one of the most frequently impacted areas in SLE patients. As a proinflammatory adipokine, leptin affects both adaptive and innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref027">27</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that leptin overexpression in pigs induced considerable alterations in the immune system and resulted in the presence of various autoantibodies in the whole blood and immune complex deposition in organs such as the kidney. Further research showed a significant decrease in the percentage of Tregs, which was consistent with changes observed in patients with active SLE. The potential role of leptin in SLE that we demonstrated here is also consistent with previous reports showing that a genetic deficiency of leptin protected mice from SLE, specifically reducing the production of autoantibodies and preventing renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref028">28</xref>]. Particularly, the gene expression profiling of our transgenic leptin pigs showed changes consistent with the typical alterations to proinflammatory pathways observed in human SLE patients. Altogether, our data show that leptin overexpression in our transgenic leptin pigs promotes autoimmune phenotypes resembling human SLE macroscopically, histologically, and molecularly.</p>
<p>Obesity is associated with many human diseases, including autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref031">31</xref>]. Our work provides compelling evidence indicating that an increased leptin level plays a crucial role in the development of obesity-associated SLE.</p>
<p>Murine models are useful tools for researching lupus pathogenesis, and they are well documented as mimicking human SLE at the molecular and cellular level. However, most of the models only partially resemble human SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref027">27</xref>] and are used to study certain aspects of lupus pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref035">35</xref>]. A number of SLE-prone mouse models have been developed for use in SLE studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref037">37</xref>]. The SLE-prone NZM2410 mouse model is highly penetrant, with early-onset lupus nephritis in both males and females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref033">33</xref>]. The MRL/Mp mouse model presented some SLE-like symptoms, including autoimmune antibody production in the peripheral blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref037">37</xref>]. However, these mouse models are unable to fully demonstrate all the features of human SLE patients, especially when looking at the mechanisms underlying the disease progression. In a spontaneous animal model of SLE, the administration of leptin promoted acceleration of the disease, whereas functionally reducing leptin protected animals from the development of autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref028">28</xref>]. However, lupus can be extremely complex and exhibit high clinical heterogeneity, which was not fully demonstrated in the leptin-overexpressing mice.</p>
<p>C-X-C motif ligands/C-C motif chemokine ligands have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by monocytic infiltrates, like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis. We found CCL4 is the most down-regulated gene in PBMCs from leptin pigs. CCL4 has not yet been linked with SLE. It has been shown to play a critical role in Treg function. Tregs deficient for expression of CCL4 were impaired in their ability to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis or islet allograft rejection in murine models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref038">38</xref>]. This is consistent with the reduction of Treg portion in leptin pigs. Besides JAK2/STAT3 and other pathways we detected, “metabolic pressure” has been reported to mediate the leptin signal to immune response. Imbalanced glucose, amino acids, and lipids metabolism, induced by an elevated leptin signal, will compromise Th1/Th17/Treg homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Pigs have similar body sizes, anatomical structures, organ physiology, and life spans to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref015">15</xref>]. In this study, the leptin-overexpressing pigs exhibited remarkable resemblance to humans with SLE in multiple aspects of the disease. Similar to the ways in which a pig model has been influential in studying cystic fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref018">18</xref>], we believe that the leptin-overexpressing transgenic pig is a promising preclinical SLE model that could be influential in performing translational research to further understand this disease and determine beneficial treatment strategies.</p>

<p>Pig fibroblast cells were isolated from 30-day-old York pig embryos using a previously described method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref022">22</xref>]. The cells (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were washed twice after trypsin digestion and mixed with 6 μg/ml plasmid DNA before being transferred into a cuvette with a 0.4 cm gap. Electroporation was performed at 250 v for 25 ms. Neomycin (500 μg/mL) was added into the media for 2 weeks to select the stably transfected cell line. SCNT was performed using a standard procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref023">23</xref>]. The activated oocytes containing the nucleus from the leptin fibroblast cells were transplanted into the uteri of surrogate sows. On average, approximately 400 developing embryos were transplanted into one surrogate sow. A total of six surrogate sows were used in this study, and five of them became pregnant. The newborn pigs were removed by cesarean section. A total of 13 pigs survived. All pigs were raised to sexual maturity at 6 months old. Standard procedures for animal husbandry were used throughout the study. Animal operations were performed under general anesthesia after Propofol ear injection (dose = 2.5 mg/kg). Blood was collected from the precaval vein and used in physiological examinations. Scoring with the Mouse Interventional Scoring System (MISS) was a surrogate for death as an endpoint and was tested concurrent to main investigative aims. The experimental endpoint was followed according to the MISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005354.ref040">40</xref>]. We gave each clinical feature—including appearance, respiratory rate, general behavior, provoked behavior, and weight loss—a numerical value and scored them. Each criterion contains 0 to 12 points. Pigs were euthanized by Propofol ear injection when the score was equal to or higher than 12.</p>
