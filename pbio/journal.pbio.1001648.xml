<p>During the oocyte-to-embryo transition in Drosophila, degradation of the Polo kinase inhibitor, Matrimony, depends on Cortex, a meiosis-specific form of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome that is required for the oocyte's normal transition from meiosis to mitosis.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Oocytes are stockpiled with proteins and mRNA that are required to drive the initial mitotic divisions of embryogenesis. But are there proteins specific to meiosis whose levels must be decreased to begin embryogenesis properly? The Drosophila protein Cortex (Cort) is a female, meiosis-specific activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We performed immunoprecipitation of Cortex followed by mass spectrometry, and identified the Polo kinase inhibitor Matrimony (Mtrm) as a potential interactor with Cort. <italic>In vitro</italic> binding assays showed Mtrm and Cort can bind directly. We found Mtrm protein levels to be reduced dramatically during the oocyte-to-embryo transition, and this downregulation did not take place in <italic>cort</italic> mutant eggs, consistent with Mtrm being a substrate of APC<sup>Cort</sup>. We showed that Mtrm is subject to APC<sup>Cort</sup>-mediated proteasomal degradation and have identified a putative APC/C recognition motif in Mtrm that when mutated partially stabilized the protein in the embryo. Furthermore, overexpression of Mtrm in the early embryo caused aberrant nuclear divisions and developmental defects, and these were enhanced by decreasing levels of active Polo. These data indicate APC<sup>Cort</sup> ubiquitylates Mtrm at the oocyte-to-embryo transition, thus preventing excessive inhibition of Polo kinase activity due to Mtrm's presence.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Despite their many differences, the meiotic and mitotic divisions of the early embryo take place within the same cytoplasmic space. The oocyte-to-embryo transition is the process by which an oocyte, which initially undergoes meiosis, becomes “adapted” to support the rapid mitotic divisions of embryogenesis. This involves fertilization as well as the stockpiling of proteins and mRNA for the transcriptionally silent early embryo. The Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is a large protein complex that is active during both mitosis and meiosis and is responsible for targeting certain proteins for degradation. The discovery of the existence of APC/C activators that are present only during meiosis hinted at the possibility that this complex also functions to regulate protein degradation during the oocyte-to-embryo transition. Here we study Cortex, a female- and meiosis-specific activator of the APC/C in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We find that Cortex activity is necessary for the degradation of Matrimony, a key regulator of female meiosis in Drosophila. Matrimony itself inhibits Polo kinase, another important regulator of both mitosis and meiosis that also functions in chromosome segregation, centrosome dynamics, and cytokinesis. When excess Matrimony protein is not removed from the early embryo, developmental defects arise. Together our findings demonstrate that the precise regulation of Matrimony levels in the egg is necessary for the switch from meiosis to mitosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The oocyte-to-embryo transition is the developmental course by which an oocyte not only switches from a meiotic to a mitotic program, but becomes fully competent to support early embryogenesis. Initially, fertilization introduces the haploid genomic content of the sperm into the egg. Egg activation, triggered by fertilization in vertebrates and independent of fertilization in insects, signals the resumption and completion of meiosis in the egg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-VonStetina1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Horner1">[2]</xref>. Following successful completion of meiosis, pronuclear fusion creates a single diploid nucleus from the individual haploid sperm and egg nuclei. The single diploid nucleus must then transition to a mitotic cell cycle within the same cytoplasm in which the meiotic divisions took place.</p>
<p>The oocyte-to-embryo transition can proceed normally only if the preceding events of meiosis are completed successfully. During <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> oogenesis, an oocyte enters prophase I following completion of premeiotic S-phase. After homologous chromosome pairs synapse and recombine, the oocyte enters a prolonged prophase I arrest. Oocyte maturation then releases this primary arrest, allowing the oocyte to continue meiosis until its secondary arrest at metaphase I, in what is known as a stage 14 oocyte. Lastly, egg activation triggers resumption and completion of meiosis concordantly with the oocyte-to-embryo transition itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-VonStetina1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Horner1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>The switch from meiosis to mitosis is controlled by cellular proteins and structures produced during gametogenesis, with both the sperm and egg making unique contributions. The centrosome, important for proper spindle formation during mitotic divisions, is brought into the acentrosomal egg by the sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Schatten1">[3]</xref>. The initial rapid divisions of a developing embryo are driven by the maternal stockpile of nutrients, mRNA, and translational machinery that are “packed” into the egg during oocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-VonStetina1">[1]</xref>. Additionally, the egg also contains numerous meiosis-specific proteins. These meiosis-specific proteins are crucial for proper meiotic progression, but are not necessarily needed after the switch to mitosis.</p>
<p>There are known examples of proteins uniquely employed in meiosis that need to be removed prior to mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-DeRenzo1">[4]</xref>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the MBK-2 kinase promotes the oocyte-to-embryo transition. One target is the katanin subunit MEI-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Quintin1">[5]</xref>, and phosphorylation of MEI-1 by MBK-2 marks it for degradation before the completion of meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Stitzel1">[6]</xref>. A gain-of-function MEI-1 protein that persists into embryogenesis often leads to a short, mispositioned mitotic spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Dow1">[7]</xref>. The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> meiosis-specific protein Spo13 prevents the biorientation of sister chromatids at meiosis I, ensuring homologs segregate together <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Katis1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Lee1">[9]</xref>. Spo13 is actively targeted for degradation during anaphase I by the Cdc20 form of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Sullivan1">[10]</xref>. Interestingly, a nondegradable form of Spo13 does not result in a significant meiotic phenotype; however, overexpression of Spo13 leads to mitotic cell cycle defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Sullivan1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Lee2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Shonn1">[12]</xref>. This demonstrates the necessity of degrading a meiosis-specific protein not for proper meiotic progression, but subsequent mitotic progression.</p>
<p>The unique mechanisms of meiosis such as segregation of homologs in meiosis I, absence of DNA replication between divisions, and the meiotic arrests during oogenesis require either unique regulators or altered control of factors that also are used in mitosis. For example, during mitosis the mitotic cyclins are completely degraded as the cell progresses through the metaphase to anaphase transition and exits from mitosis. In contrast, the mitotic cyclins are left at an intermediate level after the metaphase to anaphase transition of meiosis I; low enough to exit from meiosis I, but high enough to prevent re-replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Furuno1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Iwabuchi1">[14]</xref>. This altered control of mitotic regulators may need to be removed upon the start of embryogenesis. The APC/C inhibitor Emi2 is responsible for maintaining Cyclin B1 levels after meiosis I in mouse oocytes, but it is quickly degraded to allow for meiotic exit (though it has been shown to reestablish its levels in early embryogenesis in Xenopus) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Madgwick1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Tischer1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Inoue1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Nishiyama1">[18]</xref>. This illustrates how normal mitotic cell cycle regulation can be altered through the use of unique meiotic proteins.</p>
<p>Regulated degradation of proteins, particularly by the APC/C, plays an indispensable role in progression through the mitotic and meiotic divisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pines1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pesin1">[20]</xref>. The APC/C ubiquitylates numerous proteins during mitosis, targeting them for degradation and promoting mitotic progression and exit. Similarly, during oogenesis proper cell cycle regulation by the APC/C is crucial in maintaining coordination between meiosis and development. The APC/C must use activator proteins (Cdc20/Fizzy and Cdh1/Fizzy-related in mitosis) to recognize its substrates. Interestingly, meiosis-specific activators of the APC/C are known to exist in both budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Cooper1">[21]</xref> and fission yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Blanco1">[22]</xref> in addition to sex and meiosis-specific APC/C activators in Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pesin1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pesin2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Chu1">[24]</xref>. Elucidating the function and targets of these meiosis-specific APC/C activators will give valuable insights into meiotic regulation and the transition from meiosis into mitosis.</p>
<p>The Drosophila protein Cort is a female, meiosis-specific activator of the APC/C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pesin2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Chu1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Swan1">[25]</xref>. It is expressed exclusively during oogenesis and is itself targeted for degradation by the APC/C soon after meiotic completion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pesin2">[23]</xref>. Cort is dispensable for viability, but absolutely essential for fertility. Eggs laid by <italic>cort</italic> mutant mothers arrest in metaphase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Page1">[26]</xref>. During Drosophila female meiosis, Cort and Fzy/Cdc20 both contribute to meiotic progression, whereas Fizzy-related/Cdh1 is not believed to play a role. Cort coordinates with Fizzy/Cdc20 during meiosis to degrade the Cyclins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pesin2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Swan1">[25]</xref>, but whether it also has other substrates is unknown. Identifying additional substrates of APC<sup>Cort</sup> will give further insight into the differential regulation of meiosis and mitosis, as well as the necessary steps to transition from oocyte to embryo.</p>
<p>Here we show that degradation of the female-specific protein Mtrm during meiotic completion is dependent on the activity of Cort. Furthermore, we show that this downregulation of Mtrm is crucial to the proper onset of embryogenesis.</p>

<title>Cort Binds to the Polo Inhibitor Mtrm</title>
<p>To recover substrates and regulators of APC<sup>Cort</sup>, a functional myc-tagged Cort <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pesin2">[23]</xref> was immunoprecipitated from whole ovaries, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. In addition to isolating multiple components of the APC/C as expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pesin2">[23]</xref>, the Polo inhibitor Mtrm was recovered as a potential substrate/interactor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001648.s006">Table S1</xref>). Mtrm was identified initially in a genetic screen for dominant effects on achiasmate chromosome segregation in Drosophila oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Harris1">[27]</xref>, and it was later shown to function as a direct inhibitor of Polo kinase during meiosis I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Xiang1">[28]</xref>. Given Mtrm's essential role during female meiosis, we sought to explore further its relationship to Cort.</p>
<p>To confirm the physical interaction between Cort and Mtrm, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays were performed. GST-tagged Mtrm and GST alone were expressed and purified from bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), and then incubated with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated 6×Myc-Cort produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Cort strongly bound to GST-Mtrm beads, but not to GST-only beads or beads alone, consistent with the physical interaction between these two proteins being direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Cortex lacking its C-terminus binds GST-Mtrm much less efficiently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001648.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The C-terminus of Cortex is made up mainly of its WD40 repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Chu1">[24]</xref>, which are known to mediate substrate binding in other APC/C activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Kraft1">[29]</xref>. These data are consistent with Cortex binding Matrimony directly through its WD40 propeller.</p>

<p>Cort and Fzy/Cdc20 are both required for degradation of the mitotic cyclins during female meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pesin2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Swan1">[25]</xref>, and therefore share at least a subset of their substrates. We also tested whether the interaction between Cort and Mtrm was specific, or whether Mtrm might be a target of all forms of the APC/C (or an APC/C regulator). In contrast to 6×MycCort, little to no <italic>in vitro</italic> translated 6×MycFzy/Cdc20 bound to GST-Mtrm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, <italic>in vitro</italic> translated Fzy/Cdc20 could bind Cyclin A, a known substrate/interactor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Wolthuis1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-DiFiore1">[31]</xref>. Full-length Cortex also bound Cyclin A, albeit to a lesser extent than it binds Matrimony (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001648.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, the interaction between Cort and Mtrm is specific, suggesting regulation between these two female, meiosis-specific proteins.</p>

<title>Decreased Mtrm Protein Levels After Meiosis Are Cort Dependent</title>
<p>Mtrm protein levels increase throughout meiosis I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-VonStetina2">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, its levels are drastically reduced by the time meiosis is completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; compare <italic>cort/+</italic> stg. 14 oocyte to <italic>cort/+</italic> activated egg).

<p>To test whether the decrease in Mtrm is dependent on Cort function, we compared Mtrm protein levels in <italic>cort</italic> mutant eggs to heterozygous control unfertilized eggs. Unfertilized eggs have completed meiosis, but have not initiated embryogenesis, and therefore provide the best control for <italic>cort</italic> mutant eggs. In contrast to heterozygous unfertilized eggs, activated eggs laid by homozygous <italic>cort</italic> females retained high levels of Mtrm protein, consistent with it being a substrate of APC<sup>Cort</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Moreover, unfertilized eggs laid by females mutant for <italic>morula/APC2</italic>, a component of the APC/C itself, also showed elevated levels of Mtrm. This shows APC/C function is necessary to trigger the decrease in Mtrm protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, <italic>fzy/cdc20</italic> mutant unfertilized eggs did not show elevated Mtrm levels, again illustrating Mtrm is not a general APC/C substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Together these data demonstrate the decrease in Mtrm protein upon meiotic completion (or during meiosis II) is dependent specifically on APC<sup>Cort</sup> function. We hypothesized the relatively large pool of Mtrm present in the ovary is necessary for proper progression through meiosis, but such high levels may be detrimental in early embryogenesis.</p>

<p>If Mtrm is targeted for degradation by APC<sup>Cort</sup>, levels of Mtrm protein should be reduced in the presence of Cort. Indeed, levels of a Myc-tagged Mtrm were reduced when functional Cort was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, expression of functionally null alleles of Cort, Cort<sup>QW55</sup> (a missense mutation) or Cort<sup>RH65</sup> (a nonsense mutation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Chu1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Page1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Schupbach1">[33]</xref>, failed to decrease Mtrm protein levels. Therefore, wild-type Cort function is required to bring about the observed decrease in Mtrm protein. Consistent with APC<sup>Cort</sup> affecting Mtrm levels through degradation, these cells contained similar amounts of <italic>mtrm</italic> transcript, illustrating the effect is posttranscriptional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g003">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Additionally, reduction of Mtrm levels was not observed when a 6×Myc-tagged Fzy/Cdc20 was expressed, again showing the selectivity of APC<sup>Cort</sup> for Mtrm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001648.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We next used this cell-culture-based system to determine whether APC<sup>Cort</sup>'s effect on Mtrm was truly the result of degradation. Mtrm protein was accumulated during arrest with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and upon release of the arrest translation was inhibited with cycloheximide and Mtrm protein levels examined over time in the presence or absence of Cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g003">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Mtrm protein levels decreased rapidly in the presence of Cort. Importantly, this continued decrease was abolished in the continued presence of MG132 to inactivate the proteasome. Mtrm levels remained higher when an empty vector was transfected in place of Cort. These data establish that APC<sup>Cort</sup> affects Mtrm levels through proteasome-mediated degradation.</p>
<p>Given the decrease in Mtrm is mediated through degradation, we searched Mtrm's primary amino acid sequence for APC/C recognition motifs that could influence its stability during the oocyte-to-embryo transition. Four motifs previously implicated in APC/C-mediated degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pines1">[19]</xref> are present within Mtrm's 217 amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). To examine the role these motifs play in Mtrm protein stability at the oocyte-to-embryo transition, transgenic flies expressing mCherry-Mtrm under the control of <italic>mtrm</italic>'s endogenous promoter were created. mCherry-Mtrm protein levels decreased at the oocyte-to-embryo transition as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g003">Figure 3G</xref>, lanes 1 and 7). Point mutants in the four candidate APC motifs were also examined for their effect on (mCherry-) Mtrm protein stability. Whereas the G170A mutation and the double R95A/R193A mutations did not stabilize mCherry-Mtrm in activated eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g003">Figure 3G</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 8; 4 and 10, respectively), mutation of leucine 21 exhibited partial stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g003">Figure 3G</xref>, lanes 3 and 9). A quadruple mutant of mCherry-Mtrm that also contains the L21A mutation is partially stabilized as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g003">Figure 3G</xref>, lanes 5 and 11). Importantly, both Mtrm-L21A and Mtrm-4A are functional, as judged by their ability to rescue <italic>mtrm<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> induced nondisjunction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001648.s009">Table S4</xref>). Given mCherry-Mtrm-L21A is still partially degraded at the oocyte-to-embryo transition, L21 is not likely to be the only residue responsible for Matrimony degradation. It is intriguing to note, however, that L21 is part of the LxExxxN APC/C destruction motif found within Spo13, another meiosis-specific substrate of the APC/C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Sullivan1">[10]</xref>.</p>

<title>Genetic Interactions Reveal an Antagonistic Relationship Between Cort and Mtrm</title>
<p>We next investigated the genetic relationship between Cort and Mtrm, specifically in the background of a mutant with low APC<sup>Cort</sup> activity. Mutants with low APC<sup>Cort</sup> activity arrest without completing meiosis, presumably due to a failure to degrade key substrates. If Mtrm were such a substrate, we hypothesized that decreasing its levels could lead to suppression of the reduced APC<sup>Cort</sup> phenotype. All alleles of <italic>cort</italic> are null <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Page1">[26]</xref>, however mutation of Cort's dedicated transcription factor <italic>grauzone</italic> results in decreased levels of <italic>cort</italic> transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Harms1">[34]</xref> and protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Pesin2">[23]</xref>. Activated eggs laid by <italic>grauzone</italic> mutant females also arrest in meiosis II (just as <italic>cort</italic> eggs do) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Page1">[26]</xref>, thus illustrating that such low levels of APC<sup>Cort</sup> cannot efficiently cause degradation of key substrates. Decreasing levels of the Mtrm substrate may be sufficient to permit progression past the meiotic arrest. Alternatively, the reduced levels of one key substrate may afford low APC<sup>Cort</sup> enough opportunity to target its remaining substrates for degradation. Thus we used this sensitized background to test whether decreased <italic>mtrm</italic> permitted progression past the <italic>grauzone</italic> metaphase II arrest.</p>
<p>Strikingly, when one copy of the <italic>mtrm</italic> gene was removed, we observed partial suppression of the <italic>grau</italic> phenotype. <italic>grau</italic> eggs typically arrest with two spindles at metaphase II, but <italic>grau</italic> eggs also mutant for one copy of <italic>mtrm</italic> contained, on average, an increased number of spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These spindles appear acentriolar, and thus are likely not mitotic. Supporting this, no gamma-tubulin (a common component of centrosomes) is present at the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001648.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These spindles likely arise from completion of meiosis followed by all meiotic products (including polar bodies) forming bipolar spindles and possibly dividing, reminiscent of the effect of <italic>polo</italic> mutation on meiosis II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Riparbelli1">[35]</xref>. Importantly, the observed increase in spindle number is not due to a restoration of Cort protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001648.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Thus the <italic>mtrm</italic> mutation partially suppresses the <italic>grau</italic> phenotype, allowing further progression through the oocyte-to-embryo transition.</p>

<title>Increased Mtrm Levels in the Embryo Lead to Developmental Defects</title>
<p>Proteins and mRNA deposited into the oocyte during oogenesis control the early embryonic divisions, but it is possible some of these proteins function in meiosis and then need to be removed. We hypothesized degradation of Mtrm at the oocyte-to-embryo transition by APC<sup>Cort</sup> is a crucial step necessary to ensure proper development of the syncytial embryo. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed a transgenic <italic>mtrm</italic> using the <italic>UAS-GAL4</italic> system. 3×FLAG-Mtrm was overexpressed in the ovary using the maternal alpha tubulin driver, resulting in excess Mtrm being present in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001648.s005">Figure S5A/B</xref>).</p>
<p>This surplus of Mtrm caused a variety of defects in early embryogenesis, which we categorized into three phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g005">Figure 5A–C</xref>). We observed some embryos undergoing nuclear fallout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). During nuclear fallout, nuclei at the surface of an embryo that have detached from their centrosomes fall back into the middle of the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Takada1">[36]</xref>. We also found embryos that exhibited complete mitotic catastrophe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), showing only scattered DNA with no real spindle organization. DNA masses seemed to contain varying chromosomal content, and were usually associated with tubulin. These embryos were found with variable amounts of total DNA, some containing DNA over the entire expanse of the embryo (late arrest), while others only contained DNA in a particular section of the embryo (early arrest). Lastly, some embryos showed scattered DNA/tubulin over a portion of the embryo, whereas the rest of the embryo appeared to reach the blastoderm stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These embryos seemingly underwent an abortive/abnormal development up to the blastoderm stage. Given the centrosome's crucial role in spindle organization and the requirement for Polo kinase for proper centrosome attachment in the early embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Archambault1">[37]</xref>, there are many ways these phenotypes could be obtained. In summary, these data illustrate that the downregulation of Mtrm protein following meiosis is biologically significant to early embryonic development.</p>

<p>The defects observed from <italic>mtrm</italic> overexpression likely result from low Polo kinase activity, given Mtrm's known function as its inhibitor. If true, mutating <italic>polo</italic> should further exacerbate the <italic>mtrm</italic> overexpression phenotype. Indeed, overexpression of Mtrm in conjunction with heterozygous <italic>polo<sup>11</sup></italic> results in a substantially higher proportion of defective embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Additionally, the observed defects are often more severe, with DNA completely fragmented and tubulin in almost random configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). In our hands the heterozygous <italic>polo<sup>11</sup></italic> mutation alone also exhibited defects similar to <italic>mtrm</italic> overexpression alone, but these fell primarily into one phenotypic category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). These data are consistent with increased Mtrm in the early embryo causing developmental defects due to excessive inhibition of Polo kinase activity (and potentially other, unknown targets).</p>
<p>To address the possibility that Matrimony affects proteins other than Polo, we expressed a mutant form of Matrimony deficient in Polo binding. Mtrm-T40A is unable to bind Polo, and cannot rescue chromosome nondisjunction in <italic>mtrm/+</italic> heterozygotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Xiang1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Bonner1">[38]</xref>. In contrast to wild-type Matrimony, expression of Mtrm-T40A did not cause any developmental defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Importantly, expression of both the WT and T40A transgenes is similar using the maternal alpha tubulin driver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001648.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). Thus, high levels of Matrimony in the early embryo cause developmental defects due to inhibition of Polo kinase activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite its pivotal role in development, regulation of the oocyte-to-embryo transition is poorly understood. Given the maternal stockpiles in the oocyte, mechanistic differences between meiosis and mitosis, and meiosis-specific forms of the APC/C, it is crucial to determine which proteins need to be degraded to switch correctly from meiosis to mitosis. The meiosis-specific activator Cort is essential for the transition from oocyte to embryo despite Fzy/Cdc20's presence. Cortex's existence raised the possibility that degradation of particular meiosis-specific proteins may be necessary for the onset of embryogenesis. Here we show this to be the case: the Cort form of the APC/C is required for Mtrm's destruction at the oocyte-to-embryo transition. Furthermore, reduced levels of Mtrm heading into embryogenesis are necessary for proper development, indicative of requirements for differential levels of the protein in meiosis and mitosis.</p>
<p>A requirement for reduction in levels of Mtrm is illustrated by the deleterious effects of overexpression of the protein in the embryo. A crucial role for Mtrm degradation in the transition from oocyte to embryo is supported by the observation that reduction in levels of Mtrm protein can suppress the developmental block caused by low activity of Cort. In the <italic>grau</italic> mutants, levels of Cort are reduced, and the mutant oocytes arrest in meiosis. By mutating a single copy of the <italic>mtrm</italic> gene, this arrest was overcome, the eggs progressed, and several nuclear divisions occurred.</p>
<p>Mtrm provides key insights into how protein degradation can be regulated at the oocyte-to-embryo transition. Mtrm is not completely removed from the embryo, illustrating that its protein levels are important and degradation does not have to be an all-or-none process. In this case, APC<sup>Cort</sup> acts as a rheostat, allowing for high levels of Mtrm in meiosis and low levels in mitosis. Consistent with this, it is interesting that stabilized forms of Mtrm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g003">Figure 3G</xref>) present at lower levels than the overexpressed wild-type form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001648.s005">Figure S5A/B</xref>) did not exhibit an embryonic phenotype (unpublished data). mCherry-Mtrm also is present at levels lower than endogenous Mtrm in stage 14 oocytes, and therefore may never reach high enough levels to be able to cause the developmental defects seen with the overexpressed form of Mtrm. This offers evidence for a specific threshold of Mtrm that can be tolerated in the early embryo.</p>
<p>Polo kinase is a critical regulator of both mitosis and meiosis, and is conserved from yeast to humans. <italic>polo</italic> (and its orthologs) help regulate mitotic/meiotic entry, chromosome segregation, centrosome dynamics, and cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Archambault2">[39]</xref>. With such diverse roles during mitosis and meiosis, Polo function must be carefully regulated. Up-regulation of human Polo-like kinase (Plk1) is prevalent in many human cancers, and identifying potent inhibitors of Plk1 is the focus of much research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Strebhardt1">[40]</xref>. In Drosophila, without inhibition by Mtrm during prophase of meiosis I, Polo prematurely triggers nuclear envelope breakdown (through activation of the Cdc25 phosphatase) and eventually leads to chromosome nondisjunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Xiang1">[28]</xref>. Mutation of <italic>polo</italic> has direct consequences on female meiotic progression as well. During Drosophila embryogenesis, expression of Scant, a hyperactive form of the Polo antagonist Greatwall kinase, leads to dissociated centrosomes from prophase nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Archambault1">[37]</xref>. Embryos homozygous for <italic>polo<sup>1</sup></italic> show a wide array of defects, including irregular DNA masses with disorganized spindles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Riparbelli1">[35]</xref>, reminiscent of our <italic>mtrm</italic> overexpression phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001648-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These data illustrate the importance of Polo kinase in both mitosis and meiosis, and that improper regulation of its activity can have disastrous consequences on cell division.</p>
<p>Current evidence suggests that Mtrm regulates Polo activity during both meiosis and mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Xiang1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-VonStetina2">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Archambault1">[37]</xref>. Our results shed light on how the oocyte/embryo might use the same protein to regulate Polo during such drastically different cell divisions. Our data indicate meiosis requires high levels of Mtrm protein/Polo inhibition, while low levels of Mtrm are needed for early embryogenesis. This is likely a mechanism to allow for fine tuning of Polo activity during the rapid divisions of the syncytial embryo.</p>
<p>The results here provide an interesting biological counterpoint to a recent study on the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> meiosis-specific APC/C activator Ama1. Previously, Ama1 had been known to act later in meiosis, regulating spore formation and Cdc20 degradation at meiosis II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Cooper1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Tan1">[41]</xref>. Okaz et al. showed APC<sup>Ama1</sup> also acts earlier in meiosis to clear out mitotic regulators (including Polo/Cdc5) during the extended meiotic prophase I. Consequently, cells lacking Ama1 exit prematurely from prophase I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Okaz1">[42]</xref>. It is interesting that two meiosis-specific APC/C activators have now been tied to regulation of Polo kinase. Ama1 has a direct, inhibitory effect early in meiosis, whereas Cort seemingly activates Polo indirectly through degradation of Mtrm late in meiosis.</p>
<p>Mtrm is not likely to be the only specific substrate of Cort, and it will be exciting to search for more APC<sup>Cort</sup> substrates in the future. It will also be interesting to examine whether Cort targets continue to follow a graded versus all-or-none pattern of degradation during the oocyte-to-embryo transition. Further study of meiosis-specific APC/C activators will give valuable insight into the distinctions between meiotic and mitotic regulation and the control of the onset of embryogenesis.</p>

Bands were cut from the silver stained gel and reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were extracted and the volume reduced to 15 µl. The digestion extracts were analyzed by HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry using a Waters NanoAcquity UPLC system and a ThermoFisher LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer operated in a data-dependent manner. Tandem mass spectra were extracted by Extract_MSn. Charge state deconvolution and deisotoping were not performed. All MS/MS samples were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.4.0). Mascot was set up to search the refseq_fly_lc2_042413 database (27,878 entries) assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin. Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.00 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 3.0 Da. Iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine was specified in Mascot as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine was specified in Mascot as a variable modification. Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.0.5, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Keller1">[50]</xref>and contained at least two identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001648-Nesvizhskii1">[51]</xref>. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.</p>
