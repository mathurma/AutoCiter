<p>This study describes a novel “white-gray-opaque” tristable phenotypic switching system in the human fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, revealing additional complexity in this organism's ability to adapt to changing environments.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Non-genetic phenotypic variations play a critical role in the adaption to environmental changes in microbial organisms. <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, a major human fungal pathogen, can switch between several morphological phenotypes. This ability is critical for its commensal lifestyle and for its ability to cause infections. Here, we report the discovery of a novel morphological form in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, referred to as the “gray” phenotype, which forms a tristable phenotypic switching system with the previously reported white and opaque phenotypes. White, gray, and opaque cell types differ in a number of aspects including cellular and colony appearances, mating competency, secreted aspartyl proteinase (Sap) activities, and virulence. Of the three cell types, gray cells exhibit the highest Sap activity and the highest ability to cause cutaneous infections. The three phenotypes form a tristable phenotypic switching system, which is independent of the regulation of the mating type locus (<italic>MTL</italic>). Gray cells mate over 1,000 times more efficiently than do white cells, but less efficiently than do opaque cells. We further demonstrate that the master regulator of white-opaque switching, Wor1, is essential for opaque cell formation, but is not required for white-gray transitions. The Efg1 regulator is required for maintenance of the white phenotype, but is not required for gray-opaque transitions. Interestingly, the <italic>wor1/wor1 efg1/efg1</italic> double mutant is locked in the gray phenotype, suggesting that Wor1 and Efg1 could function coordinately and play a central role in the regulation of gray cell formation. Global transcriptional analysis indicates that white, gray, and opaque cells exhibit distinct gene expression profiles, which partly explain their differences in causing infections, adaptation ability to diverse host niches, metabolic profiles, and stress responses. Therefore, the white-gray-opaque tristable phenotypic switching system in <italic>C. albicans</italic> may play a significant role in a wide range of biological aspects in this common commensal and pathogenic fungus.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The capacity of the yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic> to grow in several cellular forms—a phenomenon known as phenotypic plasticity—is critical for its survival and for its ability to thrive and cause infection in the human host. In this study, we report a novel form of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the “gray” phenotype, which may enhance fitness and confer an adaptive advantage for this important pathogenic yeast in certain host environments. The gray cell type, together with the previously discovered “white” and “opaque” cell types, forms a tristable phenotypic switching system. The three phenotypes differ in their cellular and colony appearance, their global transcriptional profiles, their production of secreted aspartyl proteinases (enzymes that degrade host tissues and release nutrients), and their virulence in different infection models. Moreover, gray cells exhibit a level of mating competency that is intermediate between that of white and opaque cells. We further demonstrate that two key transcriptional regulators, Wor1 and Efg1, play central roles in the regulation of the “white-gray-opaque” tristable transitions. Our study reveals a multi-stable and heritable switching system, indicating that the adoption of distinct morphological forms in response to environmental change could be much more elaborate than previously thought.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability of a single genotype to generate a number of different phenotypes in response to environmental stimuli, known as phenotypic plasticity, enables microorganisms to rapidly adapt to their changing environment and to survive and thrive in certain ecological niches. The human pathogenic yeast <italic>C. albicans</italic> can switch among several morphological phenotypes in response to a variety of environmental cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Sudbery1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang1">[2]</xref>. The ability to grow in different morphological forms is critical for both its commensal lifestyle and its existence as a pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Whiteway1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Pande1">[4]</xref>. The “white-opaque” transition is a well-known bistable phenotypic switching system in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Slutsky1">[5]</xref>. White and opaque cells are two morphologically distinct cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Anderson1">[6]</xref>. White cells are small and round and form white and shiny colonies on solid media, while opaque cells are larger and elongated and form flatter and rougher colonies. White and opaque cells also differ in their gene expression profiles, mating competency, and virulence characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Miller1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Soll1">[8]</xref>. For instance, opaque cells can mate more efficiently and are better at cutaneous infections than white cells, while white cells are more virulent in systemic candidiasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Soll1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>The white and opaque phenotypes are heritable and stable for many generations of cell divisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Slutsky1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Anderson1">[6]</xref>. There does not appear to be a stable intermediate phase between white and opaque in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Slutsky1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Bennett1">[9]</xref>, although transient intermediate phenotypes have been observed at the cellular level during the process of high temperature-induced transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Bergen1">[10]</xref>. <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, two human fungal pathogens closely related to <italic>C. albicans</italic>, can also undergo white-opaque switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Pujol1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Xie1">[13]</xref>. We recently observed an intermediate phase between the white and opaque phenotypes in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and proposed that the phenotypic switching system in this species may be tristable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Xie1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>The white-opaque transition is regulated by the bistable expression of the master regulator gene <italic>WOR1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Zordan1">[16]</xref>, and therefore, there is not an intermediate phase between white and opaque phenotypes. In the laboratory strain SC5314 and its derivatives, the mating type locus (<italic>MTL</italic>) controls white-opaque switching via repressing <italic>WOR1</italic> expression by the <bold>a</bold>1-α2 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Miller1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang2">[14]</xref>. We have recently reported that a subset of clinical isolates of <italic>C. albicans MTL</italic><bold>a</bold>/α heterozygous strains can undergo white-opaque switching when cultured in N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-containing media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Xie2">[17]</xref>, which is thought to mimic the host environment. The key regulators, including Wor1, Wor2, Efg1, and Czf1, constitute an interlocking transcriptional circuit controlling white-opaque switching via positive and negative feedback loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Zordan2">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we report a novel morphological phenotype of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, referred to as the “gray” phenotype. This phenotype is heritable but distinct from the previously identified white and opaque phenotypes in cellular and colony appearance, global gene expression profiles, secreted aspartyl proteinase (Sap) activities, and virulence characteristics. The gray phenotype, together with the white and opaque phenotypes, forms a novel tristable and heritable switching system in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. We further demonstrate that neither Wor1 nor Efg1 are required for the maintenance of the gray phenotype. Deletion of <italic>WOR1</italic> blocks white-to-opaque and gray-to-opaque transitions, but not white-gray transitions. Deletion of <italic>EFG1</italic> blocks opaque-to-white and gray-to-white transitions, but not gray-opaque transitions. Deletion of both <italic>WOR1</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic> locks cells in the gray phenotype. Therefore, Wor1 and Efg1 may coordinately regulate the “white-gray-opaque” tristable phenotypic switching system in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p>

<title>Discovery of the Gray Phenotype and the White-Gray-Opaque Tristable Switching System in <italic>C. albicans</italic></title>
<p>We isolated a <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain (BJ1097) from the genital tract of a female patient at a women's health hospital in Beijing, China. We sequenced the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and 5.8S rDNA region and verified that BJ1097 is a <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain. When this strain was grown on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar plates for several days, we observed a novel colony phenotype, hereafter referred to as the “gray” phenotype, in addition to the typical white and opaque colony phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Gray colonies appeared smooth and gray, while typical opaque colonies were gray and rough or “opaque,” and typical white colonies were relatively white and smooth. On YPD agar containing the dye phloxine B, the white colonies remained white and the opaque colonies were stained pink, while the gray colonies exhibited a distinctly lighter pink color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). The color of the gray colonies was noticeably different than that of the opaque colonies on phloxine B containing media. The cellular morphologies of the white, gray, and opaque phenotypes were also distinguishable on YPD medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, white cells were round and small, while opaque cells were elongated and large. Gray cells were also elongated, but appeared much smaller than opaque cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The cellular and colony morphologies of the three phenotypes on Lee's glucose and Lee's GlcNAc medium are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s002">S2</xref>. Similar to the phenotypes on YPD medium, the order of coloration from darkest to lightest on Lee's media was opaque&gt;gray&gt;white. Cellular morphologies of white, gray, and opaque cells on Lee's media were also similar to those on YPD medium. The cellular morphology of gray cells was very similar to that of opaque cells of the haploid <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains recently reported by Hickman and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Hickman1">[19]</xref>. We, therefore, performed fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to assess ploidy, and found that all three cell types of BJ1097 are in fact diploid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).</p>

On YPD medium plates, white-to-gray and opaque-to-gray switching frequencies were 5.7%±0.7% and 89.7%±3.0%, respectively, indicating that the white and especially opaque phenotypes are not stable under this culture condition. On Lee's glucose and Lee's GlcNAc media, the white and the opaque phenotypes were relatively stable when cultured in air at 25°C, while the gray-to-opaque switching frequencies were 21.3%±0.4% and 17.6%±3.1%, respectively. The white, gray, and opaque phenotypes were also stable in liquid Lee's media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s013">Figure S5</xref>, the strain BJ1097 could switch among the white, gray, and opaque phenotypes in Lee's and YPD media at 37°C. Switching frequencies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figure 2B</xref>.

<title>Role of GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> in White-Gray-Opaque Tristable Transitions</title>
<p>GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> are white-to-opaque switching inducers, which are abundant in the host gut, a major niche of <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang3">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang4">[21]</xref>. Consistent with our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Xie2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang3">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang4">[21]</xref>, the combination of GlcNAc and CO<sub>2</sub> promoted white-to-opaque switching on Lee's medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). On YPD medium, the induction effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on the opaque phenotype was not obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s006">S6</xref>). The switching frequencies from opaque-to-gray were 89.7%±3.0% in air and 51.1%±4.4% in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that CO<sub>2</sub> has an effect on stabilizing the opaque phenotype on YPD medium. In 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, gray cells are more stable than white cells, which showed a high frequency to switch to the opaque phenotype on Lee's glucose and Lee's GlcNAc media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figure 2A and 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>At 37°C, opaque-to-gray switching on Lee's glucose and Lee's GlcNAc medium were 100% and 0.5%±0.4%, respectively, suggesting that GlcNAc can also stabilize the opaque phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However, neither GlcNAc nor CO<sub>2</sub> had a notable effect on white-gray transitions on three different media both at 25°C and at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figure 2A–2C</xref>).</p>

<title>The Presence of the Gray Phenotype in Other Clinical Isolates of <italic>C. albicans</italic></title>
<p>To test whether other clinical strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> could form the gray phenotype, we plated 30 clinical isolates of <italic>C. albicans</italic> on Lee's media and cultured them at 25°C. These strains are all competent at white-opaque switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Xie2">[17]</xref> and our unpublished data). We found that a subset of strains could switch to the gray phenotype. Six examples are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s006">Figure S7</xref>. The cellular morphology of gray cells of all these strains was similar to that of BJ1097.

For example, <italic>WOR1</italic>, <italic>WOR3</italic>, and <italic>OP4</italic> were enriched only in opaque cells, while <italic>EFG1</italic> was expressed in white and gray cells but not in opaque cells. <italic>WH11</italic> was enriched only in white cells. (2) Gray-enriched genes included cell wall-related (e.g., <italic>PGA26</italic> and <italic>SUN41</italic>), drug resistance-related genes (e.g., <italic>CSA2</italic>, <italic>orf19.3348</italic> and <italic>orf19.3475</italic>), stress-response-related (e.g., <italic>HSPs</italic>), metal ion metabolism-related genes (e.g., <italic>FRE7</italic> and <italic>FRE30</italic>), and some secreted enzymes (<italic>SAPs</italic> and <italic>LIP9</italic>). Notably, two oral infection-upregulated genes (<italic>orf19.6200</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Mayer1">[24]</xref> and <italic>orf19.6070</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Zakikhany1">[25]</xref>) were exclusively enriched in gray cells. (3) The expression profiles of metabolism-related genes, especially those involved in carbohydrate metabolism, exhibited distinct features from that of white and opaque cells. A small proportion of genes (&lt;10%), such as the NADH oxidase gene <italic>AOX2</italic> and the glycerol permease gene <italic>HGT10</italic>, were highly expressed in gray cells. About 30% of metabolism-related genes showed a similar expression level in gray cells to that of white cells, ∼20% to that of opaque cells, and ∼30% exhibited an intermediate level between white and opaque. Consistent with the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Lan1">[22]</xref>, white cells express a fermentative metabolism-gene profile, while opaque cells adopt an oxidative one. These results indicate that gray cells may have a unique metabolic mode, which is different from that of white and opaque cells. (4) A large set of genes encoding signaling peptide- or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-containing proteins were enriched in gray cells, including <italic>orf19.3378</italic>, <italic>orf19.3376</italic>, <italic>orf19.3117</italic>, <italic>orf19.6200</italic>, <italic>PGA26</italic>, and <italic>IFF8</italic>. (5) The absolute expression levels in opaque cells (indicated by the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads, or RPKM values) of <italic>SAP</italic> genes were much higher than those in white and gray cells. For example, the RPKM value of <italic>SAP1</italic> is over 20,000 in opaque cells, while it is less than 30 in both white and gray cells. Although the expression level of <italic>SAP7</italic> in gray cells is about 10-fold higher than that in opaque cells, the absolute expression levels in both cell types are very low (the RPKM values are 22 and 2 in gray and opaque cells, respectively).</p>

<title>White, Gray, and Opaque Cells Exhibit Differential Secreted Aspartyl Protease (Sap) Activity</title>
<p>The transcriptional profiles of the <italic>SAP</italic> genes, which are known major virulence factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Naglik1">[26]</xref>, were different in the three cell types. We therefore tested Sap activities using the yeast carbon base (YCB)-bovine serum albumin (BSA) medium assay. As expected, white cells showed lowest Sap activity, which is consistent with low expression levels of the <italic>SAP</italic> genes. However, we surprisingly found that gray cells exhibited higher Sap activity than opaque cells, indicated by the white halos of precipitated BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Quantitative Sap activity assays verified these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This result is inconsistent with the expression profiles of <italic>SAP</italic> genes in gray and opaque cells. Since the RNA-Seq analysis was performed in Lee's glucose medium (without BSA), we predicted that the YCB-BSA medium induced the expression of <italic>SAP</italic> genes in gray cells and thus increased Sap activity. To test this hypothesis, we performed quantitative Sap activity assays. As predicted, the Sap activity of opaque cells was higher than that of gray cells in Lee's glucose medium, but was lower than that of gray cells in the YCB-BSA medium. Using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>) and quantitative real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) assays, we further found that <italic>SAP1</italic> was constitutively expressed in opaque cells in both media. <italic>SAP2</italic> exhibited extremely low expression levels in all three cell types in Lee's medium, while its expression level was increased over thousands of times in gray cells cultured in the YCB-BSA medium. Taken together, these results imply that the three cell types are likely to have differential virulence characteristics at different host niches.</p>

<title>White, Gray, and Opaque Cells Differ in Virulence in a Murine Systemic Candidiasis Model and in Fungal Burdens at Different Host Organs</title>
<p>White cells were much more virulent than gray and opaque cells in the survival assay of systemic infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). At the higher inoculation concentration (3.75×10<sup>6</sup> cells per mouse), the order of virulence observed from highest to lowest was white cells&gt;opaque cells&gt;gray cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). At the lower inoculation concentration (1×10<sup>6</sup> cells per mouse), both gray and opaque cells exhibited similarly low virulence, while white cells killed all the infected mice in seven days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). We further performed competitive infections to evaluate the fungal burdens in different organs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, the three types of cells differed in fungal burdens in different organs, suggesting that the three cell types may have distinct abilities to invade and colonize different host tissues. For example, the fungal burden of white cells was higher than that of gray and opaque cells in the kidney, while the fungal burdens of gray and opaque cells were relatively higher than those of white cells in the liver and spleen. The fungal burdens of opaque cells were significantly higher than those of gray cells in four (liver, kidney, lung, and brain) of the five organs examined. These results were consistent with the data of survival assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

Consistently, SEM examinations at 48 hours post-inoculation revealed that gray and opaque cells caused significantly greater damage of the skin than white cells.

<title>Transcription Factors, Wor1 and Efg1, Are Master Regulators of the White-Gray-Opaque Tristable Switching System</title>
<p>The basic morphology of gray cells is similar to that of opaque cells, although the former is much smaller in cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s001">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s002">S2</xref>). Moreover, the key white-opaque switching regulator genes, <italic>WOR1</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic>, were differentially expressed in the three cell types. We therefore set out to test whether the gray phenotype is governed by Wor1 and Efg1. Deletion of <italic>WOR1</italic> blocked opaque cell formation but allowed white-gray transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g006">Figures 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s009">S9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s010">S10</xref>). Deletion of <italic>EFG1</italic> blocked white cell formation but allowed gray-opaque transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g006">Figures 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s009">S9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s010">S10</xref>). The frequencies of white-gray switching in the <italic>wor1/wor1</italic> mutant and gray-opaque switching in the <italic>efg1/efg1</italic> mutant are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s010">Figure S10</xref>. Given that Wor1 and Efg1 are essential for the formation of opaque and white cell types, respectively, we predicted that inactivating Wor1 and Efg1 simultaneously would block the formation of both the white and the opaque cell type and thus could only allow cells to exist in the gray phenotype. We, therefore, constructed a <italic>wor1/wor1 efg1/efg1</italic> double mutant. As predicted, the double mutant was locked in the gray phenotype and could not switch to the white or opaque phenotype under all culture conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g006">Figures 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s010">S10E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s010">S10F</xref>). The wild type (WT) control is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g006">Figure 6D</xref>. These results indicate that (1) neither Wor1 nor Efg1 is essential for gray cell formation; (2) both Wor1 and Efg1 could repress the formation of the gray phenotype; (3) Wor1 and Efg1 may work coordinately in the regulation of the white-gray-opaque phenotype.

The relatively high mating efficiency of gray cells could be partly due to their high switching frequency to the opaque phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To rule out this possibility and characterize the mating ability of gray cells, we next performed mating assays in the <italic>wor1/wor1</italic>, <italic>efg1/efg1</italic>, and <italic>wor1/wor1 efg1/efg1</italic> mutants. Gray cells of the <italic>wor1/wor1</italic> mutant mated about 2,000 times more efficiently than their white cell counterparts and 248 times more efficiently than white cells of the wild type.

<title>Environmental Cues Regulate White-Gray-Opaque Transitions</title>
<p>The tristable and heritable phenotypic switching system reported in this study may confer the pathogen with higher plasticity and capacity of environmental adaptation. White-gray-opaque transitions can both occur spontaneously and be induced by environmental cues. Although CO<sub>2</sub> and GlcNAc promote white-to-opaque switching and stabilize the opaque phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang4">[21]</xref>, they have no obvious effect on the induction of the gray phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, the rich YPD medium facilitates the formation of gray cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These results suggest that white and gray cells differ in response to environmental cues and that these three cell types may have different abilities to adapt to specific host niches.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Phase-Specific Gene Expression Profiles, Saps, Virulence, and Niche Adaptation</title>
<p>White, gray, and opaque cells show distinct global gene expression profiles. The gray cell type-enriched genes include these encoding secreted enzymes, cell wall and surface proteins, metabolism- and antifungal-related proteins, and filamentation-regulators. This unique gene expression profile could contribute to a number of important biological traits of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, such as filamentation and biofilm formation, virulence, and resistance to antifungals. For example, a large set of genes encoding cell wall, membrane, and extracellular proteins, was upregulated in gray cells. These proteins directly interact with the extracellular environment and may play critical roles in sensing and responding to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Secreted proteinases, including Saps in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, play important roles in nutrient acquisition, tissue adherence, invasion, and infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Naglik1">[26]</xref>. Interestingly, although the expression of a number of <italic>SAP</italic> genes was only enriched in opaque cells in Lee's glucose medium, gray cells exhibited higher Sap activity than opaque cells in the BSA-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). The inducible expression mode of <italic>SAP2</italic> could confer advantages to gray cells over white and opaque cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>SAP2</italic> mRNA is highly upregulated in a reconstituted human epithelial (RHE) infection model and critical for epithelial tissue damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Schaller1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Nailis1">[32]</xref>. Constitutive expression of <italic>SAP</italic> genes in opaque cells could cost and waste a lot of energy to the cell, and the damaging effects of Saps could evoke strong host immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Pande1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Naglik1">[26]</xref>. The expression of <italic>SAP</italic> genes would not favor the commensal life style of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The low Sap activity of white cells limits certain infection abilities, especially the ability to cause cutaneous infections. Inducible expression of Sap activity could also play a balancing role in the transition between the commensal and pathogenic life styles in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The major components of the skin surface are proteins, such as collagen, elastin, and keratin. Like BSA, these proteins could also induce Sap activity in gray cells. Consistent with this idea, the skin damage and nutrient acquisition abilities of white, gray, and opaque cells correspond to their respective Sap activities exhibited in BSA-containing media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g005">5D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s008">S8</xref>). Gray cells and opaque cells are less virulent in the systemic infection model possibly due to their weaker abilities to filament compared to white cells (unpublished data). Gray cells and opaque cells propagated faster than white cells in an ex vivo tongue infection model and led to more serious damages in an in vivo skin infection model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s007">Figure S8</xref>). These results are consistent with previous studies in terms of the correlation between Sap activity and cutaneous infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Naglik1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the three cell types differ in fungal burdens in different organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that they may play distinct and specific roles in systemic infections. The distinct global transcriptional profiles and differential Sap activities of the three different cell types may contribute to the adaptability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to inhabit a diverse number of host niches and to propagate in different tissues.</p>

<title>Roles of the <italic>MTL</italic> Locus, Wor1, and Efg1 in the Regulation of White-Gray-Opaque Transitions</title>
<p>The <italic>MTL</italic> locus is involved in the regulation of white-opaque switching and sexual mating in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Miller1">[7]</xref>. Here we found that the white-gray-opaque tristable switching system is independent of the regulation of the <italic>MTL</italic> locus. Although only a subset of <italic>C. albicans</italic> clinical strains undergo the tristable switch under the culture conditions tested, we suggest that this phenotypic switching system may be a general feature of natural <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains, and most, if not all, strains could do this under certain conditions (e.g., in certain niches of the host).</p>
<p>Wor1 is the master regulator of white-opaque switching and is essential for opaque cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g006">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s009">S9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s010">S10</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Zordan1">[16]</xref>. Efg1 plays a negative role in white-to-opaque switching and is essential for white cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s010">S10</xref>). Wor1 and Efg1, together with transcription factors Czf1, Wor2, and Wor3, form interlocking transcriptional feedback loops controlling white-opaque switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Zordan2">[18]</xref>. Although neither Wor1 nor Efg1 is required for the formation of the gray phenotype, deletion of both <italic>WOR1</italic> and <italic>EFG1</italic> locks cells in the gray phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g006">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s009">S9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s010">S10</xref>). These results suggest that different transcriptional circuitries may be involved in the regulation of white-gray and gray-opaque transitions. Together with other unidentified regulators, Wor1 and Efg1 may coordinately govern the formation of gray cells. On phloxine B-containing media, the cellular and colony morphologies of the <italic>wor1/wor1 efg1/efg1</italic> double mutant we generated are similar to those of the <italic>wor1/wor1 efg1/efg1</italic> double mutant in the SC5314 background constructed by Hnisz and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Hnisz1">[33]</xref>, suggesting that derivatives of SC5314 also have the potential to switch to the gray phenotype. Both CO<sub>2</sub> and GlcNAc induce white-to-opaque switching predominantly via activating the Wor1 regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang4">[21]</xref>; however, neither of these stimuli had an obvious effect on the induction of white-to-gray switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This is reasonable because the expression level of <italic>WOR1</italic> is very low in gray cells and Wor1 is not required for the formation of gray cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s011">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>The Gray Cell Type Differs from the Reported “GUT” Cell Type</title>
<p>Gray cells also differ from the recently reported GUT cell type (gastrointestinally induced transition) in several aspects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Pande1">[4]</xref>. First, GUT cells resemble opaque cells in shape and cell size but lack cell wall surface pimples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Pande1">[4]</xref>. Gray cells are much smaller than both opaque and GUT cells. Second, GUT cells have been reported to exist only in the animal gut and have not been found to be stable in vitro culture conditions, while gray cells are very stable in a variety of laboratory culture conditions. Third, several virulence genes including <italic>SAPs</italic>, are downregulated in GUT cells, while gray cells have a higher Sap activity than white and opaque cells in the presence of BSA. The switching characteristic, together with the unique aspects of gray cells discussed above, indicates that the gray phenotype is a novel morphological phenotype.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3e">
<title>Is the Gray Cell Type an Intermediate of the White and Opaque Phenotypes?</title>
<p>A number of reasons suggest that the gray cell type is not an intermediate of the white and opaque phenotypes. First, white cells can directly switch to the opaque phenotype under some culture conditions at high frequencies without an intermediate phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001830-g002">Figure 2</xref>), and vice versa. Consistently, the frequencies of white-to-opaque switching is even higher than that of gray-to-opaque switching under certain conditions, suggesting that conversion to the gray phenotype is not necessary to facilitate the formation of opaque cells. Second, the key regulators of white-opaque switching, Wor1 and Efg1, are not required for the maintenance of the gray phenotype. If the gray phenotype were an intermediate of the white and opaque phenotypes, one would expect that the expression levels of white- or opaque-phase specific genes, such as <italic>WOR1</italic>, <italic>EFG1, WH11</italic>, and <italic>OP4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang1">[2]</xref>, would be at intermediate levels in gray cells. However, this was not the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s011">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001830.s012">S2</xref>). Third, the order of Sap activities from highest to lowest is gray&gt;opaque&gt;white cells. In this sense, the opaque phenotype is an intermediate of the white and gray phenotypes. Fourth, the gray phenotype is not transient, but heritable, and can be maintained for many generations. Fifth, similar to white and opaque cells, gray cells exhibit a unique global gene expression profile.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of phenotypic changes will provide insights into several fundamental questions such as how pathogens adapt to the host and survive and propagate under diverse niches. Here we add the gray morphology and the white-gray-opaque tristable transitions to the list of known fungal morphological switching systems. This study provides an example of multiple stable and heritable switching systems, indicating that the regulation of morphological forms to adapt to environmental changes could be much more elaborate than previously thought. Our study also sheds new insight on the regulatory mechanism of the transition between commensal and pathogenic life styles in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Exploring the molecular basis of this tristable phenotypic switching system and its role in host adaptation will be important for seeking new strategies to treat infections caused by the major fungal pathogen of humans.</p>

<p>The tristable switching assays were performed similarly to previously described white-opaque bistable switching assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001830-Huang4">[21]</xref>.

For competition experiments, 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells of each type (white, gray, or opaque) of BJ1097 were mixed with 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells of SC5314N (Nou<sup>R</sup>, locked in white phase) in 250 µl PBS and then injected into a mouse via tail vein. Mice were humanely killed at 24 hours after injection. Different organs were used for fungal burden assays. BJ1097 is sensitive to 100 µg/ml nourseothricin (clonNAT). To generate the nourseothricin resistant strain SC5314N, pNIM1 was linearized and integrated into the laboratory strain SC5314. Organ tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain) were homogenated, diluted in PBS, and plated on Lee's medium for 3 days of growth at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for colony-forming unit (CFU) calculation. Colony morphologies of SC5314N and BJ1097 were distinguishable. SC5314N formed wrinkled and filamentous colonies, while BJ1097 formed smooth colonies under this culture condition. SC5314N and BJ1097 were also subject to the nourseothricin susceptibility test. Both colony morphology and nourseothricin susceptibility assays were used to distinguish SC5314N and BJ1097 formed colonies.
