        <p>Whole genome duplication in teleost fish reveals that a few changes in non-regulatory genomic sequences are a source for generating new enhancers.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Evolutionary innovation relies partially on changes in gene regulation. While a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated. Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. For this, we took advantage of the massive gene loss following the last whole genome duplication in teleosts to systematically identify regions that have lost their coding capacity but retain sequence conservation with mammals. We found that these regions show enhancer activity while the orthologous coding regions have no regulatory activity. These results demonstrate that these enhancers have been de novo generated in fish. By revealing that minor changes in non-regulatory sequences are sufficient to generate new enhancers, our study highlights an important playground for creating new regulatory variability and evolutionary innovation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The genome of each living organism contains thousands of genes, and the precise control of the timing and location of expression of these genes is key for normal development and homeostasis of each individual. Despite the oftentimes high genetic similarity between organisms, the source of phenotypic differences, for example between human and mouse, is thought to originate mainly from changes in how and when genes are expressed. This is partially determined by enhancers, that contribute to the control of gene expression. For decades, duplication of existing genomic enhancers, mobile elements, and changes in the sequence of existing enhancers were believed to be the major ways of increasing the number and modifying the activity of enhancers. In this study, we show that enhancers don't have to be derived from pre-existing ones but can also appear de novo in regions of the genome that were previously not regulating gene expression. We analyzed teleost fish genomes and found three regions for which a limited number of changes in the DNA sequence was sufficient to generate new enhancers. We predict that such a process is frequent in vertebrate genomes, making de novo generation of enhancers an important mechanism for creating variation in gene expression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The question of the evolutionary origin and modification of enhancer elements is central for understanding the dynamics of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Wray1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Chan1">[3]</xref>. A growing body of evidence points out that new enhancers evolve from existing ones via duplication. According to the classic model of evolution by duplication as put forward by Ohno <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Ohno1">[4]</xref>, the duplicated copies are used as starting material for variation in the binding site composition, which modifies the respective enhancer's activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Gompel1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Rebeiz2">[10]</xref>. Mobile genetic elements have also been shown to have regulatory activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Bejerano1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Sasaki1">[12]</xref> or bear transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Bourque1">[13]</xref>, and thus, their translocation can be associated with changes in gene expression.</p>
      <p>While the modification/translocation of those pre-existing elements has been shown to play an important functional role, they may only contribute to a fraction of the regulatory innovation. Indeed, recent findings using large-scale comparative analysis of regulatory features have shown that single binding sites can vary extensively between closely related species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Schmidt1">[14]</xref> or even between individuals of the same species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Kasowski1">[15]</xref>. Further supporting the flexibility of regulatory elements, tissue-specific enhancers such as heart enhancers have been shown to be poorly conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Blow1">[16]</xref> and examples of lineage/specie-specific enhancers have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Romano1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Brown1">[18]</xref>. Recently it has been reported that the genomic positions of tissue-specific enhancers of the <italic>yellow</italic> gene differ between <italic>Drosophila</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Kalay1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Taken together, these results are suggesting that complete autonomous enhancer elements containing all the necessary binding sites in the correct arrangement can be lineage specific. Nevertheless it is currently unclear whether these apparent lineage-specific enhancers appear de novo or are derived from pre-existing enhancers whose sequences have diverged too much to be identifiable. In order to show the de novo nature of these lineage-specific enhancers, a strategy to identify the orthologous regions and test them for enhancer activity is needed.</p>
      <p>In this report we identify de novo enhancers by searching for special cases that we refer to as “Recycled Regions” (RRs). An RR is a region with enhancer function in one lineage that remains identifiable in another lineage due to sequence constraints imposed by a different kind of function. These scenarios are likely to be very rare in stable genomes. Thus, we took advantage of the most recent Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) in teleosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Jaillon1">[20]</xref> followed by a massive loss of the duplicated coding genes. It is estimated that 75% of the duplicated genes lost one copy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Jaillon1">[20]</xref>. Initially, while one of the duplicated copies remained a coding gene, the other copy lost its coding function and accumulated nucleotide changes. In rare cases, the sequence from the non-coding copy became constrained if a regulatory function arose de novo. Those regulatory sequences are alignable to their coding orthologs if the selection for the new function took place soon enough. Hence we used the ancestral coding function as an evolutionary trap to identify orthologous sequences of the enhancer across lineages (mammalian, cartilaginous fish, and teleost) and assessed whether these enhancers are generated de novo in the teleost lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

          <title>Using an evolutionary trap to identify de novo enhancer sequences.</title>
          <p>(A) After Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) in teleost fish, one copy of an ancestrally coding sequence lost its coding function and acquired a regulatory function instead (blue branch). The sequence is retained in the fish genome because of the selection acting on the new function while the orthologous sequences in mammalian and shark are retained because of the coding function (red branches). If the gain of the regulatory activity happened sufficiently fast after the loss of the coding function, all sequences (human, fish, and shark) can be detected using standard alignment algorithms. Thus, the de novo nature of the regulatory function in fish is addressable. The evolutionary time since the divergence from the last common ancestor is taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Kumar1">[35]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Christoffels1">[63]</xref>. (B) Schematic example of an evolutionary scenario leading to the appearance of de novo enhancers: The recycled locus (RL) in fish has lost the gene (red), but one region (blue) in the RL is still alignable to one human exon. This region we refer to as a “Recycled Region” (RR) and is a good candidate for having a de novo acquired regulatory function controlling the expression of the neighbouring gene (orange). The approach used to identify such a scenario is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and Computational Pipeline. (C) Schematic overview of human loci and both duplicated loci in medaka for all candidate RRs: As in (B), the human gene corresponding to the RR is shown in red, the medaka RR is shown in blue. The putative target gene(s) of the RR is in orange. For ttc29<sup>RR</sup> the homologous coding sequence was not found in medaka. The presence of two intact <italic>dock9</italic> genes in medaka is likely the result of an additional duplication unrelated to the WGD in fish. Only genes flanking the RR and their orthologs are shown. For clarity, all genes (except for the red genes) are shown as two exon genes, even though they may contain more exons. Gene names written above the schematic representation indicate the location on the “plus” strand, names written below indicate location of the gene on the “minus” strand. The distances between genes do not reflect the actual genomic distances.</p>

        <title>Identification of the Recycled Regions</title>
        <p>We developed an algorithm to systematically search for the RRs in teleost fish genomes that satisfy the corresponding criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g001">Figure 1B</xref>): (1) are located in the locus corresponding to the lost copy of a duplicated gene; (2) despite no evidence for the coding function, are conserved with part of the human coding ortholog; and (3) as experimental validation is performed during embryogenesis, we selected those RRs flanked by at least one gene annotated to be involved in development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, Computational Pipeline). The algorithm was first run on the stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) genome because of the high quality of the gene annotation and assembly, and later the results were transferred to the <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> (medaka) genome. Our analysis identified four RRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s010">Table S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s011">Table S2</xref>) as putative de novo regulatory regions satisfying the above criteria. Those RRs are conserved across teleosts including <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (zebrafish), suggesting that they appear after the WGD but before the Cypriniformes-Euteleostei split.</p>

        <title>The Recycled Regions Show Enhancer Activity</title>
        <p>We investigated the enhancer activity of the four medaka RRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s010">Table S1</xref>) using an in vivo reporter assay in medaka that we previously developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Mongin1">[21]</xref>. We cloned the four RRs extended with a maximum of 200 bp flanking sequences upstream of an hsp70 minimal promoter and a reporter gene (<italic>gfp</italic>). The basal expression of the hsp70 minimal promoter in the lens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Blechinger1">[22]</xref> was used as injection control. We found that all four regions tested drive reporter gene expression in specific structures in the medaka embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g002">Figure 2A–D</xref>). The assay is highly reproducible, resulting in a consistent expression pattern in a large fraction of embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s012">Table S3</xref>). The onset of reporter gene expression depends on the nature of the RR and varies from developmental stage 20 (fam44b<sup>RR</sup>) to stage 32 (dock9<sup>RR</sup>) and is in all cases maintained in juvenile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and adult fish (unpublished data). Moreover, the specific expression pattern observed in injected embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s012">Table S3</xref>) is retained in stable lines. In line with our hypothesis, these results show enhancer activity for all four RR reporter constructs. We further addressed the contribution of the four RRs to the observed enhancer activity by deleting the orthologous regions corresponding to the exon, leaving only the flanking regions from the reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–D). In two cases, the deletion constructs completely abolished reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s003">Figure S3E</xref>–F). For ccdc46<sup>RR</sup>, the deletion altered and massively reduced the reporter gene expression to a few cells in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s003">Figure S3G</xref>). Only for fam44b<sup>RR</sup> did the deletion construct not abolish the original enhancer activity of the full construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s003">Figure S3H</xref>) and therefore fam44b<sup>RR</sup> was excluded from further analysis. These results demonstrate that three out of four RRs are necessary for enhancer activity.</p>

        <title>Recycled Regions Recapitulate Part of the Flanking Gene Expression Patterns</title>
        <p>We next investigated whether the enhancer activity of the remaining three RRs recapitulates aspects of the expression pattern of flanking genes. For this, we analysed the in situ expression pattern of those genes. We found that in all cases RR-driven reporter gene expression temporally and spatially resembles the expression of at least one of the respective flanking genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s004">Figure S4</xref>). To further confirm this, we performed double fluorescent whole mount in situ hybridisation on stable transgenic lines by combining probes for the reporter and the flanking genes. In all cases, we identified at least one flanking gene that recapitulates key aspects of the expression pattern of the RR-driven reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In particular, both ttc29<sup>RR</sup>-driven GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and the flanking gene <italic>pou4f2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) are expressed in the optic tectum and retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). dock9<sup>RR</sup> shows very specific enhancer activity in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g003">Figure 3E,H</xref>) as do the neighbouring genes <italic>zic5</italic> and <italic>zic2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g003">Figure 3D,G</xref>), which exhibit an expression pattern that includes the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g003">Figure 3F,I</xref>).

        <p>Two possible evolutionary scenarios may account for our results obtained so far: (1) the ancestral function was both regulatory and coding or (2) the ancestral vertebrate sequence was coding but the teleosts have lost that function in one of the duplicated copies and acquired regulatory function instead (which supports the de novo enhancer hypothesis). For the former scenario, dual functions on the same region have been hypothesised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Dong1">[26]</xref> and shown for several cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Neznanov1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Woltering1">[32]</xref> while the latter scenario has not been shown so far. To shed light on the ancestral state of the RRs, we investigated the RRs in lineages that diverged prior to the last WGD in teleosts.</p>

        <title>Orthologous Regions in Non-Teleost Lineages Show No Enhancer Activity</title>
        <p>In species that have diverged prior to the teleost-tetrapod split (e.g., elephant shark (<italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>) or ciona (<italic>Ciona savignyi</italic>)) the sequences corresponding to the three RRs showed an open reading frame (ORF) spanning the coding exon that is in frame with the human ORF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s005">Figure S5</xref>). For both <italic>TTC29</italic> and <italic>CCDC46</italic> we also found EST evidence in the ciona lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s011">Table S2</xref>). These results show that the RRs ancestral sequences were very likely to have been coding at the split of the teleost-tetrapod lineages.</p>
        <p>We next investigated the evolutionary dynamics of these regions by analysing the similarity between the human coding exon and the orthologous regions in various lineages at both the amino-acid (AA) and nucleotide level. We found that the percentage identity at the nucleotide level is higher for the fish RRs, while the similarity at the AA level is higher for all other lineages, including the fish coding paralog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Consistent with the alignment similarities, the ratio of non-synonymous compared to synonymous base pair changes (Ka/Ks) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Goldman1">[33]</xref> is increased for the RRs compared to the coding homologs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s006">Figure S6</xref>). In accordance with the results obtained so far, these data further support the hypothesis that (1) the RRs were ancestrally coding and (2) the fish RRs are under a selection acting at the nucleotide rather than at the AA level. These data suggest that the RRs were ancestrally not regulatory since the Ka/Ks ratio between human and shark or ciona would favour a selection acting at the AA level only.</p>
        <p>To test the nature (regulatory or non-regulatory) of the ancestral state at the tetrapod-teleost split, we further explored the enhancer activity of the exons homologous to the RRs in two independent lineages (mouse and elephant shark) as well as the coding paralog in fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

For ttc29<sup>RR</sup> no homologous coding sequences were found in medaka and shark. While only one stage is represented, the monitoring of the reporter gene expression is performed throughout the embryonic development (except for the mouse transgenic assay where the specific stage is annotated on the figure).

As the exon orthologous to the RRs was tested in the Medaka embryo, the absence of activity could be due to trans-regulatory changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Ritter1">[34]</xref>. To rule out this hypothesis, the mouse exons orthologous to the RRs were tested directly in mouse. Again, in none of the cases tested was an enhancer activity detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g004">Figure 4</xref> and Material and Methods), confirming that the mouse exons orthologous to the RRs have no enhancer activity (at the time point assayed).</p>
        <p>The results obtained so far provide convincing evidence that the enhancer function in teleosts was de novo acquired in this lineage. As most of the de novo genesis of enhancers is expected to occur in “neutrally” evolving sequences, these cases of de novo enhancers deriving from cooption may constitute a very small subset of all possible de novo enhancers.</p>
        <p>We roughly estimate at several thousands the number of de novo enhancers under positive selection since the tetrapod-teleost split (450 mya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Kumar1">[35]</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s013">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s007">Figure S7</xref> for a more detailed analysis of the estimation of the number of de novo enhancers). Considering that those de novo elements under purifying selection may constitute only a tiny fraction of all possible regulatory elements generated, the rate of genesis of new enhancers (regardless of their evolutionary fate) may be very high in vertebrate genomes. While this estimation of the number of de novo enhancers is only tentative and based on a number of assumptions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s013">Text S1</xref>), a more accurate prediction of the de novo enhancers across various phylogenetic branches of vertebrates will require further studies. Nonetheless, these results highlight the importance of the genesis of enhancers and provide one possible explanation amongst others of the widespread observation that a large fraction of TFBSs appears non-conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-ENCODE1">[36]</xref>. Nonetheless, those TFBSs forming de novo enhancers may represent only a fraction of all the apparent lineage-specific binding sites found by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to predict what the possible TFBS involved in the generation of the de novo enhancers are, we further investigated at the sequence level the difference in terms of putative TFBSs between the RRs and the exons (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We found from five to seven binding sites in the medaka RRs that are specific to teleosts and are not present in other vertebrate species nor in the predicted ancestral reconstruction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s008">Figure S8</xref>).

        <title>Function of the De Novo Enhancers in Gene Regulation</title>
        <p>These de novo enhancers may either confer additional domains of expression to their target genes or rather act as redundant enhancers. To tackle the functional consequences of the de novo enhancers, we took advantage of a conserved block flanking the ccdc46<sup>RR</sup> homologous exon previously shown to be bound by p300 in mouse forebrain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s009">Figure S9</xref>, orange bar, upper panel) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Visel1">[38]</xref>. We tested the mouse extended region containing both the p300 pulldown region and the extended exonic sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s009">Figure S9</xref>, light green bar, upper panel) and detected enhancer activity in the medaka forebrain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). This activity was not altered when deleting the exonic sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s009">Figure S9</xref>, blue bar, upper panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s009">Figure S9B</xref>), demonstrating that the exon itself is not required for enhancer function (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Similarly, the shark and medaka sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s009">Figure S9</xref>, orange bar, lower panel) orthologous to the mouse p300-bound enhancer also show forebrain activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s009">Figure S9C</xref>–D). These results demonstrate that the p300-bound enhancer element is an ancestral feature and suggest that the nearby ccdc46<sup>RR</sup> de novo enhancer in fish has complementary function to reinforce the forebrain expression rather than creating a new expression domain. Similarly dock9<sup>RR</sup> is active in the medaka cerebellum, while the mouse <italic>zic</italic>2 and 5 genes are also expressed in this structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Nagai1">[39]</xref>.</p>
        <p>While those de novo enhancers may still quantitatively modify the transcript level within the cell or activate transcription in related cell types within the same domains, these results favour the hypothesis of redundant enhancer. This hypothesis is supported by the recent finding that redundant enhancers confer phenotypic robustness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Frankel2">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Perry1">[41]</xref> and thus are likely to be selected for.</p>
        <p>Similar to TFBS turnover by the de novo emergence of new binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Dermitzakis1">[42]</xref>, complete enhancers may also be turned over, leading to the disappearance of the ancestral element.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>It has long been thought that new functions emerge primarily by duplication and/or modification of existing functional elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Force1">[43]</xref>. On the gene level, this view has begun to change with the recent publication of several studies reporting the de novo origin of genes in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Cai1">[44]</xref>, drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Levine1">[45]</xref>, and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Knowles1">[46]</xref>. In this study we show that not only genes but also enhancers can be de novo generated.</p>
      <p>De novo genesis of enhancers raises the question of how evolution can produce such complex functional elements. Indeed, enhancers were generally believed to have a stringent regulatory code, and thus the odds for generating a de novo enhancer were believed to be low. Recent studies have already started challenging that view by pointing either to the flexibility of this code <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Brown1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Zinzen1">[47]</xref> or the rapid turnover of binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Schmidt1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Kasowski1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Dermitzakis1">[42]</xref>. It is possible that the appearance of new binding sites can not only modify pre-existing enhancer but also lead to the creation of completely new autonomous enhancers.</p>
      <p>This work further shows the relative “facility” of conferring regulatory activities to non-regulatory sequences. Consequently, the birth of regulatory elements is a highly dynamic property of vertebrate genomes and should also be considered as an evolutionary toolkit for innovation. The results of this study have significant implications, notably in the gene regulation and medical genetic fields by pointing out that genomic variation could lead to the generation of enhancers in regions with no apparent regulatory function. As such variation may also lead to altered gene expression, more attention should be devoted to variation in so-called “neutral” DNA.</p>

          <title>Summary of the computational pipeline</title>
          <p>In order to find RRs we undertook a conservative analysis of the stickleback non-coding genomic sequences mapping to the human exome. For this, a total of 282,599 human annotated exons were mapped to the stickleback genome using BLASTZ. BLASTZ is a sensitive alignment tool suited for non-coding genomic sequences. In order to retain only the stickleback non-coding regions, hits matching even partially an annotated exon in stickleback were removed. To identify putative RRs we took advantage of the last WGD in teleosts followed by the massive loss of the duplicated genes. Only hits in the syntenic loci between human and stickleback were further processed. From the WGD, two such syntenic loci per human locus can be found in fish (one locus contains the functional protein, while the other locus has lost the gene). Thus we restrict the search to only hits containing stop codon(s) disrupting the ORF and found in the locus of the lost gene. Such hits are good candidates for having acquired a de novo enhancer function controlling nearby genes. As experimental validation is performed during embryogenesis, we further selected those hits flanked by at least one gene annotated to be involved in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001188-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

For each exon, hits on the stickleback genome within 1 kb from each other are considered to be part of the same regulatory unit and were therefore fused. To deplete the dataset from un-annotated genes or exons, only exons from human genes with at least one annotated ortholog in stickleback were further considered. Any hits within 2 Mb of the stickleback ortholog(s) locus were removed.

Genomic candidate regions (extended to a maximum of 200 bp on each side) tested in the enhancer assay were amplified from genomic DNA of medaka, inbred CAB strain (extraction described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-MartinezMorales1">[56]</xref>), mouse (C57BL/6 strain, kind gift from F. Spitz), and elephant shark (<italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>, kind gift from B. Venkatesh) using standard PCR methods. For the dock9 mouse and shark exon constructs, only the exon and 200 bp downstream sequence could be cloned. The 200 bp upstream sequence corresponds to a repeat and could not be amplified. The deletion-constructs were generated by applying a PCR-driven “splicing by overlap extension” approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Heckman1">[57]</xref>. For the deletion constructs, in all reporter gene constructs the sequence corresponding to the human exon (the putative RR) was spliced and the flanking genomic sequences were fused. Coordinates of the fused fragments are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s012">Table S3</xref>.</p>
          <p>The enhancer assay was performed as described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Mongin1">[21]</xref>. In short, genomic sequences were cloned into a transgenesis-vector upstream of a zebrafish hsp70 minimal promoter and GFP reporter gene flanked by I-SceI Meganuclease sites using standard cloning techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Sambrook1">[58]</xref>. The constructs were sequenced in order to verify the sequence and the orientation of the cloned regions. Deletions and orthologous constructs were cloned in the same orientation relative to the reporter gene compared to the RR constructs. Meganuclease-mediated transgenesis by injection into one-cell stage medaka embryos (heino or cab strains) was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Thermes1">[59]</xref>. The hsp70 core promoter triggers a strong and specific lens expression from stage 28 on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001188-Blechinger1">[22]</xref>, and this feature is used to calculate the percentage of specific expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s012">Table S3</xref>). Stable transgenic lines for all positive enhancer constructs were obtained. Images of transient/stable transgenic embryos were taken using an Olympus MVX10 fluorescence microscope with a Leica DC500 camera or a Leica SPE confocal microscope (10× dipping lens). Images were assembled and processed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop. All confocal images displayed are Z-projections of stacks.</p>

The alignments spanning the human exon coordinates were done by retrieving the 46-way multiz hg19 alignments for selected species.

In the case of dock9<sup>RR</sup> the alignment shown spans the length of the shark coding part of the exon (shortest coding part). Percentage identity at the nucleotide (NT) level (blue) and the percentage identity/similarity at the AA level (red) were calculated between human and the other sequences. The medaka RRs show a higher identity on the NT level than on the AA level (red arrow), contrasting with regions in other species, where the selective pressure is acting on the AA level. The Ka/Ks ratio between human and the medaka RRs, the medaka coding exon, and the coding exon of an outgroup species (ciona for <italic>TTC29</italic> or shark for <italic>DOCK9 and CCDC46</italic>) were calculated.

          <p>The number of putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is lower in coding exons compared to non-exonic regions and experimentally validated enhancers. (A) For most structural classes of transcription factors, a higher number of putative binding sites is found in medaka non-coding regions (regions randomly picked and regions directly flanking the coding exon) than in coding exons, suggesting that coding sequences are less likely to acquire enhancer function compared to non-coding sequences. The total number of binding sites found is 21,480 for the coding exon dataset, 38,840 for the random dataset, and 47,203 for the exon-flanking dataset. (B) The number of binding sites per 200 bp (S200) tend to be lower for exons compared to experimentally validated enhancers. Both distributions show an overlap of only 60% (regulatory potential of exons: 60%). The S200 of the ccdc46<sup>RR</sup>, ttc29<sup>RR</sup>, and dock9<sup>RR</sup> are also represented. (C) Conversely, the distribution of S200 of non-coding sequences is very similar to the enhancers reaching the regulatory potential of non-coding regions is 95% (C) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001188.s013">Text S1</xref> for more details).</p>
