<p>Proliferating hepatocytes in the liver show an atypical, asymmetric mode of cell division, which is coordinated by Par1b and LGN and may explain the unique tissue architecture of the liver.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The development and maintenance of polarized epithelial tissue requires a tightly controlled orientation of mitotic cell division relative to the apical polarity axis. Hepatocytes display a unique polarized architecture. We demonstrate that mitotic hepatocytes asymmetrically segregate their apical plasma membrane domain to the nascent daughter cells. The non-polarized nascent daughter cell can form a de novo apical domain with its new neighbor. This asymmetric segregation of apical domains is facilitated by a geometrically distinct “apicolateral” subdomain of the lateral surface present in hepatocytes. The polarity protein partitioning-defective 1/microtubule-affinity regulating kinase 2 (Par1b/MARK2) translates this positional landmark to cortical polarity by promoting the apicolateral accumulation of Leu-Gly-Asn repeat-enriched protein (LGN) and the capture of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA)–positive astral microtubules to orientate the mitotic spindle. Proliferating hepatocytes thus display an asymmetric inheritance of their apical domains via a mechanism that involves Par1b and LGN, which we postulate serves the unique tissue architecture of the developing liver parenchyma.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The development and maintenance of the polarized epithelial architecture and function of organs that form tubular “lumen” structures is important for normal physiology and, when deregulated, gives rise to disease. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of a strict coordination of the orientation of mitotic divisions relative to an internal axis of asymmetry in proliferating epithelial cells during this process. Hepatocytes are the predominant epithelial cells of the liver. Hepatocytes display a unique lumen-forming architecture and cellular asymmetry, but the molecular basis for this special polarized architecture is not well understood. Our study now reveals an unexpected mode of plasma membrane domain inheritance that is coupled to a cellular axis of asymmetry in proliferating mammalian hepatocytes. We show that mitotic hepatocytes asymmetrically segregate their apical plasma membrane (the membrane facing the lumen structure) along with the lumen to their daughter cells. We demonstrate that the coordinated action of two proteins, Par1b and LGN, constitutes a fundamental part of the underlying molecular mechanism. This coupling of cell division and polarity in hepatocytes is distinct from that established in other epithelial cell types. These findings are important for understanding the unique polarized tissue architecture in the developing liver.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The liver is a vital organ. Hepatocytes occupy more than 85% of the parenchymal liver mass and are responsible for a wide range of biological processes. These include the synthesis of plasma proteins and the processing of nutrients and toxic compounds from the blood that passes through the liver sinusoids. Hepatocytes also produce and secrete bile. Bile contributes to fat emulsion in the intestine and the elimination of detoxified compounds via the feces. Hepatocytes form a branching network of bile canaliculi between the cells that efficiently drains the secreted bile out of the liver parenchyme while keeping it separate from the blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Fu1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Fu2">[2]</xref>. The microanatomy of this canalicular network is unique to the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Treyer1">[3]</xref>. Defects in the bile canalicular network and bile flow are associated with liver diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Li1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the cell biological principles and molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of the bile canalicular network is limited. This is in part due to the lack of in vitro cell culture model systems that combine cell proliferation and canalicular network formation. Nevertheless, different in vitro cell model systems can reproduce specific steps in the process of bile canalicular network formation. For instance, from early microscopy studies of embryonic rat livers we know that the formation of isolated small spherical lumens between mitotically active hepatocytes is the first step in bile canalicular network development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Wood1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Zinchuk1">[8]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and this process is reproduced by hepatic HepG2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-VanIJzendoorn1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Ohgaki1">[10]</xref> and WIF-B9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Ihrke1">[11]</xref> cell lines. Both in vivo and in vitro, the formation of these primordial intercellular lumens is accompanied by the segregation of the hepatocyte surface into a lumen-facing apical domain and a sinusoid-facing basal domain, each with a specific protein and lipid composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Feracci1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Ihrke1">[11]</xref>. The establishment of cell surface domains is the hallmark of apical–basal cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Apodaca1">[12]</xref>.</p>

<p>The early establishment of apical–basal polarity is instrumental for the functional shaping of a proliferating epithelial cell mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Gillies1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Pease1">[14]</xref>. Indeed, dividing cells not only generate enough critical cell mass to create the tissue, but they also make use of their apical–basal polarity axis (PA) to orientate their mitotic spindle apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Morin1">[15]</xref>. By orientating its mitotic spindle apparatus, the dividing polarized epithelial cell can control the position of the emerging new nuclei, and hence the position of the daughter cells, relative to the position of the primordial apical domain and lumen. The same principles are used when dividing cells repair tissue damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Song1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The unique microanatomy of the bile canalicular network suggests that the mode of cell division orientation in hepatocytes—from the moment that they have established apical–basal polarity—differs from that observed in “simple” epithelial cells such as intestinal or kidney epithelial cells. Indeed, simple epithelial cells do not develop a canalicular network between cells. Instead, they develop large cystic lumens and tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) via a process that is dependent on a Leu-Gly-Asn repeat-enriched protein (LGN)–mediated orientation of the mitotic spindle apparatus that is strictly perpendicular to the apical–basal axis, and the resultant symmetric segregation of the apical domain to both daughter cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Jaffe1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Zheng1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). A mitotic spindle orientation that is strictly perpendicular to the apical PA would in mitotic hepatocytes thus be predicted to promote the development of cystic lumens rather than of canalicular networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to investigate the orientation of the mitotic spindle in hepatocytes within their native environment, immunohistochemistry can be performed on fixed liver tissues. To study the molecular regulation and the dynamics of mitotic spindle orientation and cell division in hepatocytes, cell lines are the best model of choice. In this study we have combined the analysis of liver tissues with that of HepG2 and WIF-B9 cell lines to investigate the relationship between cell polarity and the orientations of the mitotic spindle and cell division at the molecular level in hepatocytes.</p>

<title>Calculations and Statistics</title>
<p>For calculating the orientation of the mitotic spindle in cell lines, a line was drawn from the center of the apical lumen through the center of the mitotic spindle (PA). A second line was drawn through the spindle poles (spindle axis [SA]). When no spindle pole staining was performed, it was assumed that the spindle poles were localized in a straight line perpendicular to the metaphase plate. The angle between these lines (SA/PA) was calculated with the ImageJ measure angle tool and plotted accordingly. To study the orientation of cell division in rat and mouse liver tissue, a line was drawn through both spindle poles of a dividing cell and extrapolated to determine the plasma membrane domain to which the spindle poles were oriented. The orientation of the spindle poles was scored as oriented towards (1) the bile canaliculus, (2) the apicolateral domain, or (3) the basolateral (sinusoidal) or common lateral membrane. Microsoft Excel was used for calculations, and Graphpad PRISM was used to generate graphs. Graphs represent mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments, unless otherwise specified.

<title>The Mitotic Spindle in Hepatocytes In Vivo Is Orientated towards an LGN-Enriched Apicolateral Plasma Membrane Domain</title>
<p>We first analyzed the orientation of the mitotic spindle relative to the apical PA in vivo in mitotic mouse hepatocytes that were in metaphase or in telophase 48 h after hepatectomy. A line drawn through the mitotic spindles poles (immunolabeled with antibodies against the microtubule-binding nuclear mitotic apparatus protein [NuMA]) typically intersected the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPPIV)–positive apical canalicular domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, arrowheads) or its flanking regions, rather than the basolateral/sinusoidal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, sinusoidal domains are indicated by “si” and dotted lines).

<title>The Typical Orientation of the Mitotic Spindle to LGN-Enriched Apicolateral Plasma Membrane Domains in Hepatocytes In Vivo Is Reproduced in Cultured HepG2 Cells</title>

Importantly, in agreement with the observations in hepatocytes in vivo, a line drawn through the spindle poles in HepG2 cells in more than 70% of all cases intersected the apical or apicolateral domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s002">S2A</xref>), where LGN was almost exclusively localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Note that LGN was not detected at the “common” lateral and sinusoidal plasma membrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, apicolateral domains are green and “common” lateral and sinusoidal domains are orange and grey, respectively, in the diagram). To more accurately determine the orientation of the mitotic spindle relative to the apical PA in these cells, we measured the angle between the SA (the line drawn through the spindle poles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, dotted line) and the PA (the line drawn between the center of the immunolabeled apical domain and the center of the mitotic spindle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, solid line). 50.9%±7.0%, 32.1%±6.8%, and 17.0%±0.3% of the mitotic spindle axes in cells that were in metaphase displayed an SA/PA angle of 0–30°, 31–60°, and 61–90°, respectively, with statistically significant differences between the three categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g003">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>). A similarly biased SA/PA angle distribution was observed in cells that were in later stages of mitosis, i.e., anaphase or telophase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s002">Figure S2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s002">S2C</xref>), and live cell imaging in HepG2 cells showed that the apicolateral-directed orientation of the mitotic spindle was fixed early in mitosis and remained stable throughout the subsequent mitotic stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s002">Figure S2D and S2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s009">Movie S2</xref>).

<title>Dividing HepG2 Cells Segregate Their Apical/Bile Canalicular Plasma Membrane Domain Asymmetrically to the Two Emerging Daughter Cells</title>
<p>Concomitant with the predominant apicolateral-plasma-membrane-directed orientation of the mitotic spindle apparatus, live cell imaging revealed that HepG2 cells predominantly divided in such a way that only one of the two emerging daughter cells inherited the apical lumen. Stills from a representative movie (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s010">Movie S3</xref>) of dividing HepG2 cells that express the green fluorescent eGFP-tagged apical protein ABCB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) show two non-mitotic (interphase) cells with ABCB1-eGFP-positive apical plasma membrane domains and lumens (indicated by the red arrowhead). After each cell passed through metaphase it formed a cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, black arrowheads) during anaphase/telophase that, following subsequent cytokinesis, gave rise to one daughter cell (marked by “1”) that inherited the apical domain (red arrowhead) and one daughter cell (marked by “2”) that did not. The vast majority of live cells (&gt;75%) showed this asymmetric segregation of the apical plasma membrane domain and lumen during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Similar results were observed with another hepatocyte cell line, WIF-B9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s003">Figure S3A and S3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s011">Movie S4</xref>), underscoring that this mode of cell division orientation is a feature of polarized hepatocytes and not only of HepG2 cells. Interestingly, we observed that the emerging non-polarized daughter cells could reestablish apical–basal polarity and reestablish an apical lumen with their new neighbor cells. An example of this is shown in the stills (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s012">Movie S5</xref>. These stills show that a HepG2 cell with an ABCB1-eGFP-positive apical plasma membrane domain and lumen (red arrowhead) formed a cleavage furrow (white arrowheads) that gave rise to one daughter cell (marked by the asterisk) that did not inherit the apical domain (red arrowhead), but reestablished an ABCB1-eGFP-positive apical domain (yellow arrowhead) with its sister at the site of cytokinesis. Taken together, we conclude that hepatocytes orientate their mitotic SA with a significant bias towards an LGN-enriched apicolateral plasma membrane domain, and asymmetrically segregate their apical plasma membrane domain and apical lumen to the emerging daughter cells.</p>

<title>Par1b Overexpression in Simple Epithelial Cells Coordinates the Adoption of a Hepatic Polarity Phenotype with Changes in the Localization of LGN and Mitotic Spindle and Cell Division Orientation</title>
<p>In order to investigate to what extent the hepatocyte polarity phenotype—as such—was sufficient to dictate an apicolateral-domain-directed orientation of the mitotic spindle, we made use of our earlier observation that the overexpression of the polarity protein partitioning-defective 1/microtubule-affinity regulating kinase 2 (Par1b/MARK2) in simple epithelial cells induces a hepatic polarity phenotype (schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Cohen1">[22]</xref>. Thus, when Par1b was overexpressed in MDCK cells (a widely used model of simple epithelial cells), apical plasma membrane proteins such as gp135 localized to lumens formed between adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, Par1b), rather than to the cell-culture-medium-facing cell surface at the top of the control cell monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, control). In mitotic cells identified in parental MDCK cell cultures, LGN was localized at the lateral plasma membrane domains and was excluded from the apical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, control, dotted white line; and previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Zheng1">[19]</xref>). In agreement with the role of cortical LGN in spindle orientation in these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Zheng1">[19]</xref>, 100% of all SA/PA angles have been demonstrated to be in the 61–90° range, giving rise to the symmetric segregation of apical and basal domains to both daughter cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Reinsch1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Fleming1">[37]</xref>. In contrast, in MDCK cells that overexpressed Par1b and displayed a hepatic polarity phenotype, the localization of LGN was highly polarized and restricted to the apical/apicolateral domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, Par1b, red arrowhead), and LGN was excluded from the “common” lateral cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, Par1b, dotted white line). Coinciding with this change in the distribution of LGN, 58.3%±7.5%, 32.4%±6.6%, and only 9.3%±5.8% of all SA/PA angles were in the 0–30°, 31–60°, and 61–90° range, respectively, with a clear, statistically significant difference between these categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These data demonstrate that the overexpression of Par1b in simple epithelial cells caused a strong shift from a mitotic spindle orientation that was perpendicular to the apical PA to one that was significantly more parallel to the apical PA, matching a change in the distribution of LGN. Concomitantly, live cell imaging revealed that Par1b-overexpressing MDCK cells, like hepatic cells, predominantly divided in such a way that only one of the two emerging daughter cells inherited the apical lumen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s004">Figure S4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s004">S4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s013">Movie S6</xref>).

<title>Par1b Regulates Mitotic Spindle Orientation by Controlling the Apicolateral Enrichment of LGN in HepG2 Cells</title>
<p>The results from the Par1b-overexpressing MDCK cells as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g005">Figure 5</xref> do not demonstrate whether solely the induction of a hepatic polarity phenotype—as such—was sufficient to change the localization of LGN and the orientation of the mitotic spindle. Therefore, in order to further investigate to what extent Par1b is important for the localization of LGN and spindle orientation in the context of the hepatic polarity phenotype, we knocked down Par1b in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Confocal images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref> show that in control cells—i.e., cells treated with scrambled shRNA (scramble)—LGN (black arrowheads) localized at the cell surface flanking the ABCC2- or ZO-1/actin-labeled apical domain (red arrowheads), similarly to in untreated cells (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, in cells treated with shRNA against Par1b (Par1b-KD), the localization of LGN was no longer restricted to the apicolateral domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). LGN frequently showed an (additional) localization at the “common” lateral domain (black arrowheads, the “common” lateral domain is orange in the diagram), away from the apical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>, red arrowhead). Note that these cells have retained the typical hepatic polarity phenotype. The change in the distribution profile of LGN was accompanied by a change in the orientation of NuMA-positive astral microtubules that emanated from the mitotic spindle poles and reached out to the cell cortex (<italic>z</italic>-stack sections in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s005">Figure S5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s014">Movies S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s015">S8</xref>). The knockdown of LGN in HepG2 cells with two different shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g006">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s006">S6A</xref>) caused a randomization of the SA/PA angle in the 0–30°, 31–60°, and 61–90° categories, and caused a significant reduction of SA/PA angles in the 0–30° category when compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g006">Figures 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s006">S6B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s006">S6C</xref>), hence underscoring the contribution of LGN to mitotic spindle orientation in these cells. In agreement with the change in LGN distribution, the knockdown of Par1b caused a randomization of the orientation of the mitotic spindle axes, with approximately 26.8%±9.2%, 32.6%±10.1%, and 40.6%±19.2% displaying an SA/PA angle between 0–30°, 31–60°, and 61–90°, respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the three categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, Par1b knockdown effectively abolished the bias in mitotic SA orientation towards smaller SA/PA angles (0–30°). An illustrative example of this is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g006">Figures 6A, 6B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s005">S5D</xref>, and the quantifications are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g006">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s005">S5C</xref>. The reintroduction of shRNA-resistant Par1b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s005">Figure S5A</xref>) completely rescued this effect, and treatment of the cells with a scrambled shRNA without effect on Par1b expression did not affect the SA/PA distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, control and rescue). Similarly to in HepG2 cells, the knockdown of Par1b in WIF-B9 cells, or the expression of a dominant-negative Par1b mutant, caused a statistically significant shift in SA/PA angle bias from 0–30° to 31–60° and 61–90° (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s007">Figure S7A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s007">S7C</xref>), underscoring that the role of Par1b mitotic spindle orientation is a feature of polarized hepatocytes and not only of HepG2 cells. Concomitant with the loss of bias towards 0–30° angles, live cell imaging showed that the frequency of cell divisions in which both daughter cells inherited part of the same apical lumen significantly increased upon Par1b depletion or expression of the Par1b-DN mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s007">Figure S7D</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s007">S7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001739.s016">Movie S9</xref>). Taken all together, our data suggest that, in cells with a hepatic type polarity, Par1b controls the apicolateral enrichment of LGN and, thereby, the apicolateral-directed orientation of the mitotic spindle to promote the asymmetric segregation of the apical plasma membrane domain to the two emerging daughter cells and to preserve the typical polarity phenotype of polarized hepatocytes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that mitotic hepatocytes asymmetrically segregate their apical plasma membrane domains to the emerging daughter cells during cell division. This is in striking contrast to the symmetric segregation of apical and basal surface domains observed in vitro and in vivo in simple epithelial cells such as those found in the neuroepithelium, kidney, and intestine (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Morin1">[15]</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data indicate that this asymmetric inheritance of the apical plasma membrane domain in hepatocytes is dictated by an apicolateral-plasma-membrane-domain-directed orientation of the mitotic spindle. Interestingly, this apicolateral plasma membrane domain is a geometrically distinctive feature in cells with a (fetal) hepatic polarity phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, apicolateral domain is green in the diagram). Indeed, the apicolateral domain represents the cell's contacting surface with the adjoining cell with which it shares an apical lumen, and can be distinguished from its contacting surface with other adjoining cells with which no apical lumens are (yet) shared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g007">Figure 7</xref>, orange). This apicolateral subdomain has gone unnoticed, presumably because no functional relevance had been ascribed to it. Our data now demonstrate that Leu-Gly-Asn repeat-enriched protein (LGN) predominantly accumulates at this apicolateral domain during mitosis, both in rat liver hepatocytes in vivo and in polarized HepG2 cells in culture. Furthermore, NuMA-positive astral microtubules predominantly target this apicolateral domain in mitotic HepG2 cells. These observations are consistent with data from other cell systems in which LGN recruits NuMA on astral microtubules to the cell cortex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Gillies1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Morin1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Gnczy1">[38]</xref>). Indeed, knockdown experiments demonstrate that LGN is necessary for orientating the SA predominantly towards the apicolateral domain. We propose that this apicolateral domain thus serves as an instructive positional landmark in hepatocytes for the polarized recruitment of LGN, which, in turn, is required for the predominantly apicolateral orientation of the mitotic spindle and asymmetric segregation of the apical domain to the nascent daughter cells.</p>

<title>Implications of mitotic spindle orientation during the development of the unique liver architecture.</title>
<p>(1) LGN localizes to the apicolateral plasma membrane area during hepatocyte cell division. (2) The mitotic spindle orients one of its (NuMA-containing) spindle poles towards the LGN-enriched apicolateral plasma membrane. (3) This orientation of the mitotic spindle results in the cleavage furrow not bisecting the apical plasma membrane, resulting in asymmetric segregation of the apical plasma membrane. (4) New apical surfaces are created de novo at the site of abscission. (5) During early liver development, apical pockets are created between hepatocytes. (6) These pockets grow out to bile canalicular/channel-like structures during later phases of liver development. (7) When Par1b is impaired, LGN migrates away from the apicolateral plasma membrane area and is subsequently found on basal or lateral membranes. (8) The mitotic spindle orients its poles towards LGN-enriched cortical areas. (9) The cleavage furrow has an increased chance of bisecting the apical plasma membrane, resulting in symmetric segregation of the apical plasma membrane. (10) Both cells now share the same apical surface (“simple” epithelial polarity). (11) Continued cell division likely results in the generation of “simple” epithelial cyst-like structures.</p>

<p>In contrast to the apicolateral accumulation of LGN in dividing hepatocytes, LGN has been shown to accumulate at the apical plasma membrane domain in asymmetrically dividing Drosophila neuroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Schaefer1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Siller1">[40]</xref>. In epithelial cells, atypical protein kinase C at the apical plasma membrane has been proposed to exclude the apical recruitment of LGN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Hao1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Guilgur1">[42]</xref>. Possibly, the presence of atypical protein kinase C at the apical bile canalicular plasma membrane domain in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes (unpublished data) may have similarly prevented the accumulation of LGN at the apical surface. But what caused LGN accumulation at the apicolateral subdomain and excluded it from the “common” lateral surface in hepatocytes? Our data implicate the polarity protein Par1b as a critical determinant for this. Indeed, upon knockdown of Par1b in HepG2 cells, LGN no longer accumulated predominantly at the apicolateral domain, but rather showed additional localization at “common” lateral plasma membrane domains. In agreement with the occurrence of multiple sites of cortical LGN, NuMA-positive astral microtubules reached multiple sites at the cell surface. Concomitant with the altered distribution of LGN, knockdown of Par1b or expression of a nonfunctional Par1b mutant in HepG2 and WIF-B9 cells resulted in a loss of spindle orientation bias towards the apicolateral domain and promoted symmetric cell divisions that bisected the apical surface. Notably, in Par1b-depleted hepatic cells the loss of apicolaterally restricted LGN occurred while cells maintained their apicolateral domain. This suggests that Par1b translated the presence of the apicolateral domain as a positional landmark to cortical polarity—i.e., the apicolateral accumulation of LGN—in the mitotic cell. This is further supported by our observations that the overexpression of Par1b in simple epithelial MDCK cells coordinated the acquisition of a fetal hepatocyte polarity phenotype (and thus the establishment of an apicolateral domain) with apicolateral LGN recruitment during mitosis, spindle orientation, and asymmetric cell division. This demonstrates that the coordinated action of Par1b and LGN constitutes a fundamental part of the molecular mechanism that drives mitotic spindle orientation and asymmetric/symmetric apical plasma membrane inheritance. Further studies are needed to determine how Par1b precisely controls the exclusive apicolateral recruitment of LGN.</p>
<p>The orientation of cell division parallel to the apical–basal axis establishes cell fate specification, as has been shown in skin epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Poulson1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Williams1">[44]</xref> and in neuroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Morin1">[15]</xref>, although not necessarily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Morin2">[31]</xref>. Apart from the asymmetric inheritance of apical plasma membrane proteins, we observed no overt signs of cell fate specification in dividing HepG2 cells. Live cell imaging showed that emerging daughter cells that did not inherit the apical plasma membrane domain were capable of establishing an apical plasma membrane domain and lumen with a new neighbor or the sister cell, and did not show distinct behavior when compared to the polarized daughter cell. We cannot, however, exclude the asymmetric acquisition of specific molecules that may have endowed one of the daughter cells with distinct capabilities. Although fetal liver development/patterning has not been experimentally tested, our findings may suggest that in early fetal hepatocytes the asymmetric segregation of apical domains during division may, in conjunction with a repolarization of non-polarized nascent daughter cells, promote the dissemination of isolated apical lumens throughout the proliferating cell mass. It can be speculated that, in vivo, such asymmetric-cell-division-driven propagation of biliary luminal pockets throughout the proliferative fetal liver parenchymal mass could facilitate the development of a branching canalicular network via concomitant or subsequent apical lumen expansion and fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001739-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, elongation of bile canaliculi results from the expansion and fusions of numerous small isolated apical lumens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Fu1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Fu2">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Wood1">[5]</xref> and as such would not necessarily require symmetric cell divisions. We propose that the Par1b-regulated spindle orientation via LGN and the resultant asymmetric inheritance of individual apical plasma membrane domains and lumens, as shown in this study, are made possible by and serve the unique polarized architecture of hepatocytes and, possibly, the liver parenchymal tissue.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, there have been no reports in the literature on human liver diseases associated with Par1b, LGN, or hepatic spindle disorientation. Defects in the orientation of the mitotic spindle apparatus may hamper the efficient development of bile canalicular networks during normal liver development or regeneration, or promote the development of cystic lumens, the latter process typically being driven by symmetric divisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Jaffe1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001739-Zheng1">[19]</xref>. In future studies Par1b knockout mice may be useful to investigate the role of Par1b in the formation of the bile canalicular network during embryonic liver development or regeneration after hepatectomy.</p>
