<abstract>
<p>Chemotherapeutic resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has brought great challenges to the improvement of patient survival. The mechanisms of taxane chemoresistance in TNBC have not been well investigated. Our results illustrated C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) was significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologic complete response. Furthermore, CCL20 promoted the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) or breast cancer stem-like cells through protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated activation of p65 nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, significantly increasing the frequency and taxane resistance of BCSCs. Moreover, CCL20-promoted NF-κB activation increased ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1)/multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) expression, leading to the extracellular efflux of taxane. These results suggested that chemotherapy-induced CCL20 mediated chemoresistance via up-regulating ABCB1. In addition, NF-κB activation increased CCL20 expression, forming a positive feedback loop between NF-κB and CCL20 pathways, which provides sustained impetus for chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. Our results suggest that CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response, and the blockade of CCL20 or its downstream pathway might reverse the taxane resistance in breast cancer patients.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Breast cancers are divided into several different subtypes according to the expression of three receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2). One subtype of breast cancer is known as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) because of lack of expression of all three receptors. TNBC is highly malignant and susceptible to developing drug resistance during chemotherapy. However, the reasons for resistance have not been well explained. We found that a secretory protein called C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) responds to taxane chemotherapy in TNBC and promotes the expression of a drug efflux pump through a specific signaling pathway (CCL20-protein kinase Cζ [PKCζ]/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]-nuclear factor kappa B [NF-κB]-ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 [ABCB1]). Increasing levels of CCL20 result in expanding breast cancer stem-like cell population and chemotherapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells. Breast cancer stem-like cells are a special population of cells with self-renewal and differentiation potential within the tumor, which are often the culprit of tumor reoccurrence, drug resistance, and metastasis. Our results suggest that blocking CCL20 or its downstream signal can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of TNBC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers diagnosed among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref001">1</xref>]. The recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance in the course of chemotherapy have brought great threat to breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref003">3</xref>], especially as chemoresistance limits the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents to a large extent.</p>
<p>Although the triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are generally very susceptible to chemotherapy initially because of the highly proliferative capacity, early complete response (CR) does not correlate with overall survival (OS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref004">4</xref>]. Chemoresistance emerges during therapy because tumor cells are able to maintain viability following chemotherapeutic exposure via undergoing alternative cellular fates such as autophagy, cellular senescence, and therapeutic induced senescence (TIS), although cytotoxic chemotherapy aims to kill cancer cells through apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref005">5</xref>]. There are several specific ways to regulate chemoresistance of TNBC. Regulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and β-tubulin III subunit, disorder in enzymes critical in DNA replication and repair, alterations in genes involved in apoptosis, and drug inactivation/detoxification and abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways such as aberrant activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) or AKT activity all participate in chemoresistance in TNBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref006">6</xref>]. These regulatory mechanisms can help tumor cells escape apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs to acquire the ability of chemoresistance in TNBCs. Besides, more and more studies showed that breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), which represent a distinct population that can be prospectively isolated from the total tumor cell population and have clonal long-term repopulation and self-renewal capacity, are responsible for chemotherapy resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref007">7</xref>]. The differential and diverse regulation of BCSCs also influences the chemoresistance of TNBCs.</p>
<p>In addition to intrinsic genetic changes in cells as described above, recent data suggest that chemoresistance can also result from cell-extrinsic factors such as growth factors and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref008">8</xref>]. Both malignant and cancer-associated normal cells in the tumor niche affect the balance of cytokines that play pivotal roles in regulating tumor cell proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref011">11</xref>]. Gilbert and Hemann’s study in lymphoma model described an interleukin 6 (IL-6)-triggered cytokine-chain response that can promote therapeutic resistance to genotoxic chemotherapy of lymphoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref010">10</xref>]. In addition to IL-6, some other cytokines are also able to regulate tumor progression and chemotherapeutic resistance in an autocrine manner in multiple cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref012">12</xref>]. Although both the extrinsic and intrinsic factors have revealed the possible clues to chemotherapeutic resistance in TNBC, there are still some critical questions to be answered in clinical practice. During the taxane (taxol or docetaxel) therapies for TNBC patients, the risk factors for determining drug resistance and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. And there is a lack of effective markers to indicate the chemoresistance of TNBC. Through studies analyzing breast cancer patients’ serum, tumor tissue sample, survival prognosis, and pathologic response to taxane, we identified a chemokine, C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), that might predict the risk of taxane resistance in TNBC patients. Moreover, our studies in both TNBC cell line–derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models showed that the blockade to CCL20 or CCL20-mediated downstream molecules could attenuate BCSCs and reverse chemoresistance and significantly improved the chemotherapeutic efficacy of taxane to TNBC.</p>
<p>CCL20, a member of the C-C motif chemokine subfamily, participates in many diseases’ progression—including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and immune response—and promotes the malignancy in colorectal cancer and lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref014">14</xref>]. However, the role of CCL20 in cancers has not been well elucidated. More importantly, little work has been done on the role of CCL20 in regulating the tumor progression and chemoresistance in breast cancer, especially TNBC, and the regulation mechanisms still remain unknown. Our current studies showed that taxane-induced CCL20 could promote self-renewal of BCSCs through the activation of p65 NF-κB, which was mediated by protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. The activation of p65 NF-κB further promoted transcription of both ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and CCL20, which sequentially increased extracellular efflux of taxane and enhanced CCL20 effect via a positive feedback loop, leading to the taxane-resistance of TNBCs and promoting breast cancer progression with worse prognosis.</p>

<title>CCL20 elevation was closely correlated with the nonpathologic complete response (non-pCR) in breast cancer patients receiving taxane-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)</title>
<p>Taxanes have become widely recognized as active chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and early-stage breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref015">15</xref>]. Cytokine changes during chemotherapy regulate disease progression, favoring the growth and proliferation of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref016">16</xref>]. However, the involvement of taxane-induced cytokines in chemoresistant breast cancer has not been well studied. Here, we investigated cytokine levels in sera from 3 TNBC patients undergoing taxane-containing NAC. Utilizing cytokine arrays, we found that NAC significantly induced a serial of cytokines in the sera of patients, including CCL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>CCL20 elevation was closely correlated with the non-pCR in breast cancer patients receiving taxane-containing NAC.</title>
<p>(A) Cytokine antibody array was carried out with sera before NAC (untreated) or during the NAC containing taxanes of the same TNBC patient. The pCR index was obtained by the commonly used Miller and Payne grading of breast cancer in clinic diagnosis. Grades 1–4, including no response and partial response, are considered as non-pCR. Grade 5, indicating no residual invasive cancer after treatment, is considered as pCR. Patient #26 is a non-pCR patient. Data were representative of 3 patients. (B-D) CCL20 level in sera of breast cancer patients before or during or after NAC containing taxanes was measured by ELISA. n = patient number.

<p>In order to investigate whether CCL20 is one of the commonly taxane-induced cytokines, more serum samples were collected from breast cancer patients in clinic before, during, or after chemotherapy in the presence of taxol or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to measure CCL20 levels in sera. The results showed that there is no significant difference among 3 collection time points in the entire cohort of patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The patients were classified according to pCR or non-pCR. In pCR patients, there was no significant difference in the level of CCL20 at the 3 collection time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, in non-pCR patients, CCL20 was obviously increased in the sera collected during the chemotherapy compared with that collected before NAC. CCL20 was also augmented in sera after chemotherapy compared with that collected before NAC in non-pCR patients; however, the difference was not significant, probably because of the interval time between therapy termination and blood collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). These results suggest that there might be a correlation between CCL20 induction and taxane resistance. In order to verify our conjecture, we collected 36 pairs of breast tumor tissues before and after taxane-containing NAC from the same non-pCR patients in the clinical pathology from 4 cancer hospitals in China, and results showed that CCL20 staining was significantly increased in the tumor specimens from postchemotherapy, which represent the chemoresistant tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>It is critical to investigate the effect of taxane on inducing cytokines from resistant cancer cells to clarify the relationship between chemotherapy-induced cytokines and taxane resistance. Cytokine antibody array was conducted in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>). CCL20 level was obviously elevated after taxane treatment. Similar results were also validated in human TNBC cell lines SUM149 and SUM159 and mouse TNBC cell line 4T1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s001">S1A, S1B, S1C and S1D Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g001">Fig 1I and 1J</xref>). Then, we analyzed the induced cytokines from the 4 TNBC cell lines and the serum of patients with taxane chemotherapy. Interestingly, we found that CCL20 was the most universally and significantly up-regulated in common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g001">Fig 1K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s001">S1E Fig</xref>), suggesting CCL20 might play a vital role in regulating the taxane resistance of breast cancer cells. Taken together, we identified a taxane-induced cytokine CCL20, and its expression level in serum and tumor tissue showed a positive correlation with the poor pathologic response to NAC in breast cancer patients.</p>

<title>Taxanes triggered CCL20 induction significantly both in vitro and in vivo</title>
<p>Next, we established xenografts with mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 in BALB/c mice and conducted the taxane treatment in mice to mimic the clinical setting. In comparison to the tumor-free mice (“NULL”), only a few cytokines were elevated in the sera of mice bearing tumors but without treatments (“CTRL”). However, consistent with results from breast cancer patient serum, cytokine levels in the mouse sera were significantly changed when receiving the taxane treatment, among which CCL20 was obviously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). These results further suggested that the CCL20 was significantly induced in tumor-bearing mice under taxane treatment. Furthermore, we investigated whether the CCL20 induction depended on the taxane dosage or treatment duration. Utilizing 3 TNBC cell lines (SUM149, SUM159, and MDA-MB-231), we showed that CCL20 was induced by docetaxel in a dose-dependent way as measured by both quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Also, docetaxel treatment triggered CCL20 induction significantly, and the induction efficacy progressed in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). In addition, we found that CCL20 was elevated in the tumor residue of MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor model in the docetaxel treatment group, in contrast to the control group, as analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). In brief, these results suggested that CCL20 was indeed significantly increased after taxane treatment both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

<title>CCL20 promoted tumor progression in TNBC and enhanced the chemoresistance of cancer cells to taxanes</title>
<p>To determine if CCL20 regulates breast cancer malignancy, firstly, we analyzed the database of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cancergenome.nih.gov/" xlink:type="simple">https://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link>) and found that CCL20 was highly expressed in TNBC in contrast to non-TNBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), which was also observed at both mRNA and protein levels in breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). These studies indicate CCL20 expression is positively correlated with the malignancy of breast cancer. In order to investigate the function of CCL20 in TNBC, we silenced CCL20 in TNBC cell lines and found knockdown of CCL20 significantly decreased the proliferation of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).

To explore the regulation of BCSCs via CCL20, we first investigated the differential expression of CCL20 in BCSCs defined by ALDH activity and found there was higher level of CCL20 in flow-sorted ALDH<sup>+</sup> population than in ALDH<sup>−</sup> population in TNBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

These indicate the probable role of CCL20 in promoting BCSC stemness property. Hence, the stemness and self-renewal of BCSCs were determined after CCL20 overexpression. Stem cell genes NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 were up-regulated in CCL20-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g004">Fig 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s004">S4D Fig</xref>), which suggested that CCL20 promoted the stem property of BCSCs.

<p>Next, we tested if the effect of CCL20 on regulating BCSC expansion leads to taxane resistance. Utilizing in vitro sphere-culture system to enrich BCSCs, we showed that both CCL20 overexpression and rhCCL20 treatment increased the docetaxel resistance of sphere-formed cells, while the anti-CCL20 blocked this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g004">Fig 4K and 4L</xref>). It is interesting that, after blocking CCL20, the drug resistance of the taxol-resistant subline of MDA-MB-231 was reduced to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g004">Fig 4M</xref>).

Moreover, GPCR-coupled G protein can act as an adaptor protein to activate PKCζ in NIH 3T3-m1R cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref021">21</xref>]. Here in our study, after overexpression of CCL20, an increase in p65 NF-κB activation by phosphorylation was observed in breast cancer cells. The activation of p38 MAPK and PKCζ via phosphorylation was also increased by CCL20 overexpression in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). These results prompted us to demonstrate the probable mechanisms of CCL20 signal transduction in regulating the chemoresistance of BCSCs.</p>

<p>As the downstream role of p65 NF-κB in transducing signal, whether p65 activation was mediated by activity of p38 MAPK and PKCζ was explored. We found that the pharmacological inhibition of p65 NF-κB activation via the specific inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) did not affect the increased activity of p38 MAPK or PKCζ caused by CCL20 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s005">S5A Fig</xref>), which suggested that p65 probably was the downstream effector of p38 MAPK or PKCζ when transducing CCL20 stimuli. But phosphorylation of p65 was not substantially decreased by inhibition of either PKCζ alone (Gene Ontology [Go] 6983) or p38 MAPK alone (SB202190) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). In addition, it was noticed that PKCζ inhibition actually increased the activation of p38 MAPK in CCL20-overexpressing cells, which was not observed in vector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), partly accounting for the reason why effect of PKCζ inhibition alone on p65 activation was limited. Interestingly, the inhibition of both PKCζ and p38 MAPK significantly abolished the enhancement of p65 NF-κB activity induced by CCL20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). These results suggested that p38 or PKCζ mediated p65 NF-κB activation in parallel manner under CCL20 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>CCL20 activated p38 MAPK or PKCζ, followed by a dramatic increase of the phosphorylated p65 NF-κB translocating into the nucleus, which indicates the activation of NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Whether p65 NF-κB activation mediates the CCL20-induced chemoresistance was determined, and we found that the enhancement of CCL20 on docetaxel resistance was abolished by CAPE in the BCSC-enriched mammosphere-derived cells from both MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5H</xref>) and SUM159 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5I</xref>). The docetaxel resistance enhanced by rhCCL20 in the BCSC-enriched mammosphere-derived cells from both MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5J</xref>) and SUM159 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5K</xref>) was also abolished by CAPE. In addition, the degree of PKCζ or p38 blockage alone was limited for the remission of resistance, and the combinatorial inhibition of the two significantly reduced chemoresistance induced by CCL20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s005">S5D and S5E Fig</xref>). This further indicates that PKCζ and p38 mediate CCL20-induced drug resistance in a parallel manner, consistent with their impacts on the activation of p65 NF-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>To further confirm these findings, p65 was knocked down in CCL20v1-overexpressing breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5L</xref>), and we found that docetaxel resistance of CCL20v1-overexpressing cancer cells was also abolished by p65 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5M</xref>). Furthermore, we also noticed that the tumorsphere-forming ability of CCL20v1-overexpressing breast cancer cells was inhibited by p65 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g005">Fig 5N and 5O</xref>). In addition, the p65 silence alone significantly reduced the chemoresistance and tumorsphere formation of BCSCs, further confirming the role of NF-κB in this process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s005">S5F, S5G, S5H, S5I, S5J and S5K Fig</xref>). And the CCL20-dependent increase in the percentage of ALDH<sup>+</sup> cells is mediated through p65 NF-κB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s005">S5L Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>These studies suggested that the activation of p65 NF-κB pathway induced by CCL20 was mediated by p38 MAPK and PKCζ activity, respectively, and p65 NF-κB activation plays an important role in mediating CCL20-promoted taxane resistance of BCSCs.</p>

<title>ABCB1 up-regulation mediated by CCL20-induced NF-κB activation reduced the intracellular abundance of taxane and promoted chemoresistance in breast cancer cells</title>
<p>Differential and diverse transcription control via NF-κB appears to be context-dependent and stimulus-specific regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref023">23</xref>]. Alteration of transcriptional events after CCL20-induced p65 NF-κB activation has not been studied yet. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to observe the transcriptome change by overexpression of CCL20 in TNBCs. Our results showed that the expression levels of the 32 genes were up-regulated by 1.5-fold or more, and 18 genes were down-regulated by 40% or more with CCL20 overexpression both in SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), including ABCB1. Up-regulation of ABCB1 transcription after CCL20 overexpression was validated by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).

In addition, the CCL20-induced up-regulation of ABCB1 can be abrogated by p65 silencing, suggesting that p65 NF-κB mediated the increased transcription of ABCB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>

<p>ABCB1, a member of the superfamily of ABC transporters, is an active efflux pump for a variety of toxins as well as dietary and environmental carcinogens and drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref024">24</xref>]. More interestingly, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that the pathway termed response to chemical stimulus, which ABCB1 was in, was positively correlated with CCL20 overexpression significantly, indicating CCL20 enriches the gene sets with resistant ability for cancer cells to respond to chemical drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Therefore, we observed the pharmacological distribution and abundance of docetaxel in breast cancer cells after overexpression of CCL20 by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). Our results showed that, in comparison to vector cells, the intracellular drug abundance in CCL20-overexpressing cancer cells was decreased by 50%, and more docetaxel was accumulated in the extracellular supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). In view of the ability of ABCB1 to transport taxane as efflux pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref026">26</xref>], the up-regulation of ABCB1 induced by CCL20 in our current studies might account for the pharmacological intracellular abundance of taxane being lower in CCL20-overexpressing cells than vector cells, which promoted the taxane resistance of breast cancer cells. In addition, the silence of ABCB1 also reversed the CCL20-induced resistance to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s006">S6D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these studies demonstrated that taxane-induced CCL20 activated NF-κB through PKCζ or p38 and then promoted the expression of ABCB1, leading to the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells. In addition, we were excited to observe that the increase of CCL20 induced by taxane depended on p65 NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g006">Fig 6G</xref>), suggesting that the activated p65 NF-κB could regulate CCL20 level in positive feedback to further enhance the effect of CCL20 on chemoresistance. Reduction in PKCζ and p38 activation after NF-κB inhibition also further confirmed the existence of the CCL20-triggered feedback loop under docetaxel-treatment circumstances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s006">S6E and S6F Fig</xref>). The whole regulation loop for CCL20 and BCSC chemoresistance can be demonstrated as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g006">Fig 6H</xref>. Our current studies are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate the mutual regulation between CCL20 and NF-κB that up-regulates efflux pump protein ABCB1 to promote chemoresistance in BCSCs.</p>

<title>CCL20 predicted poor prognosis, and the blockade to CCL20-NF-κB pathway reversed the chemoresistance of breast cancer via attenuating BCSCs</title>
<p>Through analyzing the cohort of basal breast cancer cases, we found that high CCL20 expression significantly predicted poor OS in the entire cohort of breast cancer patients (not only for patients treated by taxane) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), which, given the key role of CCL20 in modulating chemotherapeutic resistance, may provide an important clue for the design of subsequent new chemotherapy regimens for patients who have received chemotherapy but failed the treatment or are about to receive chemotherapy. Moreover, we found that the higher the histological grade, the more obvious the effect of CCL20 on the deterioration of OS. More interestingly, in the cohort of human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer cases including TNBC or non-TNBC, after neoadjuvant taxane-containing chemotherapy, the patients with high CCL20 level were in a poor condition of relapse-free survival (RFS), and the higher the grade, the poorer the 5-year RFS in breast cancer patients with high CCL20 expression after NAC containing taxane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), which revealed that CCL20 played a vital role in influencing patient survival after taxane treatment not only in TNBC but also probably in non-TNBC. Our results have shown that high CCL20 level contributed to taxane resistance. The residual taxane-resistant BCSC-enriched cells after chemotherapy tended to reproliferate and lead to tumor relapse, decreasing patient probability in RFS.</p>

<p>CCL20 intervention may improve taxane therapy for breast cancer, including TNBCs. Our results in vivo suggested that CCL20 silencing could significantly improve the therapeutic effect of docetaxel and inhibit tumor growth in MDA-MB-231 tumor model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). Moreover, the enrichment of ALDH<sup>+</sup> BCSCs and CD24<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> BCSCs induced by docetaxel treatment in tumors can be reversed by CCL20 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g007">Fig 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Since we have shown that p65 NF-κB mediated the effects of CCL20, therefore, we also investigated the effect of blocking p65 NF-κB activation on the tumor growth. In the PDX model (TNBC), the inhibition of p65 NF-κB could enhance the antitumor effect of docetaxel significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g007">Fig 7F and 7G</xref>). Moreover, the phenomenon of BCSC enrichment induced by docetaxel treatment was also inhibited by CAPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005869.g007">Fig 7H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). In conclusion, high expression of CCL20 predicts worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. The combinational therapies of taxane and the blockade of CCL20 or its downstream signaling molecules can improve therapeutic effect of TNBC through attenuating BCSCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>TNBC has become a worldwide threat because of its high invasiveness, recurrence, drug resistance, and lack of effective treatment prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref027">27</xref>]. Taxanes are the commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for TNBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref028">28</xref>]. The chemotherapeutic resistance during taxane treatment seriously affected the OS of cancer patients and brought huge complications to the clinician. Thus, it is urgent to demonstrate the mechanisms such as defining the key molecules in mediating taxane resistance in treating TNBCs.</p>
<p>In response to the influence of repression and stimuli from chemotherapeutic agents, cancer cells will undergo multiple changes, such as alteration of the cytokine secretion. Through cytokine antibody array, we observed the correlation between CCL20 in patient serum and the indication of therapeutic response. In our studies, CCL20 emerged as the most responsive cytokine to taxane treatment, which is dosage dependent and time dependent. However, as far as the taxane stimulation on CCL20 is concerned, not only in TNBC but the phenomenon of CCL20 induction via taxane treatment also occurred in non-TNBC, actually, and the expression level of CCL20 in taxol-resistant sublines of colon cancer and ovarian cancer was significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005869.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). These suggest that CCL20 may confer taxane resistance in various molecule types of breast cancer and even across multiple cancers, in which further exploration and study are needed.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that CCL20 promoted proliferation and migration of normal breast epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref030">30</xref>]. Little work has revealed the regulation of CCL20 on breast cancer. Our studies showed that CCL20 stimulated the proliferation, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth in TNBC and promoted tumor outgrowth in vivo. In addition, we discovered CCL20 also exhibited strengthening in resistance to taxane, demonstrating its pivotal role in the regulation of breast cancer malignancy. And our results demonstrated for the first time that CCL20 promoted chemoresistance in BCSCs by enhancing self-renewal and stemness characteristics of BCSCs.</p>
<p>The range of tumor types displaying aberrant NF-κB activity is extensive and comprises many solid tumors, as well as lymphomas and leukemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref032">32</xref>]. NF-κB signaling exhibits the intricate transcriptional control of gene expression and diverse posttranslational modifications in a stimulus-specific or context-dependent way, for which the influence on the tumor progression is also complex tumor promotion or suppression, chemoresistant or chemosensitive effect, and even playing the biphasic role with dynamic regulation in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref033">33</xref>]. In our results, p65 NF-κB mediated CCL20-induced TNBC resistance to taxane. In this process, PKCζ and p38 delivered the CCL20 stimulus in parallel. We demonstrated that, under the stimulation of taxane-induced CCL20, the p65 NF-κB was mainly shown to promote resistance to apoptosis induced by taxane treatment. Combined with the inhibition of p65 NF-κB activity, the therapeutic effect of docetaxel was significantly improved in vivo, which was consistent with the elevated therapeutic efficacy under the combinational treatment of docetaxel and direct CCL20 blockage in vivo. These discoveries shed light on direct targeting CCL20 or small molecule inhibition of CCL20-induced signaling being able to potentiate chemotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer.</p>
<p>In our study, one of the consequences following CCL20-induced p65 NF-κB activation was the up-regulation of ABCB1, which was involved in the efflux of a variety of drugs, including taxane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref026">26</xref>]. The observation that the intracellular abundance of docetaxel was significantly decreased after overexpression of CCL20 in our study well demonstrated why CCL20-induced NF-κB activation promoted taxane resistance. Our studies offer a novel strategy to solve taxane resistance in breast cancer, including TNBC—that is, the combination of taxane treatment and the adjuvant pharmacological inhibition of ABCB1 may greatly improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results demonstrated for the first time that CCL20 promoted chemoresistance in BCSCs through the positive feedback loop mediated by PKCζ/p38-NF-κB. Importantly, our findings suggest that CCL20 can be used as a novel chemoresistance marker for the adjuvant evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in taxane treatment and as a therapeutic target to improve the efficacy of taxane therapy for TNBC patients.</p>

<title>Cell culture and tumorigenicity in mice</title>
<p>Breast cancer cell line SUM149 and SUM159 were from Asterland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005869.ref034">34</xref>]. MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 were purchased from ATCC. The culture medium for SUM149 and SUM159 is Ham’s F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FBS (Gibco, United States of America), 5 μg/mL insulin, and 1 ug/mL hydrocortisone (both from Sigma, St. Louis, USA) and 1% pen-strep (Beyotime, China). MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, USA) and 1% pen-strep antibiotic (Beyotime, China). All of the cell lines were tested and authenticated. These cell lines were maintained at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>All mice were bred and housed in AAALAC-accredited specific pathogen-free rodent facilities at University of Science and Technology of China. Mice were housed in sterilized, ventilated microisolator cages and supplied with autoclaved commercial chow and sterile water.</p>
<p>Tumorigenicity was determined by injecting MDA-MB-231 cells and 4T1 cells with Matrigel into fourth mammary fat pads of 1-month-old female nude mice or BALB/c mice. The animals were euthanized when the tumors were 1.0–1.5 cm in diameter. Before being euthanized, a small quantity of blood was collected into a tube without additives from mouse eye socket. Then, it was kept at RT for 20 minutes, centrifuged 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm, aliquoted into small tubes, and stored at −80°C until use. A portion of each tumor was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. Another portion was digested to single cell and utilized for flow cytometry. The tumor sizes were measured once a week with a caliper and calculated as tumor volume = Length × Width<sup>2</sup> / 2.</p>

<title>Breast tumor cell isolation, flow cytometry, and sorting</title>
<p>Mouse tumors were dissected and minced into small pieces and resuspended with collagenase-hyaluronidase digestion reagent (Catalog #07912, STEMCELL Technologies, USA). Tumor pieces were digested for approximately 1 hour at 37°C and shaken once every 15 minutes. Cell aggregates were removed by filtering cell suspension with 40 μm filter, and ammonium chloride solution (Catalog #07850, STEMCELL Technologies, USA) was used for lysis of erythrocytes for 10 minutes at RT. Then, cell suspension was centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended for subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>When analyzing tumor cells from xenograft of human MDA-MB-231 model or PDX, mouse cells were excluded by gating in flow cytometry using H-2K<sup>d</sup>-PE (Clone SF1-1.1, Cat 116607, BioLegend, USA).</p>
<p>Single cells from tumor or cell line were assessed for their ALDH activity using the ALDEFLUOR Kit (Catalog #01700, STEMCELL Technologies, USA) following the manufacturer’s procedures. Briefly, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were resuspended in 1 ml ALDEFLUOR buffer, and activated ALDEFLUOR substrate (BAAA) was added. Immediately, 300 μl of them were separated in another tube with the inhibitor DEAB (Catalog #01705, STEMCELL Technologies, USA). The incubation was performed for 40 minutes at 37°C, and then cells were resuspended with DAPI solution for the following flow cytometry analysis. In addition, single cells from tumor or cell line were also stained with CD24 antibody (Cat 311118, BioLegend, USA) and CD44 antibody (Cat 560532, BD Pharmingen, USA) for 30 minutes on ice and then resuspended with DAPI solution for flow cytometry analysis. A population of 10,000 living cells was captured and analyzed, and all fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) experiments was performed using MOFLO ASTRIOS flow cytometer system (BECKMAN COULTER, USA) and software Summit 6.1.
