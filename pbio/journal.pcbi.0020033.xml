We have developed a general comparative genomics method based on phylogenetic stochastic context-free grammars for identifying functional RNAs encoded in the human genome and used it to survey an eight-way genome-wide alignment of the human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, zebra-fish, and puffer-fish genomes for deeply conserved functional RNAs. At a loose threshold for acceptance, this search resulted in a set of 48,479 candidate RNA structures. This screen finds a large number of known functional RNAs, including 195 miRNAs, 62 histone 3′UTR stem loops, and various types of known genetic recoding elements. Among the highest-scoring new predictions are 169 new miRNA candidates, as well as new candidate selenocysteine insertion sites, RNA editing hairpins, RNAs involved in transcript auto regulation, and many folds that form singletons or small functional RNA families of completely unknown function. While the rate of false positives in the overall set is difficult to estimate and is likely to be substantial, the results nevertheless provide evidence for many new human functional RNAs and present specific predictions to facilitate their further characterization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Structurally functional RNA is a versatile component of the cell that comprises both independent molecules and regulatory elements of mRNA transcripts. The many recent discoveries of functional RNAs, most notably miRNAs, suggests that many more are yet to be found. Computational identification of functional RNAs has traditionally been hampered by the lack of strong sequence signals. However, structural conservation over long evolutionary times creates a characteristic substitution pattern, which can be exploited with the advent of comparative genomics. The authors have devised a method for identification of functional RNA structures based on phylogenetic analysis of multiple alignments. This method has been used to screen the regions of the human genome that are under strong selective constraints. The result is a set of 48,479 candidate RNA structures. For some classes of known functional RNAs, such as miRNAs and histone 3′UTR stem loops, this set includes nearly all deeply conserved members. The initial large candidate set has been partitioned by size, shape, and genomic location and ranked by score to produce specific lists of top candidates for miRNAs, selenocysteine insertion sites, RNA editing hairpins, and RNAs involved in transcript auto regulation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NHGRI (Grant 1P41HG02371) and the Danish Research Council (Grant 21–04–0444).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Pedersen JS, Bejerano G, Siepel A, Rosenbloom K, Lindblad-Toh K, et al.

These structures function both as independent molecules and as part of mRNA transcripts. These recent discoveries verify that fRNAs fulfill many important regulatory, structural, and catalytic roles in the cell, and suggest that perhaps only a small fraction of these fRNAs are currently identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>The development of computational methods that can efficiently identify fRNAs by comparative genomics has been hampered by the fact that fRNAs often exhibit only weakly conserved primary-sequence signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b005">5</xref>]. Fortunately, the stem-pairing regions of fRNA structures evolve mostly with a characteristic substitution pattern such that only substitutions that maintain the pairing capability between paired bases will be allowed. This leads to compensatory double substitutions (e.g., GC ↔ AU) and to a few types of compatible single substitutions (e.g., GC ↔ GU); the latter made possible by RNA's ability to form a non–Watson-Crick pair between G and U. This evolutionary signal can be exploited for comparative identification of fRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b012">12</xref>].</p><p>The many non-human vertebrate genomes now sequenced can be aligned against the human genome, leading to a multiple alignment with considerable information about the evolutionary process at every position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b015">15</xref>]. Given a diverse enough set of genomes, comparative methods that can make effective use of this evolutionary information should in principle be able to efficiently identify the conserved human fRNAs. We have developed a comparative method called EvoFold for functional RNA-structure identification in multiple sequence alignments. EvoFold makes use of a recently devised model construction, a phylogenetic stochastic context-free grammar (phylo-SCFG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b017">17</xref>], which is a combined probabilistic model of RNA secondary structure and sequence evolution. Phylo-SCFGs use stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b019">19</xref>] to define a prior distribution over possible RNA secondary structures, and a set of phylogenetic models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b022">22</xref>] to evaluate how well the substitution pattern of each alignment column conforms with its secondary-structure annotation. EvoFold uses a very general model of RNA secondary structures that allows it to model everything from short hairpins to complex multiforking structures, including novel structures not seen in its training set. The substitution process explicitly models co-evolution of paired bases within the structure using the phylogenetic tree and evolutionary branch lengths relating the sequences of the alignment. Stem-pairing regions are detected not only by the presence of compensatory substitutions, but also by the presence of compatible single substitutions and the overall slower rate of evolution. We have built a human-referenced eight-way vertebrate whole-genome alignment and used EvoFold to search for functional RNAs in the human genome. This search resulted in a total of 48,479 candidate RNA structures. Based on estimates of the false-positive rate, which unfortunately are associated with very large uncertainties, we estimate that the candidate set contains approximately 18,500 substructures of approximately 10,000 RNA transcripts. These numbers are derived using an estimated false-positive rate of 62%. Among the highest-scoring candidates, where the estimated false-positive rate is much lower, this screen finds a large number of known functional RNAs, and contains new candidate miRNAs, selenocysteine insertion sites, RNA editing hairpins, RNAs involved in transcript auto regulation, and many folds that form singletons or small functional RNA families of completely unknown function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We constructed a whole-genome alignment of the human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b023">23</xref>], chimpanzee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b024">24</xref>], mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b025">25</xref>], rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b026">26</xref>], dog, chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b027">27</xref>], zebra fish, and puffer fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b028">28</xref>] genomes using the MULTIZ program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b029">29</xref>]. From this alignment we assembled a set of human genome segments where at least four other species are aligned and the pattern of substitution shows evidence of negative selection using the PhastCons method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b015">15</xref>]. These segments were further filtered to remove retroposed genes, simple/low-complexity repeats, segments with mitochondrial chromosome homology, and segments that were not clearly in the orthologous locations with respect to neighboring genes in both the human and mouse genomes (“nonsyntenic human-mouse matches”). The resulting set defines 1,181,107 conserved segments spanning 3.7% of the reference human genome. We applied the EvoFold algorithm, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020033-g001">Figure 1</xref>, to each of these conserved segments. This resulted in a total of 48,479 candidate RNA folds with more than five pairing bases that span 0.07 % of the human genome at the base level (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-sg001">Figure S1</xref> for length distribution).

We distinguished two size ranges: short (between five and 15 pairing bases, 39,075 folds) and long (more than 15 pairing bases, 9,404 folds); five types of genomic location: coding (12,736 folds), 3′UTR (3,331 folds), 5′UTR (334 folds), intronic (11,777 folds), and intergenic (20,301 folds); and four shape-types: hairpins (42,964 folds),Y-shaped (3,479 folds), clover-shaped (250 folds), and more complex shapes (1,786 folds). This scheme results in 40 different RNA fold prediction categories. Candidate folds were also clustered by proximity in the genome or overlap with cDNAs into sets of folds that are likely to be part of a single underlying RNA transcript. This grouped the 48,479 candidate RNA folds into 23,287 candidate structure–containing transcripts. Finally, the folds within each category were ranked by a length-normalized likelihood-ratio score that we call the folding potential score (fps), and a shuffling scheme was used to tentatively estimate the rate of false-positive predictions in each category as a function of score (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-sg002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-sg003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-st001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-st002">S2</xref>).</p><p>We mapped all available human and non-human mRNAs and ESTs to the human genome and determined the enrichment of hits to our set of candidate RNA folds relative to the background hit rate in genomic DNA. These were found to vary from 3.6× (cDNA from humans) to 11.4× (non-human EST). This is significantly higher than the enrichments observed for the full set of conserved elements from which these candidates were chosen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-sg004">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p>We also found that predictions at known fRNAs generally score higher on the strand of the fRNA compared to its reverse complement (this is, e.g., the case for 89% of the known miRNAs we predict). The asymmetry is primarily caused by the ability of GU (or UG) to pair, but not its reverse complement AC (CA). Since the most common types of substitutions in RNA stems involve GU (or UG) pairs, this can have a pronounced effect on the EvoFold score, thus allowing the strand association of a fold to be inferred by comparing the score of an alignment with the score of its reverse complement. In cases where the candidate RNA is contained in a known transcript, the EvoFold score for the sense strand (i.e., the strand complementary to the template strand for transcription) is often significantly higher than for the anti-sense strand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-st003">Table S3</xref>). Because this is similar to the effect observed for known fRNAs, this provides circumstantial evidence that many of these predictions are new fRNAs. However, part of this effect may be due to compositional asymmetries, possibly due to transcription-mediated repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b030">30</xref>], or the influence of other sense-strand associated functional elements (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p><p>Using a shuffling approach, we estimate that the set of 48,479 candidates contain 18,500 partially correct fRNAs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, Validation section). However, this estimate is associated with huge uncertainties inherent to the shuffling approach and should only be viewed as a first approximation based on the available data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). Based on the shuffling approach and the genomic distribution of the candidates, we estimate, conditional on the above-mentioned uncertainties, that our predictions comprise about 10,000 human RNA transcripts: 2,200 of which are transcripts of protein-coding genes that harbor functional RNAs in their UTRs or overlapping their coding region, and the remainder being fRNA genes. After correcting for the shuffling-based estimates of false-positive rates, the folds break down into the different sizes, locations, and shapes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020033-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020033-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020033.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Breakdown of Types of RNA Folds Detected in the Human Genome Based on True Positive Estimates</title><p>See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, Validation section.</p><p>Folds are classified according to (A) size (number of pairing bases), (B) location in the genome, and (C) shape. The relative abundance of each class of folds is indicated. For (B), also shown is the genomic span of the conserved segments relative to their genomic location, for comparison.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020033.g002" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Three quarters of the predicted folds are short. These are likely to represent a mix of small complete folding units and partial predictions of larger folds, where only a small core element had sufficient evolutionary covariation to be detected by our method. Among the long folds, about 82% are intergenic or intronic, 5.5% are in 3′UTRs, 0.5% in 5′UTRs, and a surprising 12% (550 folds) overlap known coding regions. These are discussed further below. As expected, the small folds are predominantly single hairpins; there are usually not enough paired bases in these to support more complex stable structures. The long folds show a more varied shape distribution, but are also dominated by simple hairpins. Again, since these are often partial structural predictions, this breakdown is likely to be somewhat biased toward the simpler fold types.</p><p>Because EvoFold is designed to look for RNAs that are conserved in structure and remain in the same genomic context in all vertebrates, there are likely to be additional fRNAs not detected in this survey. There are some classes of known functional RNAs that are too mobile or rapidly evolving for EvoFold to detect, such as tRNAs and snoRNAs. The vertebrate tRNAs spawn many lineage-specific copies that land in different places in the genome, most of which are pseudogenes, so that the remaining functional copies often end up in a different genomic context in different vertebrate lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b027">27</xref>]. As a result, more than 99% of the functional human tRNAs fail the filter we applied that removes nonsyntenic matches between human and mouse, and hence are absent in our set of predicted folds. In contrast, most snoRNAs are missing from our set of predicted folds either because they have too few base pairs (bp), e.g., 4–5 bp in the CD-box snoRNAs, or have experienced too many structural changes in vertebrate evolution. We observe that 32% of the bp of known deeply conserved snoRNAs could not be formed in fish or chicken, causing a conflict with the overall structural signal EvoFold is designed to detect. The signal recognition particle RNA and the Y RNAs are also missed due to their evolutionary mobility. On the other hand, RNase P RNA and both the U11 and U12 spliceosomal RNAs are well conserved and detected by this screen. Based on our current methods, we cannot predict how many more, as-yet-undiscovered, classes of highly mobile or rapidly evolving RNAs there are in vertebrate genomes.</p><p>For other known classes of RNAs, such as miRNAs, EvoFold achieves a high rate of sensitivity, finding nearly all known members. To evaluate EvoFold's sensitivity, we performed a 5-fold cross-validation test using various curated sets of known RNAs. These tests showed that EvoFold is quite good at detecting some known classes of RNAs, such as miRNAs and Histone 3′UTR stem loops (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020033-t001">Table 1</xref>). Despite the fact that Histone 3′UTR stem loops have stems containing only 6 bp, they are predicted very accurately: 97% predicted with 100% correct structure.</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0020033-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020033.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>EvoFold Sensitivity</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020033.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" valign="top"><hr/>Case</td><td colspan="4"><hr/>Deviations from Phosphorylated Crystal Structure (&Aring;)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/>Loop Only</td><td colspan="2"><hr/>Loop &plus; Surroundings</td></tr><tr><td><hr/>P</td><td><hr/>BB</td><td><hr/>P</td><td><hr/>BB</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reconstruction</td><td>0.6</td><td>1.7</td><td>1.7</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>Prediction</td><td>8.8</td><td>6.7</td><td>0.8</td><td>2.9</td></tr><tr><td>CDK2/KAP</td><td>1.1</td><td>2.3</td><td>0.5</td><td>1.3</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>The case study is summarized using two measures: the deviation of the phosphate group from its position in the crystal structure of phosphorylated CDK2 (&ldquo;P&rdquo;), and the overall backbone RMSD of the predicted loop compared to the same structure (&ldquo;BB&rdquo;).

But most of the families were completely new. Some contain long intergenic and intronic hairpins and are likely to be new families of miRNAs (e.g., 17 of our miRNA candidates are found in 11 families). Others contain hairpins in ion-channel genes not previously characterized as undergoing RNA editing (e.g., a cluster of three coding hairpins overlapping sodium channel exons in <italic>SCN3A, SCN8A,</italic> and SCN2A2. But the majority involves more complex folds, which we currently have no functional hypotheses for.

While this alignment contains considerably more evolutionary information than has been previously available, these currently available genomes are still quite limited in terms of their statistical power to detect negative selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b055">55</xref>], a situation that will change in the coming years as more vertebrate genomes are sequenced. Nevertheless, this study shows that we already have sufficient evolutionary information for efficient discovery of many classes of fRNAs. Further information from additional genomes and additional experiments should be able to weed out many of the false-positive predictions and refine the individual candidate structures.</p><p>This initial survey suggests that there are many more functional RNAs in the human genome than are represented in the current RNA sequence databases. We estimate that these databases annotate 1,207 RNA genes in the human genome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Our results suggest that there may be 10-fold more functional RNAs there, and 7-fold more RNA genes. However, these values depend on the ability of the shuffling experiments to correctly estimate the false-positive rate. It is not clear how well shuffling experiments can estimate false-positive rates, and thus our current estimates are associated with very large and difficult to quantify uncertainties. Previous scans for ncRNAs based on pair-wise alignments have found that only a small fraction of the predictions are experimentally verifiable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b057">57</xref>], thus caution is warranted. Further experimental work will be necessary to reliably characterize the number of human fRNAs. However, combined with the presence of additional evidence (sense-strand bias, transcription evidence, biologically plausible folds, and existence of paralogous families), our results do suggest that there are many additional RNAs to be found. The exploration of RNA genes and RNA structural elements within protein-coding genes represents a huge opportunity, and a huge challenge, as we try to fully explore the key functional elements of the human genome sequence.</p><p>The RNA folds we predict with the highest confidence include many known fRNAs, such as miRNAs and genetic recoding signals, as well as thousands of new fRNA candidates, a large fraction of which are supported by the presence of compensatory substitutions. Some of these new fRNAs enlarge existing families while others group into small new families. Detailed analysis of individual candidates has revealed additional supporting evidence and has allowed specific functional hypotheses to be formulated in some cases, including the new SECIS elements, RNA editing hairpins, regulatory hairpins, and miRNA candidates discussed above. We estimate that about 500 coding regions contain overlapping functional RNA structures, and that a non-negligible fraction of these may contain undocumented examples of genetic recoding.</p><p>The EvoFold method we have developed was trained to only predict RNA stems that are well-supported by a consistent evolutionary signal in clearly orthologous copies from many species. To guarantee orthology, the alignments used require that aligned sequences from different species appear in the same genomic context, i.e., have orthologous flanking DNA, in each species. This greatly reduces the number of false-positive predictions due to mobile elements such as transposons and retroposed pseudogenes. However, it causes us to miss some highly mobile known fRNAs, such as tRNAs and snoRNAs, even with a relatively liberal threshold that allows an estimated 62% false positives in our overall set of predictions. Identifying mobile fRNAs with a general model of molecular evolution will require logic for lineage-specific duplication and loss of function in addition to the simple evolution of orthologous copies that the EvoFold model embodies.</p><p>Alignment errors can also disrupt the evolutionary signal of true fRNAs, and thus improvements to the current sequence-alignment scores might improve the results. Local alignment errors involving only a few bases are unlikely to affect the entire structure and thus should normally allow at least a partial structure with a reduced signal to be identified. However, more extensive errors, where non-orthologous regions are aligned, will most likely cause the fRNA to be missed completely as discussed above.</p><p>EvoFold's rate of false positives is much lower among the highest-scoring predictions, but it never goes completely to zero, even for the largest predicted structures. One problem is that the elements where negative selection is strongest, the ultraconserved regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b058">58</xref>], often have too few substitutions within the available vertebrates for the evolutionary approach to distinguish conservation of RNA secondary structure from other kinds of functional conservation. Until more genomes are available, for these elements we are faced with something like the problem of predicting RNA structure in a single sequence, without benefit of comparative genomics.</p><p>Sequence comparisons between novel predicted fRNAs verify that some of these can be grouped into small paralogous families, but most appear as singletons. Since many fRNAs undergo lineage-specific expansions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b032">32</xref>], we find it likely that a search for paralogs in the human genome will show many of these singletons to be founders of phylogenetically shallow families. However, lineage-specific expansion and rapid diversification may make family members difficult to recognize in searches based on primary-sequence identity.</p><p>The EvoFold scoring scheme very highly ranks compact folds with a high ratio of paired to unpaired bases, such as miRNAs and histone 3′UTR stem loops. Indeed, these two families stand out prominently in this survey, and their existence would have been a clear-cut new outcome of this study had it not already been known. One of the reasons they rank so highly is because the fps is a length-normalized likelihood ratio, which tends to emphasize the ratio of paired to unpaired bases rather than the total number of paired bases. Other normalization schemes may emphasize other families of fRNAs as shown by the substitution-ranked ncRNA candidates (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p><p>This set of fold predictions represents what we believe is the first general survey of evolutionarily conserved human fRNAs. (Another survey, based on our multiple alignments and PhastCons detection of conserved segments as well, has come to our attention during the final stages of preparing this paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020033-b059">59</xref>]. The authors appear to have reached similar conclusions regarding the expected number of human RNA genes.) We have attempted to create a comprehensive set, which still maintains a relatively low false-negative rate, in hopes that it would be a useful resource for further studies of fRNAs. To facilitate these further studies, the complete set of predictions is available through the UCSC Human Genome Browser, including detailed structure-labeled alignments as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020033-g003">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020033-g006">6</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>).

One of the strengths of this model construction is that it can handle multiple alignments with any number of sequences and weigh their information content in a way that reflects phylogeny.</p><p>Two types of phylogenetic models are used by the phylo-SCFGs: a single-nucleotide model and a di-nucleotide model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020033-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). The single-nucleotide model describes the substitution process of the nonpairing regions of the RNA secondary structures (i.e., loops and bulges) as well as the nonstructural regions of the genome. The di-nucleotide model describes the substitution process of the stem-pairing nucleotides. These two models differ in various ways, in particular the single nucleotide model makes many kinds of substitutions relatively likely and the di-nucleotide model strongly favors compensatory substitutions.</p><p>The phylo-SCFGs are composed of two components: a structural and a nonstructural one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-sg005">Figures S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-sg006">S6</xref>). The structural component describes structural regions whose first and last bases are paired. Such regions can correspond to a single hairpin or a more complex structure, and will be referred to here as folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020033-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). This component contains both a di-nucleotide and a single-nucleotide phylogenetic model. The nonstructural component describes the regions outside folds and contains only a single-nucleotide phylogenetic model.</p><p>The fRNA model contains both the structural and the nonstructural component. In contrast, the background model contains only the nonstructural component.

All the predicted folds, which pass the fold elimination described below, are included in the candidate set.</p><p>The fps measures the overall tendency for the alignment to contain any fRNA.

The background model is carefully designed to model alignment sequences using the same nucleotide distribution as the fRNA model, thereby alleviating the problem of overpredicting in, e.g., GC-rich regions. The fps scores are length dependent; length-normalized versions of the fps scores are therefore used in this paper. The scores are used to rank the folds within each subclass.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Validation.</title><p>The false-positive rate of EvoFold was estimated by applying it to a set of alignments that have been randomized to remove the signal of any true fRNAs, but which retain the same base composition, substitution pattern, and conservation pattern as the original alignments.

Our set of fold predictions thus contains some false positives, but we decided to retain all but the very short folds to sustain a comprehensive set of folds for downstream analysis. Subsets of folds with a much lower occurrence of false positives can be defined by focusing on only the top-ranked predictions, e.g., there are only an estimated 5% false positives in the top 100 scoring folds with more than 15 bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020033-sg002">S2</xref>C).

The conserved human–mouse syntenic matching elements (see below) that overlap these human matches were selected and annotated with the secondary structures given in Rfam Full. Annotated stem pairs that could not form in the human sequence were treated as unpaired. Then all tRNA matches were discarded (many were found to be pseudogenes) and alignment sequences with poor secondary-structure conservation were removed. Finally all alignments with fewer than four sequences left were discarded. The resulting set contained 262 annotated alignments.
