				<article-title>Gut Reaction: Pyrosequencing Provides the Poop on Distal Gut Bacteria</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The human intestinal microbiota is essential to the health of the host and plays a role in nutrition, development, metabolism, pathogen resistance, and regulation of immune responses. Antibiotics may disrupt these coevolved interactions, leading to acute or chronic disease in some individuals. Our understanding of antibiotic-associated disturbance of the microbiota has been limited by the poor sensitivity, inadequate resolution, and significant cost of current research methods. The use of pyrosequencing technology to generate large numbers of 16S rDNA sequence tags circumvents these limitations and has been shown to reveal previously unexplored aspects of the “rare biosphere.” We investigated the distal gut bacterial communities of three healthy humans before and after treatment with ciprofloxacin, obtaining more than 7,000 full-length rRNA sequences and over 900,000 pyrosequencing reads from two hypervariable regions of the rRNA gene. A companion paper in <italic>PLoS Genetics</italic> (see Huse et al., doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000255" xlink:type="simple">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000255</ext-link>) shows that the taxonomic information obtained with these methods is concordant. Pyrosequencing of the V6 and V3 variable regions identified 3,300–5,700 taxa that collectively accounted for over 99% of the variable region sequence tags that could be obtained from these samples. Ciprofloxacin treatment influenced the abundance of about a third of the bacterial taxa in the gut, decreasing the taxonomic richness, diversity, and evenness of the community. However, the magnitude of this effect varied among individuals, and some taxa showed interindividual variation in the response to ciprofloxacin. While differences of community composition between individuals were the largest source of variability between samples, we found that two unrelated individuals shared a surprising degree of community similarity. In all three individuals, the taxonomic composition of the community closely resembled its pretreatment state by 4 weeks after the end of treatment, but several taxa failed to recover within 6 months. These pervasive effects of ciprofloxacin on community composition contrast with the reports by participants of normal intestinal function and with prior assumptions of only modest effects of ciprofloxacin on the intestinal microbiota. These observations support the hypothesis of functional redundancy in the human gut microbiota. The rapid return to the pretreatment community composition is indicative of factors promoting community resilience, the nature of which deserves future investigation.</p>

          <p>The intestinal microbiota is essential to human health, with effects on nutrition, metabolism, pathogen resistance, and other processes. Antibiotics may disrupt these interactions and cause acute disease, as well as contribute to chronic health problems, although technical challenges have hampered research on this front. Several recent studies have characterized uncultured and complex microbial communities by applying a new, massively parallel technology to obtain hundreds of thousands of sequences of a specific variable region within the small subunit rRNA gene. These shorter sequences provide an indication of diversity. We used this technique to track changes in the intestinal microbiota of three healthy humans before and after treatment with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, with high sensitivity and resolution, and without sacrificing breadth of coverage. Consistent with previous results, we found that the microbiota of these individuals was similar at the genus level, but interindividual differences were evident at finer scales. Ciprofloxacin reduced the diversity of the intestinal microbiota, with significant effects on about one-third of the bacterial taxa. Despite this pervasive disturbance, the membership of the communities had largely returned to the pretreatment state within 4 weeks.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Specialized microbial communities inhabit the skin, mucosal surfaces, and gastrointestinal tract of humans (and other vertebrates) from birth until death, with by far the largest populations in the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b002">2</xref>]. Humans rely on their native microbiota for nutrition and resistance to colonization by pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b006">6</xref>]; furthermore, recent discoveries have shown that symbiotic microbes make essential contributions to the development, metabolism, and immune response of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b010">10</xref>]. Co-evolved, beneficial, human–microbe interactions can be altered by many aspects of a modern lifestyle, including urbanization, global travel, and dietary changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b001">1</xref>], but in particular by antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b011">11</xref>]. The acute effects of antibiotic treatment on the native gut microbiota range from self-limiting “functional” diarrhea to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b013">13</xref>]. The long-term consequences of such perturbations for the human–microbial symbiosis are more difficult to discern, but chronic conditions such as asthma and atopic disease have been associated with childhood antibiotic use and an altered intestinal microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b016">16</xref>]. Because many chemical transformations in the gut are mediated by specific microbial populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b017">17</xref>], with implications for cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b019">19</xref>] and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b021">21</xref>], among other conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b022">22</xref>], changes in the composition of the gut microbiota could have important but undiscovered health effects. An approximate return to pretreatment conditions often (but not always) occurs within days or weeks after cessation of antibiotic treatment, as assessed by subjective judgments of bowel function and characterizations of overall community composition using techniques with low phylogenetic resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b025">25</xref>]. However, the effects of a single course of antibiotics on specific microbial populations in vivo can persist for years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b028">28</xref>]. Overall, the duration and extent of antibiotic-induced disturbance throughout the intestinal microbiota remains poorly characterized, particularly at the species and strain level where the diversity of the community is greatest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b029">29</xref>], and we lack the information to compare these disturbances to normal temporal variation in community composition.</p>
      <p>The diversity and abundance of the human microbiota, and of the gut community in particular, poses a challenge for researchers investigating changes in community composition over time. The laborious cultivation-based techniques that were the mainstay of microbiology for a century have revealed only a minority of the species that inhabit the human colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b031">31</xref>]. Over the past decade, cultivation-independent molecular techniques, particularly those based on the small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene, have given us a broader and less biased view of the gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b033">33</xref>]. Full-length 16S rRNA sequences offer the highest possible degree of taxonomic resolution using this gene, but the cost of dideoxy Sanger sequencing limits our ability to survey the less-abundant members of this diverse community. Studies comparing changes in the gut microbiota over time or between treatments have often used alternative molecular techniques that are more rapid and less expensive than sequencing, but that offer lower taxonomic resolution and reveal only the more abundant members of the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b037">37</xref>]. These approaches can be focused more narrowly on particular taxonomic groups, which facilitates the investigation of less-abundant taxa, but at the expense of a broader view of community composition that might reveal important microbial interactions.</p>
      <p>Pyrosequencing ameliorates some of these constraints by generating a much larger amount of genetic sequence data at a lower cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b038">38</xref>]. Both with this approach and with the established approach of clone library sequencing, DNA is extracted from a sample, and PCR primers complementary to conserved regions of the 16S rRNA are used to amplify the intervening variable sequence. The diversity and relative abundance of 16S rRNA sequence variants in the pool of amplicons is analyzed as a proxy for the diversity and relative abundance of the microbial populations in the sample. Because the gene sequence-based recognition of uncultivated microbial populations is not equivalent to traditional taxonomic classification, terms such as “species” or “strain” are not appropriate. Instead, the populations inferred to exist on the basis of sequence data are referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which can be defined in various ways and at different levels of resolution.</p>
      <p>Both the clone library and pyrosequencing approaches can be affected by biased PCR amplification of microbial populations in the sample, although the problem is reduced for the shorter pyrosequencing amplicons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b039">39</xref>]. The pyrosequencing approach also avoids the cloning bias of the earlier technique by attaching amplicons individually to beads and physically separating the beads into picoliter-scale wells on a specialized plate. Less phylogenetic information is available from a single pyrosequencing read (at most, ∼230 informative bases with recent technology) than from near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence (∼1,400 bases with commonly used primers), but reads that span particular variable regions of the gene are highly informative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b041">41</xref>]. On the other hand, well over 200,000 short 16S rRNA sequence reads, which we refer to as tags, can be obtained in a single run of the Genome Sequencer FLX System. In comparison, two runs of a state-of-the-art capillary Sanger sequencer are required to obtain at most 384 full-length 16S rRNA sequences.</p>
      <p>Sogin and his co-workers have demonstrated the power of pyrosequencing by amplifying the V6 variable region of 16S rRNA from marine deep water and hydrothermal vent samples, analyzing over 900,000 bacterial and archaeal tags from the vent system and revealing greater taxonomic richness (over 20,000 OTUs observed at 3% sequence divergence) than has previously been reported for any microbial habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b043">43</xref>]. Roesch et al. followed a similar strategy using the V9 region to analyze North American soil samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b044">44</xref>], and a group led by Knight have focused on a longer tag that includes the V2 region in macaque gut samples and in a mixture of five diverse microbial habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b046">46</xref>]. Computer simulations by Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b043">43</xref>], Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b041">41</xref>], and Sundquist et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b047">47</xref>] have indicated that pyrosequencing tags from different regions of the gene will vary in their utility for the distinct tasks of revealing microbial diversity and performing taxonomic classification, both of which contribute to making informative comparisons between complex microbial communities. As with the established approach of generating data from clone libraries, the actual performance of tag pyrosequencing for the goals of a particular study will depend on the region of the 16S rRNA gene analyzed, the PCR primers used, and the composition of the microbial communities in the samples.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we used pyrosequencing tags spanning the V6 and V3 regions as well as full-length 16S rRNA sequences to analyze the bacterial community composition in a time series of stool samples obtained from three healthy adults before, during, and after a short course of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cp). A companion paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b048">48</xref>] reports a high degree of similarity in the community composition inferred from the two variable regions and from full-length sequences. Here we describe the diversity of human intestinal bacteria more completely and with more precision than has previously been possible. Cp has an extensive and individualized effect on the composition of these communities, but most members of the community returned to their pretreatment abundance within weeks.</p>

        <title>Participants, Treatment, and Sampling</title>
        <p>Healthy adults who had not taken any antibiotics within the previous year were recruited to donate stool samples before, during, and after a short course of ciprofloxacin (Cp) (500 mg twice a day for 5 d), typical of the treatment prescribed, e.g., for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Samples of approximately 5 g were collected in sterile plastic containers by the participants themselves and immediately stored in home freezers until brought to the laboratory (within several days) for storage at −80 °C. From a larger number of samples collected, we chose five time points spanning an 8-mo interval from each of three participants for analyses using full-length 16S rRNA clone libraries and pyrosequencing of the V6 variable region of 16S rRNA. An additional three samples from one of the participants were analyzed along with the original 15 samples using V3 tag pyrosequencing. Participant characteristics and the sampling and analysis regime are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060280-t001">Table 1</xref>. For each participant, samples 1 and 2 (1, 2a, 2b, and 2c for individual A) were collected prior to Cp treatment, sample 3 (3a and 3b for individual A) was the Cp-associated sample taken during or immediately after treatment, and samples 4 and 5 were more distant post-treatment samples. Informed consent was obtained from participants, and the study protocol was approved by the Administrative Panel for Medical Research on Human Subjects (Institutional Review Board) of Stanford University.</p>

        <title>DNA Extraction</title>
        <p>A subsample of approximately 200 mg of frozen stool was added to a 2.0-ml screwcap vial containing glass beads of 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.1 mm diameter (BioSpec Products), and kept on ice until the addition of 1.4-ml ASL buffer from the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen). Samples were immediately subjected to beadbeating (45 s, setting 4) using a FastPrep machine (Bio 101) prior to the initial incubation for heat and chemical lysis at 95 °C for 7 min. Subsequent steps of the DNA extraction followed the QIAamp kit protocol. DNA from two separate extractions of each sample were pooled for molecular analysis. Extraction controls lacking fecal material but otherwise treated identically were carried through the entire procedure including PCR amplification (no bands visible) and attempted cloning of PCR amplicons, which was unsuccessful.</p>

        <title>Full-Length 16S rRNA Sequencing</title>
        <p>To amplify near full-length 16S rRNA sequences, 2 ml of extracted DNA served as the template in 20-μl reactions containing 1 unit AmpliTaq polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 1x Buffer II, 1.5mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20mM tetramethylammonium chloride, 5% DMSO, 0.02% Triton X-100, 100 nM of each dNTP, and 20 nM each of forward and reverse primers (Integrated DNA Technologies). The forward primer was a mixture of 90% bacterial primer 8F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and 10% 8F-Bif targeting <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> (5′-AGGGTTCGATTCTGGCTCAG-3′); it was paired with the three domain reverse primer 1391R (5′-GACGGGCGGTGTGTRCA-3′). Thermocycling involved a 5-min denaturation at 95 °C followed by 15–22 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (90 s), with a final extension at 72 °C for 8 min. The fewest possible cycles were used to produce a faint band of the expected size under UV illumination after electrophoresis of 5-μl reaction product in a 1% agarose minigel containing 1 mM ethidium bromide. Two 4-cycle, 50-μl reconditioning PCR reactions were performed per sample to eliminate heteroduplexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b049">49</xref>], with 5-μl aliquots of the initial PCR product mixture as the template and other PCR conditions unchanged. Products of the two reconditioning PCR reactions per sample were combined, purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen), and sent to the J. Craig Venter Institute (Rockville, MD) for cloning and automated bidirectional dideoxy sequencing.</p>
        <p>Forward and reverse sequencing reads were assembled using the Phred/Phrap/Consed suite of programs with default parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b052">52</xref>]; assembled sequences were aligned via the NAST algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b053">53</xref>] at the Greengenes Website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://greengenes.lbl.gov/" xlink:type="simple">http://greengenes.lbl.gov/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b054">54</xref>]. Aligned sequences were checked for chimeras using version 2 of the Greengenes implementation of Bellerophon, with 99% similarity to a trusted sequence over 1,250 nucleotides as the threshold to bypass checking, and rejecting both putative and subthreshold chimeras regardless of the divergence ratio. Of 10,062 assembled sequences, 203 did not result in a NAST alignment that included both the V3 and V6 regions, and 2,651 were excluded as possible chimeras, leaving 7,208 full-length sequences for analysis. Using the less-stringent default settings in Bellerophon to identify chimeras (divergence ratio &gt; 1.1) would have excluded 766 fewer sequences from the analysis, but the exclusion of these sequences did not significantly affect the inferred taxonomic composition of the community (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sd008">Text S1</xref>). The taxonomic affiliation of full-length sequences was determined using the Classifier tool of the RDP, with an 80% bootstrap threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b041">41</xref>].</p>
        <p>The NAST-aligned full-length sequences were imported into ARB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b055">55</xref>] and a genetic distance matrix calculated with the Olsen distance correction using the Hugenholtz version of the Lane mask (included with Greengenes ARB database) to exclude regions of questionable alignment; 1,241 columns were retained. The distance matrix was used with a 0.01 genetic distance, furthest-neighbor threshold in DOTUR version 1.53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b056">56</xref>] to designate 1,295 operational taxonomic units (OTU<sub>0.01</sub>). The full-length sequences have been deposited in GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/</ext-link>; accession numbers: EU761594–EU768801).</p>

        <title>16S rRNA Tag Pyrosequencing</title>
        <p>Amplicon libraries for 16S rRNA V6 region pyrosequencing were generated as recommended by 454 Life Sciences, using the same DNA extracts as for full-length sequencing, with 50 ng of template DNA (determined by a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer, NanoDrop Technologies) in 50-μl, 30-cycle reactions. The PCR reagents and thermocycling parameters were those suggested in the protocol, except that the annealing temperature was reduced from 57 °C to 55 °C. Each PAGE-purified fusion primer (Integrated DNA Technologies) consisted of the 454 platform A or B linker/primer sequence, a trinucleotide key (or barcode) that was unique for each sample, and sequence complementary to a conserved region flanking the V6 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The forward primer was an equimolar mixture of two nondegenerate oligonucleotides 5'-<italic>Bxxx</italic>CAACGCGAAGAACCTTACC-3′ and 5'-<italic>Bxxx</italic>ATACGCGAGGAACCTTACC-3′, where <italic>B</italic> represents the B linker (5′-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG-3′), <italic>xxx</italic> represents the sample identification key, and the remaining nucleotides correspond to positions 967–985 of the 16S rRNA gene (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> numbering). The degenerate reverse primer was 5'-<italic>Axxx</italic>CGACARCCATGCASCACCT-3′, including the A linker (5′-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAG-3′), sample key, and nucleotides corresponding to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> positions 1,064–1,046. Two or three separate amplification reactions for each sample were pooled and purified as recommended using Ampure beads (Agencourt).</p>
        <p>The amplicon length and concentration in the libraries was estimated using the BioAnalyzer microfluidics device (Agilent), and an equimolar mix of all 15 V6 amplicon libraries was used to prepare both A-linked and B-linked pyrosequencing beads (i.e., for bidirectional reads of the amplicons) via emulsion PCR using the recommended kit and protocol (454 Life Sciences). An equal mixture of A-linked and B-linked beads was loaded onto both regions of a Picotiter plate (estimated 825,000 beads/region). Pyrosequencing on the Genome Sequencer FLX System (Roche) at the Stanford Genome Technology Center resulted in 490,881 reads which passed the length and quality criteria of the machine software.</p>
        <p>Preparation of amplicon libraries for the V3 region used the same DNA extracts as for the full-length and V6 sequences, except that new DNA extracts were prepared for samples 2c and 3b from individual A, and additional samples 2a, 2b, and 3a from individual A were included, as described above and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060280-t001">Table 1</xref>. V3 amplicon libraries were prepared as for the V6 region, using a single 50-μl PCR reaction per sample and with the following PAGE-purified primers (Integrated DNA Technologies): 5'-<italic>Bxxxxx</italic>ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′ (B linker, pentamer sample identification key, forward primer at <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> positions 338–357) and 5'-<italic>Axxxxx</italic>TTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3′ (A linker, pentamer key, reverse primer at <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> positions 533–515). Preparation of A-linked and B-linked beads and pyrosequencing were carried out as described above, with an estimated 900,000 beads loaded in each region of the Picotiter plate, which resulted in 593,088 pyrosequencing reads passing machine quality filters.</p>
        <p>Pyrosequencing reads of both the V6 and V3 regions were passed through additional quality filters to reduce the overall error rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b043">43</xref>]. Any reads containing one or more ambiguous nucleotides and reads shorter than 50 nucleotides were discarded. The expected sample keys and primer sequences were trimmed from the proximal and distal ends of the reads, and those lacking an expected sample key and primer sequence at either end were examined further. In many of these cases, a rare variant of the expected sequence was identified and trimmed from the read. The origin of at least some of these rare primer variants as oligonucleotide synthesis errors was suggested by the frequent appearance of several copies of a particular rare variant in a single sample, while no examples of that variant appeared in any other sample. Because unique primers (differing in the sample key and synthesized separately) were used to generate the amplicon libraries from each sample, a synthesis error would be likely to affect only a single sample. Reads lacking a recognizable primer sequence (including rare variants) at either end, reads covering only a portion of the variable region, and reads that could not be unambiguously assigned to a sample were discarded; in addition, 18 reads from the V3 region with identity or near identity to eukaryotic rRNA sequences were discarded. The resulting datasets contained 441,894 V6 tags and 490,699 V3 tags, which were the basis of all subsequent analyses.</p>

        <title>Reference Databases and OTU Definition for Tag Pyrosequencing</title>
        <p>The V6 and V3 reference databases (V6 RefDB, V3 RefDB) are composed of publically available, high quality, full-length 16S rRNA sequences from Silva release 92 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arb-silva.de/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.arb-silva.de/</ext-link>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b057">57</xref>] with taxonomic classifications obtained from the RDP Classifier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b041">41</xref>] (minimum 80% bootstrap score) as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b048">48</xref>]. The V6 region is defined as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> positions 986-1045 corresponding to the sequence between primers 967F and 1046R. The V3 region is defined as <italic>E. coli</italic> positions 358–514, corresponding to the sequence between primers 338F and 515R.</p>
        <p>Pyrosequencing tags were assigned the taxonomic classification of the most similar reference sequence or sequences in the V6RefDB or V3RefDB, based on a multiple sequence alignment. In cases where a tag was equidistant to multiple reference sequences, the tag was classified to the level of the most resolved taxon shared by at least two-thirds of the reference sequences nearest that tag. For example, a tag with exact matches to multiple reference sequences would be resolved to the genus level only if at least two-thirds of the sequences containing that tag were classified in the same genus with an 80% bootstrap score by the RDP.</p>
        <p>A reference sequence-based operational taxonomic unit (refOTU) was defined as containing all query tags sharing the same RefDB sequence (or group of sequences) as their nearest neighbor. The vast majority of human gut pyrosequencing tags obtained in the current study (unlike marine tags [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b039">39</xref>]) have an exact or near match in the corresponding RefDB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which simplifies the classification of tags and the definition of refOTUs for this habitat. In this study, we will refer to a specific refOTU as V3<italic>_Taxon</italic> refOTU_X, where <italic>Taxon</italic> is the most-resolved taxon name assigned to the refOTU, and X is the rank order of the refOTU within <italic>Taxon</italic> based on the total normalized abundance data from this study.</p>

        <title>Statistical Calculations</title>
        <p>The comparison of nearest database distance to tag abundance, the rank abundance plots, the rarefaction curves, and the diversity summary statistics were calculated using actual tag counts without normalizing the number of tags obtained per sample. Rarefaction curves for full-length sequence OTU<sub>0.01</sub>s were calculated on a per-tag basis using DOTUR version 1.53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b058">58</xref>]; rarefaction curves for variable region refOTUs were calculated per sample using EstimateS version 7.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b059">59</xref>]. The Shannon diversity index <italic>H</italic> = –Σ <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic> ln(<italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic>) and Shannon equitability index <italic>E<sub>H</sub></italic> = <italic>H</italic>/ln(<italic>S</italic>) (where <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic> is the proportion of the <italic>i</italic>th OTU and <italic>S</italic> is the total number of OTUs) were calculated using spreadsheet software. The diversity summary statistics for Cp-associated samples were compared to the lower tail of values for other samples, assuming that summary statistics would be distributed normally when calculated for samples drawn repeatedly from an unchanging community.</p>
        <p>Comparisons of V3 refOTU abundance between samples were made after correcting for the unequal number of tags obtained from each sample. All tag abundance values within a sample were multiplied by the required factor so that total normalized tag abundance for all samples was 43,405, which was the number of V3 tags obtained from sample C5, the maximum for any sample. Normalization factors for the other samples ranged from 1.072 to 2.087. Principal component analysis of normalized refOTU abundance used the <italic>prcomp</italic> function of the <italic>stats</italic> package of the R statistical language, version 2.2.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>).

        <p>From 15 stool samples (five each from individuals A, B, and C), we obtained 7,208 near full-length 16S rRNA sequences by traditional PCR amplification, cloning, and capillary dideoxy sequencing. From the same set of 15 samples, we obtained 441,894 V6 pyrosequencing tags (average length 59), and from the same samples plus three additional samples from individual A (18 samples total), we obtained 490,699 V3 pyrosequencing tags (average length 145) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060280-t002">Table 2</xref>). The number of unique tags or sequences revealed by each method followed the same rank order as the total number of tags or sequences (V3 &gt; V6 &gt; full-length). However, the numerical disparity between pyrosequencing and capillary sequencing was smaller for unique tags or sequences than for all tags or sequences, reflecting the competing trends of higher throughput for tag pyrosequencing but greater resolution for full-length sequences. The V6 and V3 tags were grouped into 3,316 and 5,671 refOTUs, respectively, via comparison to reference databases (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>); 1,295 OTUs were identified among full-length sequences using a 1% genetic distance threshold after masking sequence positions of uncertain alignment (designated as OTU<sub>0.01</sub>). The number of unique genera or other most-resolved taxa above the genus level (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>) identified among sequences or tags was much lower, ranging from 56–130, confirming conclusions based on earlier molecular studies that the diversity of human colonic bacteria is concentrated at the species and strain level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b029">29</xref>].</p>

        <p>The abundant pyrosequencing tags derived from these three participants were much more likely than were the rare tags to have been seen before, i.e., to correspond perfectly to one or more of the full-length 16S rRNA sequences already available in the public databases. Even though only 9% of the unique V6 tags and 7% of the unique V3 tags had exact matches in the reference databases, these represented 90% of all V6 tags and 85% of all V3 tags, because nearly all the abundant tags had exact matches. Of the 100 most abundant V6 and V3 tags (representing 75% and 80% of all tags, respectively), 97 V6 tags and 94 V3 tags had perfect matches in the reference databases. The abundant gut bacteria from these participants were less well represented by cultivated strains; only about half of the 100 most abundant tags (51 V6 tags and 55 V3 tags) had perfect matches to 16S rRNA sequences derived from bacterial strains in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Pyrosequencing Errors and Rare, Genuine Tags</title>
        <p>The recently reported average accuracy per base of better than 99.75% for pyrosequencing of the V6 region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b043">43</xref>] (after applying additional filters to eliminate error-prone reads) is lower than that of capillary dideoxy sequencing, although considerably better than the 96% accuracy initially reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b038">38</xref>]. Undoubtedly, some fraction of the unique tags in our data arose from pyrosequencing errors, but individual error products were rare relative to the frequency of the correctly sequenced tag from which they were derived. The most abundant V6 and V3 tags in our data (exactly matching <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacteroides dorei</named-content> sequences) were observed 31,788 and 41,153 times, respectively, across all three participants. Assuming a uniform error rate per base of 0.25% over 59 or 145 nucleotides, most tags are expected to be error-free, and most error-containing tags are expected to have only a single error. There were 177 unique V6 tags in our dataset that differed from the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dorei</named-content> V6 tag at a single nucleotide position and that lacked an exact match to any sequence in the reference database. The most abundant of these potential error products occurred only 60 times, 0.19% the frequency of the error-free <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dorei</named-content> V6 tag. Similarly, of 270 unique V3 tags differing from the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dorei</named-content> V3 tag at only one position and lacking a perfect database match, the most abundant occurred 367 times. However, we consider this to be a rare, genuine tag, because the distribution of this tag among samples differed significantly from that of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dorei</named-content> tag, in contrast to the pattern expected for a pyrosequencing error product (following paragraph; also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sd008">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sd002">Dataset S2</xref>). The most abundant potential V3 error product derived from the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dorei</named-content> sequence occurred 226 times, 0.55% the frequency of the error-free tag.</p>
        <p>Sogin et al. suggested that using a reference database of public full-length 16S rRNA sequences to define taxa (i.e., refOTUs) for pyrosequencing tags would result in a conservative estimate of taxonomic richness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b039">39</xref>]. This procedure will also minimize the influence of pyrosequencing errors on comparisons of community composition, since such errors could never result in the definition of a novel (but artificial) taxon. Instead, most pyrosequencing error products will be counted appropriately as a member of the refOTU containing the nearly identical error-free tag from which it was derived. However, this OTU definition inherently limits the detectable taxonomic diversity to the sequences already present in the public databases, and it obscures genuine biodiversity whenever tags derived from distinct organisms are grouped into a single refOTU. We investigated this diversity-masking effect for the most abundant V6 and V3 taxa by calculating, for each sample separately, the abundance ratios of individual rare tags to the most common tag belonging to the same refOTU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sd008">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sd002">Dataset S2</xref>). For a given rare tag, significant variation in this ratio across samples is not expected if the rare tag is a pyrosequencing error product, because the likelihood of a particular error is independent of the origin of the tag. On this basis, four of the 42 rare V6 tags and 33 of the 87 rare V3 tags that we investigated were not likely to be pyrosequencing error products derived from the most common tag in the same refOTU (G test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Even though this approach cannot differentiate all error-free, rare tags from pyrosequencing error products, it is clear that analyzing pyrosequencing tags on the basis of refOTUs will obscure some genuine biodiversity. Nonetheless, we chose to accept this cost in order to ensure that pyrosequencing errors did not inflate the reported taxonomic richness, nor influence comparisons between communities. Because the vast majority of abundant tags had exact matches in the reference databases, the loss of taxonomic resolution in the current study would have affected mostly a subset of the rare taxa.</p>

        <title>Exploring the Rare Biosphere in the Distal Human Gut</title>
        <p>The rank abundance curves for OTUs derived from V6 and V3 tags and full-length sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g002">Figure 2</xref>) show the extent to which tag pyrosequencing facilitated our exploration of the rare biosphere of the human gut. There was substantial agreement between the methods in the estimated relative abundance of specific taxa ranging from the phylum to genus level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b048">48</xref>]. At a finer scale of resolution, the rank abundance curves had similar shapes for the V6 and V3 refOTUs and full-length OTU<sub>0.01</sub>s, with a small number of dominant taxa and a long tail of less abundant taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Tag pyrosequencing identified many more OTUs than were identified by a large, traditional 16S rRNA survey, but of perhaps greater importance, there are many OTUs for which pyrosequencing provided a more precise estimate of relative abundance, and an improved confidence of detection. For example, 869 of the 1,295 OTU<sub>0.01</sub>s detected among the cloned full-length sequences were singletons, represented by only a single sequence. The best estimate for the relative abundance of each singleton OTU<sub>0.01</sub> in the pooled community is 1/7,208 or 1.4 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, but the 95% confidence interval for this estimate (assuming a Poisson distribution of detection events) ranges over almost 2 orders of magnitude, 7.3 × 10<sup>−6</sup>–6.6 × 10<sup>−4</sup>. There is only a 63% chance for a specific taxon at 1.4 × 10<sup>−4</sup> relative abundance to be detected in a single sample of 7,208 clones, so the presence (or absence) of these singleton OTUs does not provide a robust basis for comparisons between samples. A refOTU that appeared 65 times among the V6 or V3 tags would have had the same estimated relative abundance as a singleton OTU<sub>0.01</sub> in the clone libraries, but with a much narrower 95% confidence interval of 1.0 × 10<sup>−4</sup>–1.7 × 10<sup>−4</sup>. There were 1,122 refOTUs in the pooled V6 libraries which occurred often enough (≥5 times) to estimate that their probability of detection was at least 99%; the estimated relative abundance for these taxa ranged from 7.4 × 10<sup>−2</sup> to 1.1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>. The pooled V3 libraries had 1,759 refOTUs with at least 99% probability of detection, with relative abundance ranging over almost 4 orders of magnitude, from 9.3 × 10<sup>−2</sup> to 1.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup> Because the depth of pyrosequencing permits a high confidence of detection for many moderately rare and rare taxa, their presence or absence is informative for comparisons between samples. In contrast, in the pooled clone libraries, there were only 199 OTU<sub>0.01</sub>s (relative abundance ranging from 4.8 × 10<sup>−2</sup> to 6.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), with at least a 99% estimated probability of detection.</p>

A range of 1,673–1,745 V6 refOTUs and 2,592–3,319 V3 refOTUs were found per individual, providing minimal estimates of the number of bacterial strains present in one person over an 8 month interval. Considering all the sampling times together, between 539–552 V6 refOTUs and 680–810 V3 refOTUs were found in each individual at 99% confidence of detection or above, compared to 66–98 full-length OTU<sub>0.01</sub> per individual.</p>
        <p>Rarefaction curves can be used to assess the degree of completion of a taxonomic survey, i.e., how closely the observed taxonomic richness approaches the endpoint of all the taxa detectable with a particular method for that set of samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b060">60</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows that the OTU<sub>0.01</sub> rarefaction curve rises more steeply than the curves for V6 or V3 refOTUs, which reflects the greater taxonomic resolution of this typical OTU definition applied to full-length sequences, compared to the refOTU definitions for pyrosequencing tags. On the other hand, although this set of 7,208 sequences is among the largest datasets of full-length 16S rRNA sequences from the human microbiota (or any environment), the rarefaction curves for V6 and V3 tag pyrosequencing eventually rise higher and display more curvature toward the horizontal than the OTU<sub>0.01</sub> curve. These features show that a single run of the FLX sequencer targeting V6 or V3 tags from the human gut microbiota can reveal more taxa, and capture a larger proportion of the detectable taxa, than a more extensive effort directed toward full-length 16S rRNA clone sequencing.</p>

Text boxes indicate the final observed OTU richness (O), range of estimated OTU richness by the ACE, ICE, Chao 1 and Chao 2 nonparametric estimators (E) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b063">63</xref>], and Good's coverage (C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b064">64</xref>] for each method. The nonparametric estimators indicate that total OTU richness is much higher than currently observed, but are known to underestimate the true richness when the number of observations (i.e., tags or sequences) is small relative to the size of the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b063">63</xref>].

        <p>However, the tag-based surveys are by no means complete, as shown by the large number of singleton refOTUs in both the V6 and V3 data (1,361/3,316 and 2,306/5,671, respectively). Nonparametric estimators of total refOTU richness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b063">63</xref>] were 60–70% higher than the observed richness, in the range of 5,300–5,700 refOTUs for the V6 tags and 8,875–9,650 refOTUs for the V3 tags. These large discrepancies between observed and estimated richness, and the 20–35% increase in estimated richness over the last half of sampling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) indicate undersampling, a situation in which nonparametric estimators underestimate true richness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b063">63</xref>]. The biological significance of the many rare, unobserved taxa implied by these estimates is unknown.</p>
        <p>While rarefaction and richness estimators consider survey completion from the perspective of identified and unidentified taxa, coverage considers completion from the perspective of individual tags or sequences. Good's coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b064">64</xref>], the estimated likelihood that a tag or sequence chosen from the sample at random will belong to an OTU that has already been identified in the dataset, was 99.2% and 99.5% for V6 and V3 data, respectively, in contrast to 88% for the full-length sequences. In other words, we expect that more than 100 additional tags would need to be sequenced in order to detect a new refOTU for either variable region, while on average less than ten new full-length sequences would suffice to detect a new OTU<sub>0.01</sub>.</p>

        <p>In the now-familiar context of interindividual variability in the human microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b071">71</xref>], the similarity of the gut communities in individuals A and C was unexpected. None of the study participants are related, nor do they live or work together, and individuals B and C would appear to be the most similar to each other based on host traits such as gender, ethnicity, and geographic origin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060280-t001">Table 1</xref>). Hence, other factors (e.g., diet) that were not investigated in this study may have an important influence on the similarity of the intestinal communities from individuals A and C.</p>
        <p>Log transformation of taxon relative abundance prior to PCA reduces the influence of abundant taxa relative to that of moderately abundant taxa; it has an impact intermediate between performing no transformation, which allows abundant taxa to dominate inter-sample variability, and scaling the data so that the variability of each taxon among samples is weighted equally. Not surprisingly, the first axes of PCA on the untransformed refOTU data explained a higher proportion of the total variability (because a few taxa accounted for most of the variation); in this case, the distinction between the Cp-associated and non-Cp samples of individual C was obscured within the temporal variability of non-Cp samples of individual A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A). On the other hand, with scaled PCA, the proportion of explained variability on the initial axes was lower, but the Cp-associated samples of both A and C were clearly separated in the same direction along axis 2 from a cluster containing all the non-Cp-associated samples from both individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B). As with the diversity statistics, PCA (regardless of the abundance transformation) did not reveal any Cp effect at 4 wk post-treatment that could be distinguished from other sources of temporal variability. A caveat to interpreting PCA with any weighting scheme is that each refOTU is treated as equally dissimilar to all others. Preliminary results from ordination techniques that considered a range of refOTU relatedness showed a smaller magnitude of Cp-associated variability relative to the magnitude of interindividual differences of community composition (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>Over a third of the V3 refOTUs with normalized total abundance of ten or more (528/1,450) differed significantly in abundance between participants (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 2.9% FDR).

        <p>We tested taxa for a significant response to Cp by looking for two patterns: either a difference between the relative abundance in Cp-associated samples versus all other samples (pattern 1), or a difference between the relative abundance in pre-Cp samples versus samples collected during and after treatment (pattern 2). A detectable Cp response in a particular taxon could be a direct effect of Cp activity, or it could be mediated by ecological interactions with other taxa. Because these data represent relative abundance, a taxon that maintains constant abundance in absolute terms as the total community abundance declines will represent an increasing proportion of the community. For comparisons across all individuals we expressed the refOTU abundance in a sample as the deviance of log abundance from the mean log abundance of the refOTU in that individual; this procedure compared changes in relative, not absolute abundance across individuals. Cp effects were found in 30% of refOTUs (442/1,450) when tested over all individuals, more according to pattern 1 (428 taxa, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 7.7% FDR) and fewer according to pattern 2 (46 taxa, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005, 10% FDR; 32 taxa are significant according to both patterns) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sd006">Dataset S6</xref>). The predominance of pattern 1 was expected based on the PCA results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g006">Figure 6</xref>; Cp-associated samples differed from others within each subject, but no separation of pre- and post-Cp samples was evident on the primary PCA axes.</p>
        <p>A number of the abundant taxa found to vary significantly in response to Cp appeared to have different responses among the participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g008">Figure 8</xref>), which suggested that testing for a Cp response within each individual might reveal additional taxa that respond to Cp only in some subjects. Testing only within A, for example, revealed that 25% (314/1,260) of refOTUs varied in response to Cp (pattern 1: 314 taxa significant, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 6.9% FDR; pattern 2: 1 taxon significant, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>4</sup>, 1.5% FDR, this taxon was significant by pattern 1 as well) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sd007">Dataset S7</xref>). Slightly less than half of these taxa (158/321) were found to be Cp responsive when testing across all individuals; the taxa found to be significant both within A and across all individuals were concentrated among the more abundant taxa. With data from only a single Cp-associated sample, we cannot yet conduct a similar comparison within individuals B and C, but the Cp response of the intestinal microbiota appears to be individualized, particularly for less abundant members of the community.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We applied the 16S rRNA tag pyrosequencing strategy of Sogin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b039">39</xref>] to characterize bacterial populations in the distal human gut, which constitute the predominant community of the human microbiota and one of the most densely populated microbial habitats on Earth. This approach revealed both the pervasive effects of an antibiotic that is considered to be relatively benign for the gut microbiota, and the resilience of the human gut microbiota following perturbation. As shown with marine, soil, and macaque gut samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b045">45</xref>], massively parallel pyrosequencing permits the exploration of microbial diversity in complex communities to an unprecedented depth. In comparison to clone libraries and traditional dideoxy sequencing, tag pyrosequencing detects more taxa, and provides more-accurate estimates of the relative abundance of a large number of moderate- and low-abundance taxa. Such data will facilitate better ecological studies of the human microbiota, with immediate clinical application. For example, the composition of the microbiota at the start of antibiotic treatment may determine the likelihood of pathogen overgrowth and life-threatening antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b073">73</xref>]; investigation of this hypothesis will depend on comprehensive characterizations of the community over time, including both rare and abundant taxa. Of the four bacterial pathogens associated with severe AAD, tags matching <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Klebsiella oxytoca</named-content> and <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> were detected rarely in the current study (nine tags in two subjects and one tag, respectively); tags matching <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Clostridium difficile</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content> were not found. The rarity of these pathogens and the absence of severe AAD in the current study is not surprising, since only a small number of healthy young adults were involved. It would be of tremendous interest and practical value to conduct a similar study of stool samples collected over time from elderly patients in hospitals or long-term care facilities, which have higher frequencies of both antibiotics use and serious complications from such use.</p>
      <p>Cp is reported to have a lower rate of common gastrointestinal side effects than some other broad-spectrum antibiotics, and effects on gut microbial diversity (as detected by a low resolution “fingerprinting” technique) were less pronounced for Cp than for clindamycin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b025">25</xref>]. Nonetheless, the relative abundance levels of about 30% of the taxa in the gut were affected by Cp treatment when the comparison was made across all individuals, and additional taxa were found to respond to Cp within a single participant. Some of these changes may be direct effects of varying sensitivity to the antibiotic among the taxa comprising the gut microbiota. The refOTUs that increased in relative abundance following Cp treatment may represent taxa with intrinsic resistance to the antibiotic, strains that are typically Cp-sensitive but that had already acquired resistance prior to this study, or strains that developed Cp-resistance due to the current exposure. However, many of the changes in the community are likely to be explained by indirect effects, mediated by ecological interactions among taxa such as resource competition, cross-feeding, or the cooperative lysis of polymeric substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b075">75</xref>].</p>
      <p>Despite a pervasive disturbance of the gut microbiota, gut function remained normal as assessed subjectively by the participants, and the community composition in samples taken 4 wk after treatment were within the range of temporal variability of pretreatment samples. While the current study did not include samples showing the temporal features of the return of the community to its prior state, a pyrosequencing-based investigation of this rapid transition in a complex community is clearly of interest, and is continuing in our laboratory. The apparent continuity of gut function supports the hypothesis that the diversity of the microbial community provides functional redundancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b002">2</xref>]. At the same time, continuity in the predominant metabolic activity of the community, i.e., hydrolysis and fermentation of polysaccharides, does not necessarily imply the continuity of more specialized activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b076">76</xref>] such as bile transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b077">77</xref>], immune modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b078">78</xref>], or pathogen resistance due to specific inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b080">80</xref>]. Yet, the rapid return of the gut community to its pretreatment state in each individual suggests that not all communities supporting similar functions are equivalent. A quantitative examination of the metabolic transformations and host interactions of the gut microbiota during perturbation will be necessary to assess functional stability. In addition, it will be important to examine the microbiota at different sites within the intestinal tract in order to appreciate possible local antibiotic effects that are not revealed in fecal specimens. Epidemiological studies associating antibiotic-induced changes in the gut microbiota with chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b081">81</xref>] suggest that some consequences of community change may not be evident immediately.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the factors responsible for community resilience is warranted. A mixture of selective forces intrinsic to the community (e.g., a competitive hierarchy based on relative growth rates and substrate affinity or interference mechanisms) and imposed by the environment (e.g., composition of the diet and of host-derived substrates) is likely to be involved, but nonselective forces such as re-colonization of the gut lumen from protected environments (perhaps the mucosa) must also be considered.</p>
      <p>The current study can be compared to that of Young and Schmidt, who investigated changing bacterial populations in stool samples from a single patient with self-resolving AAD subsequent to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b082">82</xref>]. These investigators noted the complete absence of sequences from <italic>Clostridium</italic> cluster XIVa on the fourth day of antibiotic treatment (down from 20% on day 0) and a reduction from 33% to 15% of sequences affiliated with the genus <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>; these two groups include the majority of butyrate-producing bacteria in the human gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b083">83</xref>]. (Butyrate is the preferred energy source of colonocytes.) In contrast, none of the participants in the current study experienced AAD. While <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> refOTUs declined in all participants in response to Cp, each individual had other refOTUs with dominant tags exactly matching known butyrate-producing organisms that maintained or increased their abundance during Cp treatment (e.g., V3_<italic>Roseburia</italic>_refOTU_1 in individual B matches <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Roseburia intestinalis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b084">84</xref>], V3_<italic>Anaerostipes</italic>_refOTU_1, in individuals A and C, matches the unnamed butyrate-producing strains SS2/1 and SSC/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b085">85</xref>]).</p>
      <p>Although the community as a whole showed a substantial return to the pre-Cp composition within 4 wk of the end of Cp treatment, there were examples of taxa that were affected by Cp and did not recover. V3_<italic>Clostridiales</italic>_refOTU_23 was the 41st and 52nd most abundant taxon before Cp treatment in individuals A and C, respectively, and present in all pre-Cp samples (means of 206 and 158 tags per sample); it was completely absent from all samples after the start of Cp treatment. This refOTU includes perfect matches to clones obtained from the human gut and from swine manure lagoons, but none to a cultivated bacterium. The most similar cultivated species are <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Clostridium piliforme</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. colinum</named-content>, both zoonotic pathogens. V3_<italic>Bilophila</italic>_refOTU_1 was the 82nd and 79th most abundant pre-Cp refOTU in individuals A and C (means of 60 and 91 tags/sample); it was reduced to an average of less than two tags per sample after Cp treatment began. V3_<italic>Bilophila</italic>_refOTU_1 responded differently in individual B, in whom it was absent from the Cp-associated sample but subsequently rebounded to pre-Cp levels. The dominant tag of this refOTU exactly matches <italic>Bilophila wadsworthia,</italic> a common gut microbe that is frequently isolated in cases of appendicitis and from intestinal and extraintestinal abscesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b086">86</xref>]. The clinical significance of these persistent Cp-induced changes is unknown, but some gut bacteria are known to have important health effects despite being present at moderate or low abundance. For example, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Oxalobacter formigenes</named-content> is the most important known oxalate degrader in the human gut, an activity associated with a reduced risk for the development of calcium oxalate kidney stones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b022">22</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">O. formigenes</named-content> is found at low abundance in most children, but is absent from many adults, which is generally attributed to its susceptibility to many antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b022">22</xref>]. Tags matching <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">O. formigenes</named-content> were not detected in the current study.</p>
      <p>Certain abundant taxa responded differently to Cp in different individuals, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g008">Figure 8</xref>. This result is not surprising when we consider that antibiotic resistance, even high-level Cp resistance resulting from chromosomal mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b087">87</xref>], can be acquired far more rapidly than the rate of evolutionary change in the 16S rRNA gene. Although the participants had not taken any antibiotics in the year prior to the study, their earlier exposure to Cp or other antibiotics is unknown. Once established, antibiotic resistant strains can persist in the human gut for years in the absence of further antibiotic use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b028">28</xref>]. Another potential explanation for divergent Cp responses of the same refOTU between individuals is the existence of indirect effects; the response may be mediated by ecological linkages that differ between individuals.</p>
      <p>As shown in the companion paper of Huse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b048">48</xref>], the inferred bacterial community composition in these samples at taxonomic levels from phylum to genus was very similar, whether based on tags from the V6 or V3 variable regions or on full-length 16S rRNA sequences. All three techniques involve PCR amplification, and hence could fail to detect certain phylogenetic groups or lead to skewed levels of tag or sequence relative abundance with respect to the starting material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b088">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b089">89</xref>]. However, the similarity of the results obtained from three distinct sets of primers suggests that the PCR bias of these primers (and the cloning bias for full-length sequences) for the bacterial taxa present in this habitat is minimal. The interpretation of these results as a measure of the relative abundance of cells in the gut habitat must still be made with caveats regarding differential cell lysis and the unequal numbers of rRNA genes per genome, as for any 16S rRNA-based technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b088">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b089">89</xref>].</p>
      <p>Clearly, full-length sequences will provide the highest possible phylogenetic resolution for any genetic locus. However, pyrosequencing tags from either of two carefully chosen, short variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene have sufficient resolution to reveal taxonomic richness that exceeds any previously observed for samples of host-associated microbial communities, even though most diversity in these habitats is concentrated at the species and strain level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b029">29</xref>]. This success occurred despite our use of reference databases to define OTUs, which necessarily constrained the resolution of tag pyrosequencing to the diversity already represented in public 16S rRNA sequence databases. A more accurate assessment of microbial diversity that accounts for the novel 16S rRNA variants discovered by pyrosequencing will depend on defining OTUs with reference to the tags themselves (e.g., using tag sequence divergence), with appropriate treatment of potential pyrosequencing errors. A high proportion of tags in the current study have an exact match in the database, due to the substantial sequencing effort that has already been directed to the human gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b090">90</xref>]. Hence, the constraint of defining OTUs with respect to a database is not as severe for this habitat as it may be for others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b042">42</xref>]. However, the limitations of full-length 16S rRNA sequence surveys for discovering rare members of the gut biosphere are demonstrated by the contrast between the abundant tags in this study, almost all of which have an exact match in the database, and rare tags, which occur at a range of distances from their nearest database match (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>This study has confirmed the existence of more than 5,600 bacterial taxa in the human gut, exceeding earlier predictions made on the basis of nonparametric richness estimators and full-length 16S rRNA sequencing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b030">30</xref>], but the presence of singleton OTUs in our data leads to a still larger predicted richness for this habitat. As has long been appreciated, the highly uneven abundance distribution among taxa in this community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060280-sd003">Dataset S3</xref>) hampers the identification of rare taxa via traditional sequencing approaches. However, coverage values exceeding 99% for our V6 and V3 data correspond to estimates that fewer than 1% of all detectable 16S rRNA tags in these samples belong to taxa that have not yet been detected. Individually, any of the rare, unobserved taxa in these samples are unlikely to exceed 0.001% of all 16S rRNA genes, the relative abundance at which we have roughly 99% confidence of detection. Because so many distinct reference tags are matched exactly by the tags obtained in this study, we conclude that a large number of bacterial taxa previously identified as gut inhabitants in a range of previous 16S rRNA sequencing studies can be present simultaneously or sequentially in a single individual, albeit at widely varying abundance. As suggested in a recent revision to the maxim of Baas Becking, “Everything may be everywhere, but not in equal amounts” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b091">91</xref>]. This result challenges microbial ecologists to account for persistent differences in the composition of the microbiota between individuals, either by ongoing selective forces that vary among individuals such as diet and host genotype, or by factors such as founder effects and specific mutualistic interactions that stabilize community composition. However, any explanation will also have to account for the temporal variability shown by some taxa, and the resilience of the community to perturbations involving a significant fraction of its constituent populations.</p>

          <title>Cp Effects Assessed via Effective Number of Taxa</title>
          <p>Cp decreases the effective number of refOTUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060280-b067">67</xref>] in the gut bacterial community as assessed by diversity of order zero (<sup>0</sup>D) (A), order one (<sup>1</sup>D) (B), and order two (<sup>2</sup>D) (C). Diversities of different orders vary in the relative importance of rare and abundant taxa in calculating a diversity index. The use of an effective number of taxa as the unit of diversity overcomes difficulties with traditional measures such as the Shannon-Weiner index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) and the Gini-Simpson index, which are measured in units that are not commensurate with each other, and that have no natural interpretation. An effective number of taxa is interpreted as the number of equally abundant taxa that would result in the same calculated diversity as the community under investigation. <sup>0</sup>D disregards abundance to consider rare and abundant taxa equally important, thus it is equivalent to taxon richness as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g005">Figure 5</xref>A. <sup>1</sup>D considers that taxa contribute to diversity in proportion to their relative abundance (like the Shannon-Weiner index, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g005">Figures 5</xref>B and S3B), and <sup>2</sup>D weighs taxa in proportion to the square of relative abundance (like the Gini-Simpson index). Cp-associated samples are significantly lower in <sup>1</sup>D and <sup>2</sup>D than other samples for all individuals.</p>

          <title>Untransformed and Scaled PCA</title>
          <p>The transformation applied to taxon abundance data influences the similarity of samples as assessed by PCA. PCA on untransformed V3 refOTU abundance data emphasizes the small number of highly abundant taxa (A). In this case, the first PCA axis captures both community differences between individual B and the others, and differences between the communities of Cp-affected samples and other samples of individual A. The second PCA axis reflects differences in the Cp-associated samples of both individuals A and B. Changes of community composition in the Cp-associated sample of individual C were less distinct than in the other individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g004">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060280-g006">6</xref>), and with untransformed abundance data the Cp-associated sample of individual C falls within the cluster of non-Cp samples of individuals A and C. The influence of abundance can be removed entirely by scaling the data so that the inter-sample variance of each taxon is weighted equally (B). In this case the Cp-associated samples of both individuals A and C are displaced in the same direction along PCA axis 2 from the cluster of non-Cp samples of these individuals. However, the Cp-associated sample is less distant from the non-Cp samples within individual B. Considered together, these results suggest that the effects of Cp in individual C involve changes in the identity of less abundant taxa, while in individual B the effects also involve large changes in the abundance of taxa. Cp-associated changes in individual A involve many of the same taxa as in individual C, but changes in the abundant taxa are more pronounced.</p>
