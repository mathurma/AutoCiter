<abstract>
<p>Chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex disease with underlying changes in electrophysiology, calcium signaling and the structure of atrial myocytes. How these individual remodeling targets and their emergent interactions contribute to cell physiology in chronic AF is not well understood. To approach this problem, we performed <italic>in silico</italic> experiments in a computational model of the human atrial myocyte. The remodeled function of cellular components was based on a broad literature review of <italic>in vitro</italic> findings in chronic AF, and these were integrated into the model to define a cohort of virtual cells. Simulation results indicate that while the altered function of calcium and potassium ion channels alone causes a pronounced decrease in action potential duration, remodeling of intracellular calcium handling also has a substantial impact on the chronic AF phenotype. We additionally found that the reduction in amplitude of the calcium transient in chronic AF as compared to normal sinus rhythm is primarily due to the remodeling of calcium channel function, calcium handling and cellular geometry. Finally, we found that decreased electrical resistance of the membrane together with remodeled calcium handling synergistically decreased cellular excitability and the subsequent inducibility of repolarization abnormalities in the human atrial myocyte in chronic AF. We conclude that the presented results highlight the complexity of both intrinsic cellular interactions and emergent properties of human atrial myocytes in chronic AF. Therefore, reversing remodeling for a single remodeled component does little to restore the normal sinus rhythm phenotype. These findings may have important implications for developing novel therapeutic approaches for chronic AF.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Atrial fibrillation is a complex disease which, at the level of individual atrial muscle cells, is a result of changes in a number of ion channels and transporters, as well as in cellular structure. How these alterations, together and separately, affect electrical and contractile function of the atrial cells is not well understood. In this study, we evaluated the effect of these changes using a computational approach. Our results show that abnormal function of both calcium and potassium ion channels at the sarcolemma has the largest impact on the electrical properties of the human atrial myocyte. Changes in intracellular calcium handling and cellular geometry are also significant for cellular function. Finally, our results highlight the interactions and additive effect of these abnormalities, in that a hypothetical restoration of any single modification does not result in recovery of function to a healthy phenotype. These findings have potentially important implications for developing novel treatment options for atrial fibrillation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, is a complex disease with multiple etiologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Pedersen1">[1]</xref>. However, the endpoint can be broadly characterized by two pathophysiological features: a tissue substrate with increased propensity to arrhythmia as well as loss of contractility. These global outcomes are due to adverse remodeling processes, leading to self-perpetuation of the arrhythmia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Allessie1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Nattel1">[3]</xref>. Despite its clinical significance the mechanisms of AF-induced contractile dysfunction are still poorly understood, and current drugs for the treatment of chronic AF (cAF) increase the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias while featuring only moderate efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Ehrlich1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the literature, cAF-related remodeling is typically divided into three categories: (1) electrical, (2) contractile and (3) structural <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Schotten1">[5]</xref>. The first includes decreased conductances of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (I<sub>CaL</sub>), transient outward K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>to</sub>) and ultra rapid delayed rectified K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>Kur</sub>), and increased conductance of inward rectified K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>K1</sub>), and is considered a typical hallmark of cAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Dobrev1">[6]</xref>. This electrical remodeling causes, for example, shortening of both the action potential (AP) duration and the effective refractory period (ERP). Contractile remodeling, on the other hand, appears to be predominantly a result of impaired intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, as contractile force can be almost completely restored by increasing the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Schotten2">[7]</xref>. Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling is a key contributor to atrial remodeling during AF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Dobrev2">[8]</xref>. The third category, structural remodeling, includes changes at both the cellular level (hypertrophy, glycogen accumulation and modified mitochondrial morphology, among others) and tissue level (fibrosis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Thijssen1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>It has been established in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> experiments that the remodeling of sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels creates a substrate which supports the maintenance of AF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Schotten1">[5]</xref>. Recent studies have also demonstrated that remodeled intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling is one of the main causes for the loss of contractility observed in cAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Wakili1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Grandi1">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, cellular hypertrophy has been shown to cause conduction disturbances, even in the absence of increased fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Neuberger1">[12]</xref>. However, neither how the above mechanisms interact nor how these may contribute as isolated modifications to alter the electrical and contractile function of atrial myocytes in cAF is well understood. To approach this complex problem, we conducted an extensive literature review to form a cohort of virtual cell variants that represent the various cellular components reported as remodeled in cAF. We then analyzed, both in single cells and in tissue, the mechanisms underlying AP shortening, altered intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and changes in excitability in cAF, using a recently developed mathematical model of the human atrial myocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Koivumki1">[13]</xref>.</p>

<p>We initially compared the simulation results with <italic>in vitro</italic> findings for AP and CaT characteristics in cAF vs. normal sinus rhythm (nSR). The model reproduces one of the hallmarks of electrophysiological cAF-remodeling, AP shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Measured as a decrease of APD<sub>90</sub>, in simulations AP shortening (31.9%) corresponds closely with previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, the more negative (5.5% increase) resting membrane potential (RMP) observed here in cAF as compared to nSR cells is in line with experimental findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Cellular cAF-remodeling also causes dramatic changes to Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In simulations, both reduced diastolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (−29.1% for cAF vs. nSR) and the decreased CaT<sub>amp</sub> (−62.3% for cAF vs. nSR) match <italic>in vitro</italic> findings well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, a small reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> content (−23% for cAF vs. nSR), measured as the integral of I<sub>NCX</sub> during a caffeine pulse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s002">Figure S2</xref>) is observed, which corresponds well with the 18% decrease reported <italic>in vitro</italic> in cAF myocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Grandi1">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, CaT peak is delayed in simulations (by 49.8% for cAF vs. nSR), which compares well qualitatively with results obtained from a canine AF model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Wakili1">[10]</xref>. The CaT decay time constant was also increased by 35.6% in cAF vs. nSR, within the reported range for <italic>in vitro</italic> results (28% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Voigt1">[14]</xref> and 80% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Grandi1">[11]</xref>). The spatiotemporal presentation of CaT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g001">Figure 1</xref> F&amp;G shows there is virtually no rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the central parts of the cAF-remodeled cell, which also corresponds well to <italic>in vitro</italic> findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Wakili1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Simulation results also accurately represent the non-linear nature of cardiac myocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics: although the maximum conductance of I<sub>CaL</sub> is decreased by 65% in the cAF model as compared to the nSR model, the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is decreased only by 39.6% overall, as there is less Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent inactivation of I<sub>CaL</sub> in cAF. These results are also in line with <italic>in vitro</italic> findings of 42% and 22% reduction in peak vs. integrated I<sub>CaL</sub>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Voigt1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>1D tissue simulations reveal restitution properties that also correspond well to <italic>in vivo</italic> findings in nSR vs. cAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g002">Figure 2</xref> A–D). Relative APD<sub>90</sub> and conduction velocity (CV) changes lie within the measured standard deviation. The model reproduces relative ERP for the nSR case quite well, although this is rather low for the cAF case. The rotor center in a 2D tissue patch for the nSR and the cAF <italic>in silico</italic> models are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g002">Figure 2</xref> E and F, respectively. The rotor center trajectory of the nSR variant consumes greater area than that of cAF, representing the stabilization of reentrant waves associated with this electrophysiological remodeling. Furthermore, the rotor is meandering comparatively stable during the simulation time of 8 s for the cAF case, whereas the instable rotor center of the nSR case drifts collides with the geometry boundary and vanishes. Movies showing rotor movement for both cases can be found in Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s018">Video S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s019">S2</xref>). Simulated dominant frequencies are 4.15 Hz for the physiological case and 11.23 Hz for the cAF model, which compares favorably to the range of measured values of 11.6±2.9 Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Jarman1">[15]</xref>.</p>

<title>Analysis of cellular remodeling targets in cAF</title>
<p>To evaluate the contribution of individual variables to cAF remodeling, we next simulated changes in each cellular component separately in the model and calculated three resultant biomarkers APD<sub>90</sub>, AP<sub>tri</sub> and CaT<sub>amp</sub> for all cell variants. Each cAF-remodeled component was included one at a time, and the AP and CaT characteristics of all cell variants were compared to the nSR myocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In simulations, reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> alone decreased APD<sub>90</sub> by 17.3%, while increased I<sub>K1</sub> caused an even greater reduction of APD<sub>90</sub> (by 52.7%). Increased I<sub>NCX</sub> and cell dilation each had the opposite effect: APD<sub>90</sub> increased by 21.5% and 7.4%, respectively. AP<sub>tri</sub> was substantially decreased in cAF (−35.9%) vs. nSR, which appeared to be primarily related to increased I<sub>K1</sub> and reduced I<sub>CaL</sub>, as these singular modifications reduced AP<sub>tri</sub> by 58.9% and 16.6%, respectively. While cell dilation had almost no effect on AP<sub>tri</sub> (+3.1%), cAF-remodeled NCX increased AP<sub>tri</sub> quite dramatically (by 22.9%). On the other hand, CaT<sub>amp</sub> was impacted most by reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> (−46.0%), cell dilation (−20.0%) and increased NCX activity (−12.4%). These modifications also hampered the propagation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves from sarcolemma to cell center (right column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The crucial role of increased I<sub>K1</sub> and reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> in cAF remodeling was further demonstrated in tachy pacing (BCL = 250 ms) simulations. Results showed that without these two remodeling targets, the virtual cell is unable to recover excitability between stimuli during such a fast pacing regime (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Investigation of restitution properties in 1D tissue simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s007">Figure S7</xref>) also revealed the dominant effects of changes in I<sub>CaL</sub> and I<sub>K1</sub> on APD, ERP, CV and WL restitution (as known from measurements and illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g002">Figure 2</xref> A–C). Interestingly, the reduction of I<sub>CaL</sub> alone led to alternans in electrical properties at higher rates.</p>

<p>Similar analysis using the same three biomarkers was also carried out for the cAF-remodeled I<sub>to</sub>, I<sub>Kur</sub>, SERCA and RyR; the results are shown in Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Surprisingly, the effects of SERCA and RyR remodeling on both CaT<sub>amp</sub> and AP morphology were very small as compared to the effects of, for example, cAF-remodeled I<sub>CaL</sub> and NCX. However, it has been shown in animal studies that increased RyR sensitivity has only transient effects on CaT<sub>amp</sub>, as reduced SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content balances the effect of increased sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Dibb1">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, increased PLB and decreased SLN expressions have opposing effects on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of SERCA, so these modifications partially balance one another in the cAF model.</p>
<p>To explore putative targets among the remodeled cellular components for reversing the cAF phenotype, we performed simulations in which we excluded each one of these components independently, and then compared AP and CaT characteristics to the full cAF model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Neglecting the effect of I<sub>K1</sub> remodeling caused a substantial increase in APD<sub>90</sub> (+79.7%), while similarly excluding the effects of I<sub>CaL</sub> and NCX remodeling, as well as cell dilation had only relatively minor effects (+2.5%, −8.7% and +1.0% change in APD<sub>90</sub>, respectively). Interestingly, neglecting the effect of remodeled I<sub>K1</sub> renders the virtual cell bistable: depending on initial conditions either a normal or unresponsive/depolarized steady-state is reached via normal pacing (BCL = 1000 ms; data not shown). The second biomarker, AP<sub>tri</sub>, was changed by −12.4%, 112.7%, −33.9% and −17.2% in comparison to cAF, when the remodeling of I<sub>CaL</sub>, I<sub>K1</sub>, NCX and cell dilation, respectively, were independently reversed. When compared to nSR, AP<sub>tri</sub> values were not well restored: −43.8%, +36.4%, −57.6% and −46.9% for the I<sub>CaL</sub>, I<sub>K1</sub>, NCX and cell dilation, respectively. On the contrary, CaT<sub>amp</sub> was almost completely restored when the effects of remodeling (reduced) I<sub>CaL</sub> (+94.4%) were reversed, and enhanced to a smaller extent (+38.2%) if the virtual cell was not dilated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g004">Figures 4</xref> B&amp;E, right column). The vital role of increased I<sub>K1</sub> and reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> in cAF remodeling was further demonstrated in tachy pacing (BCL = 250 ms) simulations; omitting either of these remodeling targets renders the virtual cell unresponsive to pacing at such a rapid rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s006">Figure S6</xref>). 1D restitution simulations revealed similar results as in single cell simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s008">Figure S8</xref>). An increase of APD, ERP, CV and WL was only significant in the cases wherein I<sub>CaL</sub> or I<sub>K1</sub> remodeling were omitted. Interestingly, reduction of I<sub>K1</sub> led to alternans at higher rates in this case.

<title>Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation during fast pacing</title>

<title>Inducibility of DADs in cAF-remodeled cells</title>
<p>Delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) have been linked to various arrhythmogenic diseases; however their role in cAF has not yet been elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Nattel2">[17]</xref>. The main mechanism for induction of cellular DADs in human atrial cells has been shown to be NCX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Benardeau1">[18]</xref>. It was thus of special interest to examine, how remodeled Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling might affect the inducibility of DADs in these cells. First, we tested whether DADs could be induced via an extra opening of RyRs during diastole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). While it was not possible to induce DADs in the cAF-remodeled virtual cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), the subsequent activation of NCX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) in the nSR model variant did elicit DADs, as the inward current sufficiently depolarized the virtual cell to elicit an AP. A possible explanation for this surprising finding is the reduced SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in cAF cells. To test this, we employed the same protocol used in cAF versus nSR virtual cells in a cell variant featuring RyR remodeling only (with all other features identical to nSR model). Even maximal opening of the RyR was not enough to activate NCX and induce a DAD in this variant (<italic>cAF: RyR</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g007">Figure 7</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that it was not possible to induce DADs in cAF cells due to reduced SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content. In this case, however, membrane potential following RyR opening was closer to the AP initiation threshold than in the original cAF cell variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>

<p>DADs were induced with either an extra Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (A–C) or an extra current stimulus (D&amp;E) at the time point of 1 second. Same protocol was used to study four model variants: normal sinus rhythm (nSR), chronic atrial fibrillation with all modifications (cAF: all), only modified inward rectified K<sup>+</sup> current (cAF: IK1), and only ryanodine receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity (cAF: RyR).</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003620.g007" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>An additional mechanism to explain the lack of DADs in the cAF-remodeled cell could be increased I<sub>K1</sub>, which might stabilize the membrane potential such that pathological opening of RyRs during diastole would not induce a DAD. To investigate this possibility, we performed simulations in which DADs were induced by current injection during diastole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). A 65% greater current amplitude was needed to induce a DAD in cAF as compared to nSR, suggesting that the cAF model membrane was indeed more stable with respect to depolarization. To further isolate the role of increased I<sub>K1</sub>, we ran corresponding simulations in a model variant that included only the remodeling of I<sub>K1</sub> (<italic>cAF: IK1</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Compared to nSR, a 69% greater current amplitude was needed to induce a DAD in this model variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>These results implicate two mechanisms that dramatically reduce the inducibility of DADs in cAF-remodeled virtual cells. First, when SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content is reduced, it is not possible to release a sufficient amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the SR to activate NCX to the extent that would elicit a DAD. Second, increased I<sub>K1</sub> decreases cell excitability and stabilizes the membrane potential against DADs in cAF, as with a RMP hyperpolarization of −3.7 mV, a larger depolarizing current is needed to reach the AP threshold. Thus, reduced SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> load together with increased I<sub>K1</sub> actually overcompensates for the combined, contradictory effects of increased RyR sensitivity and increased expression of NCX, such that DAD inducibility is reduced rather than enhanced in our <italic>in silico</italic> model of cAF.</p>

<title>Central targets in cAF remodeling</title>
<p>Simulation results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g008">Figure 8</xref> in a heat map-like presentation, where each individual modification is rated as based on its impact in remodeling (from nSR to cAF) and in reverse remodeling (from cAF closer to nSR) on selected AF biomarkers. It is apparent that individual modifications have differential impact on cell function depending whether each is involved in remodeling or reverse remodeling (i.e. the isolated modification is aimed at improving function following cAF remodeling). For example, while cell dilation affects several functional variables (CaT, Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation, DAD inducibility and cell excitability) during the remodeling process, when excluded from cAF-remodeled cells, cell dilatation affects only cell excitability. It is also clear that the cAF phenotype is more resistant to modifications than the nSR phenotype (see larger gray area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In evaluating the impact of isolated features of remodeling, results also show that the increase in I<sub>K1</sub> is the most central component in cAF remodeling, since it affects all functional markers.</p>

<title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is altered in cAF</title>
<p>The importance of abnormal intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in the pathophysiology of AF is becoming clear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Nattel3">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Greiser1">[20]</xref>. According to our simulations, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are severely blunted in cAF (smaller CaT<sub>amp</sub>), which corresponds well with experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Wakili1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Grandi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Voigt1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Voigt2">[21]</xref>. These changes are primarily due to decreased I<sub>CaL</sub>, and secondarily to the increased activity of NCX. Changes in other remodeling targets involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, such as RyR and SERCA, had only minor impact on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s003">S3</xref>). Reduction in I<sub>CaL</sub> exerts its effect not only by limiting the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and thus the immediate trigger for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release during the AP, but also reduces SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content over time, thereby further reducing the strength of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p>
<p>In atrial myocytes, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release involves two separate phases: the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx first activates RyR clusters in the vicinity of the sarcolemma and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from these junctional release sites triggers a propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave activating adjacent RyRs located deeper within the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Wakili1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Koivumki1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Bootman1">[22]</xref>. However, recent data suggest that larger mammals, including humans, might actually have a more developed network of t-tubules in their atrial cells than previously thought <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Richards1">[23]</xref>. In fact, t-tubules are present in the ovine atrial myocytes at low density and strongly reduced in AF, leading to gradual loss of synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Lenaerts1">[24]</xref>. This feature of cAF-remodeling is a very interesting topic for future study, particularly as increased spatial heterogeneity in Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion within the cell has been shown to promote the genesis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Li1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our simulations and <italic>in vitro</italic> data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Wakili1">[10]</xref> have shown the vulnerability of the fire-diffuse-fire mechanism to disruption in cAF; suppression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during AF remodeling leads to severely compromised transverse propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> inside the cell. Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are thus only circulated within the volume just beneath the sarcolemma in this case; a defect aggravated by cAF-induced cell dilatation, which increases the volume of the junctional space and further dilutes [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the subsarcolemmal space. This redistribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is likely to contribute to the suppression of contraction during AF, as with impaired propagation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals do not reach the contractile elements located centrally within the cell. Furthermore, this alteration likely has a profound indirect effect on energy expenditure of the cAF-remodeled cells, since contractile elements are not activated to same extent and thus consume less energy than in healthy cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Stanley1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>According to experimental data from patients suffering from chronic AF, contractile force of atrial tissue can be restored with increased extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Schotten2">[7]</xref>. This implies that remodeling of the cellular contractile elements involved in cAF has a lesser role in depressing contraction in cAF as compared to the impact of altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the disease. Furthermore, the data also suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is the single most influential variable when considering cAF-induced contractile dysfunction in the light of electrical remodeling. This view is supported by our simulations, wherein cAF-induced I<sub>CaL</sub> downregulation alone reduces CaT<sub>amp</sub> by 46% and induces defects in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>AP morphology changes in cAF</title>
<p>A number of remodeling targets in AF have been proposed to contribute to changes in the AP waveform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Schotten1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Nattel2">[17]</xref>. Our simulations support the conclusion that the two most important elements leading to AP shortening in AF are increased I<sub>K1</sub> and decreased I<sub>CaL</sub>. Increased I<sub>K1</sub> alone reduces APD by 52.7% and is also the single most influential factor contributing to AP triangulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, the membrane potential is hyperpolarized in diastole by the cAF-related remodeling of I<sub>K1</sub> (which is a repolarizing current and one of the main contributors to the maintenance of the RMP in cardiac myocytes). Interestingly, some of the remodeling modifications also act to lengthen the AP, e.g. increases in I<sub>NCX</sub> and cell volume. Increase in the NCX current promotes augmented inward current during AP repolarization when it exchanges cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions for extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> ions at a ratio of 1∶3. The effect of the cell volume on AP is a bit more indirect; the volume increase appears to delay the Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal from the cytosol, which in turn increases I<sub>NCX</sub> during late repolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and the AP are tightly coupled in human atrial myocytes inherently, and this coupling seems to be an essential part of AF remodeling. Hence, as compared to changes in e.g. K<sup>+</sup> current densities which have more straightforward effects on AP, changes in variables involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, like I<sub>CaL</sub> and I<sub>NCX</sub>, modulate not only the AP directly, but have more adverse consequences through their effects on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. In our simulations, remodeling of I<sub>CaL</sub> alone reduced APD<sub>90</sub> by 17.3% (compared to AP shortening by 31.9% in cAF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g003">Figure 3</xref>), while normalization of CaT in cAF cells lengthened the AP by 18.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that effects of I<sub>CaL</sub> on AP are mediated only partly by direct impact of the current on V<sub>m</sub> and that major effects come via the secondary suppression of CaT.</p>

<title>Tissue electrophysiology is influenced by cAF</title>
<p>Changes in AP morphology also impact tissue electrophysiology (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The simulated tissue APD<sub>90</sub> is reduced by around 30%, which is in agreement with the available <italic>in vivo</italic> data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Franz1">[27]</xref>. Similarly, the simulated ERP is reduced by about 20%. In this case, the measured data from Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Yu1">[28]</xref> revealed reduction by a lesser extent (around 10%) as compared to simulation data. These differences might be due to different stages of remodeling. CV is not influenced to a great degree in our simulations, as we did not include gap junction remodeling. Feld et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Feld1">[29]</xref> measured a reduced CV in cAF, suggesting that there might be changes in conductive tissue properties during cAF. The reduced wavelength (the product of ERP and CV) in the simulated cAF case suggests the higher chance of the maintenance of AF following rotor initiation. The simulated rotor center trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g002">Figure 2</xref>) show that these anchor more easily in cAF, evincing greater stability, whereas in nSR, the rotor core tends to meander and subsequently might be eliminated at a boundary or an anatomical obstacle. The simulated dominant frequencies also demonstrate the higher chance of a permanent fibrillation in the cAF case.</p>

<title>Sodium accumulation is attenuated in cAF</title>
<p>Intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation has been established as an important mechanism for AP shortening during fast pacing in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Grandi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Koivumki1">[13]</xref>. In cardiac myocytes, [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is mainly dictated by the balance between Na<sup>+</sup> influx during an AP (upon activation of I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>NCX</sub>) and Na<sup>+</sup> efflux (through NKA and NCX). Therefore, Na<sup>+</sup> fluxes are tightly coupled with both [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and activation frequency, both of which are drastically altered in AF. According to our simulations, high frequency activity induces substantial Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in cAF cells, and this accumulation acts to shorten the AP upon activation of NKA, although this mechanism is less prominent than in nSR cells. In all types of cardiac myocytes, Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation can result indirectly via Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload which itself automatically results from high frequency pacing. In cAF cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload is limited by remodeling (reduced I<sub>CaL</sub>), which drastically suppresses the AP-evoked CaT. Thus, there is less Ca<sup>2+</sup> to be extruded by NCX and consequently a lesser degree of Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the link between [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, we normalized the I<sub>CaL</sub> in cAF model and noticed that pacing-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation were both augmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g006">Figure 6</xref>). It could be hypothesized that altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> balances are actually among the features of cAF cells that enable sustained high frequency activity. When cardiomyocytes act to restore normal levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, vast amounts of ATP are consumed by SERCA (to pump Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the SR) and by NKA (to pump Na<sup>+</sup> to the extracellular space). Thus, when ion gradients are smaller, cAF cells can maintain high frequency of activation at lower energy costs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Stanley1">[26]</xref>.</p>

<title>Inducibility for DADs is not increased in cAF-remodeled cells</title>
<p>The main mechanism for induction of cellular DADs in human atrial cells has been shown to be activation of NCX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Benardeau1">[18]</xref>. As NCX is overexpressed in cAF, we expected to see a lower threshold for DADs in simulations; however, results revealed the opposite finding. In fact, an extra Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the SR was not enough to trigger DADs in the cAF-remodeled virtual cell. This result appears to contradict the recent <italic>in vitro</italic> findings that showed increased spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in cells of AF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-HoveMadsen1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Llach1">[31]</xref>. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include the measurement conditions (experiments carried out at room temperature) and pooled patient population (no separation for paroxysmal, persistent and chronic AF). Indeed, further analysis of our simulation results showed that the mechanism explaining this surprising finding was the reduced cellular excitability due to increase of inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> currents.</p>
<p>Our results suggesting reduced DAD inducibility in cAF contradict the recent finding that enhanced SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak and NCX function underlie DADs in patients with cAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Voigt1">[14]</xref>. In another study, however, DADs were not observed in either nSR nor cAF patient tissue despite the fact that the measurement conditions were in favor of such events, as I<sub>Kur</sub> was blocked with AVE0118 compound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Schotten3">[32]</xref>. These controversial results suggest that increased propensity for DADs in cAF might depend, for example, on underlying etiologies in the patient population.</p>
<p>To summarize, DAD inducibility depends on four factors mechanistically: 1) the strength of the input (SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> load), 2) how this input is transformed into a trigger (sensitivity of RyR), 3) how much depolarizing current this trigger induces (NCX vs. SERCA balance in Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal from the cytosol), and, ultimately, 4) if the depolarizing current is large enough to depolarize the membrane voltage above the threshold for I<sub>Na</sub> activation (which depends on the dynamic balance of depolarizing and repolarizing membrane currents). All four factors are altered in the context of cAF. Because factors #2 and #3 are greater (increase RyR sensitivity and greater net depolarizing current, respectively) one might intuitively infer that DAD inducibility would be increased in cAF-remodeled cells. In our <italic>in silico</italic> cAF model, however, the reduced SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> load together with increased I<sub>K1</sub>, which reduce the trigger and stabilize the resting membrane potential, respectively, overcompensate for the combined depolarizing effect of increased RyR sensitivity and increased expression of NCX, such that DAD inducibility is actually reduced.</p>
<p>Future computational studies, possibly employing stochastic methods and finer spatial resolution, should address factors #2 and #3 in more detail, when <italic>in vitro</italic> data on the co-localization of RyR and NCX in cAF vs. nSR human atrial cells becomes available.</p>

<title>What are the key cellular components contributing to remodeling in cAF?</title>
<p>Both AP shortening and loss of contractility are hallmarks of cAF. Our analysis indicates that, at the cellular level, these changes are strongly coupled to the increased I<sub>K1</sub> and decreased I<sub>CaL</sub> conductances, respectively. In fact, without the I<sub>K1</sub> modification, the cAF-remodeled cell becomes unresponsive during more rapid pacing due to sustained depolarization of the membrane voltage (which inactivates fast sodium channels). Decreased I<sub>CaL</sub> conductance, on the other hand, has a more diverse effect. While also contributing to AP shortening, reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> is the main mechanism for the diminished intracellular CaT<sub>amp</sub> in cAF. The large impact of the remodeling of I<sub>CaL</sub> is related to its dual role, since it not only acts as a trigger for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the SR, but also affects Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading of the SR.</p>
<p>Remodeled I<sub>CaL</sub> and I<sub>NCX</sub> work in synergy to adapt the cell to abnormally fast reoccurring activation in cAF. While reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> and increased I<sub>NCX</sub> both reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload during fast pacing, they also shift Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics from the normal “whole-cell state” to a “subsarcolemmal state”, where Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling is limited primarily to the vicinity of the cell membrane. Myocyte hypertrophy exacerbates the effect of remodeled Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, in that it further reduces CaT<sub>amp</sub> in cAF in addition to the effects of I<sub>CaL</sub> and NCX remodeling. The dilation of the cell also increases the delay between the peaks of the AP and the CaT, which may have arrhythmogenic effects in tissue. In fact, Schotten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Neuberger1">[12]</xref> found that myocyte hypertrophy can cause conduction disturbances in the absence of increased fibrosis in a goat model of chronic atrio-ventricular block. As changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling are centrally involved in normal and pathological regulation of myocyte growth, apoptosis and necrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Bers1">[33]</xref>, cell dilation warrants further research to elucidate its role in cAF.</p>

<title>What could be the key targets for restoring cell function in cAF?</title>
<p>Anti-arrhythmic drug therapy to counter AF has long concentrated on agents that may delay atrial repolarization. Drug targets have included, for example, I<sub>Kr</sub> and I<sub>Ks</sub>; however, more recently agents blocking I<sub>Kur</sub> have been studied extensively, because of the current's atria-specificity in human myocardium. More recently, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling has been established as a potential drug target in cAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Nattel3">[19]</xref>. As our results showed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g005">Figure 5</xref>), restoration of intracellular CaT could, hypothetically, be used to improve AP shape (increase APD<sub>90</sub>) in cAF to, for example, lengthen the effective refractory period.</p>
<p>The most effective targets for restoring healthy cell properties following cAF-induced electrical remodeling are likely to be those that most impact the cAF phenotype. Our simulations suggest that changes in I<sub>K1</sub> and I<sub>CaL</sub> in isolation induce most of the characteristic features of cAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003620-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, restoring either the K<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance could, in theory, be effective in limiting the effects of electrical remodeling in the cAF substrate. However, complete reversal of any single cAF-induced change via pharmacological means is not likely to be feasible. Instead, it might be useful to consider therapies that aim at partial restoration of combinations of targets. In such efforts, however, understanding the full implications of altered cellular electrophysiology on tissue and organ dynamics is absolutely essential. To illustrate, consider the partial inhibition of K<sup>+</sup> currents (for increasing APD<sub>90</sub> and thus ERP), in combination with drugs aimed at increasing CaT<sub>amp</sub> (for restoring contractility). Partial block of NKA with digoxin, combined with reduced RyR Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak using a calmodulin kinase II inhibitor, appeared to be beneficial in single cell simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s011">Figure S11</xref>) and may actually become feasible in the near future, as novel specific blockers of I<sub>K1</sub> are being developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Takanari1">[34]</xref>. The 1D restitution results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s012">Figure S12</xref>) also illustrated increases in APD, ERP, CV and WL, which may be desirable in terms of protecting against arrhythmia. However, this model variant developed alternans at higher pacing rates. In 2D simulations, these alternans also led to a break-up of a single rotor into two rotors (not captured within the geometry, so excitation vanishes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s012">Figure S12E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003620.s020">Video S3</xref>). In a realistic geometry, such wavebreak could lead to stable fibrillatory activity. This finding highlights the need to carry out <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of potential drug targets at different scales (cell, tissue, organ) to achieve a more realistic understanding of pharmacological effects.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Although the human atrial myocyte model employed here has been shown to be the most internally consistent and physiologically accurate to date, particularly regarding intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, in a recent comparison, the model has its limitations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003620-Wilhelms1">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, a holistic analysis of cAF as effected in this study is inevitably biased to some extent by the fact that the pathophysiology clinically involves multiple etiologies. Some studies group available data based on, for example, whether patients have a valvular disease or not, while other studies pool the data among AF subtypes and etiologies. Finally, our model of the cAF-remodeled cell is by no means exhaustive, as novel mechanisms of electrical remodeling are reported continuously. Instead, we have included those remodeling targets that have been established in more than one study of human atrial electrophysiology. When novel experimental data on these disease mechanisms accumulate, the model should be updated accordingly.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The results indicate that, at the cellular level, reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> and increased I<sub>NCX</sub> contribute synergistically to adapt the cell to fast activation rates of cAF by reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, which additionally causes a drastic decrease in CaT<sub>amp</sub> at normal heart rates. Furthermore, our findings suggest that an increase of I<sub>K1</sub> in cAF is the dominant mechanism responsible for AP shortening in cAF, while the effect of reduced I<sub>CaL</sub> is less prominent and the role of remodeled I<sub>to</sub> and I<sub>Kur</sub> are rather insignificant. Increased I<sub>K1</sub>, in synergy with reduced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, also stabilizing the cAF-remodeled cell against DADs. The results also show that, in addition to remodeling of ion currents and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, cellular hypertrophy is an important mechanism contributing to changes in atrial refractoriness, contractility and arrhythmogenicity. Finally, the intrinsic complexity and interdependency of electrophysiological mechanisms are highlighted by our analysis. The presented results thus suggest that instead of targeting a single cellular component a more holistic approach is worth considering when looking for novel therapeutic approaches for chronic AF.</p>
