        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Most living organisms on earth present biological rhythms that play a fundamental role in the coordination of their physiology and behavior. The discovery of the molecular circadian clock gives important insight into the mechanisms involved in the generation of these rhythms. Indeed, this molecular clock orchestrates the rhythmic transcription of clock-controlled genes involved in different aspects of metabolism, for example lipid, carbohydrate, and xenobiotic metabolisms in the liver. However, we show here that the circadian clock could also exert its function through the coordination of mRNA translation. Namely, the circadian clock influences the temporal translation of a subset of mRNAs by controlling the expression and activation of translation initiation factors, as well as the clock-dependent rhythmic activation of signaling pathways involved in their regulation. These rhythmically translated mRNAs are mainly involved in ribosome biogenesis, an energy consuming process, which has to be gated to a period when the cell resources are less limited. Moreover, the role of the circadian oscillator in this process is highlighted by its direct regulation of the transcription of ribosomal protein mRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. Thus our findings suggest that the circadian clock exerts a major role in coordinating transcription and translation steps underlying ribosome biogenesis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology reflect the adaptation of organisms exposed to daily light-dark cycles. As a consequence, most aspects of metabolism and behaviour are under the control of these rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Bass1">[1]</xref>. At a molecular level, in all the studied species, the rhythmic expression of the genes involved originates in the network of interconnected transcriptional and translational feedback loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Zhang1">[2]</xref>. In mammals, the heterodimer composed of BMAL1 and its partners CLOCK or NPAS2 is a transcriptional activator that regulates transcription of the <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry</italic>) genes that code for repressors of BMAL1 heterodimer activity, thus closing a negative feedback loop that generates rhythms of approximately 24 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Bass1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Zhang1">[2]</xref>. Many efforts during the last decade have characterized rhythmically expressed genes and delimit the impact of the circadian clock on physiology. Numerous circadian transcriptome studies in different species and organs show that approximately 10% of the genes are rhythmically expressed. The functions of these genes established the role of the circadian clock in temporally gating rhythmic physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Bass1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Doherty1">[3]</xref>. However, increasing evidence suggests that transcriptional mechanisms are not sufficient to explain numerous observations. For example, it has been shown that many oscillating proteins in mouse liver are encoded by constantly expressed mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Reddy1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, among the rhythmically expressed genes in the liver, we noticed the presence of several genes encoding proteins involved in mRNA translation, including the components of the translation pre-initiation complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Panda1">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Hughes1">6</xref>. In its inactive state, this complex is composed of the mRNA cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF4E) bound to the hypophosphorylated form of EIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) that acts as a translational repressor. Upon stimulation, phosphorylation of 4E-BP releases EIF4E, which can then interact with the scaffold protein eIF4G and the rest of the EIF4F complex (EIF4A, EIF4B, and EIF4H) to initiate translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Jackson1">[7]</xref>. We therefore investigated whether the circadian clock might coordinate translation in mouse liver. Here we indeed show that the circadian clock controls the transcription of translation initiation factors as well as the rhythmic activation of signaling pathways involved in their regulation. As a consequence, the circadian clock influences the temporal translation of a subset of mRNAs mainly involved in ribosome biogenesis. In addition, the circadian oscillator regulates the transcription of ribosomal protein mRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. These results demonstrate for the first time the major role of the circadian clock in ribosome biogenesis.</p>

        <title>Rhythmic Expression and Activation of Components of the Translation Pre-initiation Complex</title>
        <p>We investigated whether the circadian clock might coordinate translation in mouse liver. Indeed, quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analyses confirmed that mRNAs of most of the factors involved in translation initiation are rhythmically expressed with a period of 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; statistical analyses are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s019">Table S1</xref>). Interestingly, while we did not observe any significant variations in protein abundance, rhythmic phosphorylations were strongly manifested during two consecutive days, emphasizing the robustness of these rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; quantification and statistical analyses of the data are given on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s020">Table S2</xref>). EIF4E is mostly phosphorylated during the day, with a peak at the end of the light period (ZT6-12), whereas EIF4G, EIF4B, 4E-BP1, and ribosomal protein (RP) S6 (RPS6) are mainly phosphorylated during the night, which is, in the case of nocturnal animals like rodents, the period when the animals are active and consume food.</p>

        <p>Phosphorylation of these factors is well characterized and involves different signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Laplante1">[8]</xref> whose reported activity perfectly correlates with the observed phosphorylation rhythm. EIF4E is phosphorylated by the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinase (MNK) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Silva1">[9]</xref>, which is most active during the day, at the time when EIF4E reaches its maximum phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; quantification and statistical analyses of the data are given on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s020">Table S2</xref>). On the other hand, EIF4G, EIF4B, 4E-BP1, and RPS6 are mainly phosphorylated by the target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 1 (TORC1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Ma1">[10]</xref>, which is activated during the night, at the time when the phosphorylation of these proteins reaches its maximum level. TORC1, in turn, is negatively regulated by the tuberous sclerosis protein complex (TSC), whose activity is under the control of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, ERK, and the energy sensing 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Ma1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Mendoza1">[11]</xref>. As reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Lamia1">[12]</xref>, AMPK is active during the day and mediates the activation of TSC2, contributing to the repression of TORC1 in the period of energy and nutrient restriction. Conversely, during the night, TORC1 is activated probably through TSC2 inhibition by PI3K via TORC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Zoncu1">[13]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, we found that <italic>mTor</italic>, its partner <italic>Raptor</italic>, as well as its regulating kinase <italic>Map3k4</italic>, are also rhythmically expressed, thus potentially further contributing to the rhythmic activation of TORC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s003">Figure S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s019">Table S1</xref>). ERK is activated during the day in synchrony with the rhythmic expression of <italic>Mnk2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s003">Figure S3</xref>), contributing to EIF4E phosphorylation during this period. However, its downstream target RPS6 Kinase (RSK) seems to contribute only marginally to the phosphorylation of RPS6 in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g002">2A</xref>). The rhythmic phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 resulted in its release from the mRNA cap-mimicking molecule 7-methyl-GTP from ZT14 to ZT22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s020">Table S2</xref>), allowing the rhythmic assembly of the EIF4F and potentially mRNA translation.</p>
        <p>The rhythmic expression of mRNA encoding translation initiation factors, TORC1 complex component, and a kinase activating these factors is independent of light as it is maintained under constant darkness, even if the phase seems to be advanced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Interestingly, activation of the TORC1 pathway is also maintained under constant darkness but with an advanced phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Since nutrient availability is a potent activator of the TORC1 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Zoncu1">[13]</xref>, we asked whether these parameters are also rhythmic under conditions of starvation. We found that expression of mRNA encoding translation initiation factors, TORC1 complex component, and a kinase activating these factors is still rhythmic under starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), even when this starvation occurs under constant darkness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). This result unambiguously demonstrates the role of the circadian clock in the expression of these genes. In addition, phosphorylations of RPS6 and 4E-BP1 are still rhythmic under starvation, whether or not the mice are under a light-dark regimen or in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s005">Figure S5B and S5C</xref>), confirming previously published observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-LeBouton1">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, TORC1 activation is in opposite phase with the clock-dependent rhythmic activation of autophagy in mouse liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Ma2">[15]</xref>, a process inhibited by TORC1 but able to generate amino acids that can in turn activate TORC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Neufeld1">[16]</xref>. This might suggest that the circadian clock can regulate the two processes in a coordinated fashion. Importantly, rhythmic activation of TORC1 is not restricted to the liver as the same phosphorylation rhythm is found in kidney and heart, albeit with reduced amplitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Meanwhile, TORC1 activation is constant in brain, lung, and small intestine, suggesting that the rhythmic nutrient availability due to the circadian clock-regulated feeding behavior is not sufficient by itself to explain the rhythmic activation of TORC1.</p>

        <title>Characterization of Rhythmically Translated mRNAs</title>
        <p>Diurnal binding of 4E-BP to EIF4E suggested that translation might be rhythmic in the liver. To test this hypothesis and to identify potential rhythmically translated genes, we purified polysomal RNAs, a RNA sub-fraction composed mainly of actively translated mRNA, every 2 h during a period of 48 h. We found that relative amount of this polysomal fraction follows a diurnal cycle, showing that a rhythmic translation does occur in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s007">Figure S7</xref>). This result confirms original observations based on electron microscopy and biochemical studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Fishman1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Uchiyama1">[18]</xref>. We therefore decided to characterize these rhythmically translated mRNAs through comparative microarray analysis of polysomal and total RNAs. While the obtained profiles in polysomal and total RNAs fractions are highly similar for most mRNAs (examples of rhythmic mRNAs are given on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s008">Figure S8</xref>), 249 probes showed a non-uniform ratio in diurnal polysomal over total mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This means that approximately 2% of the expressed genes are translated with a rhythm that is not explained by rhythmic mRNA abundance as in most cases, the total mRNA levels were constant while the polysomes-bound mRNA levels fluctuated during the 24-h cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s009">S9</xref>). Among translationally regulated genes, 70% were found in the polysomal fraction during the same time interval, starting at ZT8 before the onset of the feeding period and finishing at the end of the dark period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s021">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s022">S4</xref>). Most of these genes belonged to the 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5′-TOP) family, known to be regulated by TORC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Meyuhas1">[19]</xref>, but also by the level and phosphorylation state of EIF4E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Mamane1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Bianchini1">[21]</xref>. 5′-TOP genes are themselves involved in translation via ribosome biogenesis and translation elongation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s022">Table S4</xref>).</p>

        <p>After confirmations of these results by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s010">Figure S10</xref>), we wished to validate the periodicity in the amount of mRNAs purified in the different fractions obtain during polysomes purification over a 24-h period. Whereas a constitutively translated mRNA such as <italic>Gapdh</italic> is found all the time in the polysomal fraction (with a small decrease in the middle of the light period when overall translation decreases), mRNAs coding for RPs are associated with the polysomal fraction only starting towards the end of the light period (ZT8) and during the dark period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This result demonstrates a dynamic translation initiation of 5′-TOP mRNA starting before the onset of the feeding period, with a maximum at the beginning of the dark period.</p>
        <p>Next, we wanted to confirm that this rhythmic translation had an impact on the protein levels. With respect to RPs, while the half-life of mature ribosomes is approximately 5 d in rodent liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Hirsch1">[22]</xref>, newly synthesized RPs have a half-life of only a few hours, as most of them are rapidly degraded after translation during the ribosome assembly process in the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Lam1">[23]</xref>. We thus expected a rhythmic expression of this subpopulation of newly synthesized RPs in the soluble cytosolic fraction depleted of ribosomes after sedimentation. Indeed, under these conditions, RPs show a rhythmic abundance with highest expression during the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; quantification and statistical analyses of the data are given on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s011">Figure S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s020">Table S2</xref>). In some cases, we noticed a shallow decrease at ZT16-18, potentially reflecting transport of RPs into the nucleolus for ribosome assembly.</p>

        <title>Control of RPs mRNA and rRNA Transcription by the Circadian Clock</title>
        <p> In addition to translational regulation, we also observed a diurnal expression of RP mRNAs, albeit with a small average peak to trough amplitude of approximately 1.2. Taking into account their relatively long half-life (11 h) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Geyer1">[24]</xref>, we hypothesized that this minor fluctuation might reflect more pronounced rhythmic amplitudes in transcription as amplitude decreases with half-life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Gachon1">[25]</xref>. In addition, it has recently been shown that the transcription of several RP mRNAs is directly controlled by the molecular oscillator in <italic>Drosophila</italic> head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Abruzzi1">[26]</xref>. Indeed, pre-mRNA accumulation of several RP exhibited a rhythmic transcription, with an average amplitude of 3.5-fold with a maximum at ZT8, just before the activation of their translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; statistical analyses are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s019">Table S1</xref>). In addition, we found that the synthesis of the ribosome constituent precursor 45S rRNA is also rhythmic and synchronized with RP mRNAs transcription, indicating that all elements involved in ribosome biogenesis are transcribed in concert, then translated or matured. In yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Lafert1">[27]</xref> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Grewal1">[28]</xref>, transcription of RP mRNAs appears to be coordinated with rRNA transcription, which is a rate limiting step in ribosome biogenesis. On the other hand, in mammals, rRNA transcription is highly regulated by the upstream binding factor (UBF), which establishes and maintains an active chromatin state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Sanij1">[29]</xref>.

        <p>To test whether <italic>Ubf1</italic> transcription is regulated by the circadian clock, we characterized its expression in arrhythmic <italic>Cry1</italic>/<italic>Cry2</italic> knockout (KO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-vanderHorst1">[30]</xref> and <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Bunger1">[31]</xref> mice, which are devoid of a functional circadian clock. Indeed, these mice do exhibit an arrhythmic pattern of activity under constant darkness, which is in general correlated with an arrhythmic feeding behaviour. As TORC1, as well as other signaling pathways, are in part regulated by feeding through nutrient availability, we expect a temporally discontinuous and erratic activation of these pathways in the KO mice under unrestricted feeding. To verify this hypothesis, we measured activation of the TORC1, AKT, and ERK pathways in <italic>Cry1</italic>/<italic>Cry2</italic> and <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO kept in constant darkness. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s013">Figure S13A</xref>, the rhythmic activation of these signaling pathways is indeed lost under this condition, confirming their arrhythmic activation. To highlight the role of the feeding regimen on this activation, we kept <italic>Cry1</italic>/<italic>Cry2</italic> KO mice in constant darkness and sacrificed them at CT12. We found a strong inter-individual variability in the activation of the TORC1, AKT, and ERK pathways, reflecting the arrhythmic feeding rhythm of these animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s013">Figure S13B</xref>). To circumvent this caveat and study the rhythmic translation in mice devoid of a functional molecular oscillator, we decided to place <italic>Cry1</italic>/<italic>Cry2</italic> and <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO under a light-dark regimen to keep a normal diurnal feeding behaviour due to masking. In addition, mice had access to food only during the dark phase to eliminate the effect of a potential disturbed feeding behaviour. Under these conditions, KO mice had a rhythmic feeding behaviour and thus potential differences in protein levels or pathway activity cannot be attributed to the arrhythmic feeding behaviour of these animals. We indeed found that UBF1 rhythmic expression is dependent on a functional circadian clock as it is impaired in both animal models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>; quantification and statistical analyses of the data are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s012">Figure S12B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s023">Tables S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s024">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s025">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s026">S8</xref>). However, if UBF1 expression is persistently low in <italic>Cry1</italic>/<italic>Cry2</italic> KO mice, this expression is constantly high in <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO mice, suggesting the control of <italic>Ubf1</italic> by a circadian clock-regulated transcription repressor. In addition, we observed that these animals lose also the synchrony and coordination of 45S rRNA and RP pre-mRNAs transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g005">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s014">S14</xref>, and S15; statistical analyses of the data are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s023">Table S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s024">S6</xref>). Indeed, decreased UBF1 expression in <italic>Cry1</italic>/<italic>Cry2</italic> KO mice is correlated with lower 45S rRNA transcription, but higher and delayed RP pre-mRNAs transcription. Interestingly, <italic>Bmal1</italic> KO mice present a complete arrhythmic transcription of RP pre-mRNAs, highlighting the crucial role of the circadian clock in the coordination of rRNA and RP mRNAs transcription.</p>

        <title>Regulation of Ribosome Biogenesis by the Circadian Clock</title>
        <p>The results presented here show that the molecular circadian clock controls ribosome biogenesis through the coordination of transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulations. Moreover, the data strongly suggest that a functional molecular oscillator is required for a timely coordinated transcription of translation initiation factors, RP mRNAs, and rRNAs. The clock modulates the rhythmic activation of signaling pathways controlling translation through the TORC1 pathway, translation of RPs, and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, it has been reported that the size of the nucleolus, the site of rRNA transcription and ribosome assembly, follows a diurnal pattern with a maximum in the middle of the dark period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Sete1">[33]</xref>, which thus occurs in synchrony with the observed accumulation of RPs in the liver. The observed rhythmic ribosome biogenesis is substantiated by the previous observation showing that both size and organization of the nucleolus are directly related to ribosome production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-HernandezVerdun1">[34]</xref>.</p>

            <p>The molecular oscillator in the master circadian pacemaker localized in the SCN of the hypothalamus synchronizes peripheral clocks, including liver clock, and, in parallel, regulates feeding behavior, which itself influences peripheral oscillator. The liver circadian clock controls expression of translation initiation factors, and rRNA, and conceivably RP mRNA, through regulation of UBF1. In addition, in association with signals from nutrients, the molecular clock, via the TORC1 pathway, coordinates the rhythmic activation of signaling pathways controlling translation of RP and, in turn, ribosome biogenesis. This succession of events coordinated by the circadian clock finally leads to a subtle rhythmic change of general translation in mouse liver.</p>

        <p>Remarkably, a coordinated rhythmic regulation of transcriptional and translational events for the biogenesis of ribosomes has also been suggested for the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Dong1">[35]</xref> and for plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Piques1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Xu1">[37]</xref>. Since ribosome biogenesis is one of the major energy consuming process in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Warner1">[38]</xref>, its tight control is primordial to reduce interferences with other biological processes. In the case of mouse liver, we estimate that the decrease of translation during the light period is equivalent to 20% of the total translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001455.s007">Figure S7</xref>), in agreement with previously published results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Fishman1">[17]</xref>. Although moderate, this decrease affects translation of housekeeping genes like <italic>Gapdh</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001455-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and probably the translation of other genes. It means that the increase in ribosome biogenesis during the night could potentially influence the translation of many other mRNAs, however with a magnitude sufficiently low to not allow its detection by our method.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it is clear that this energy-consuming process has to be confined to a time when energy and nutrients are available in sufficient amount, which, in the case of rodents, is during the night period when the animals are active and consume food. Hence, all the elements required for translation have to be ready to start ribosome biogenesis during that time. This is achieved by increasing levels of rRNAs and RP pre-mRNAs just before the onset of the night, synchronized with the phosphorylation of EIF4E that increases 5′-TOP mRNAs translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Bianchini1">[21]</xref>. Activation of the TORC1 pathway during this period promotes RPs synthesis, rRNAs maturation, and ribosome assembly. In addition activation of the ERK pathway correlates also with ribosome biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Asmal1">[39]</xref>, strengthening the rhythmic nature of this process. Accordingly, orchestration of ribosome biogenesis by the circadian clock represents a nice example of anticipation of an obligatory gated process through a complex organization of transcriptional, translational, and post-translational events.</p>

        <title>Coordination of Rhythmic Activation of Cellular Signaling Pathways by the Circadian Clock</title>
        <p>As described in the introduction, the mammalian molecular circadian oscillator consists in interlocked feedback loops of transcription factors that generate a complex network of rhythmically expressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Doherty1">[3]</xref>. Within the core molecular clock, increasing evidence shows that post-translational modifications play a crucial role in the generation of circadian rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Reischl1">[40]</xref>. However, the circadian clock is also able to coordinate rhythmic post-translational activation of signaling pathways not directly involved in the molecular oscillator but rather in the sensing of the environment. The first described example consisted in the rhythmic activation of ERK in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus where the master circadian pacemaker is localized: if light stimulates ERK phosphorylation in the SCN in a time-dependent fashion, circadian ERK phosphorylation continues also in constant darkness, suggesting a crucial role of the circadian clock in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Obrietan1">[41]</xref>. Interestingly, the same observations have been made for the TORC1 pathway in the SCN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Cao1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Cao2">[43]</xref>, and for the PI3K/AKT pathway in the retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Ko1">[44]</xref>. Considering the fact that these two pathways have been recently identified as a potent regulators of circadian activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Zheng1">[45]</xref>, we expect that the role of the circadian clock-coordinated signaling pathways on circadian physiology will probably be emphasized in other organisms in the near future.</p>
        <p>With respect to rhythmic activation of signaling pathways in the liver, there are only few examples of such regulations. One example is the rhythmic activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway that is associated with food metabolism and rhythmic feeding behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Vollmers1">[46]</xref>. Recently, we also described a circadian clock-dependent rhythmic activation of the unfolded protein response regulating liver lipid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Cretenet1">[47]</xref>. In addition, it has been shown that the circadian clock is also able to regulate autophagy in mouse liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Ma2">[15]</xref>. In this context, our discovery of the rhythmic ribosome biogenesis through coordination of the rhythmic activation of signaling pathways constitutes an important new element in this area of research.</p>

        <title>Translation, Circadian Clock, and Longevity</title>
        <p>It has long been known that caloric restriction or intermittent fasting increases lifespan in a wide variety of models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Bishop1">[48]</xref>. Increased lifespan has also been linked to the reduced activation of the TORC1 pathway, which, in turn, provokes a reduced mRNA translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Honjoh1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Zid1">[50]</xref>.

In addition, downregulation of various components of the EIF4F complex extends lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Hansen1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Syntichaki1">[59]</xref>, whereas inhibition of RPs genes expression extends lifespan in both <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Steffen1">[60]</xref> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Hansen1">[56]</xref>. Hence, keeping ribosome biogenesis, and translation in general, to their minimum levels plays a major role in the regulation of longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Kapahi2">[61]</xref>. Interestingly, all the genetically modified animal models presenting a disrupted circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Dubrovsky1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Lee1">[64]</xref> or mice subjected to chronic jet lag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Davidson1">[65]</xref> are subjected to premature aging and reduced lifespan. The deregulation of many other circadian-clock regulated processes can reduce life expectancy, like reduced xenobiotic detoxification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001455-Gachon2">[66]</xref>. We thus believe that the potential role of disorganized ribosome biogenesis on life expectancy, observed in animals devoid of a circadian clock, will be an exciting subject for further studies.</p>

In all experiments, male mice between 10 and 12 wk of age are used. Unless noted otherwise, mice were maintained under standard animal housing conditions, with free access to food and water and in 12-h light/12-h dark cycles. However, for all experiments, animals were fed only at night during 4 d before the experiment to reduce effects of feeding rhythm. For experiments in constant darkness, mice were shifted into complete darkness after the last dark period and then sacrificed every 2 or 4 h during the next 48 h. For starvation experiments, mice were deprived from food during one complete night and then during the following 24 h, mice were sacrificed every 2 or 4 h.</p>

As in the liver, this rhythmic activation is kept in kidney and heart, nevertheless with reduced amplitude (indicated by the blot with a shortest exposure). However, TORC1 activation is constant in brain, lung, and small intestine, suggesting that nutriment availability due to rhythmic feeding is not sufficient to explain this phenomenon.
