<abstract>
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, but our knowledge of the arrhythmogenic substrate is incomplete. Alternans, the beat-to-beat alternation in the shape of cardiac electrical signals, typically occurs at fast heart rates and leads to arrhythmia. However, atrial alternans have been observed at slower pacing rates in AF patients than in controls, suggesting that increased vulnerability to arrhythmia in AF patients may be due to the proarrythmic influence of alternans at these slower rates. As such, alternans may present a useful therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of AF, but the mechanism underlying alternans occurrence in AF patients at heart rates near rest is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine how cellular changes that occur in human AF affect the appearance of alternans at heart rates near rest. To achieve this, we developed a computational model of human atrial tissue incorporating electrophysiological remodeling associated with chronic AF (cAF) and performed parameter sensitivity analysis of ionic model parameters to determine which cellular changes led to alternans. Of the 20 parameters tested, only decreasing the ryanodine receptor (RyR) inactivation rate constant (ki<sub>Ca</sub>) produced action potential duration (APD) alternans seen clinically at slower pacing rates. Using single-cell clamps of voltage, fluxes, and state variables, we determined that alternans onset was Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven rather than voltage-driven and occurred as a result of decreased RyR inactivation which led to increased steepness of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release slope. Iterated map analysis revealed that because SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake efficiency was much higher in control atrial cells than in cAF cells, drastic reductions in ki<sub>Ca</sub> were required to produce alternans at comparable pacing rates in control atrial cells. These findings suggest that RyR kinetics may play a critical role in altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis which drives proarrhythmic APD alternans in patients with AF.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rhythm affecting millions of people worldwide. Effective treatment of this cardiac disorder relies upon our detailed knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms that lead to arrhythmia. Recent clinical observations have suggested that alternans, a phenomenon where the shape of the electrical signal in the heart alternates from beat to beat, may play an important role in this process, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we use computational models to conduct a detailed examination of the causes and contributors to alternans associated with human atrial fibrillation. We find that in atria remodeled by atrial fibrillation, alternans appears near resting heart rates because several aspects of calcium cycling are disrupted in the atrial cells. In particular, the release and uptake of calcium from the cellular storage compartment, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, becomes imbalanced, leading to alternation in calcium signals from beat to beat. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of proarrhythmic alternans in human atrial fibrillation which may be used to develop novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is currently the most common cardiac rhythm disorder, posing a significant medical and economic challenge for the US health care system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Feinberg1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Go1">[2]</xref>. This burden is likely to increase as the population ages and AF prevalence rises <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Coyne1">[3]</xref>. Effective prevention and treatment of AF depends upon advances in our understanding of underlying disease mechanisms. Although several features of AF electrophysiological remodeling have been identified over the past decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Nattel1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Nattel2">[5]</xref>, our knowledge about the arrhythmogenic substrate remains incomplete.</p>
<p>Beat-to-beat alternation in the shape of cardiac electrical signals, a phenomenon called alternans, has been observed in the atria of AF patients, but the mechanism underlying these alternans is not known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Kim1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Lalani1">[11]</xref>. Narayan <italic>et al.</italic> reported differences in the rate dependence of action potential duration (APD) alternans in patients, with APD alternans occurring at pacing rates near rest in AF patients but only at fast pacing rates in controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref>. Narayan <italic>et al.</italic> also found that APD alternans always preceded AF initiation, indicating that alternans may play an important role in establishing the arrhythmogenic substrate and creating vulnerability to AF. Thus, a better understanding of AF arrhythmogenesis will likely depend upon identification of the mechanism driving atrial alternans at heart rates near rest.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in AF patients the slope of the APD restitution curve was &lt;1 during APD alternans onset at slow pacing rates. This suggests that a cellular mechanism other than voltage-driven instability underlies APD alternans at heart rates near rest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Franz1">[9]</xref>. Altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in atrial myocytes is known to play a crucial role in the generation of AF triggers and in AF maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Nattel3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Heijman1">[13]</xref>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling instabilities have been shown to underlie ventricular alternans in heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan3">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Bayer1">[15]</xref>, as well as atrial alternans in several non-AF animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Hser1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Shkryl1">[18]</xref>. However, it is unknown whether these represent a plausible mechanism for atrial alternans in AF patients, particularly at heart rates near rest. We therefore sought to determine, using a computer model of human atrial tissue, whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling abnormalities, or other electrophysiological changes that occur in AF, lead to APD alternans. We identified a critical change in the kinetics of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) that was responsible for APD alternans onset at slower pacing rates, and subsequently aimed to elucidate the mechanistic relationship between this disruption in RyR kinetics and alternans onset. To this end, we employed single-cell clamping of ionic model parameters and iterated map analysis in order to dissect the mechanisms which drive alternans in atrial tissue, as well as to provide important insights into the pathophysiological changes that contribute to the development of alternans in AF patients.</p>

<title>APD alternans in the human AF tissue model</title>
<p>In order to investigate ionic mechanisms in human AF that contribute to the generation of atrial APD alternans at the tissue level, we created a computer model of human atrial tissue incorporating ionic remodeling associated with chronic AF (cAF), as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>. The sensitivity of APD alternans to ionic model parameters was evaluated by varying parameters one at a time and applying the clinical pacing protocol used by Narayan <italic>et al.</italic> to induce APD alternans in AF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1004011-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). For control, a model of normal human atrial tissue was also simulated. We then assessed the magnitude and onset pacing cycle length (CL) of APD alternans by analyzing voltage traces from the recording electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), as outlined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>.</p>

<p>In the control model, significant APD alternans did not occur before loss of capture at 260 ms CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, in the cAF-remodeled tissue preparation, significant APD alternans appeared at a CL of 240 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Varying the RyR inactivation rate constant (ki<sub>Ca</sub>) had the greatest effect on alternans onset CL in the human cAF-remodeled tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In fact, only reduction of ki<sub>Ca</sub> resulted in alternans onset at CLs of 300–500 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), matching alternans onset CLs observed in AF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref>. When other ionic model parameters were varied from their original cAF values, APD alternans either did not appear in the tissue model at CL≥300 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, blue areas), appeared only at CL≤350 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, red areas), or did not appear before loss of capture or conduction block occurred in the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, white spaces). These results suggest that altered RyR kinetics is the critical cellular component underlying the occurrence of APD alternans in AF patients at pacing rates near rest, and that ki<sub>Ca</sub> plays a key role in this process.</p>

<title>Sensitivity of APD alternans magnitude to ionic model parameters in cAF tissue.</title>
<p>Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed in cAF tissue in order to identify ionic model parameters that influence alternans. For panels A and B, APD alternans normalized magnitude (ANM) is indicated by the colorbar (&gt;0.05 considered significant). (A) Parameters were scaled one at a time between 25% (short ticks) and 200% (long ticks) of their AF model values (25% increments). Only decreasing the RyR inactivation rate constant (ki<sub>Ca</sub>) produced alternans at the longest CLs. (B) ki<sub>Ca</sub> was scaled between 25% and 100% in 5% increments, producing a range of APD alternans onset CLs between 300–750 ms.</p>

<p>We also tested whether differences between left and right atrial electrophysiology affect alternans susceptibility using a right atrium (RA) version of the cAF model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Grandi1">[19]</xref> in tissue simulations. Results for RA tissue were very similar to those for the left atrium (LA), demonstrating that modulation of ki<sub>Ca</sub> could reproduce alternans observed at pacing rates near rest in both the LA and RA of AF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s002">S2 Figure</xref>).</p>
<p>When ki<sub>Ca</sub> was decreased by 50% in the cAF model (we refer to this as the cAF<sub>alt</sub> ionic model), APD alternans onset data from the human AF tissue model agreed well with data from persistent AF patients. Significant APD alternans began at 400-ms CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, dotted red line), mean APD at onset was 229 ms, and APD alternans magnitude at onset was 27 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, dotted red line). These metrics were each within one standard deviation (SD) of clinical observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The cAF<sub>alt</sub> model also displayed noticeable alternans in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) at the onset CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). For both the cAF and cAF<sub>alt</sub> models, mean APDs were shorter than in the control model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1B–C</xref>), and diastolic and systolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> were lower than in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). At 400-ms CL in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model, on the odd (long) vs. the even (short) beat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, blue vs. red), there was higher sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> load before release (0.288 vs. 0.273 mM), higher peak RyR open probability (RyR<sub>o</sub>) (9.0e-4 vs. 4.7e-4), a larger intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient (CaT) amplitude (Δ[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> = 0.13 vs. 0.067 µM), similar L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> (LCC) current (integrated over one beat: 144 vs. 140 mC/F), and increased Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX) current (I<sub>NCX</sub>, integrated over one beat: 98.4 vs. 74.5 mC/F). The positive coupling between transmembrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with I<sub>NCX</sub> as the primary electrogenic current, is consistent with experimental findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Wan1">[20]</xref>. Since the magnitude and onset of APD alternans in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model provided the best agreement with clinical APD alternans data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), we chose to use this model for subsequent investigations into the underlying causes of alternans occurrence.</p>

<title>SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release underlies alternans onset</title>
<p>Since APD alternans throughout the homogenous cAF<sub>alt</sub> tissue preparation were concordant and of similar magnitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s003">S3 Figure</xref>), electrotonic effects and CV restitution were excluded as factors influencing these alternans. Indeed, APD and CaT alternans in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> tissue model were very similar to alternans in the isolated single-cell cAF<sub>alt</sub> model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, left column vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, top row). We therefore concluded that cellular mechanisms gave rise to alternans in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> tissue model and decided to utilize single-cell simulations in order to investigate these mechanisms. We first used the ionic model variable clamping protocol described in detail in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>. The percent change in APD and CaT alternans magnitudes, when each ionic model variable was clamped to its trace from either the even (short) or odd (long) steady-state beat at the alternans onset CL (400 ms), are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g006">Fig. 6</xref> (right column: state variables, left column: currents and fluxes). Variables which resulted in &gt;99% reduction in APD and CaT alternans magnitudes for both even and odd beat clamps were considered essential for alternans.</p>

<p>Results for all ionic model variable clamping simulations are summarized in bar graphs showing the percent changes in APD and CaT alternans magnitudes when model variables were clamped to even or odd beat waveforms.

<p>Clamping V<sub>m</sub> resulted in −61.8% change in CaT alternans magnitude for even beat clamps and +6.6% for odd beat clamps, demonstrating that the alternans were not voltage-driven (see even and odd beat clamps depicted in column 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s004">S4 Figure</xref>, respectively). Clamping [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> enhanced APD alternans (+55.2% and +75.8% for even and odd beat clamps, respectively, column 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s004">S4 Figure</xref>). However, when SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub>) was clamped to either the even or odd beat waveforms, alternans in both APD and CaT were eliminated (&lt;−99%), demonstrating that the alternans were driven by SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> instability (column 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s004">S4 Figure</xref>). In addition, four other variables could be clamped to the even or odd beat waveforms to eliminate APD and CaT alternans: RyR inactivated probability (RyR<sub>i</sub>), RyR open probability (RyR<sub>o</sub>), junctional Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>j</sub>), and SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release flux (J<sub>SRCarel</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s006">S6 Figures</xref>). All five of these variables were therefore critical for enabling alternans to occur at the onset CL. Furthermore, these variables directly impact SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, implicating SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release as the underlying source of alternans in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model.</p>
<p>There were two ionic model components which greatly reduced but did not eliminate alternans when clamped: sub-sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>sl</sub>) and sub-sarcolemmal Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger current (I<sub>NCXsl</sub>). Clamping [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>sl</sub> to the even beat eliminated all alternans; clamping to the odd beat greatly reduced APD and CaT alternans (−95.8% and −96.2%, respectively), although large alternation in SR load persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g006">Fig. 6</xref> and columns 1–2 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s007">S7 Figure</xref>). Similarly, clamping I<sub>NCXsl</sub> to the even beat waveform resulted in elimination of APD but not CaT alternans (+72.9%), while clamping to the odd beat waveform resulted in elimination of all alternans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g006">Fig. 6</xref> and columns 3–4 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s007">S7 Figure</xref>). Hence, the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven instabilities produced alternans in Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling which were positively coupled to voltage through I<sub>NCXsl</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>sl</sub>.</p>

To test this, we compared the cAF and cAF<sub>alt</sub> ionic models under action potential (AP) voltage clamp conditions so that changes in CaT alternans would be due solely to changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis rather than bidirectional coupling between V<sub>m</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. After clamping each ionic model at a CL of 400 ms until steady state was reached, we perturbed [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub> and tracked SR load and SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release on the subsequent clamped beats (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details).

<p>To better explain the differences between the cAF and cAF<sub>alt</sub> ionic models that gave rise to different SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release slopes, we first compared [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub>, RyR<sub>o</sub>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>j</sub>, and cumulative Ca<sup>2+</sup> release for the two models at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, left column, rows 2–5, solid lines). In the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub> at steady state was 19.7% lower than in the cAF model as a result of increased RyR opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, left column, rows 2 and 3, red vs. black solid lines). Although this led to a 15.2% decrease in peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>j</sub> in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model, the duration of the release event was prolonged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, left column, row 4, red vs. black solid lines). Consequently, though cumulative Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model initially lagged behind, at t≈90 ms it actually surpassed the cumulative release in the cAF model, ultimately resulting in a 3.4% increase in total release by the end of the beat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, left column, row 5, red vs. black solid lines).</p>
<p>To illustrate how these differences between the cAF and cAF<sub>alt</sub> ionic models impacted SR release slope, we applied a large perturbation to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub> (+20 µM) at the beginning of a clamped beat and compared the unperturbed (steady state, solid line) and perturbed (dotted line) traces for each model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, left column, rows 2–6). Higher SR load at the beginning of the beat led to increased SR release flux due to luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of the RyR (causing more opening), as well as to the increased concentration gradient between the SR and junctional compartments. In both the cAF and cAF<sub>alt</sub> models, these changes led to increased peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>j</sub> (+54.4% and +100%, respectively) and RyR opening (+64.6% and +129%, respectively) as a result of more Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, left column, rows 2–4). The positive feedback relationship between [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>j</sub> and RyR opening was strong enough such that when SR load was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, left column, row 2, dotted vs. solid lines), this actually resulted in a lower minimum [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub> during release (−3.6% and −13.3% for cAF and cAF<sub>alt</sub> models, respectively). However, the amount of positive feedback differed between the cAF and cAF<sub>alt</sub> ionic models. Positive feedback amplifies changes in release inputs, such as SR load; therefore, in the cAF model, where [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>j</sub> is higher and positive feedback is stronger, the increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub> produced a slightly greater change in release (compared to the unperturbed, steady state simulation) during the rising phase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>j</sub> (t&lt;48 ms) than in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, left column, row 6, black vs. red).</p>
<p>By contrast, termination of release occurs through a negative feedback process, with RyRs inactivating upon the binding of junctional Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Negative feedback attenuates changes in release so that robust, fast termination of release is achieved even when a disturbance (such as a transient increase in SR load) occurs. In the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model, negative feedback is decreased both directly, via reduction of ki<sub>Ca</sub>, and indirectly, via reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>j</sub> that occurs as a result of decreased SR load. This causes prolongation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release event and a larger peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>j</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, left column, row 4, red vs. black dotted lines). Consequently, when SR load was increased by the same amount in the cAF and cAF<sub>alt</sub> models, although the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model had a lesser initial change in release because of weaker positive feedback, it also had a greater final change in release, i.e. a steeper SR release-load relationship, because of weaker negative feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, left column, row 6, red vs. black).</p>
<p>The results in column 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref> demonstrate how the steeper SR release slope in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> ionic model (as compared to the cAF ionic model) depends upon RyR inactivation by junctional Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, recent work suggests that termination of release does not rely on direct Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation of the RyR but rather on local SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Sobie1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Stern1">[26]</xref>. In order to test whether steepening of the SR release slope could occur in the cAF model by an alternative release termination mechanism, we implemented a version of the cAF model in which the RyR Markov model was replaced with that of Sato and Bers and the SR was divided into junctional (JSR) and network (NSR) compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Sato1">[27]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1004011-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s011">S1 Text</xref>). Termination of release in this alternative RyR model relies on calsequestrin (CSQN) binding to the RyR, which occurs as luminal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] decreases causing changes in RyR opening and closing rates.</p>

<p>The effects of decreased RyR termination in the Sato-Bers RyR model are shown in the right column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>. When the CSQN-bound RyR closing rate k<sub>34</sub> (analagous to the inactivation rate ki<sub>Ca</sub> in the original model) is decreased from 100% to 50% (cAF<sub>alt</sub>), steady-state Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations change modestly as compared to the original RyR formulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, black vs. red solid lines), but nevertheless display similar trends: [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>JSR</sub> decreases by 1.5% (vs. 19.7%, row 2), peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>j</sub> is reduced by 10.5% (vs. 15.2%, row 4) and delayed, and total release increases by 3.6% (vs. 3.4%, row 5). When [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>NSR</sub> is perturbed in the Sato-Bers models by +20 µM, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release increases more in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model than in the cAF model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, right column, row 6, red vs. black dotted lines). Consequently, the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release slope is steeper in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 3.7 vs 1.9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, right column, row 1). Thus, although changes in SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release slope in the original cAF model are caused by altered junctional Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation, altered SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms of release termination can produce such changes in SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release slope as well.</p>

<title>Iterated map analysis</title>
<p>Although SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release slope is an important component of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, other aspects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling, such as SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, could also have a significant impact. In order to understand how both SR release and uptake contribute to CaT alternans onset at slow pacing rates in human cAF cells, we used an iterated map analysis for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling stability under AP voltage clamp conditions. Three factors affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling stability were included in the analysis: SR release, SR uptake, and cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux across the sarcolemma. The latter factor was included because Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in the human atrial cell model varied significantly enough to affect alternans threshold predictions.</p>

<p>The effects of changing CL and changing ki<sub>Ca</sub> are explored for the cAF model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>. At the default ki<sub>Ca</sub> value (100%), as CL is decreased from 700 ms to 200 ms (−10 ms increments), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreases, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases, and the system approaches the alternans threshold given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004011.e010">Eq. 1</xref>. The change in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values is non-monotonic, initially decreasing (orange to green) and then increasing (green to orange) as CL is decreased. However, the change in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has a minimal effect at small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values, since the threshold curves for different <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values converge at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. At CL&lt;220 ms, the cell begins to display alternans in Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling, coinciding with the iterated map parameter values residing very close to the theoretically predicted boundary given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004011.e010">Eq. 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>, orange X's). When ki<sub>Ca</sub> is set at 50% of the default cAF value (cAF<sub>alt</sub> model), a similar trend is observed. However, the 50% ki<sub>Ca</sub> cAF model reaches threshold at a lower pacing rate (CL = 390 ms for the 50% ki<sub>Ca</sub> cAF model vs. 210 ms for the 100% ki<sub>Ca</sub> cAF model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>, X's). This is primarily due to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increasing as ki<sub>Ca</sub> is decreased, illustrated by the trajectory of the system in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> plane as CL is held constant at 390 ms but ki<sub>Ca</sub> is decreased from 100% to 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>).</p>
<p>We next performed the same iterated map analysis for the control atrial cell model with varying CL and ki<sub>Ca</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). When ki<sub>Ca</sub> is at 100%, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreases as CL is decreased. However, unlike in the cAF model, in the control case the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> undergoes a net decrease as CL shortens from 700 to 200 ms. Ultimately, since both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decrease as CL is shortened, the control atrial cell (with ki<sub>Ca</sub> at 100%) fails to reach threshold and remains in the stable, no alternans region. This suggests that alternans in control patients, which occur at CL&lt;250 ms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref>, are driven by voltage rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup>. As in the cAF model, the alternans threshold CL in the control model can be adjusted by modulating the value of ki<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>, CL = 390 ms). However, in the control model, ki<sub>Ca</sub> must be decreased much more than in the cAF model in order to reach <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at a CL of 390 ms (ki<sub>Ca</sub> reduced to 16% vs. 50%). The need for dramatic and possibly unrealistic reductions in ki<sub>Ca</sub> to produce alternans at slow rates in control is consistent with the absence of alternans observed in control patients at CL≥250 ms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>To explain the difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling properties of the cAF and control models, we examined the effects of cAF cellular remodeling on iterated map parameters. Stochastic ionic model parameter variation and regression analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Sobie2">[30]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s011">S1 Text</xref>) predicted that of the ten model parameters altered in the control model to construct the cAF model, seven would have significant effects on alternans threshold CL (these are g<sub>CaL</sub>, g<sub>Kur</sub>, ko<sub>Ca</sub>, Ibar<sub>NCX</sub>, g<sub>to</sub>, g<sub>K1</sub>, and g<sub>Na</sub>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s008">S8 Figure</xref>). Of these seven parameters, three are involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling (g<sub>CaL</sub>, ko<sub>Ca</sub>, and Ibar<sub>NCX</sub>). The effects of changing these three parameters from control to cAF values is depicted sequentially in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>: starting with the default values for the control cell at a CL of 390 ms, first g<sub>CaL</sub> is decreased and then Ibar<sub>NCX</sub> and ko<sub>Ca</sub> are increased to cAF values, resulting in an overall decrease in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Finally, when ki<sub>Ca</sub> is decreased to the cAF<sub>alt</sub> value (50%), the large increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> causes the system to reach <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and alternate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>, red X). This illustrates why the control cell is less susceptible to CaT alternans than the cAF cell: at a given ki<sub>Ca</sub> value and pacing rate, SR uptake efficiency (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is higher in the control model, thus requiring a large increase in the pacing rate (which decreases <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and/or a large decrease in ki<sub>Ca</sub> (which increases <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in order to reach <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Of the three cAF parameters which decrease <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, however, g<sub>CaL</sub> is the most important for alternans onset, since remodeling of Ibar<sub>NCX</sub> and ko<sub>Ca</sub> decreases <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while remodeling of g<sub>CaL</sub> increases <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>Findings and significance</title>
<p>The first goal of this study was to identify the electrophysiological changes in human atrial cells that are responsible for the occurrence of APD alternans at heart rates near rest, as observed in AF patients. Using parameter sensitivity analysis, we found that of the 20 electrophysiological model variables tested, only changes in the RyR inactivation rate constant (ki<sub>Ca</sub>) could produce APD alternans at relatively slow pacing rates in a tissue model of persistent/chronic AF. In particular, decreasing ki<sub>Ca</sub> by 50% (the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model) produced a good match to clinical data. We next aimed to provide mechanistic insight into why disruption of RyR kinetics, together with other electrophysiological changes occurring in AF, leads to alternans onset at pacing rates near rest. We established that alternans in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model at the onset CL were Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven rather than voltage-driven, and that they depended upon SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Furthermore, CaT alternans occurred in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model at relatively long CLs because of steep SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release slope and decreased SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake efficiency. Lastly, we demonstrated that the ability to generate alternans at slower pacing rates by modulating ki<sub>Ca</sub> depended upon the negative feedback properties of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p>
<p>This study is the first to identify a possible mechanism for alternans occurring at slow heart rates in AF patients. Our novel findings show that alternans at slow rates is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven, brought about by AF-associated remodeling of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling system in atrial cells. Clinical and experimental research has shown that atrial alternans is associated with disease progression in AF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref> and with increased AF susceptibility after myocardial infarction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Miyauchi1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Kettlewell1">[32]</xref> and atrial tachycardia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Jousset1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-MonigattiTenkorang1">[34]</xref> in animal models. Additionally, CaT alternans have been studied in animal atrial myocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Blatter1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Shkryl1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Kockskmper1">[35]</xref> and in the intact atria of AF-prone mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Xie2">[36]</xref>. However, the precise cellular mechanism underlying alternans at heart rates near rest in the remodeled human atria has not been previously identified, and a direct relationship between human AF and CaT alternans in the atria has not been established until now. Elucidating the mechanism driving alternans at slow rates is particularly important because APD oscillations appear to be closely linked to AF initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref>. If APD alternans play a direct role in AF initiation, the onset of alternans at slower pacing rates would indicate an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia in AF patients, consistent with clinical observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref>. Identification of this mechanism would thus provide a significant scientific and clinical benefit, improving our understanding of arrhythmogenesis and aiding in the development of new targeted therapies for AF.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate how different aspects of AF remodeling contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven alternans onset at slower heart rates using a theoretical analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling. This analysis allowed us to quantitatively assess CaT alternans threshold under AP voltage clamp conditions in a detailed electrophysiological model, providing valuable insights into the effects of AF electrophysiological remodeling on Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and alternans. Furthermore, we identify a critical aspect of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release—inactivation of the RyR—which is necessary for CaT alternans to occur at slow heart rates.

<title>RyR dysregulation in AF</title>
<p>The RyR has been the focus of several studies concerning trigger-mediated AF. In particular, disruption of RyR regulation has been shown to promote AF through increased RyR open probability, diastolic SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak, and delayed afterdepolarizations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Nattel3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Dobrev1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Lederer1">[40]</xref>. Here we identify an additional pathological consequence of the disruption of RyR regulation in AF: Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven alternans. Similar to what has been demonstrated with regards to Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and triggered activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Dobrev1">[39]</xref>, we found that CaT alternans is coupled to voltage primarily through upregulated I<sub>NCX</sub>, thus driving the generation of APD alternans. The RyR's central role in both alternans and triggers has important clinical implications, given the proarrhythmic consequences of interaction between ectopic activity and the arrhythmogenic substrate created by voltage alternans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Laurita1">[41]</xref>. New drug treatments to restore the normal function of the RyR and NCX, and thereby prevent arrhythmogenic triggers and alternans, have the potential to provide more effective alternatives to current AF drug therapies which target voltage-gated ion channels and often have proarrhythmic side effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Dobrev1">[39]</xref>.</p>

Possible molecular mechanisms which could account for reduced RyR inactivation include RyR hyperphosphorylation by CAMKII and PKA and dissociation of the RyR subunit FKBP12.6, which have been shown to increase RyR open probability and promote arrhythmia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Dobrev2">[42]</xref>, although the exact role of these mechanisms in RyR dysregulation are still debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Houser1">[43]</xref>. Calmodulin has also been shown to interact directly with the RyR to decrease its open probability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-ArnizCot1">[44]</xref>.

Recent experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Shkryl1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Wang1">[49]</xref> and simulation studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Restrepo1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Lugo1">[53]</xref> have shown that RyR refractoriness can drive CaT alternans under conditions where near-identical SR loads produce different amounts of SR release. In some simulation studies, this phenomenon was restricted to limited parameter values, clamping conditions, and cycle lengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Rovetti1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-AlvarezLacalle1">[52]</xref>, while in a more recent modeling study focusing on atrial cells, SR load-independent alternans occurred over a broad range of pacing rates when the number of t-tubules was reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Lugo1">[53]</xref>. Of note is the fact that many of these studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Rovetti1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Lugo1">[53]</xref> utilized the same RyR gating scheme as this current study, yet they identified various mechanisms for CaT alternans. This demonstrates that the relative importance of the various mechanisms, whether SR load-driven, RyR refractoriness-driven, or otherwise, is highly context-dependent.</p>
<p>Although exploring the issue of SR load vs. RyR refractoriness was beyond the goals of the current study, our results suggest that in human cAF, both SR load alternation and RyR refractoriness are involved in alternans genesis at slower pacing rates. In our cAF<sub>alt</sub> model, alternation in all SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release variables, including [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub>, RyR open probability, and RyR inactivated probability, was necessary for alternans at the onset CL of 400 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). In addition, SR uptake flux (J<sub>serca</sub>) enhanced alternans when clamped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) and therefore suppressed alternans under normal pacing conditions, suggesting that SR load is indeed an important driver of CaT alternans in cAF and that upregulation of the SERCA pump may be an important therapeutic strategy for diminishing alternans. We also showed that CaT alternans occurred in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model at slow pacing rates because decreased RyR inactivation resulted in steepening of the SR release-load relationship. Together, these results indicate that the interplay between SR load and RyR kinetics is responsible for alternans onset in human AF.</p>

<title>Other potential mechanisms for alternans susceptibility</title>
<p>The mechanisms for human atrial alternans susceptibility are likely to encompass a range of complex interactions at multiple scales of biology, which extend beyond the cellular-level mechanisms found here. In this study we examined the behavior of an atrial cell with well-developed t-tubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Grandi1">[19]</xref>. Research has shown that rat atrial cells have variable levels of t-tubule organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Frisk1">[54]</xref>.

<p>In addition, the complex structure of the atria, including its normal conduction pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Harrild1">[59]</xref> and fibrotic remodeling in AF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-KroghMadsen1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-McDowell1">[61]</xref>, may promote heterogeneity and discordant alternans, which significantly affect alternans dynamics and reentry initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Franz1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Qu2">[62]</xref>.

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>In many cell models, the effective refractory period (ERP) is not consistent with ERP at the tissue level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Defauw1">[63]</xref>. Electrotonic effects in tissue and the whole heart can shorten or lengthen APD depending on which structures and cell types are coupled to each other. Furthermore, alternans in single cell models may not be predictive of alternans in tissue, where conduction alternans can occur. This was the case for the control atrial tissue model, in which loss of capture occurred at a CL of 260 ms before reaching the very fast pacing rates at which APD alternans were observed in human control patients (CL = 218±30 ms) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref>. However, alternans onset at clinically observed rates occurred in the single-cell control model (200 ms CL, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s009">S9 Figure</xref>, black curve) and when ki<sub>Ca</sub> was reduced by 5% (230 ms CL, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s009">S9 Figure</xref>, red curve). This suggests that the ionic model may not be well-constrained for tissue simulations at very fast rates. However, this issue did not affect the study of alternans onset at slower pacing rates, as was observed in AF patients.</p>
<p>Our ionic model variable clamping protocol, which involved separately clamping the even or odd beat waveforms, was used to test for model variables which could robustly suppress alternans when clamped to either of two very different waveforms. An alternative approach would be to clamp model variables to the single unstable, non-alternating waveform obtained using a control algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Jordan1">[64]</xref>. This approach would allow more precise assessment of fixed point stability, since clamping is done at the point of instability rather than during the bistable (alternans) endpoint. However, for the purposes of quantifying the most important variables influencing instability, the clamping protocol used in this study was sufficient to identify the central role of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, which was later confirmed through iterated map analysis.</p>
<p>Recent experimental evidence points towards local SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RyR inactivation, as the main mechanism of SR release termination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Sobie1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Stern1">[26]</xref>. Although alternans in the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model relied on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent RyR inactivation, other termination mechanisms which rely on SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> (used in the Sato-Bers RyR model) may have similar effects on SR release slope and alternans susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, column 2). However, with the Sato-Bers RyR model, alternans and other complex oscillations began at the baseline pacing rate (750 ms CL, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s010">S10 Figure</xref>) and did not display the same rate dependence observed in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref>. In addition, large oscillations in CaT amplitude did not couple as strongly to voltage as with the original RyR, and oscillations were also attenuated in tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004011.s010">S10 Figure</xref>). Further work is needed to develop atrial cell models which incorporate current mechanistic understanding of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and which can also reproduce AF-related alternans rate dependence in tissue.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>AF is associated with progressive changes in alternans onset in the human atria, with alternans occurring at slower heart rates as AF severity worsens. We found that the differences in alternans onset between AF and control patients could be accounted for by changes in the inactivation rate of the RyR in a model of human atrial cAF-remodeled tissue. Single-cell simulations revealed that alternans at these slow heart rates were driven by abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and the development of CaT alternans, and that changes in CaT alternans threshold resulted from steepening of the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release slope, decreased SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake efficiency, and decreased inactivation of the RyR. These findings provide important insight into the mechanisms underlying proarrhythmic APD alternans occurring at slow heart rates in cAF patients. Such insight may aid in the development of targeted therapies and new treatment strategies for AF in the future.</p>

<title>Human AF tissue model</title>
<p>In order to investigate ionic mechanisms in human AF that contribute to the generation of atrial alternans at the tissue level, we created a computer model of human atrial tissue incorporating ionic remodeling associated with cAF. The atrial tissue preparation had dimensions of 0.33×0.33×9.9 mm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), similar to the one used by Krummen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Krummen1">[65]</xref> Human atrial cell membrane kinetics were represented by a modified version of the Grandi-Pandit-Voigt (GPV) human atrial action potential model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Grandi1">[19]</xref>, which we refer to as the GPVm model.

<title>Protocols for evaluating alternans in the human AF tissue model</title>
<p>We assessed alternans in the human AF tissue model by applying the clinical pacing protocol used by Narayan <italic>et al.</italic> to induce alternans in AF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref>. The tissue model was first initialized at all nodes with steady-state values from a single cell paced at 750-ms CL.

<p>Voltage traces from the recording electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) were analyzed for APD alternans. APD was calculated as the time from maximal upstroke velocity to 90% repolarization of V<sub>m</sub> from phase II amplitude. Alternans magnitude was quantified as the mean magnitude of change in APD over the last 10 pairs of beats (11 beats total). APD alternans normalized magnitude (ANM), obtained by dividing the alternans magnitude by the mean APD over the last 10 beats, was used to compare alternans between cells of varying APD. Alternans onset CL was defined as the longest CL for which ANM was greater than 5% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Narayan2">[8]</xref>.</p>

<title>AP clamp</title>
<p>To evaluate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling properties of the human atrial cell model under different pacing rates and parameter values, the following equation was used to clamp V<sub>m</sub> to a generic atrial AP-like waveform so that comparisons between different conditions would not be influenced by variations in V<sub>m</sub>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1004011.e055"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>This approach has been used previously to investigate Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling properties in ventricular myocyte models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Xie1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Restrepo1">[50]</xref>.

In our analysis, Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling stability depended upon three iterated map parameters: SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release slope (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake factor (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux factor (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004011.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

<p>To compute the iterated map parameters, a single atrial cell was repeatedly clamped to the AP waveform until model variables reached steady state. Following this, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub> was perturbed by ±1% at the beginning of an even beat, and total SR load, release, uptake, and cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux per beat were recorded for the following 10 beats. For the Sato-Bers model, the first beat was excluded since it deviated noticeably from the linear response of later beats. This procedure was repeated starting with an odd beat so that data from a total of 40 beats were recorded (36 beats for the Sato-Bers model).

Clamping sub-sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>sl</sub>) to the even beat (column 1) eliminated alternans in V<sub>m</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but clamping [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>sl</sub> to the odd beat (column 2) produced small alternans in V<sub>m</sub> and [Ca<sub>2+</sub>]<sub>i</sub> and large alternans in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub>. Clamping sub-sarcolemmal Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger current (I<sub>NCXsl</sub>) to the even beat (column 3) eliminated alternans in APD but produced large alternans in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub>. Clamping I<sub>NCXsl</sub> to the odd beat (column 4) eliminated alternans in V<sub>m</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

<p><bold>Multivariable regression between ionic model parameters and alternans threshold CL.</bold> (A) Bar graph of regression coefficient magnitudes. Twenty ionic model parameters were varied stochastically over 500 simulations to assess their effects on alternans cycle length (CL). Of the 500 simulations, 83 were excluded from the analysis because alternans threshold CL was below 100 ms or above 750 ms. Linear regression coefficients for each of the parameters are plotted in order of decreasing magnitude, with positive values plotted in red and negative values plotted in blue. Asterisks indicate <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 for the <italic>t</italic>-statistic. (B) Bar graph of the predicted contribution of parameters to alternans threshold CL in the cAF-remodeled cell. Ten of the twenty parameters used in the regression analysis were altered from control values to represent cAF remodeling (increases and decreases indicated by upward and downward arrows, respectively). Parameters whose changes were predicted to increase (decrease) the alternans CL are plotted in red (blue). Some unaltered parameters had nonzero predicted contributions to alternans threshold CL due to nonzero sample means from the regression analysis. The alternans threshold CL predicted by regression analysis (245 ms) was very close to the actual alternans threshold CL determined by simulation (244 ms).</p>

<p><bold>Single-cell APD restitution in control model.</bold> With default model parameter values, APD alternans occurred at 200 ms CL (black). When the RyR inactivation rate constant (ki<sub>Ca</sub>) was reduced to 95%, alternans occurred at slightly longer CLs (red).

<p><bold>APD and CaT oscillations in single-cell and tissue models with Sato-Bers RyR formulation.</bold> Control (black), cAF (red), and cAF<sub>alt</sub> (dotted red line) versions of the model using the Sato-Bers RyR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004011-Sato1">[27]</xref> were implemented in single cell (A and B) and in tissue (C and D). In the cAF<sub>alt</sub> model, the calsequestrin-bound RyR closing rate (k<sub>34</sub>) was decreased by 50%. APD (A and C) and CaT (B and D) restitution data are plotted showing the mean±SD range (control, gray shading, not visible; cAF, pink shading; cAF<sub>alt</sub>, red hatching). Oscillations in APD and CaT included but were not limited to alternans. Oscillations exhibited the reverse of the rate dependence observed in models using the original RyR formulation, with larger oscillations at longer CL. APD oscillations in these models were diminished as compared to the original models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1004011-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), and both APD and CaT oscillations were attenuated in tissue.</p>
