        <article-title>Preparing for Transcription: The Role of Histone H2A.Z</article-title>
      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>H2A.Z is an evolutionary conserved histone variant involved in transcriptional
          regulation, antisilencing, silencing, and genome stability. The mechanism(s) by which
          H2A.Z regulates these various biological functions remains poorly defined, in part due to
          the lack of knowledge regarding its physical location along chromosomes and the bearing it
          has in regulating chromatin structure. Here we mapped H2A.Z across the yeast genome at an
          approximately 300-bp resolution, using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with tiling
          microarrays. We have identified 4,862 small regions—typically one or two
          nucleosomes wide—decorated with H2A.Z. Those “Z loci” are
          predominantly found within specific nucleosomes in the promoter of inactive genes all
          across the genome. Furthermore, we have shown that H2A.Z can regulate nucleosome
          positioning at the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. Within HZAD domains, the regions where
          H2A.Z shows an antisilencing function, H2A.Z is localized in a wider pattern, suggesting
          that the variant histone regulates a silencing and transcriptional activation via
          different mechanisms. Our data suggest that the incorporation of H2A.Z into specific
          promoter-bound nucleosomes configures chromatin structure to poise genes for
          transcriptional activation. The relevance of these findings to higher eukaryotes is
          discussed.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Eukaryotic chromosomes are packaged into a complex nucleoprotein structure termed
        chromatin, from which the fundamental unit is the nucleosome. Nucleosomes are composed of
        octamers of histone proteins designated as H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 that wrap approximately 146
        bp of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b02">2</xref>]. Chromatin is generally highly
        repressive to cellular processes that involve DNA transactions such as gene transcription
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b03">3</xref>]. Cells have thus
        devised at least three schemes to overcome the nucleosomal barrier: the first involves
        adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis to mechanically displace nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b05">5</xref>], and the second consists of chemically modifying
        the tails of histones, such as by acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and
        ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b02">2</xref>].
        This last scheme can take the form of a “code” where modifications act
        as signals for subsequent chromatin modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b07">7</xref>]. A third scheme that has been devised by cells to overcome the
        nucleosomal barrier is to alter the composition of nucleosomes through the incorporation of
        histone variants that can—directly or indirectly—alter the
        permissiveness of chromatin to gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b09">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>Nonallelic variants have been described for many classes of histones, and one of the
        best-studied examples is the Z variant of H2A. H2A.Z, formerly called H2A.F/Z, is
        evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b11">11</xref>]. H2A.Z is essential for the viability of <italic>Tetrahymena,
          Drosophila,</italic> and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b14">14</xref>] and
        constitutes approximately 10% of all cellular H2A molecules in S-phase
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b16">16</xref>]. Experiments carried out in many organisms have
        shown that H2A.Z has a function distinct from the canonical H2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b18">18</xref>]. H2A variant histones differ mainly in their N- and C-terminal portions
        as compared to S-phase H2A, whereas the core region is highly conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b16">16</xref>]. In fact, experiments carried
        out in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in yeast have revealed that the unique feature of
        H2A.Z important for its specific function resides in the carboxyl-terminal region of the
        variant histone and not in its histone fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b19">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>In <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila,</italic> H2A.Z has been found to be associated with the
        transcriptionally active macronucleus, thus implying a positive role for H2A.Z in gene
        transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b20">20</xref>].
        Subsequently, experiments carried out in yeast have shown that H2A.Z could regulate
        transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b21">21</xref>] and that its function is
        partially redundant with nucleosome remodeling complexes such as SAGA and Swi/Snf
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b21">21</xref>]. H2A.Z has been
        shown to be quickly remodeled soon after gene induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b23">23</xref>], a
        result that implies that the role of H2A.Z in positive gene transcription occurs at an early
        step. In line with this idea, we have shown that the transcriptional machinery is not
        efficiently recruited to the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter in
        <italic>htz1</italic>Δ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b19">19</xref>]. Another mechanism by which H2A.Z could
        contribute to gene regulation has been suggested by Farris et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b23">23</xref>], where they have shown at the
          <italic>c-myc</italic> gene that transcription-induced chromatin transactions involve the
        exchange of H2A.Z for canonical H2A.</p>
      <p>In addition to its well-established role in transcriptional activation, a recent important
        piece of work by the Madhani group showed that H2A.Z positively regulates clusters of genes
        that are proximal to telomeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b24">24</xref>]. The gene expression defect observed at those gene clusters (called
        HZAD domains) in H2A.Z mutants can be suppressed by the deletion of silencing proteins such
        as Sir2. It has therefore been suggested that H2A.Z functions as an antisilencing factor by
        antagonizing the spread of heterochromatin to euchromatic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b24">24</xref>]. The expression of other
        H2A.Z-affected genes, however, is not sensitive to Sir proteins suggesting H2A.Z positively
        regulates gene expression via both antisilencing and other mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Evidence also suggests that H2A.Z can negatively regulate gene expression, notably through
        gene silencing. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in yeast, H2A.Z was reported to be
        involved in heterochromatic silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b26">26</xref>]. In mammalian
        cells, H2A.Z colocalizes with, and directly interacts with, heterochromatin protein 1 or
        HP1-α (LocusLink:23468) and with INCENP (LocusLink:3619)—a protein
        involved in chromosome segregation—in pericentric heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b28">28</xref>]. In addition, HP1-α and H2A.Z may
        function together to establish a specialized conformation at constitutive heterochromatin
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b27">27</xref>]. Thus, from
        these findings it is clear that H2A.Z is important both for the positive and negative
        regulation of gene expression.</p>
      <p>To add to all of these recent findings, there has been the codiscovery of an adenosine
        triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that specifically loads H2A.Z into
        chromatin and exchanges it with H2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b31">31</xref>].
        This complex, from which the catalytic subunit is Swr1, also shares essential subunits with
        the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b29">29</xref>]. In addition to their importance in gene
        regulation, the Swr1 complex, H2A.Z, and NuA4 are all involved in the regulation of
        chromosome stability in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b32">32</xref>]. This is interesting and important since it was also demonstrated that
        in mammalian cells, knockdown of H2A.Z causes the genome to become unstable, a process that
        is attributed to defects in chromosome segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b33">33</xref>]. Of equal importance is the fact that H2A.Z is
        required for early mouse and <italic>Xenopus</italic> development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>Despite all the work reviewed above, the mechanisms by which H2A.Z regulates transcription,
        silencing, genome stability, and developement remains largely unknown. A key piece of data
        that is missing is a global view of the distribution of H2A.Z across the genome. Polytene
        chromosome stainings have shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> H2A.Z is widely distributed
        in the genome, but with nonuniform distribution that is characterized by a complex banded
        pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b34">34</xref>]. From
        these data, it is thus conceivable that certain regions of the genome are preferentially
        occupied by variant histones and interspersed with regular histones. The resolution provided
        by this assay, however, is not high enough to allow one to correlate H2A.Z localization with
        its effect on gene expression. Experiments aimed at localizing proteins on defined chromatin
        segments in vivo—chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—have been
        performed at specific loci, but these experiments do not allow determining whether H2A.Z
        assembles preferentially within large chromosomal domains, whether it is randomly spread out
        across the genome, or whether it is associated with specific loci along chromosomes.
        Answering this question is a crucial step toward understanding the various functions of this
        important protein.</p>
      <p>Here we make use of a genome-wide location assay (ChIP–chip) to map H2A.Z across
        the yeast genome with a 300-bp resolution. Our data show that H2A.Z preferentially and
        specifically associates to small regions within the promoters of inactive yeast genes. We
        also show that replacement of H2A.Z for regular H2A within the <italic>GAL1</italic>
        promoter region perturbs nucleosome positioning, a situation that might account for the
        transcription defect at the latter gene in the absence of H2A.Z. Interestingly, the very
        strict promoter-specific association of H2A.Z that is otherwise observed elsewhere is not
        observed for genes contained within the HZAD domains. At those genes, the presence of H2A.Z
        can be detected within wider domains encompassing both the promoter region and part of the
        open reading frame (ORF).</p>

        <title>Genome-Wide Location Analysis of H2A.Z</title>
        <p>In order to investigate the genomic distribution of H2A.Z in yeast, we performed
          genome-wide location experiments (also known as ChIP–chip) on whole-genome
          tiling microarrays. The assay consists of first performing ChIP assays to
          immunoprecipitate (IP) our target DNA molecules of interest. Thus, yeast cells are first
          cross-linked with formaldehyde prior to being lysed. Chromatin fragments (approximately
          400 bp) are next obtained by sonication and specific antibodies are then used to IP our
          protein or proteins of interest along with their target DNA. Purified DNA is next
          amplified by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), labeled, and hybridizing to an array that
          contains a total of 44,290 60-mer probes (including controls) for an average of one probe
          every 266 bp (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for more
          details). Thus, ChIPs were performed using yeast strains bearing Myc epitopes on H2A.Z and
          on the canonical H2A. In every case, a ChIP for histone H2B (performed using an HA-tagged
          H2B strain) was hybridized together with the H2A.Z (or H2A) ChIP to control for nucleosome
          density. In addition, other control experiments where two Myc-H2A.Z ChIPs are hybridized
          against each other were also performed. All experiments were performed in duplicate and
          combined using a weighted average method. A Gaussian filter was then applied to each
          dataset in order to create a smooth interpolation occupancy curve. The method allowed for
          the identification of 4,862 loci enriched in H2A.Z, referred to below as “Z
          loci.” The enrichment ratio for every probe on the microarray is available in

        <title>H2A.Z Is Associated with Small Genomic Regions Present All across the Yeast Genome</title>
        <p>The 4,862 loci identified here are widely distributed across all chromosomes, and no
          regions show any bias (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g001">Figure 1</xref>
          for a map of Chromosome III and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st006">Table
            S6</xref> to see the whole genome). Typical Z loci are less than 400 bp long, suggesting
          that the variant histone occupies regions that are generally no larger than two
          nucleosomes. This estimation is based on four observations. First, the probes enriched in
          the H2A.Z experiments were not depleted in the H2A experiments (data not shown). Because
          the average size of the DNA fragments used in our ChIP assays is 400 bp, this suggests
          that most 400-bp fragments within the genome that contains H2A.Z will also contain H2A.
          Since, in principle, a nucleosome cannot contain both H2A and H2A.Z simultaneously
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b35">35</xref>], the data
          suggest that H2A.Z occupies regions that are smaller than 400 bp. Second, the size of the
          Z loci as they appear from the microarray data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g001">Figure 1</xref>, for example) are consistent with H2A.Z
          occupying small regions—especially considering the fact that ChIP experiments
          necessarily overestimate the size of the region bound by proteins due to the size of the
          chromatin fragments generated. Third, high-resolution quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis of
          ChIP experiments using small overlapping PCR probes allowed us to map the Z loci within
          the promoter of the <italic>SRB8</italic> genes to an approximately 260-bp region using
          TFIIB as a reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b36">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g001">Figure 1</xref>D; see

          H2A.Z maps to one or two nucleosomes in promoters (see below). Taken together, these
          analyses show that H2A.Z occupies very small regions scattered across the genome, rather
          than concentrating within large chromosomal domains.</p>

        <title>H2A.Z-Containing Nucleosomes Are Essentially Located within Promoter Regions</title>
        <p>We next examined the actual location of the Z loci relative to genes. Manual inspection
          of the data suggests that Z loci are predominantly located within promoter regions. This
          feature is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g001">Figure 1</xref>,
          that shows (i) only one ORF within the 40-KB window shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g001">Figure 1</xref>C contains enrichment for H2A.Z; (ii) none of the
          seven intergenic regions that do not contain any promoter in that region (for example,
          between <italic>SOL2</italic> and <italic>ERS1</italic>) contain a Z locus; (iii) there is
          a Z locus upstream of every ORF shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g001">Figure 1</xref>C; and (iv) interestingly, the intergenic region between the divergently
          transcribed <italic>YCR090C</italic> and <italic>KIN82</italic> ORFs contains two separate
          Z loci, supporting the idea that each promoter is decorated with its own H2A.Z
          nucleosome(s). In order to systematically evaluate the H2A.Z preference for promoter
          regions, we analyzed the relation between the H2A.Z/H2B ratio and the distance to the
          closest 5′ gene boundary (for example, the ATG for protein-coding genes) for all
          probes on the microarray. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g002">Figure
            2</xref>A, H2A.Z binding (green line) is higher around the 5′ boundary with a
          small bias toward the regions located just upstream compared to downstream (see inlet for
          a zoom into the 5′ region). This relationship is not observed on random data
            (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, black line) or when the
          proximity to the 3′ end of genes is examined (not shown). Because 5′
          UTRs are very small in yeast, these data are consistent with H2A.Z being localized over
          promoters, although we cannot rule out the possibility that H2A.Z is rather present within
          the 5′ UTR since only a few transcriptional start sites have been annotated in
          yeast. For the sake of simplicity the word “promoter” will be used
          here to refer to the regions localized between 500 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream of
          the 5′ boundary of transcribed elements (this includes ORFs, but also other
          transcribed elements such as Ty elements, tRNAs, etc.). This interval was chosen based on
          a recent genome-wide analysis of yeast promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b38">38</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, 74% (3,639 out of 4,862) of the Z
          loci identified in this study are located within the promoter of annotated genes.
          Considering that promoters account for about 31% of the yeast genome, this
          translates into a 2.4-fold enrichment over a random uniform distribution
          (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In addition, we find that 63% (4,742 out
          of 7,488) of yeast promoters are decorated with H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Conversely, only 2% of the H2A.Z
          loci are located within intergenic regions that contain no promoters (where two genes are

        <p>In a recent elegant study, the Rando group mapped nucleosomes over 482 KB of yeast DNA,
          including most of the entire Chromosome III. They showed that the scored yeast promoters
          contain a nucleosome-free region (NFR) flanked with well-positioned nucleosomes
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b37">37</xref>]. A median
          sliding window of their data is reproduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g002">Figure 2</xref>D (blue) along with our genome-wide location data with H2A.Z/H2B (green)
          and H2A/H2B (gold) data for a composite of 1,850 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b37">37</xref>]. Despite both assays having different
          resolution, the figure clearly shows that H2A.Z is preferentially localized downstream of
          the NFR in yeast promoters. More important, data from the figure suggest that H2A.Z may
          occupy the first, and perhaps also the second, well-positioned nucleosome downstream of
          the NFR (see cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g002">Figure 2</xref>D).
          Taken together, these data suggest that H2A.Z targets specific nucleosomes within
          promoters across the genome and therefore contributes to create a promoter-specific
          chromatin structure.</p>
        <p>In addition to class II promoter regions, we found H2A.Z loci at other transcribed units
          such as tRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, rDNAs, and Ty elements, suggesting that the role of
          H2A.Z in transcription is not limited to protein-coding genes (data not shown).
          Interestingly, we also found H2A.Z loci centered around centromeres and replication
          origins (data not shown). The association of H2A.Z to centromeres was also reported
          previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b32">32</xref>], and
          the role of H2A.Z in DNA replication and chromosomal segregation will be studied elsewhere

        <title>H2A.Z Is Not Enriched in the Promoter Region of Highly Active Genes</title>

          preference for promoter regions. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g002">Figure 2</xref>B shows that up to 37% of promoters are not associated with a
          Z locus. In order to investigate what determines the association of H2A.Z with some
          promoters but not others, we investigated the correlation between H2A.Z promoter occupancy
          and the transcription rate for all genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g003">Figure 3</xref>, there is an inverse correlation between the
          transcription rate and H2A.Z occupancy. Accordingly, when the genome-wide location of
          H2A.Z was determined for cells grown in galactose, we noticed that the occupancy of H2A.Z
          was reduced, compared to its occupancy in glucose, at the promoters of 147 out of 173
          genes whose expression levels have been demonstrated to be induced the most under those
          conditions according to the study of Ren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b39">39</xref>]. These data are consistent with H2A.Z being
          dynamically associated with inactive genes. These genomic observations are also in line
          with our ChIP/Q-PCR data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd002">Protocol
            S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>) and
          with previously published evidence at specific promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b22">22</xref>]. We would
          like to point out that data represented in the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g003">Figure 3</xref> were collected from a population of cells that
          are heterogeneous in the sense that each cell is in a different physiological state and
          phase of the cell cycle. For that reason, and also because promoters have inherently
          different strengths, a given gene is never completely off or on within the population. The
          observed transcription rate across all genes is therefore a continuum ranging from near
          zero to about 300 mRNA per hour for genes that are the most transcriptionally active. The
          transcription rate being a continuum, it is expected that the H2A.Z occupancy will also be
          a continuum. In that regard, RNA pol II or general transcription factors like TFIIB also
          show continuum-like binding patterns in those assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b41">41</xref>]. We also
          propose that the low enrichment of H2A.Z from the promoter of highly active genes most
          likely reflects the low abundance of nucleosomes in those regions since recent evidence
          shows that the promoters of highly active genes are depleted of nucleosomes
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b46">46</xref>]. Collectively, these data
          show that H2A.Z specifically associates with one or a few nucleosomes within the promoter
          of some inactive genes but is generally absent from the promoter of highly active genes.</p>

        <title>H2A.Z Regulates Nucleosome Positioning</title>
        <p>Having established that H2A.Z is present at most yeast promoters, we sought to
          investigate the functional significance of the promoter-specific localization of H2A.Z.
          First, we investigated nucleosome positioning of genes that have Z loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) versus genes that are devoid of
          those loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) as previously
          defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g002">Figure 2</xref>, using data
          presented in Yuan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b37">37</xref>]. The figure clearly shows that nucleosomes within the genes that bear
          Z loci are well positioned, whereas nucleosomes positioning at genes that do not have Z
          loci are significantly less well organized. This observation is consistent with the fact
          that H2A.Z-free promoters are less covered by nucleosomes than the more frequent
          H2A.Z-containing promoters (not shown). The figure further suggests that H2A.Z may play an
          important role in organizing chromatin structure at promoters. Alternatively, however,
          H2A.Z may associate with promoters as a consequence of their well-organized chromatin
          structure. In order to test directly whether H2A.Z can regulate chromatin structure at
          promoters, we studied nucleosome positioning at a model gene in wild-type (WT) and
          H2A.Z-null (<italic>htz1</italic>Δ) cells. The <italic>GAL1</italic> gene was
          chosen for these experiments, since H2A.Z is required for its full expression and since
          the variant histone preferentially binds the repressed promoter of that gene
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, chromatin structure at the
            <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter has been thoroughly investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b50">50</xref>], so any changes in chromatin structure should
          be experimentally tractable. First, we performed indirect end-labeling experiments on
          chromatin samples that were partially digested by MNase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, left panel, shows that the gross nucleosome
          positioning pattern is not significantly altered in <italic>htz1</italic>Δ cells
          when the latter are grown in media containing glucose. However, we do note a slight shift
          of nucleosome C (nucC) in a downstream position as well as a few other nucleosomes. The
          right panel of that figure shows the cleavage pattern of MNase-digested naked
          <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter DNA. The UAS<sub>G</sub> region can be easily identified as
          it is quite resistant to MNase cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b49">49</xref>]. Since indirect end-labeling experiments only
          have a resolution of approximately 20–30 bp, we decided to carry out
          high-resolution LM-PCR assays of MNase-digested mononucleosomes at two positioned
          nucleosomes within the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter region (nucB and nucC; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Thus, LM-PCR linkers were
          ligated to mononucleosome-purified DNA, and PCR reactions were carried out with external
          oligonucleotides corresponding to the linkers in combination with oligonucleotides
          corresponding approximately to the center of the nucleosome-protected DNA as previously
          determined by Fisher-Adams and Grunstein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b49">49</xref>]. These last oligonucleotides are designed to
          either amplify the right-end portion of nucleosome-embedded DNA (R) of nucB and nucC, or
          the left-end portion (L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g004">Figure 4</xref>D,
          above). The results show that nucB does not shift position in the
          <italic>htz1</italic>Δ mutant as compared to WT cells when PCR reactions were
          performed at either the right or left boundaries of the nucB. However, in the case of
          nucC, there is an approximately 20-bp shift to a downstream position in
          <italic>htz1</italic>Δ cells as compared to the WT case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g004">Figure 4</xref>D, right panel). More important, this shift was
          observed with both the right and left boundaries of nucC. These results confirm our
          observations in indirect end-labeling experiments and suggest that the absence of H2A.Z
          induces a specific shift of nucC to a downstream position but has no effect on the
          positioning of nucB. Our results suggest that H2A.Z may be enriched at the promoters of
          inactive genes in order to modulate the position of key regulatory promoter-associated
          nucleosomes. Because we found that most Z loci are located within well-positioned
          nucleosomes and because H2A.Z-free promoters have a less organized chromatin structure
          than H2A.Z-containing genes, it is tempting to speculate that the variant histone also
          plays a role in nucleosome positioning at other genes.</p>

        <title>H2A.Z Is Unusually Localized at HZAD Genes</title>
        <p>Because genes contained within the so-called HZAD domains—unlike other H2A.Z
          regulated genes—are proposed to be regulated by H2A.Z through an antisilencing
          mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b24">24</xref>], we
          investigated more closely the distribution of H2A.Z at those genes. First, manual
          inspection suggested that H2A.Z occupied larger regions at those genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, the regions occupied by H2A.Z
          around the <italic>GIT1</italic> gene (an HZAD gene) extend both upstream as well as
          downstream within the coding region as compared to a non-HZAD gene such as
          <italic>SRB8</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).
          Similar examples can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>. In order to investigate this in an unbiased manner, we have
          calculated the size of the regions localized between the coordinates where the H2A.Z
          occupancy curve approaches baseline (log<sub>2</sub> ratio = 0.1). This size provides an
          estimation of the width of the Z loci. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030384-g005">Figure
            5</xref>C shows a plot of that size relative to the distance to chromosome ends. The
          figure shows that H2A.Z covers larger uninterrupted regions within the first 20 KB from
          telomeres compared to telomere distal regions. This is consistent with H2A.Z occupying
          wider regions around HZAD genes than at other genes in the genome. This conclusion was
          also reached using a different analysis described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd003">Protocol S3</xref> and is not dependent on
          a difference in gene density at telomeres (not shown). This phenomenon is not restricted
          to HZAD genes since many telomere-proximal non-HZAD genes also show the same pattern (not
          shown). It is therefore possible that the antisilencing function observed at HZAD genes
          could actually be extended to more (perhaps most) telomere-proximal genes. Three
          possibilities could account for this wider distribution. First, H2A.Z could occupy more
          nucleosomes at those genes. Second, the number of nucleosomes occupied by H2A.Z may be the
          same, but these nucleosomes may not always be the same in different cells. Finally, it is
          also possible that chromatin at those genes is more fluid such that the H2A.Z nucleosomes
          can be found anywhere along a long stretch of DNA.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have investigated the genome-wide distribution of histone variant H2A.Z as compared to
        the regular S-phase histone H2A. Our results show that H2A.Z can preferentially associate to
        narrow regions of yeast promoters. Surprisingly, the variant histone is present within most
        nucleosome-containing promoters. Conversely, the promoters of highly transcribed genes are
        not predominantly enriched in H2A.Z. Furthermore, and much to our surprise, H2A.Z does not
        appear to be as sharply localized within HZAD genes. The wider distribution of H2A.Z at HZAD
        genes may be important for preventing Sir protein spreading at those regions. Since H2A.Z
        shows a strong preference for inactive gene promoter regions, we also investigated whether
        the variant histone had an important role in modulating chromatin structure at the
          <italic>GAL1</italic> model gene. More important, we find that the replacement of H2A.Z
        for regular H2A in cells induces a shift in the positioning of a nucleosome located over the
        transcription start site. In accordance with this finding is the fact that nucleosomes at
        promoter regions bearing Z loci are well positioned as compared to genes not enriched in
        H2A.Z. Taken together, our results support a model where H2A.Z associates to specific
        nucleosomes in the promoters of inactive genes in order to poise, and perhaps organize,
        chromatin structure in a fashion that is permissive to transcription initiation. However, it
        remains to be determined whether the simple incorporation of H2A.Z into specific nucleosomes
        is by itself necessary and sufficient to facilitate gene activity or whether additional
        factors are required for that action. The first possibility is supported by the fact that in
        vitro-assembled chromatin arrays containing H2A.Z are inherently more resistant to
        condensation as compared to H2A-containing nucleosomal arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b52">52</xref>]. On the other hand, work from our laboratory
        has shown that H2A.Z can interact with regulatory proteins and components of the
        transcriptional machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b19">19</xref>], arguing that H2A.Z may regulate gene expression through interactions
        with such downstream effectors.</p>
      <p>Although H2A.Z has been previously shown to be enriched at the <italic>GAL1, PHO5,</italic>
        and <italic>PUR5</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b22">22</xref>], the fact that
        H2A.Z globally associates to defined promoter regions of inactive genes is surprising since
        previous studies had suggested that even though H2A.Z was generally enriched in euchromatic
        regions, there did not appear to be any correlation between deposition of the variant
        histone and promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b30">30</xref>]. However, we note that in those
        cases where H2A.Z was found more enriched in the ORF as compared to the promoter, the genes
        were highly transcribed housekeeping genes (e.g.,<italic>ACT1</italic> and
        <italic>ADH1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b30">30</xref>]. Recent
        studies have clearly established that the promoters of such highly active genes are rather
        depleted of nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b46">46</xref>], and
        thus the apparent low enrichment of H2A.Z at those promoters could actually reflect low
        nucleosome occupancy. In support of this conclusion, we find that H2B levels are
        significantly reduced at the <italic>ACT1</italic> promoter, while the H2A.Z/H2B ratio shows
        a slight enrichment in the promoter region (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>C). Because housekeeping genes are by definition transcribed
        in most, if not all, conditions, and since we found that H2A.Z is present at promoters of
        genes when they are inactive, we favor a model where H2A.Z would be more important for the
        regulation of nonhousekeeping genes that are generally repressed when grown in rich medium
        but are strongly induced under specific growth conditions (e.g.,<italic>GAL</italic> genes
        upon galactose induction, etc.). It is interesting to note that this last possibility is in
        line with published evidence regarding the role of H2A.Z in higher organisms. For example,
        H2A.Z is not significantly expressed in the nondifferentiated inner cell mass tissue of the
        mouse embryo, whereas it is highly expressed in the differentiating tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, H2A.Z is required
        for the proper development of <italic>Xenopus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b13">13</xref>]. These observations may be taken to suggest
        that H2A.Z is only required when a particular gene expression program is engaged in an
        organism and not so much for gene expression that pertains to basic cellular metabolisms.
        Since H2A.Z has been shown to be abundantly associated with heterochromatin in higher
        eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b28">28</xref>]—which is much more preponderant in metazoans as compared to
        yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b54">54</xref>]—it remains to be determined whether
        or not the variant histone plays additional functions linked to this localization in
        metazoans. It is worth emphasizing, however, that this colocalization of H2A.Z with metazoan
        heterochromatin does not exclude the possibility that it may also be associated with the
        promoter regions of inactive genes as we have shown with yeast. This possibility is
        currently under investigation.</p>
      <p>Our genome-wide location assay has revealed that—as opposed to what is observed
        at other genes—H2A.Z occupies wider regions that spread out well beyond the
        promoter region and into the ORF, at HZAD genes. As previously suggested by Meneghini et al.
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b24">24</xref>], it is
        conceivable that H2A.Z has a dual role in gene expression, the first being that of poising
        genes for transcription initiation in euchromatin, and the second being that of protecting
        euchromatin from silencing. We propose that at most inactive genes where H2A.Z has a sharp
        promoter-binding pattern, H2A.Z will simply be incorporated into specific repressive
        nucleosomes that need to be remodeled quickly prior to gene induction, whereas at HZAD
        genes, H2A.Z would create nucleated domains that are refractory to gene silencing by
        heterochromatin. Alternatively to this scenario, it is possible that the broad distribution
        of H2A.Z at HZAD genes reflects unstable positioning of variant histone-bearing nucleosomes,
        perhaps due to a chromatin structure that is less well organized at those genes. This last
        possibility, however, is less likely since examination of the nucleosome positioning data
        from Yuan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b37">37</xref>]
        reveals that nucleosomes are well positioned over the Chromosome III-contained HZAD genes.
        Nevertheless, it is likely that the specific chromatin structure exemplified by this unusual
        localization of H2A.Z renders the HZAD genes more sensitive to Sir2 silencing.</p>
      <p>Our observations that H2A.Z is also important in regulating nucleosome positioning, in
        particular at the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, may account for a mechanism by which H2A.Z
        regulates transcription. We had previously observed that absence of H2A.Z prevents RNA
        polymerase II and TBP from being efficiently recruited to the <italic>GAL1</italic>
        promoter, whereas the Gal4 activator was efficiently recruited to the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b19">19</xref>]. In addition to these findings,
        recent experiments from our laboratory have shown that Mediator, SAGA, and Swi/Snf also
        cannot be efficiently recruited to <italic>GAL1</italic> in the absence of the variant
        histone (K. Lemieux and L. Gaudreau, unpublished data). We thus propose that improper
        positioning of at least one nucleosome over the <italic>GAL1</italic> transcription start
        site may be sufficient to severely impair the recruitment of the entire transcriptional
        machinery to the gene. Our results also emphasize the fact that chromatin architecture is
        exquisitely regulated, and even subtle changes in its structure may trigger transcription
        defects. A similar situation was recently reported with bromodomain factor 1 (Bdf1) and
        histone H4-tail acetylation at the <italic>PHO5</italic> gene. It was reported that a shift
        of 2–3 bp of a positioned nucleosome at a <italic>PHO5-lacZ</italic> reporter
        construct resulted in a defect in <italic>PHO5</italic> induction in the absence of Bdf1 and
        H4-acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b55">55</xref>].
        This is of particular significance since Bdf1 is a component of Swr1.com that loads H2A.Z
        into chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b30">30</xref>]. It is conceivable that
        deletion of <italic>BDF1</italic> prevents loading of H2A.Z into chromatin, and therefore
        the Bdf1-related defect would be owed to improper loading of H2A.Z at the
        <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter. Alternatively, it is conceivable that Bdf1 could be a
        downstream target of H2A.Z and important in mediating its function in nucleosome
        positioning. These possibilities are currently under investigation. Finally, we point out
        that our data do not exclude the possibility that H2A.Z could also be important in
        transcription elongation since the latter histone variant has been shown to interact
        genetically with the TFIIS elongation factor in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b30">30</xref>] and since it appears to be replaced by H2A
        downstream of the <italic>c-myc</italic> promoter region during elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b23">23</xref>].</p>

        <title>DNA microarrays</title>
        <p>The microarrays used for location analysis were purchased from Agilent Technologies (Palo
          Alto, California, United States). The microarrays contain a total of 44,290 60-mer probes
          (including 2,306 controls), covering the entire genome (except for repetitive regions) for
          an average density of one probe every 270 bp (±100 bp) within the probed
          regions. The greatest distance between the end of one probe and the beginning of the next
          is 540 bp, and 97% of the probes are within 350 bp of another one. The probes
          were mapped to the genome (UCSC) using BLAST. More than 99.9% of the probes
          mapped to a single locus, whereas 370 probes (&lt;0.1%) had multiple BLAST
          outputs and were mapped accordingly. These microarrays were previously used to map histone

        <p>Labeling was done as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030384-b58">58</xref>]. Briefly, the immunoprecipitated DNA
          fragments were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated to unidirectional linkers. The
          DNA was then amplified by LM-PCR in the presence of aminoallyl-modified dUTP. The labeling
          was carried out post-PCR using monoreactive Cy-dye NHS esters that react specifically with
          the aminoallyl-modified dUTP. Hybridization was performed as described in Pokholok et al.

            previous literature provides the actual size of the domain occupied by the protein on
            DNA (e.g., TFIIB) can be used to estimate the actual domain of an unknown protein (e.g.,
            H2A.Z). Data from the control protein are used to estimate the amount of DNA that is
            added due to the limit of the resolution of the ChIP assay. This “resolution
            addition” is removed from the “observed” domain of the
            tested protein to generate its “actual” domain.</p>

          <title>Z Loci Are Wider around Telomeres</title>
          <p>(A) Graphical representation of the width index calculation.</p>
          <p>In order to look at the spread of the H2A.Z domains across chromosomes we have
            calculated an index estimating the relative width of these domains. The width index (i)
            is defined as <italic>x/y,</italic> where <italic>x</italic> is the width observed at
            ½ <italic>y, y</italic> being the height at the maximum of the H2A.Z smooth
            occupancy curve. The width is divided by the height in order to normalize for the fact
            that higher peaks will necessarily take more space to reach baseline and will therefore
            look like wider domains than would small peaks.</p>
          <p>In order to avoid “contamination” by overlapping peaks, maxima
            localized within less than 1.5 KB from one another were not considered in the analysis.</p>
          <p>(B) The width trend was determined by computing a sliding median of the width index
            (see A) across all yeast genes ordered by their distance from the chromosomal end and
            plotted against that distance.</p>
