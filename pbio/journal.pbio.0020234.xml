				<article-title>Retrovirus Integration into the Human Genome</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The completion of the human genome sequence has made possible genome-wide studies of retroviral DNA integration. Here we report an analysis of 3,127 integration site sequences from human cells. We compared retroviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV), and murine leukemia virus (MLV). Effects of gene activity on integration targeting were assessed by transcriptional profiling of infected cells. Integration by HIV vectors, analyzed in two primary cell types and several cell lines, strongly favored active genes. An analysis of the effects of tissue-specific transcription showed that it resulted in tissue-specific integration targeting by HIV, though the effect was quantitatively modest. Chromosomal regions rich in expressed genes were favored for HIV integration, but these regions were found to be interleaved with unfavorable regions at CpG islands. MLV vectors showed a strong bias in favor of integration near transcription start sites, as reported previously. ASLV vectors showed only a weak preference for active genes and no preference for transcription start regions. Thus, each of the three retroviruses studied showed unique integration site preferences, suggesting that virus-specific binding of integration complexes to chromatin features likely guides site selection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Retroviral replication requires reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome and integration of the resulting DNA copy into a chromosome of the host cell. A topic of long standing interest has been the chromosomal and nuclear features dictating the location of integration target sites (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Coffin1">Coffin et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Bushman2">Bushman 2001</xref>). Integration site selection has also gained increased interest because of its importance for human gene therapy. Retroviral vectors have been used extensively to deliver therapeutic genes carried in retroviral backbones. However, retroviral integration can take place at many locations in the genome, on occasion resulting in insertional activation of oncogenes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Coffin1">Coffin et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Bushman2">Bushman 2001</xref>). Recently, two patients undergoing gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency developed leukemia-like illnesses associated with integration of a therapeutic retroviral vector in or near the LMO2 proto-oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Check1">Check 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Hacein-Bey-Abina1">Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2003</xref>). Insertional activation of oncogenes by retroviral vectors has also been detected in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Li1">Li et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>With the availability of the complete human genome sequence, large-scale sequence-based surveys of integration sites have become possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Laufs1">Laufs et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. (2002)</xref> investigated targeting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HIV-based vectors in a human lymphoid cell line (SupT1) and found that genes were favored integration targets. Global analysis of transcription in SupT1 cells showed that active genes were favored for integration, particularly those that were active after infection with the HIV-based vector. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. (2003)</xref> examined targeting of murine leukemia virus (MLV) in human HeLa cells and found that MLV does not strongly favor integration in transcription units, but rather favors integration near sequences encoding mRNA 5′ ends. Here we contrast integration targeting by three retroviruses, avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV), HIV, and MLV, taking advantage of 1,462 new integration site sequences and matched transcriptional profiling data. We find that ASLV does not favor integration near transcription start sites, nor does it strongly favor active genes. For HIV, we find that active genes are favored for integration in two primary cell types, extending findings from previous studies of transformed cell lines. Cell-type-specific transcription was found to result in cell-type-specific biases in integration site placement. We also reanalyzed the MLV data from Burgess and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>) in parallel, confirming that MLV integration is favored near transcription start sites. Thus it appears that each retrovirus studied to date has a unique pattern of integration site selection within the human genome, suggesting that there may be local recognition of chromosomal features unique to each virus.</p>

        <title>Integration Site Datasets Used in this Study</title>
        <p>The origins of the 3,127 integration sites studied are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020234-t001">Table 1</xref>. All were generated by acute infection of cells with retroviruses or with viruses generated from retroviral vectors. To isolate integration sites, DNA from infected cells was isolated, cleaved with restriction enzymes, then ligated to DNA linkers. Integration sites were amplified using one primer that bound to the viral DNA end and another that bound the linker, then amplification products were cloned and sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>). Integration sites were mapped on the draft human genome sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020234-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and local features at integration sites quantified.</p>

        <p>Three integration site datasets were newly determined in this study. Integration by an ASLV vector was analyzed in 293T-TVA cells, which are human 293T cells engineered to express the subgroup A avian retrovirus receptor. Integration by an HIV-based vector was characterized in two types of primary human cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and IMR90 lung fibroblasts. Several previously described datasets were also subjected to further analysis in parallel—HIV integration sites in three transformed cell lines (SupT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>], H9, and HeLa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>]) and MLV integration sites in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>The use of restriction enzymes to cleave cellular DNA during the cloning of integration sites could potentially introduce a bias in favor of isolating integration events closer to restriction sites. Previous work suggested that integration site surveys were not strongly biased. In one study, an experimental control based on integration in vitro indicated that the cloning and analytical methods used did not detectably bias the conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>). In addition, HIV integration sites cloned by different methods showed a similar preference for active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Carteau1">Carteau et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>), including sites isolated using several different restriction enzymes to cleave cellular DNA prior to linker ligation, and isolation using inverse PCR instead of ligation-mediated PCR.</p>
        <p>In this study we have added a computational method to address possible biased isolation. Each integration site was paired with ten sites in the human genome randomly selected in silico that were constrained to be the same distance from a restriction site of the type used for cloning as the experimentally determined integration site. Statistical tests were then carried out by comparing each experimentally determined integration site to the ten matched random control sites. In this way any bias due to the placement of restriction sites in the human genome was accounted for in the statistical analysis. All the collections of integration sites were analyzed in this manner, including data previously published in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>). However, direct analysis of the distribution of integration sites without this correction yielded generally similar conclusions, suggesting that restriction site placement did not introduce a strong bias. A detailed description of the statistical analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref> (p. 2).</p>

      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>Integration in Transcription Units</title>
        <p>For HIV the frequency of integration in transcription units ranged from 75% to 80%, while the frequency for MLV was 61% and for ASLV was 57%. For comparison, about 45% of the human genome is composed of transcription units (using the Acembly gene definition). Analysis using the different catalogs of human genes suggests that somewhat different fractions of the human genome are transcribed, and new information indicates that an unexpectedly large fraction of the human genome may be transcribed into noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Cawley1">Cawley et al. 2004</xref>). However, for comparisons using any catalog of the human genes, the rate of integration in human transcription units determined experimentally was substantially higher than in the matched random control sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>, p. 3–11).</p>
        <p>We next assessed the placement of integration sites within genes and intergenic regions. A previous study revealed that integration by MLV is favored near transcription start sites, but no such bias was seen for HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>). We investigated this issue for ASLV and reanalyzed all of the available data by comparison to the matched random control dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020234-g002">Figure 2</xref>). For sites within genes, MLV showed a highly significant bias in favor of integration near transcription start sites (<italic>p</italic> = 1.4 × 10<sup>−14</sup>). No such bias was seen for ASLV (<italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05). For the HIV datasets, two of the four sets showed modest bias (HIV/PBMC, <italic>p =</italic> 0.0007; HIV/H9 and HeLa combined, <italic>p =</italic> 0.027). For HIV, the observed statistical significance was sensitive to the details of analytical approach used and is of questionable biological importance. Thus, ASLV and HIV do not strongly favor integration at transcription start sites as was seen with MLV.</p>

            <p>Genes or intergenic regions were normalized to a common length and then divided into ten intervals to allow comparison. The number of integration sites in each interval was divided by the number of matched random control sites and the value plotted.

        <title>Effects of Transcriptional Activity on Integration</title>
        <p>Transcriptional profiling analysis was carried out in some of the cell types studied, allowing the influence of transcriptional activity on integration site selection to be assessed. Transcriptional profiling was carried out on infected cells so that the data reflected the known influence of infection on cellular gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Corbeil1">Corbeil et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Mitchell1">Mitchell et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-van1">van 't Wout et al. 2003</xref>). Prior to isolating RNA for microarray analysis, the SupT1, PBMC, and IMR90 cells were each infected with the HIV-based vector used for HIV integration site isolation. The 293T-TVA cells were infected with the RCAS ASLV vector prior to RNA isolation. RNA samples were harvested 24–48 h after infection. For analysis of MLV and HIV integration sites in HeLa cells, published transcriptional profiling data from uninfected cells were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Tian1">Tian et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
        <p>The median expression level (average difference value) of genes hosting integration events was consistently higher than the median of all genes assayed on the microarrays. The ratios (targeted genes/all genes assayed) for HIV ranged from 1.6 to 3.0, indicating that integration targeting in human primary cells (PBMC and IMR90) favored active genes, as shown previously for transformed cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>). For MLV and ASLV the ratios were each 1.3, lower than for HIV but still greater than the chip average. The analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020234-g003">Figure 3</xref> reveals that the association of integration sites with gene activity was statistically significant for all the HIV datasets.

        <title>Tissue-Specific Transcription Results in Tissue-Specific Biases in HIV Integration Site Selection</title>
        <p>We next investigated the effects of cell-type-specific transcription on integration site selection. For this analysis we used only the three HIV integration site datasets for which we had transcriptional profiling data from infected cells (i. e., SupT1, PBMC, and IMR90), to allow us to control for the effects of infection on transcription. Pairwise comparisons of the microarray datasets for the three cell types showed that the correlation coefficients ranged only from 0.64 to 0.79, indicating that transcriptional activity indeed differed among cell types. We reasoned that since active transcription favors integration, then the genes targeted by integration should on average be more highly expressed in the cell type that hosted the integration event than in either of the other two. Statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020234-g004">Figure 4</xref>) showed that transcription of targeted genes was higher on average in the cell type hosting the integration event than in either of the other two tested (all comparisons attain <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05 using the Chi-square test for linear trend in proportions).

EST sequences from many tissues were used to build up the map of transcriptional activity, thus focusing the analysis on transcriptional patterns common to many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Caron1">Caron et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Mungall1">Mungall et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Versteeg1">Versteeg et al. 2003</xref>).

        <p>Statistical analysis was carried out comparing integration frequencies to (1) gene density or (2) transcriptional intensity, as measured by the EST counts. All analyses incorporated a comparison to the matched random control set of integration sites. Each type of vector showed a significant positive correlation with gene density (HIV, <italic>p =</italic> 1.8 × 10<sup>−12</sup> to 3.2 × 10<sup>−38</sup>, depending on the dataset; MLV, <italic>p =</italic> 2.4 × 10<sup>−22</sup>; ASLV, <italic>p =</italic> 3.2 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) and a stronger association with transcriptional intensity (HIV, <italic>p =</italic> 3.8 × 10<sup>−19</sup> to 9.7 × 10<sup>−46</sup>; MLV, <italic>p =</italic> 5.1 × 10<sup>−35</sup>; ASLV, <italic>p =</italic> 1.7 × 10<sup>−11</sup>). Overall, ASLV showed the weakest association with gene density and transcriptional intensity.</p>
        <p>Thus, the analysis of transcriptional activity in the context of chromosomal location revealed significant effects of transcription on MLV and ASLV integration. This is in contrast to the study based on transcriptional profiling alone, in which the effect was not statistically significant—however, a similar trend was evident and the general conclusions similar (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020234-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

        <title>Substructures within Chromosomal Regions Favorable for Integration</title>
        <p>Two lines of evidence indicated that the chromosomal regions favorable for integration can be subdivided into favorable and unfavorable segments. In the first study, a computational analysis was carried out to determine the length of the chromosomal segments yielding the best fit between transcriptional intensity and integration intensity. The sizes of the chromosomal regions analyzed were varied systematically from 25 kb to 32,000 kb, and the statistical significance determined for the correlations. This analysis revealed that the segment length yielding the best correlation was comparatively short, around 100–250 kb, the length of one or a few human genes. These conclusions held for HIV, ASLV, and MLV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>, p. 16–65).</p>
        <p>An analysis of integration frequency near CpG islands also indicated substructure within regions favorable for integration. CpG islands are chromosomal regions enriched in the rare CpG dinucleotide. These regions commonly correspond to gene regulatory regions containing clustered transcription factor binding sites—consequently, CpG islands are more frequent in gene-rich regions. Previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. (2003)</xref> reported that CpG islands were positively associated with MLV integration sites but that for HIV integration sites there was no influence. An analysis of the effects of proximity to CpG islands on integration frequency incorporating the matched random control dataset is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020234-g006">Figure 6</xref>. The relative integration frequency near CpG islands was found to be much higher than expected by chance for MLV, as reported previously, and slightly higher than expected by chance for ASLV. For HIV, the region surrounding CpG islands was actually disfavored, and this was statistically significant in three out of four datasets. Thus for HIV, broadly favorable gene-dense chromosomal regions actually contain a mixture of favorable clusters of active genes and unfavorable CpG islands. For MLV, in contrast, CpG islands are quite favorable.</p>

            <p>The viral vectors and cell types studied are indicated by color. A value of one indicates no bias, less than one indicates disfavored integration, and more than one indicates favored integration. The x-axis (from plus or minus 1 kb to 50 kb) indicates distance from the edge of a CpG island in either direction along the genome. The statistical analysis specifically removed the favorable effects of being in a gene and being in a region containing expressed genes to highlight the effects of CpG islands alone. When effects of gene density and activity are left in, HIV integration goes from disfavored at short distances (less than 1 kb) to favored at longer distances (more than 10 kb). This is because at longer distances the association with genes is significant—many CpG islands are within 10 kb of a gene, and genes are favored targets for HIV integration. To carry out this analysis, the numbers of experimentally determined and matched control sites were fitted according to whether they were near a CpG island, whether they were in genes, and the level of the expression density variable. Each variable contributes a “multiplier” for the ratio of the number of experimental to control sites. The multiplier for “near CpG island” is shown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd002">see Protocol S2</xref>, p. 9–12).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report that ASLV, MLV, and HIV have quite different preferences for integration sites in the human chromosomes. HIV strongly favors active genes in primary cells as well as in transformed cell lines. MLV favors integration near transcription start regions and favors active genes only weakly. ASLV shows the weakest bias toward integration in active genes and no favoring of integration near transcription start sites. We expect that these same patterns will be seen for MLV and ASLV integration in different human cell types, because all four HIV datasets yielded similar results, though more data on additional cell and tissue types will be helpful to further evaluate the generality.</p>
      <p>One of the earliest models for chromosomal influences on integration targeting proposed that condensed chromatin in inactive regions disfavored integration, thereby concentrating integration in more open active chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Panet1">Panet and Cedar 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Vijaya1">Vijaya et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Rohdewohld1">Rohdewohld et al. 1987</xref>). Integration by HIV, ASLV, and MLV all showed at least a weak bias in favor of integration in active genes, consistent with the idea that open chromatin at active genes favors integration. Also consistent with this idea, heterochromatic regions at human centromeres and telomeres were found to disfavor integration.</p>
      <p>However, it seems unlikely that relative accessibility is the only feature directing integration site selection, because HIV, ASLV, and MLV each show such distinctive target sequence preferences. Studies of the Ty retrotransposons of yeast, close relatives of retroviruses, have revealed that interactions with bound chromosomal proteins can tether the Ty integration machinery to chromosomes and thereby direct integration to nearby sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Boeke1">Boeke and Devine 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Bushman3">Bushman 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Sandmeyer1">Sandmeyer 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Zhu1">Zhu et al. 2003</xref>). Such a model may explain integration targeting by retroviruses as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Bushman3">Bushman 2003</xref>). HIV integration complexes might bind to factors enriched at active genes, while MLV complexes could bind to factors bound near transcription start sites. In support of this idea, in vitro studies have established that retroviral integrase enzymes fused to sequence-specific DNA-binding domains can direct integration preferentially to local regions when tethered at specific DNA sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Bushman1">Bushman 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Goulaouic1">Goulaouic and Chow 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Katz1">Katz et al. 1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>The analysis of chromosomal regions favored for integration also suggested a role for locally bound proteins. Chromosomal regions enriched in active genes were generally favorable, but further analysis revealed interleaved favorable and unfavorable regions. Statistical tests indicated that favorable regions were typically short (100–250 kb), and for HIV these were interspersed with unfavorable regions near CpG islands. CpG islands are thought to be regulatory regions that bind distinctive sets of transcription factors. Thus, a simple model to explain targeting is that a distinctive set of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins bound at or near CpG islands disfavor HIV integration, while proteins bound in active transcription units are favorable. For MLV, the proteins bound at CpG islands instead favor integration.</p>
      <p>For ASLV, it is possible that the viral integration machinery does not interact with factors bound in or near genes, explaining the more random distribution of integration sites in the genome. Such a pattern might have evolved to minimize disruption to the host cell chromosomes due to integration. Another possibility, however, is that ASLV does have stricter target site preferences during normal integration in chicken cells, but the targeting system does not function properly in the human cells studied here. According to this idea, putative chicken chromosomal proteins normally bind ASLV integration complexes and direct integration, but the homologous human proteins may be too different to interact properly. It should be possible to investigate this possibility by characterizing ASLV integration in chicken cells, now that the draft chicken genome sequence is completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Ren1">Ren et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>One consequence of the above findings is that integration will differ from tissue to tissue as a consequence of cell-type-specific transcription. To assess effects of tissue-specific transcription, we analyzed HIV integration in three different cell types (SupT1, PBMC, and IMR90). Transcriptional profiling data showed that transcription was significantly different among the three. This allowed an analysis of integration targeting, which showed that highly expressed genes particular to each tissue were favored for integration in that tissue. However, the magnitude of the tissue-specific biases on integration were modest, probably because most of the cellular transcriptional program appears to be common among cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Caron1">Caron et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Mungall1">Mungall et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Versteeg1">Versteeg et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Additional mechanisms could also contribute to targeting. For example, we and others have detected statistically significant biases in integration frequency in whole chromosomes that do not appear to be fully explained by gene density or gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Laufs1">Laufs et al. 2003</xref>; data reported here). Perhaps the intranuclear position of chromosomes may have an influence, since this has been proposed to be relatively fixed for cells of specific types but may differ among cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Boyle1">Boyle et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Chubb1">Chubb and Bickmore 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our data indicate that ASLV has integration site preferences that may make it attractive as a vector for human gene therapy. MLV-based vectors have the unfavorable preference for integration near transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>). The adverse events arising during X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency gene therapy involved integration of an MLV vector near the transcription start region of the LMO2 proto-oncogene. HIV-based vectors strongly favor integration in active genes, which is also likely to be disruptive to the host cell genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>). ASLV, in contrast, shows only weak favoring of integration in active genes, and no favoring of integration near transcription start sites. A quantitative model based on gene density, expression, and proximity to transcription start regions fit the ASLV data least well, indicating that ASLV has the weakest bias toward integration in these unfavorable locations. ASLV vectors are known to infect a variety of human cell types (e. g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Valsesia-Wittmann1">Valsesia-Wittmann et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Federspiel1">Federspiel and Hughes 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Hatziioannou1">Hatziioannou and Goff 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Katz2">Katz et al. 2002</xref>) and can transduce nondividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Hatziioannou1">Hatziioannou and Goff 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Katz2">Katz et al. 2002</xref>), adding to their possible utility. More generally, this study, together with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>), indicates that the selection of different retroviral integration systems can modulate the selection of integration target sites, and this may potentially be exploited for safer gene therapy.</p>

          <title>Preparation of the ASLV- and HIV-based vectors</title>
          <p>To produce HIV vector particles, 293T cells were cotransfected with three plasmids: one encoding the HIV vector segment (p156RRLsinPPTCMVGFPWPRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Follenzi1">Follenzi et al. 2000</xref>), the second, the packaging construct (pCMVdeltaR9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Naldini1">Naldini et al. 1996</xref>), and the third, the gene for <italic>VSV-G</italic> (pMD.G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Naldini1">Naldini et al. 1996</xref>). Forty-eight hours after transfection, supernatants were collected, centrifuged to pellet cellular debris, then filtered through 0.45-μm filters. Viral particles were further purified by centrifugation at 23,000g and resuspended in 1/17 volume of fresh medium. ASLV particles were generated by transfecting the DF-1 chicken embryonic fibroblast cell line (ATCC CRL-12203) with the plasmid RCASBP(A)GFP (from Steve Hughes, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland). Supernatant was removed from the cells 4 d post transfection (when cells were nearly 100% GFP positive) and filtered though a 0.45-μm syringe filter.</p>

          <title>Infections.</title>
          <p>PBMCs were separated from human blood using a ficoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> PHA, IL-2 prestimulated PBMCs, or IMR-90 cells (passage #36) at 30%–50% confluency (1–2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were infected with the HIV-based vector at an moi of 10 (60 ng p24 per 5 × 10 <sup>5</sup> cells). The vector was added to the cells with DEAE-dextran at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Forty-eight hours after infection, the cells were pelleted. For RNA isolation, cells were resuspended in 250 μl of PBS and 750 μl of TRIzol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. To determine the extent of infection, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. For ASLV, supernatant containing RCASBP(A)GFP particles was added to 293T-TVA cells (293T 0.8 cells; a gift from John Young, Salk Institute) at 30%–50% confluency. Forty-eight hours post infection, green fluorescence was seen in approximately 30% of the cells, as determined by examination of the cultures with a fluorescence microscope. DNA was harvested at this point (DNeasy, Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States). RNA from infected cells was also isolated at 48 h post infection (TRIzol) and stored at −80 °C until used for transcriptional profiling analysis. RNA was isolated from infected cell cultures, and samples from each were used for hybridization on one Affymetrix (Santa Clara, California, United States) microarray.</p>

          <p>HIV integration sites were cloned by ligation-mediated PCR essentially as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Schroder1">Schroder et al. (2002)</xref>. ASLV integration site determination using ligation-mediated PCR was carried out essentially as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020234-Wu1">Wu et al. (2003)</xref>. Oligonucleotides used are summarized above. All novel integration site sequences are deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (accession numbers CL528318–CL529767). Integration sites from earlier studies were reanalyzed on the November 2002 freeze of the human genome sequence (using the University of California at Santa Cruz browser), and a few were excluded because they did not find matches of sufficiently high quality on the new draft sequence, accounting for slightly different numbers than in previous reports. This study used primarily the Acembly and Ensemble human gene catalogs; similar results were generally obtained when the Unigene, RefGene, or GeneScan catalogs of the human genes were used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Protocol S1</xref>, p. 3–10).</p>
