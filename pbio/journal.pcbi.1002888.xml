      <abstract>
        <p>Our understanding of most biological systems is in its infancy. Learning their structure and intricacies is fraught with challenges, and often side-stepped in favour of studying the function of different gene products in isolation from their physiological context. Constructing and inferring global mathematical models from experimental data is, however, central to systems biology. Different experimental setups provide different insights into such systems. Here we show how we can combine concepts from Bayesian inference and information theory in order to identify experiments that maximize the information content of the resulting data. This approach allows us to incorporate preliminary information; it is global and not constrained to some local neighbourhood in parameter space and it readily yields information on parameter robustness and confidence. Here we develop the theoretical framework and apply it to a range of exemplary problems that highlight how we can improve experimental investigations into the structure and dynamics of biological systems and their behavior.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>For most biological signalling and regulatory systems we still lack reliable mechanistic models. And where such models exist, e.g. in the form of differential equations, we typically have only rough estimates for the parameters that characterize the biochemical reactions. In order to improve our knowledge of such systems we require better estimates for these parameters and here we show how judicious choice of experiments, based on a combination of simulations and information theoretical analysis, can help us. Our approach builds on the available, frequently rudimentary information, and identifies which experimental set-up provides most additional information about all the parameters, or individual parameters. We will also consider the related but subtly different problem of which experiments need to be performed in order to decrease the uncertainty about the behaviour of the system under altered conditions. We develop the theoretical framework in the necessary detail before illustrating its use and applying it to the repressilator model, the regulation of Hes1 and signal transduction in the Akt pathway.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mathematical models of biomolecular systems are by design and necessity abstractions of a much more complicated reality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Bruggeman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Nurse1">[2]</xref>. In mathematics, and the theoretical sciences more generally, such abstraction is seen primarily as a virtue which allows us to capture the essential features or defining mechanisms underlying the workings of natural systems and processes. But while qualitative agreement between even very simple models and very complex systems is easily achieved, formally assessing whether a given model is indeed good (or even just useful) is notoriously difficult. These difficulties are exacerbated in no small measure for many of the most important and topical research areas in biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Silver1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-DelSol1">[5]</xref>. The regulatory, metabolic and signalling processes involved in cell-fate and other biological decision-making processes are often only indirectly observable; moreover, when studied in isolation their behavior can often be markedly altered compared to the experimentally more challenging <italic>in vivo</italic> contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Liepe1">[6]</xref>. The so-called “inverse problem” — to learn, construct or infer mathematical or mechanistic models from experimental data — is often considered (see e.g. Brenner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Brenner1">[7]</xref>) as one of the major problems facing systems biologists.</p>
      <p>These challenges have prompted the development of novel statistical and inferential tools, required to construct (or improve) mathematical models of such systems. We can loosely group these methods into (i) those aimed at reconstructing network models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Beal1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Lbre1">[10]</xref> (using correlations or statistical dependencies in observed datasets), (ii) methods to estimate (biochemical reaction) rate parameters of models describing the dynamics of biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Mendes1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Kreutz1">[13]</xref>, and (iii) approaches that allow us to rank or discern between different candidate models/hypotheses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Vyshemirsky1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Toni1">[15]</xref>. The first set of challenges is typically faced when dealing with new systems where little information is known, and where network-inference algorithms offer a convenient way of generating novel mechanistic hypotheses from data. Here we address the second point. In particular, we start from a model that describes how the abundances of a set of molecular entities, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, change with time, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; the rate of change in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> over time is typically described in terms of (ordinary, partial or stochastic) differential equation systems,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002888.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-dimensional vector describing the system's state and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-dimensional vector containing the model parameters. Finally, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the particular experimental setup under which data are collected. This dependence is generally tacitly ignored but, as we will show below, explicitly incorporating the experimental approach (and the fact that different experimental choices are typically available) into the model and any down-stream statistical analysis allows us to develop strategies that yield more detailed insights into biological systems, and better models thereof. The aims of the present study are to develop experimental design strategies that allow us to infer the (unknown or only poorly known) model parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and to reduce the uncertainty in the predicted model behavior.</p>
      <p>Inferential tools have been developed that, given some observed biological data and a suitable mathematical candidate model, provide us with parameters that best describe the system's dynamics. Unfortunately obtaining reliable parameter estimates for dynamical systems is plagued with difficulties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Gutenkunst1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Erguler1">[17]</xref>. Usually sparse and notoriously noisy data are fitted using models with large number of parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Wilkinson1">[18]</xref>. As a result, over-parameterized models tend to fit to the noisy data but may loose confidence in predictive behavior. Conventional fitting approaches to such data routinely fail to capture this complexity by underestimating the uncertainty in the estimated parameters, which substantially increases the uncertainty in prediction of model behavior.</p>
      <p>We use <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to denote the total set of available experimental assays that could be used to probe a system in a given situation. These might, for example, include knock-out or knock-down mutants, transcriptomic or proteomic assays, different time-courses or different environmental conditions (or both), etc. Here we remain very flexible as to which type of experimental setup is included in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but merely acknowledge that it is rarely possible to probe all important aspects of a system simultaneously. Instead different techniques require different sample preparations etc , and therefore separate experiments. Here we account also for the possibility, that for two different experimental set-ups, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the mathematical model may differ; therefore the dependence on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is made explicit in our notation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For example, if species <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is knocked out in experiment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we can ignore any terms referring to it when modelling <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
      <p>Performing different experiments is costly, however, in terms of both money and time, and not all experiments are equally informative. Ideally we would like to perform only those experiments which yield <italic>substantial</italic> and <italic>relevant</italic> information. We regard any information that decreases our uncertainty about model parameters or model predictions as <italic>relevant</italic>. As we will show below, what is <italic>substantial</italic> information is then easily and naturally resolved. We will show, for example, that experimental interventions differ in the amount of information they provide e.g. about model parameters. Equally some experiments provide insights that are more useful for making predictions about system behavior than others. It may seem surprising that we consider parameter inference and prediction of output separately, but this merely reflects the fact that not all parameters contribute equally to system output: varying some parameters will have huge impact on the output, while varying other parameters will lead to negligible changes in the output. By making the reduction in uncertainty of predicted model behavior the target of experimental design we explicitly acknowledge this.</p>
      <p>Experimental design in systems biology is different from classical experimental design studies. The latter theory was first developed at a time when the number of alternative hypotheses was smaller than the amount of available data and replicates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Cox1">[19]</xref>. Systems biology, on the other hand is hypotheses rich and data rarely suffice to decide clearly in favour of one model unambiguously. Moreover for dynamical systems, as a host of recent studies have demonstrated, generally less than half of the parameters are tightly confined by experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Gutenkunst1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Erguler1">[17]</xref>. Together these two challenges have given rise to a number of approaches aimed at improving our ability to develop mechanistic models of such systems. Here we meld concepts from Bayesian inference and information theory to guide experimental investigations into biological systems to arrive at better parameter estimates and better model predictions.</p>
      <p>Several authors have used the information theoretical framework, in particular the expected gain in Shannon information to assess the information content of an experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Lindley1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Bernardo1">[24]</xref>. Although the methodology of Bayesian experimental design is well established, its applicability has been computationally limited to small models involving only several free parameters. Recently their use for systems biology becomes possible as a result of increased computational resources. Vanlier <italic>et. al</italic> proposed an approach that uses the Bayesian predictive distribution to asses the predictive power of experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Vanlier1">[25]</xref>. Huan and Marzouk used a framework, which is similar to ours, in that it maximizes mutual information via Monte Carlo approximation to find optimal experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Huan1">[26]</xref>; but they only focus on parameter inference and ignore prediction. Furthermore they only apply their method to systems with small number of parameters. Here we demonstrate how such an approach can be utilized to analyse multi-parameter models described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) regarding both, parameter inference and prediction of system behavior. The latter is especially useful when one aims to predict the outcome of an experiment which is too laborious or impossible to perform. Our approach improves on previous methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Vanlier1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Vanlier2">[32]</xref> in a number of ways: first we are able to incorporate but do not require preliminary experimental data; second, it is a global approach that is not limited to some neighbourhood in parameter space unlike approaches solely based on e.g. the Fisher information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Chu1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Komorowski1">[33]</xref>; third, we obtain comprehensive statistical predictions (including confidence, sensitivity and robustness assessments if desired); and we are very flexible in the type of information that we seek to optimize.</p>
      <p>Below we first develop the theoretical concepts before demonstrating the use (and usefulness) of the Bayesian experimental design approach in the context of a number of biological systems that exemplify the set of problems encountered in practice. In order to demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach we investigate two simple models (repressilator and Hes1 systems), as well as a complex signalling pathway (AKT) with experimentally measured dynamics.</p>

        <title>Information content of experimental data</title>
        <p>To achieve their full functionality mathematical models require parameter values that generally need to be inferred from experimental data. The extraction of this information is, however, a nontrivial task and is further compounded by the need to assess the statistical confidence of parameter estimates. In the Bayesian framework for example, we seek to evaluate the conditional probability distribution, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which relates to the prior knowledge <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the distribution of data, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, given parameters, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, via Bayes' formula<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002888.e024"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e024" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>The posterior probability density function, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, describes the probability of finding a parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the volume element <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of parameter space, given the data, the model and the prior information. From this distribution we can obtain all relevant information about the parameters: how sensitive the solution is to varying them individually or together; how correlated different parameters are with one another; if there are non-linear dependencies among the parameters; and the level of precision with which each parameter is known in light of the data. A highly readable and enlightening account of the Bayesian formalism is given e.g. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-MacKay1">[34]</xref>. Finding the posterior, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is usually achieved by means of powerful (if costly) computational algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, which also exist in the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Toni1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Marjoram1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Sisson1">[36]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Rather than providing a single parameter estimate the posterior distribution allows us to assess how well a parameter is constrained by data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002888-g001">Figure 1 A</xref>). More formally, we measure the uncertainty about a parameter information-theoretically in terms of the Shannon entropy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Shannon1">[37]</xref>,<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002888.e029"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e029" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>for the prior and<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002888.e030"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e030" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>for the posterior. The information gained by collecting data <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can then be expressed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The parameters which explain the output of all the three experiments are at the intersection of the three ellipsoids. (B) Flowchart of the experimental design method. Given a mathematical model of the biological system, a set of experiments and the target information —which can be either a set of parameters to infer or a description of the experiment to predict — the Bayesian Experimental Design method determine the experiment to carry out. Once the experiment has been performed, the experimental data are then used to provide target information and to improve the model. Thereafter, the process can be iterated to select other experiments in order to improve the accuracy of the target information.

        <p>Given the importance of the predictive role of mathematical modelling it is also of interest to reduce the uncertainty of model predictions; intriguingly and perhaps counterintuitively — but demonstrably and provably (see below and <italic>Supplementary Material</italic>) — better parameter estimates are not necessarily required for better, more certain model predictions. Therefore, instead of focussing on parameter inference we can directly seek to identify the experimental condition <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which minimizes the uncertainty in the predicted trajectories <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The suggested 4 experiments are hypothetical, but can be linked to potential experiments. For example, a decrease in the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponds to a decrease of the basal transcription rate, which could be achieved with inhibitors or site-directed mutation of the corresponding transcription factor binding site. The proposed modifications can lead to different dynamics, and this in turn can lead to a higher mutual information between the parameters and the resulting mRNA and protein trajectories, which are here the output of the system. The information content increases as differences in the outputs resulting from different parameter values increase. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002888.s001">Figure S1</xref>, we illustrate the link between the increase in mutual information and the dynamics of the system for three different regimes.</p>

        <p>This can again be further substantiated by simulations. We perform parameter inference based on such simulated data (simulated data are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002888.s005">Figure S5</xref>) and compute the difference between the entropy of the prior and that of the resulting posterior distribution. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002888-g004">Figure 4 C</xref> are consistent with the predictions based on mutual information: mRNA measurements carry more information for parameter inference. Interestingly, however, although the mutual information computation indicates that the protein measurements should contain more information about parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> than about the other parameters, this is not confirmed by the difference in entropy result for this simulated data set.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF, red triangle) is a stimulus for a signalling cascade, which results in the phosphorylation (green circle) of Akt (blue square) and S6 (purple square). EGF binds to the EGF membrane receptor EGFR (orange), which is generated from a pro-EGFR. The Binding results in the phosphorylation of the receptor, which consequently leads to the activation of downstream cascades (thick black circle).

        <p>To obtain better predictions we can use data from other experiments measuring the time course of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> species of interest for a experimentally more straightforward input signals chosen from among <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> possible stimuli: impulse, step or ramp stimuli with different EGF concentrations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002888-g006">Figure 6</xref>). To determine which of those inputs would result in the most reliable predictions we compute the mutual information between the time courses for the different potential experimental inputs and the time-course of the target <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-impulse noisy stimulus. We incorporate initial information about model parameters by computing the mutual information based on the posterior distribution inferred above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002888-g006">Figure 6 C</xref> shows that a step stimulus of intensity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ng/ml has the highest mutual information and therefore reduces the uncertainty of the predicted behavior of our target stimulus pattern.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002888-g006">Figure 6 D</xref> we show that this does indeed yield much improved predictions compared to the initial prediction. This reduction in uncertainty about predicted model behaviour results from the difference in the posterior distributions obtained under different stimulus regimes; by focussing on predictive ability we focus implicitly on data that is informative about those parameters that will affect the system behaviour most under the target (5-pulse) stimulus. The posterior distributions are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002888-g006">Figure 6 E</xref> for two parameters, the EGFR turn over and the EGFR initial concentration, which appear to be essential for the prediction of the evolution of Akt/S6 phosphorylation patterns under the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-pulse stimulus. Those two parameters were not inferred using the initial dataset alone, whereas the addition of the outcome of the step stimulus experiment suggested by our methods infers these parameters at the required precision.</p>
        <p>This ability to predict the time courses extends to much greater signal distortion and even with a noise level of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> percent of the signal intensity we find that our experimental design method yields similar improvements in the predictions. This additional analysis of the new input signal is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002888.s010">Figure S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002888.s011">S11</xref>. We observe that the direct target (EGFR receptor) as well as activated AKT (pAKT) efficiently filter out the noise but capture the 5 pulses; EGFR activation quickly returns to base level in response to the higher frequency background noise. This indicates that there might be a constant low concentration of activated EGFR (pEGFR), but the activation of S6 has very different characteristics and is far less robust to noise. The level of noise is amplified as can be observed in the pS6 time course. This might suggest that the downstream molecule pS6 has a longer time delay to react to a signal. Moreover, pS6 does not have time to relax to its baseline between the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> pulses, which leads to incremental signal amplification. This behavior fits with the low-pass filter characteristics previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Fujita1">[45]</xref>. In further support earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Toyoshima1">[46]</xref> found that a downstream molecule can be more sensitive to an upstream activator than the direct target molecule of the activator. This might explain that the activation of EGFR and AKT is more robust to noise than the downstream molecule, S6.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have found that maximizing the mutual information between our target information — here either model parameter values or predictions of system behaviour — and the (simulated) output of potentially available experiments offers a means of arriving at optimally informative experiments. The experiments that are chosen from a set of candidates are always those that add most to existing knowledge: they are, in fact, the experiments that most challenge our current understanding of a system.</p>
      <p>This framework has a number of advantages: First, we can simulate cheaply any experimental set-up that can in principle be implemented; second, using simulations allows us to propagate the model dynamics and to quantify rigorously the amount of (relevant) information that is generated by any given experimental design; third, our information measure gives us a means of meaningfully comparing different designs; finally, our approach can be used to design experiments sequentially — our preferred route as this will enable us to update iteratively our knowledge of a system along the way — or in parallel, i.e. selecting more than one experiment. Previous approaches had taken a more local approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Vanlier1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Chu1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Bandara1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Hengl1">[47]</xref> that relied on initial parameter guesses and often data; our approach also readily incorporates different stimulus patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Apgar2">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we have focussed on designing experiments that increase our ability to estimate model parameters and to predict model behaviour. The latter depends on model parameters in a very subtle way: not all parameters affect system output equally and under all conditions. Target conditions could, for example, include clinical settings which are generally not experimentally amenable (at least in early stage research); here the current approach offers a rationale for designing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Barnes1">[49]</xref> therapeutic interventions into complex systems based on investigations of suitable model systems. In this study we provide an approach to chose the optimal experiment out of a finite and discrete set of possible experiments. Experimental design with a continuous set of experiments requires a different approach, as for example shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Bazil2">[50]</xref>.</p>
      <p>With an optimal design we can overcome the problems of sloppy parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Gutenkunst1">[16]</xref> (which are, of course, dependent on the experimental intervention chosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Erguler1">[17]</xref>) and can narrow down the posterior probability intervals of parameters. We would like to reiterate, however, the importance of considering joint distributions rather than merely the marginal probabilities of (or the confidence regions associated with) individual parameters: parameters of dynamical systems tend to show high levels of correlation (i.e. we can vary them simultaneously in a way that does not affect the output of the system — at least in some areas of parameter space) and their posterior probability distributions often deviate from normality (which also motivated the use of information theoretical measures which can deal with non-linearities and non-Gaussian probability distributions).</p>
      <p>We tested and applied our approach in three different contexts: while the repressilator serves as a toy model with hypothetical data and experiments, the Hes1 transcription regulatory system and the EGF induced Akt pathway are relevant biological systems. The question to answer in the Hes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> system, which molecular species to measure, is a common question in laboratories. The presented study of the Akt system does not only demonstrate how to chose experiments for prediction of system behaviours, but it is also an example for stimulus design.</p>
      <p>The approach we presented here yields the potential for model discrimination or checking the target of our analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Apgar2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Mlykti1">[51]</xref>, and, for example, choose experimental designs that maximize our ability to distinguish between competing alternative hypotheses or models. All of this is straightforwardly reconciled in the Bayesian framework, which also naturally lends itself to such iterative procedures where “today's posterior” is “tomorrow's prior” and models are understood increasingly better as new, more informative data are systematically being generated.</p>

        <title>Reducing uncertainty in model parameters</title>
        <p>We first consider the task of choosing an experiment that will on average provide most information about model parameters measured through the reduction in their respective uncertainties. In the information theoretic language, as by Lindley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Lindley1">[20]</xref> and later by Sebastiani and Wynn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Sebastiani1">[52]</xref> the initial (prior) uncertainty is given by the entropy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the prior distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which after data <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> have been collected (in experimental setup <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) gives rise to the entropy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the posterior distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The information gained about the parameter by collecting the data <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. On average, however, the decrease of uncertainty about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e209" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> after data are collected in an experiment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e210" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e211" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, in order to reduce parameters' uncertainties one should choose an experiment that maximizes the mutual information between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e212" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e213" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>Here we specifically consider models such that the output is of the form<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002888.e214"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e214" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e215" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a deterministic function and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e216" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> an uncorrelated, zero mean, gaussian random variable with variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e217" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (our approach is readily extended to stochastic systems). In such a model maximization of mutual information <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e218" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is equivalent to maximization of the entropy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e219" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This observation described first in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002888-Sebastiani1">[52]</xref> results directly from the fact that the mutual information <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e220" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be written as the difference between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e221" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and that<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002888.e223"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>does not depend on the experiment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Indeed, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002888.e214">Equation (9)</xref> implies that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the probability of the experimental noise <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore maximization of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e227" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is equivalent to maximization of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, this is only the case for the mutual information between the ouput <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e229" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of an experiment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e230" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the parameter of the system <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e231" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Whenever we are interested in the increase of information about only one component of the parameter vector, or in reducing uncertainty about an experimental outcome we need to use the mutual information and not the entropy.</p>

The mutual information <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002888.e342" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depends on the dynamics of the system given the prior of the system parameters: the more the dynamics for different parameter values differ from each other, the higher is the information content. To visualize this we compute the mutual information between one parameter and the outcome of the system for three different regimes in the repressilator example.
