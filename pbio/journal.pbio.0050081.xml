        <p>Many genes are recruited to the nuclear periphery upon transcriptional activation. The mechanism and functional significance of this recruitment is unclear. We find that recruitment of the yeast <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> genes to the nuclear periphery is rapid and independent of transcription. Surprisingly, these genes remain at the periphery for generations after they are repressed. Localization at the nuclear periphery serves as a form of memory of recent transcriptional activation, promoting reactivation. Previously expressed <italic>GAL1</italic> at the nuclear periphery is activated much more rapidly than long-term repressed <italic>GAL1</italic> in the nucleoplasm, even after six generations of repression. Localization of <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery is necessary and sufficient to promote more rapid activation. This form of transcriptional memory is chromatin based; the histone variant H2A.Z is incorporated into nucleosomes within the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter and is specifically required for rapid reactivation of both <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic>. Furthermore, H2A.Z is required to retain <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery after repression. Therefore, H2A.Z-mediated localization of recently repressed genes at the nuclear periphery represents an epigenetic state that confers memory of transcriptional activation and promotes reactivation.</p>

          <p>Eukaryotic cells control the spatial arrangement of chromosomes; the localization of genes can both reflect and contribute to their transcriptional state. A number of genes in the simple eukaryote brewer's yeast are “recruited” to the nuclear periphery through interactions with the nuclear pore complex when they are expressed. The functional significance of peripheral recruitment is unclear.</p>
          <p>Here, we show that recruited genes are actively retained at the periphery for generations after transcription is repressed. This suggests that localization at the nuclear periphery represents a novel inherited state that might allow simple eukaryotic organisms to “remember” previous transcriptional activation. This type of memory allows for more robust reactivation of genes, suggesting that it is adaptive. Finally, both retention at the nuclear periphery and rapid reactivation require a variant form of histone H2A.</p>
          <p>Adaptive memory is distinct from other types of transcriptional memory. In developmental memory, transcriptional states established by transcriptional regulators early in embryogenesis are propagated long after these regulators have disappeared. Adaptive memory does not propagate a state, but represents a novel state that serves as a source of information. In this way, it resembles a rudimentary form of cellular learning that allows cells to benefit from recent experience.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The subnuclear localization of DNA has important roles in regulating transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b002">2</xref>]. In particular, localization of chromatin near the nuclear periphery has well-documented effects on transcription. Heterochromatin and developmentally repressed genes localize at the nuclear periphery in metazoan cells, and peripheral localization promotes silencing of telomeres and the mating type loci in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b005">5</xref>]. Conversely, recent studies have shown that certain genes are conditionally recruited to the nuclear periphery when transcriptionally activated in both yeast and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b013">13</xref>]. The yeast genes <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> distribute randomly within the nucleoplasm under repressing conditions, but become co-localized with the nuclear periphery upon activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b007">7</xref>]. Live-cell four-dimensional imaging experiments reveal that recruitment is associated with both a change in the subnuclear distribution of genes and a reduction in their mobility, resulting in constrained movement near the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b014">14</xref>]. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that these and many other transcriptionally active genes physically interact with components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and associated factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b007">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>The mechanism and functional significance of peripheral localization is unclear. Interaction of <italic>GAL1</italic> with the nucleoporin Nup2 requires the Gal4 activator, but does not require the SAGA histone acetylase complex, and is not affected by inactivation of RNA polymerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b013">13</xref>]. Thus, the association with the NPC and, presumably, recruitment of these genes to the nuclear periphery are regulated upstream of TBP binding and transcription. Furthermore, artificial tethering at the nuclear periphery promotes transcriptional activation of the <italic>INO1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>] and the <italic>HXK1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b008">8</xref>], and is sufficient to activate certain reporter genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b011">11</xref>]. Thus, recruitment to the nuclear periphery appears to have a functional role in promoting transcriptional activation.</p>
      <p>In contrast, recruitment of genes to the nuclear periphery has also been suggested to reflect coupling between transcription and mRNA export. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies suggest that the interaction of mating pheromone–induced genes with the NPC is mediated by the mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b012">12</xref>]. Likewise, recruitment of <italic>HXK1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> to the nuclear periphery is affected by sequences in the 3′ UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b015">15</xref>], and recruitment of <italic>GAL1</italic> requires proteins that have been implicated in mRNA export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b009">9</xref>]. These results raise the possibility that recruitment of genes to the nuclear periphery might simply be the product of physical interactions between nascent transcripts, the mRNA export machinery, and the NPC.</p>
      <p>Using a quantitative chromatin localization assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>], we find that the transcriptional activation of both <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> genes in yeast is biphasic, with the mRNA levels increasing dramatically after gene recruitment is complete. RNA polymerase II activity was not required for peripheral recruitment of <italic>INO1</italic>. Furthermore, when cells were shifted from activating to repressing conditions, <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> remained localized at the nuclear periphery for generations. We find that localization at the periphery defines a distinct, heritable state that marks recently repressed genes and promotes reactivation. The reactivation of <italic>GAL1</italic> was more rapid in cells that had previously activated the gene, even after six generations of repression. The rate of activation of <italic>INO1</italic> was accelerated when the gene was artificially tethered to the nuclear envelope and was delayed in a mutant blocked for gene recruitment.</p>
      <p>Epigenetic mechanisms of transcriptional memory are employed extensively during metazoan development to stably propagate transcriptional states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b016">16</xref>]. Such memory can be mediated by DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b017">17</xref>], by histone H3 acetylation and methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b019">19</xref>] or by incorporation of variant histone H3.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b020">20</xref>]. We find that the histone variant H2A.Z was specifically required for reactivation of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1,</italic> but had no role in the activation of the long-term repressed states of these genes. H2A.Z associated with nucleosomes in the promoter of the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> gene, but not in the promoter of either activated or long-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic>. Finally, we find that H2A.Z is essential for retention of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery. These results identify a new form of chromatin-based transcriptional memory and highlight an important role for H2A.Z in regulating subnuclear localization to mark recently repressed genes and promote their reactivation.</p>

        <title>Rapid Gene Recruitment to the Nuclear Periphery upon Transcriptional Activation</title>
        <p>To determine whether gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery requires transcription, we used a chromatin localization assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>]. This is a quantitative assay for localization of genes at the nuclear periphery based on a system developed by Belmont, Murray, and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b022">22</xref>]. An array of 128 lac repressor–binding sites is targeted for integration to a location in the yeast genome by homologous recombination. The array can then be localized as a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled spot in cells expressing the lac repressor tagged with GFP (Lac I-GFP). Cells within a population are individually analyzed by confocal microscopy and scored as either peripheral, if the Lac I-GFP co-localizes with the nuclear envelope (marked by the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope membrane protein Sec63-myc), or nucleoplasmic, if the Lac I-GFP does not co-localize with the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The <italic>URA3</italic> gene, which distributes randomly within the nucleus, co-localizes with Sec63-myc in 27%–30% of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). This represents the baseline for this assay (indicated with a hatched blue line in all relevant figures in this work; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>]). When the <italic>INO1</italic> gene is artificially tethered to the nuclear envelope, we observe peripheral localization in 81% ± 7% of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>]. Therefore, the dynamic range of the chromatin localization assay is between 25% and 80%. For this reason, data from chromatin localization experiments were plotted on an axis from 20%–80%. The repressed <italic>INO1</italic> gene distributes randomly, co-localizing with the nuclear envelope in 31% ± 1% of cells in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, +inositol; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>]). The activated <italic>INO1</italic> gene is recruited to the nuclear periphery, co-localizing with the nuclear envelope in 60% ± 5% of cells in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, −inositol; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>]).</p>

            <p>(A) Left: merged confocal micrographs of cells stained for Lac I-GFP (green) and Sec63-myc (red), and scored as peripheral or nucleoplasmic. Right: cells having the lac repressor array integrated either at <italic>URA3</italic> (strain JBY409) or <italic>INO1</italic> (JBY397) were grown in the presence or absence of inositol, and scored for peripheral localization as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>]. Data are averages of multiple replicates (indicated as N) from independent cultures. Each replicate represents 30–50 cells. The hatched blue line represents the baseline level of peripheral localization for the <italic>URA3</italic> gene.</p>
            <p>(B) At the indicated times after removal of inositol, cells were scored for peripheral localization of <italic>INO1</italic> (filled circles, extrapolated to 300 min [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050081-sg001">Figure S1</xref>]; two replicates of 30–50 cells). Also, <italic>INO1</italic> mRNA abundance was quantified using RT Q-PCR and expressed relative to <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA (open circles; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b058">58</xref>]). Left panel: both datasets plotted on a linear scale. Right panel: the mRNA abundance was plotted on a logarithmic scale, and the localization was plotted on a linear scale.</p>
            <p>(C) The localization of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene (two replicates of 30–50 cells) and the <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA abundance were quantified in strain DBY32 and plotted as in (B).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We used the chromatin localization assay to compare the change in the peripheral localization of <italic>INO1</italic> with the change in transcription after shifting cells from repressing to activating conditions. We quantified the levels of <italic>INO1</italic> mRNA relative to <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA by reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR (RT Q-PCR). After shifting cells into medium lacking inositol, <italic>INO1</italic> mRNA levels increased slowly for the first 2.5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, left panel). The mRNA levels then increased more rapidly over the next several hours and reached steady state after 5–6 h (unpublished data). Recruitment of <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear periphery was rapid. The fraction of cells in which <italic>INO1</italic> localized to the nuclear periphery increased approximately 10% in the first 5 min after shifting cells to the activating condition and was complete after 60 min. Therefore, <italic>INO1</italic> recruitment to the periphery occurred prior to the rapid accumulation of mRNA. However, plotting the data on a logarithmic scale revealed that there was a substantial fold increase in the concentration of the mRNA during this time, consistent with the possibility that mRNA production might lead to recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, right panel). We conclude that (1) <italic>INO1</italic> was activated quickly, resulting in an approximately 50-fold increase in the mRNA level over the first 45 min, (2) recruitment of <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear periphery correlated with this early increase, and (3) the maximal rate of <italic>INO1</italic> mRNA accumulation occurred after relocalization was complete.</p>
        <p>We next adapted the chromatin localization assay to compare the localization and transcriptional activation of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene, which is repressed in cells grown in glucose and expressed in cells grown in galactose. We integrated the lac repressor–binding site array downstream of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene and quantified its co-localization with the nuclear envelope as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>A. Repressed <italic>GAL1</italic> localized at the nuclear periphery in 35% ± 1% (five replicates of 30–50 cells) of cells, and activated <italic>GAL1</italic> localized at the nuclear periphery in 70% ± 2.5% (three replicates of 30–50 cells) of cells (unpublished data). When cells were shifted from glucose to galactose, <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA levels increased slowly for the first 60 min and then more rapidly, reaching steady state after approximately 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Like <italic>INO1, GAL1</italic> was recruited to the nuclear periphery rapidly, increasing approximately 15% in the first 5 min after shifting cells to galactose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Peripheral localization increased to 56% ± 2% after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) and continued to increase to 70% over the next 2 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050081-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

Likewise, in cells shifted from galactose to glucose, the <italic>GAL1</italic> mRNA levels dropped rapidly, with no lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).

This persistent localization at the nuclear periphery suggested that these genes are actively retained. The rapid relocalization of both genes upon shifting cells to activating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g001">Figure 1</xref>) indicates that they are capable of rapidly changing their distribution. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient of repressed <italic>GAL1</italic> is approximately 0.18 μm<sup>2</sup>/min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b009">9</xref>].

        <p>To rule out the possibility that the localization of <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear periphery after repressing transcription was due to very low levels of transcription, we analyzed the localization of <italic>INO1</italic> after inactivating a temperature-sensitive version of RNA polymerase II. RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription is blocked within 5 min after shifting <italic>rpb1–1</italic> mutant cells to the non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050081-sg002">Figure S2</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b025">25</xref>]). We grew <italic>rpb1–1</italic> cells in the absence of inositol to activate <italic>INO1</italic> expression, and then shifted the cells to the non-permissive temperature and quantified the localization of <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear periphery over time. After 30 min at the non-permissive temperature, the <italic>INO1</italic> gene remained localized to the nuclear periphery in 60% ± 3% of the cells, despite a 5-fold decrease in <italic>INO1</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050081-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). Therefore, ongoing transcription is not required to maintain <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery.</p>
        <p>To test if transcription is required to establish <italic>INO1</italic> recruitment, we inactivated RNA polymerase II for 15 min before shifting cells into the activating condition. This treatment completely blocked <italic>INO1</italic> activation, resulting in an approximately 420-fold difference in the levels of <italic>INO1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050081-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). In the absence of RNA polymerase II function, the <italic>INO1</italic> gene was still recruited rapidly to the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). These results indicate that transcription is not required for either the establishment or maintenance of gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery. This conclusion is consistent with studies of the interaction of the nucleoporin Nup2 with the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b013">13</xref>].</p>

        <p>We next tested if the lingering localization of <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> at the nuclear periphery was inherited. We quantified the peripheral localization of both <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> in cells that had repressed transcription through several cell divisions. Cells were maintained in logarithmic growth by continual dilution, and their doubling time was approximately 110 min. The <italic>INO1</italic> gene remained localized at the nuclear periphery in more than 50% of the cells after 6 h of repression and then returned to a random distribution after 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Therefore, localization of <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery was maintained through at least three to four cell divisions. The retention of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene was even more stable, remaining localized at the nuclear periphery in more than 60% of cells after 12 h of repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). This suggests that <italic>GAL1</italic> is maintained at the nuclear periphery indefinitely in logarithmically growing cells.

Therefore, the localization of <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> at the nuclear periphery is stably maintained after repressing transcription and is inherited by subsequent generations, suggesting that it represents an epigenetic state.</p>

        <p>Our data suggest that there are two different forms of repressed <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic>. Whereas <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> that have been repressed for many generations distribute randomly within the nucleus, recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> localize at the nuclear periphery. Therefore, peripheral localization distinguishes between recently repressed and long-term repressed states. This raised the possibility that localization might function as an epigenetic marker to allow cells to “remember” recent transcription of these genes, potentially affecting their rate of reactivation. To test this idea, we compared the rate of transcriptional activation of long-term repressed and short-term repressed <italic>GAL1</italic>. The rate of reactivation of <italic>GAL1</italic> in cells in which the gene had been repressed for 12 h (six to seven generations) was much more rapid than in cells grown continuously in glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Thus, in a culture in which only approximately 1% of the cells have previously experienced galactose, the reactivation of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene is enhanced.</p>
        <p>We next compared the rate of activation of long-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> to the rate of reactivation of short-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> after 3 h of repression (∼1.5 generations). In contrast to <italic>GAL1,</italic> the reactivation of the <italic>INO1</italic> gene after 3 h of repression was delayed compared with activation of the long-term repressed gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). However, this rate of reactivation was clearly enhanced by the localization at the nuclear periphery. Nup2, a component of the nuclear pore complex that physically associates with transcriptionally active genes such as <italic>GAL1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b013">13</xref>], is required for recruitment of both <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> to the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Mutants lacking Nup2 exhibited a delay in the reactivation of <italic>INO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), suggesting that recruitment to the nuclear periphery promotes more rapid reactivation.</p>

        <p>To determine if recruitment to the nuclear periphery is sufficient to promote activation, we compared the activation of <italic>INO1</italic> that was artificially tethered to the nuclear envelope to untethered <italic>INO1</italic>. The lac repressor array was integrated beside <italic>INO1</italic> in strains expressing either the wild-type Lac I-GFP (untethered <italic>INO1</italic>) or a modified version possessing an FFAT motif to target the protein to the nuclear envelope (tethered <italic>INO1;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b026">26</xref>]). Expressing this form of the lac repressor results in efficient targeting of the <italic>INO1</italic> gene to the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b006">6</xref>]. Tethering the <italic>INO1</italic> gene to the nuclear envelope had no effect on steady-state levels of <italic>INO1</italic> mRNA under activating or repressing conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050081-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). However, tethered <italic>INO1</italic> was activated more rapidly than untethered <italic>INO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Therefore, localization at the nuclear periphery enhances the rate of reactivation of <italic>INO1</italic>.</p>
        <p>If so, then why is the rate of reactivation of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> slower than the rate of activation of long-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic>? This difference is likely due to differences in the physiology of cells grown continuously in the presence of inositol and cells to which inositol has recently been added. Activation of <italic>INO1</italic> is regulated by the concentration of phosphatidic acid, a lipid precursor of phosphatidylinositol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b027">27</xref>]. Phosphatidic acid consumption is stimulated by both exogenous inositol and the action of the Ino1 enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b027">27</xref>]. After repressing <italic>INO1</italic> transcription, the Ino1 enzyme in the cells will continue to produce inositol, driving a higher flux through the pathway and depleting phosphatidic acid. We think this may explain the longer lag phase in the reactivation experiment, which represents the time required for phosphatidic acid to accumulate to levels that activate transcription. This feedback, combined with the shorter duration of the memory phenomenon for the <italic>INO1</italic> gene, complicates a direct comparison between the rate of activation between the short- and long-term repressed states of <italic>INO1</italic>.</p>

        <p>To explore the molecular nature of the difference between short-term and long-term repressed <italic>INO1,</italic> we asked if remaining at the nuclear periphery after repression affects the chromatin state of the gene. Because nucleosome remodeling is important for both <italic>INO1</italic> activation and repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b032">32</xref>], we compared the positioning of nucleosomes within the short-term repressed and long-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter. Permeablized cells were treated with micrococcal nuclease for various times to digest unprotected DNA (Materials and Methods). As an internal control for nucleosome protection, we used a known, well-positioned nucleosome within the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (GAL NB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g005">Figure 5</xref>A; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b033">33</xref>]) and an adjacent, non-nucleosomal sequence (GAL I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Using Q-PCR to define the concentration of these two sequences in our digestion, we observed protection of the nucleosomal sequence relative to the non-nucleosomal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, left panel). Furthermore, after 15 min and 30 min of digestion, we observed the production of clear mononucleosome and dinucleosome bands, indicating that nucleosomes were providing protection from the nuclease and that linker DNA had been digested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, right panel, arrows). Previous studies have established that relative nucleosomal protection is observable over a large range of digestion and with or without gel purification of mononucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b034">34</xref>]. Therefore, we used Q-PCR and a set of 27 different primer pairs to amplify overlapping 80–100 base pair fragments from the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050081-st001">Table S1</xref>). The concentration of each of the templates for these 27 primer pairs was quantified after 30 min of digestion. The protection of each template was calculated relative to the GAL NB sequence. Using this method, we identified one well-positioned nucleosome within the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter and one at the junction between the promoter and the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Comparison between short-term and long-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> revealed no significant change in the positioning of these nucleosomes. However, we did observe a decrease in the relative protection provided by these two nucleosomes in the short-term repressed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). This difference resulted in a 2-fold decrease in the protection at these two sites relative to the GAL NB site. This difference may reflect either an increase in the fraction of cells in the population in which these nucleosomes are absent, or a change in the stability of these nucleosomes in the lysates subjected to nuclease digestion.</p>

Loss of H2A.Z led to a strong delay in the rate of reactivation of both short-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> and short-term repressed <italic>GAL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g006">6</xref>E).

These results suggest that H2A.Z plays an important and specific role in the reactivation of these genes. H2A.Z is exchanged for H2A within intact nucleosomes by the SWR1 ATPase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b042">42</xref>]. To test if SWR1 plays a role in the H2A.Z-dependent reactivation of <italic>INO1,</italic> we next tested the effect of loss of SWR1 on <italic>INO1</italic> activation and reactivation.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results show that the recruitment of genes to the nuclear periphery is a rapid, active process that is independent of transcription. The most robust transcription of the <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>INO1</italic> genes occurred after these genes had fully relocalized to the nuclear periphery, suggesting that recruitment to this subnuclear environment allows optimal expression of these genes. Furthermore, both genes remained at the periphery for generations after repressing transcription, suggesting that cells can inherit localization information. Retention of the <italic>INO1</italic> gene and optimal reactivation of both <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> required the histone variant H2A.Z, which associated with nucleosomes within the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter. Thus, cells have both molecular and cellular sources of memory of past transcriptional activation, and they are able to pass on this information to their progeny. This type of memory is mediated by local changes in chromatin structure that mark recently repressed genes to alter their transcriptional potential and localization, and perhaps to provide a mechanism for inheritance.</p>
      <p>What is the functional significance of this epigenetic memory? In the case of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene, the recently repressed state is reactivated much more rapidly than the long-term repressed state, which presumably confers an adaptive advantage upon cells that have previously grown in galactose. We do not see this for <italic>INO1,</italic> perhaps because physiological differences between recently repressed and long-term repressed cells complicates the comparison of the rate of <italic>INO1</italic> activation and reactivation. However, we can conclude that (1) there are two distinct states of repressed <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1,</italic> distinguishable by their localization, their transcriptional histories, and the molecular requirements for activation, (2) localization of <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery is necessary and sufficient to promote more rapid activation, and (3) incorporation of H2A.Z is the molecular mechanism of transcriptional memory, retaining <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery and promoting reactivation of both <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic>.</p>
      <p>Histone variant H2A.Z is enriched in pairs of nucleosomes within the promoters of repressed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b038">38</xref>]. The histone appears to play an important role in the loss of nucleosomes from promoters upon their activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b037">37</xref>]. This observation, coupled with the fact that H2A.Z nucleosomes are less tightly bound to DNA than H2A nucleosomes, suggests that H2A.Z nucleosomes promote activation by being more easily removed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b037">37</xref>]. We find that H2A.Z deposition and function can depend on the transcriptional history of the promoter into which it is incorporated. H2A.Z is required for rapid reactivation of short-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> and for retention of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery. It is possible that these results represent an indirect effect of loss of H2A.Z. However, we think H2A.Z most likely plays a direct role in promoting the reactivation of <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> because (1) loss of H2A.Z (and SWR1) affects reactivation of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic>, but not the activation of long-term repressed <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL,1</italic> and (2) H2A.Z physically associates with the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter. Therefore, we have identified a new and novel role for this histone variant: H2A.Z can serve as a molecular identifier of recently repressed genes to promote their retention at the nuclear periphery and their rapid reactivation.</p>
      <p>Our current model for the mechanism of gene recruitment and transcriptional memory is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050081-g008">Figure 8</xref>. In response to signals that regulate transcriptional activation, genes physically interact with the nuclear pore complex via the mobile nucleoporin Nup2. Recruitment to the nuclear periphery allows access to the optimal subnuclear environment for transcription and, potentially, for mRNA export. After transcription is repressed, previous transcriptional activation of genes such as <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> is remembered through retention in this optimal environment. Localization at the nuclear periphery is epigenetically inherited and requires incorporation of histone variant H2A.Z. Finally, the reactivation of <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> is optimized by both localization at the periphery and through more rapid loss of H2A.Z nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b037">37</xref>].</p>

          <p>The long-term repressed state of <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> localizes randomly within the nucleoplasm and is activated slowly. Upon activation, these genes are recruited to the nuclear periphery through interaction with NPC-associated Nup2, with full transcriptional activation following recruitment. Upon repression, <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> remain at the nuclear periphery. Specific incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z into the recently repressed promoter mediates retention at the nuclear periphery and rapid reactivation.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>What is the role of DNA localization in promoting transcriptional memory? Our data suggest two possible models for how peripheral localization affects H2A.Z-mediated transcriptional memory. In the first model, H2A.Z incorporation into promoter nucleosomes is promoted by Nup2-mediated gene recruitment to the nuclear periphery, and functions to promote reactivation by altering the rate of nucleosome loss or local histone modifications. This model is consistent with several observations in the literature. Tethering of Nup2 to DNA promotes “boundary activity,” insulating euchromatin from the spread of heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b044">44</xref>]. Intriguingly, one of the most dramatic phenotypes of mutants lacking either Nup2 or H2A.Z is the spread of silenced heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b045">45</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that tethering genes to the nuclear periphery through Nup2 leads to the incorporation of H2A.Z nucleosomes, which functions as a boundary. Furthermore, it is possible that boundary elements normally associate with the NPC. We find that H2A.Z is involved in both the activation of recently repressed genes and their retention at the nuclear periphery. Thus, a second model for the importance of H2A.Z is that H2A.Z nucleosomes promote reactivation of recently repressed genes by retaining them in the optimal environment for transcriptional activation. These models are not mutually exclusive, and we favor the possibility that H2A.Z incorporation is promoted by localization and that, once incorporated, H2A.Z affects localization.</p>
      <p>Transcriptional memory is employed extensively during development in multi-cellular organisms. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Hox gene expression throughout development is determined early in embryogenesis by transcriptional regulators that control segmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b046">46</xref>]. The initial expression states defined by the segmentation genes are maintained by the action of either polycomb group proteins (generally repressive) or trithorax group proteins (generally activating) through a number of chromatin-based mechanisms such as nucleosome positioning and histone modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b047">47</xref>]. Similarly, the variant histone H3.3 is incorporated selectively into transcriptionally active parts of the genome, which may promote the epigenetic maintenance of an activated state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b048">48</xref>]. Like these forms of transcriptional memory, the transcriptional memory described here is mediated by chromatin-based changes that mark recently repressed genes and distinguish them from long-term repressed genes. However, unlike these forms of memory, which serve to maintain a previously established transcriptional state, the transcriptional memory described here serves an informational role, revealing previous transcriptional activity and altering the transcriptional potential of previously expressed genes.</p>
      <p>Previous work has hinted that transcriptional activity of <italic>GAL1</italic> can alter the degree of methylation of histone H3, marking the chromatin for hours after repressing transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b019">19</xref>]. However, in this case, the mark was lost after cell division. Our data suggest that the past experiences of microbial organisms can affect their cellular organization and their physiology for many generations. The efficiency of inheritance of the memory state was different for the two genes we examined, suggesting that there are different timing mechanisms for each. In the case of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene, after exposure to galactose, logarithmically growing cells appeared to undergo an indefinite switch to the recently repressed state. It will be fascinating to determine if there are conditions or stimuli that can reset the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene to the long-term repressed state. In contrast, the transcriptional memory of <italic>INO1</italic> activation was relatively short lived. The previous transcriptional state of <italic>INO1</italic> is imprinted in its chromatin and its subnuclear localization for 6 h or more (two to three cell doublings), but this information is eventually lost.</p>
      <p>Why do cells optimize reactivation of genes? We speculate that rapid reactivation of certain genes confers an adaptive, and therefore an evolutionary, advantage to cells. This might be particularly important in the case of stress-responsive genes such as <italic>INO1</italic> or genes involved in metabolizing non-glucose hexose sugars. Also, epigenetic mechanisms may be useful in allowing cells to alter their transcriptional output rapidly under highly variable environmental conditions or under physiological circumstances in which they rapidly undergo reversible changes in physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b049">49</xref>]. It will be interesting to see if this mechanism is also operative in metazoan organisms, perhaps to establish epigenetically “primed” states for dynamically regulated genes in response to transient physiological or environmental cues.</p>

To create the plasmid p6LacO128-GAL1 to mark the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene with the lac repressor–binding site array, the 3′ end of the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene, and downstream sequences were amplified by PCR using the following primers (5′ to 3′): GAL1up, GTTCAAACCGCAGTTGAAGG and GAL1down, CCGAAAGATCTTCTCTATGGGG. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the TOPO4 vector (Invitrogen). This was then cloned into p6LacO128 as a SpeI fragment. The plasmid was integrated downstream of <italic>GAL1</italic> by digestion with NruI.</p>
        <p>Plasmid pRS304-Sec63-myc was created by amplifying <italic>SEC63-13myc</italic> from JBY397 genomic DNA using the following primers (5′ to 3′): SEC63up: GTATTTCGGAGAGGGGGC; Pringledown: ACTATACCTGAGAAAGCAACCTGACCTACA. The resulting PCR product was TOPO cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The insert was then cloned into pRS304 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b052">52</xref>] as a NotI-KpnI fragment. The plasmid was digested with NheI to target integration at <italic>SEC63</italic>.</p>
        <p>Unless noted otherwise, all experiments were performed on cells grown in synthetic complete medium at 30 °C. For experiments involving <italic>INO1,</italic> cells were grown in medium lacking inositol or supplemented with 100 μM <italic>myo</italic>-inositol. For experiments involving <italic>GAL1,</italic> cells were grown in media with either 2% glucose or 2% galactose.</p>

        <title>RT-QPCR.</title>
        <p>RNA was prepared as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b054">54</xref>]. A total of 2–4 μg of DNAse-treated total RNA was reverse transcribed using 5 μM Oligo dT and 20 units of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 1 h. The reaction was diluted 5-fold, and 1/20th was used for Q-PCR. The sequences of the primers used for real-time PCR were (5′ to 3′): INO1CDS F, TAGTTACCGACAAGTGCACGTACAA; INO1CDS R TAGTCTTGAACAGTGGGCGTTACAT; ACT1CDS F, GGTTATTGATAACGGTTCTGGTATG; ACT1CDS R, ATGATACCTTGGTGTCTTGGTCTAC; GAL1CDS F, GTTCGATTTGCCGTTGGACGG; GAL1CDS R, GGCAAACCTTTCCGGTGCAAG. The relative concentration of cDNA templates for both the target gene <italic>(INO1</italic> or <italic>GAL1)</italic> and the control gene <italic>(ACT1)</italic> were calculated for each sample using standard curves for each primer set that were defined by linear regression analysis of Ct values using a series of 5-fold dilutions of yeast genomic DNA covering a 3,125-fold range.</p>

        <p>Long-term repressed cells were harvested at an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.8–1.0 from 1 l of SDC + inositol. Short-term repressed cells were grown in 1 l of SDC − inositol to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.7, and inositol was added to 100 μM. After 1 h of repression, cells were harvested by filtration. Cell permeablization and micrococcal nuclease digestion were performed as described, except that DNA was not size selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050081-b055">55</xref>]. Q-PCR analysis on digested DNA was performed using the oligonucleotides listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050081-st001">Table S1</xref>.
