<p>Self-incompatibility enables plants to avoid inbreeding by self-pollination. Here we report that the genetic locus encoding self-pollen recognition has evolved twice in the Brassicaceae family, challenging the notion that loss of self-incompatibility is irreversible.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Self-incompatibility (SI) is the flowering plant reproductive system in which self pollen tube growth is inhibited, thereby preventing self-fertilization. SI has evolved independently in several different flowering plant lineages. In all Brassicaceae species in which the molecular basis of SI has been investigated in detail, the product of the <italic>S-locus receptor kinase</italic> (<italic>SRK</italic>) gene functions as receptor in the initial step of the self pollen-rejection pathway, while that of the <italic>S-locus cysteine-rich</italic> (<italic>SCR</italic>) gene functions as ligand. Here we examine the hypothesis that the <italic>S</italic> locus in the Brassicaceae genus Leavenworthia is paralogous with the <italic>S</italic> locus previously characterized in other members of the family. We also test the hypothesis that self-compatibility in this group is based on disruption of the pollen ligand-producing gene. Sequence analysis of the <italic>S</italic>-locus genes in Leavenworthia, phylogeny of <italic>S</italic> alleles, gene expression patterns, and comparative genomics analyses provide support for both hypotheses. Of special interest are two genes located in a non-<italic>S</italic> locus genomic region of <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> that exhibit domain structures, sequences, and phylogenetic histories similar to those of the <italic>S</italic>-locus genes in Leavenworthia, and that also share synteny with these genes. These <italic>A. lyrata</italic> genes resemble those comprising the <italic>A. lyrata S</italic> locus, but they do not function in self-recognition. Moreover, they appear to belong to a lineage that diverged from the ancestral Brassicaceae <italic>S</italic>-locus genes before allelic diversification at the <italic>S</italic> locus. We hypothesize that there has been neo-functionalization of these <italic>S</italic>-locus-like genes in the Leavenworthia lineage, resulting in evolution of a separate ligand-receptor system of SI. Our results also provide support for theoretical models that predict that the least constrained pathway to the evolution of self-compatibility is one involving loss of pollen gene function.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Self-incompatibility (SI) is a pollen recognition system that enables plants to avoid the inbreeding caused by self-pollination. It involves a pair of tightly linked genes known as the <italic>S</italic> locus. The product of one of these genes acts as the receptor and recognizes the pollen protein produced by the same plant, while the product of the other gene is the pollen protein that is recognized by the receptor. In this study, we have analyzed the gene sequence, genome organization, and gene evolutionary history of <italic>S</italic> loci in members of the Brassicaceae family, which includes plants of the genus Leavenworthia. From our analyses, we conclude that both genes that comprise the ancestral <italic>S</italic> locus in the Brassicaceae were lost in Leavenworthia. We show, however, that plants of this genus possess two other linked genes that exhibit patterns of polymorphism and expression that are characteristic of an <italic>S</italic> locus. These genes occupy the same genomic position in Leavenworthia as do two non-<italic>S</italic>-locus genes in the related species <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>, genes that are not known to function in self-recognition in this species. We suggest that these genes have evolved to assume the function of the pollen recognition system of SI in Leavenworthia—that is, that there has been de novo emergence of a distinct Brassicaceae <italic>S</italic> locus in this genus. We also present evidence that the breakdown of the SI system in two Leavenworthia races is due to independent mutations in the <italic>S</italic>-locus pollen gene, in accordance with theoretical predictions for the spread of <italic>S</italic>-locus disrupting mutations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Self-incompatibility (SI) is a widespread plant reproductive system that prevents inbreeding by facilitating the rejection of self-pollen. It is a major evolutionary feature of the flowering plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Whitehouse1">[1]</xref>. SI is a complex phenotype whose functioning requires co-evolution among several interacting components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-DeNettancourt1">[2]</xref>. It has been proposed that SI evolved several times in the angiosperms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Bateman1">[3]</xref>, a hypothesis supported by molecular investigations that have also helped pinpoint the genes that control pollen specificity, pollen recognition, and the downstream reactions that mediate cessation of pollen tube growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-FranklinTong1">[4]</xref>. The evolutionary loss of SI leading to self-compatibility (SC) and the potential for the shift to self-fertilization is often stated to be irreversible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Igic1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Igic2">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Despite increasing knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie SI, the question remains as to how such a complex system could have evolved independently in many different angiosperm lineages. One answer may lie in the phenomenon of neo-functionalization of genes. It has been noted that the mechanisms that underlie SI share a number of features with another important plant function, namely pathogen recognition and rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Sanabria1">[7]</xref>. Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that evolution can reshuffle and reshape functions through exon recruitment and domain swapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Shapiro1">[8]</xref>, and so it is conceivable that SI could have evolved by co-opting genes with receptor and signaling roles that initially functioned in plant defense. Neo-functionalization of genes has been shown to be most likely when there are strong selection pressures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Lynch1">[9]</xref>. The avoidance of inbreeding and its negative fitness consequences provide one such selective context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Charlesworth1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the sporophytic type of self-incompatibility (SSI), the pollen and stigma SI phenotypes (or “specificities”) are controlled by the diploid genotype of the parent (the sporophyte) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-ShermanBroyles1">[11]</xref>. SSI is known from 10 families of flowering plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Igic3">[12]</xref>. It has been best characterized in the Brassicaceae family. In Arabidopsis and Brassica (and several other closely related Brassicaceae), the SI locus (<italic>S</italic> locus) contains two tightly linked genes that have been shown to be principally responsible for the SI phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-DeNettancourt1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-ShermanBroyles1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Schopfer1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-FobisLoisy1">[14]</xref>. One of these genes, the <italic>S</italic>-locus receptor kinase (<italic>SRK</italic>), produces a transmembrane receptor expressed in the stigma. The extracellular domain of this protein can bind to the secreted protein ligand produced by the other <italic>S</italic>-locus gene, the <italic>S</italic>-locus cysteine-rich gene (<italic>SCR</italic>, also known as <italic>SP11</italic>), which is expressed in the tapetum of anthers, coating pollen with the protein product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Kachroo1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Takayama1">[16]</xref>. When self-pollen recognition occurs, it initiates a signaling cascade that prevents self-pollen hydration and growth of the pollen tube <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Samuel1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Rea1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Though not included in the initial studies of the molecular basis of SSI in the Brassicaceae, the genus Leavenworthia has played an important role in evolutionary studies of plant mating systems. Detailed biosystematic work in the genus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Rollins1">[19]</xref> documenting both inter- and intraspecific variation in the presence/absence of SI in a geographically localized region of the southern United States led to many subsequent investigations that focused especially on the ecology and population genetics of the group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Lloyd1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Busch2">[24]</xref>. More recently, application of molecular genetic tools to the study of Leavenworthia uncovered a locus that co-segregates with the SI reaction, exhibits high levels of polymorphism, forms an allele phylogeny characterized by long terminal branches, and exhibits high effective rates of migration, and trans-specific polymorphism of alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Busch3">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Herman1">[28]</xref>, all expected features for the <italic>S</italic> locus.</p>
<p>The portion of the Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic> locus sequenced in earlier studies contains a number of characteristics also reported for <italic>SRK</italic> in other Brassicaceae, in particular an exon sequence that is similar to that of the SRK extracellular domain (<italic>S</italic>-domain), which contains several hypervariable regions thought to be involved in pollen recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Busch3">[25]</xref>. This gene was referred to as <italic>Lal2</italic>. Despite published evidence that <italic>Lal2</italic> functions as <italic>SRK</italic> in Leavenworthia, the full sequence of the gene (i.e., the expected seven exons coding for the entire extracellular <italic>S</italic>-domain, transmembrane domain, and kinase domain) could not be PCR-amplified using primers anchored in conserved regions of the <italic>SRK</italic> coding sequence, and no <italic>SCR</italic> gene (which is expected to be present in the genome close to <italic>SRK</italic>) was detected using PCR-based approaches. Moreover, the bulk of <italic>Lal2</italic> alleles do not cluster phylogenetically with the <italic>SRK</italic> alleles of Arabidopsis, Brassica, and other Brassicaceae species. Two putative <italic>S</italic> alleles exhibiting sequence similarity to the <italic>S</italic>-domain of <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata SRK</italic> have been observed, but these represent fewer than 3% of the <italic>Lal2</italic> alleles characterized to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Busch3">[25]</xref>, and in a series of five separate diallel crosses involving 20 plants, <italic>Lal2</italic> allele sequences in each of 19 plants correctly predicted compatibility relationships, further indicating that it is unlikely that our investigations have failed to uncover the bulk of Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic>-locus haplotypes. The phylogenetic relationships of Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic> alleles to others in the Brassicaceae family is unexpected, especially given that biosystematic studies place the genus Leavenworthia in the tribe Cardamineae, which is more closely related to Arabidopsis and Capsella than to Brassica <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Bailey1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this report we present new data on the Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic> locus gleaned from fosmid cloning, sequencing, expression analysis, comparative genomic, and crossing studies. While sequence characteristics and tissue expression pattern of both the pollen and stigma genes strongly support the hypothesis that the previously described <italic>Lal2</italic> gene forms a portion of the Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic> locus, comparative synteny studies, along with closer examination of sequence variation at this locus, suggest that the Arabidopsis <italic>S</italic>-locus ortholog was lost in Leavenworthia following the divergence of the group from the common ancestor with other members of the Cardamineae. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of <italic>Lal2</italic>, <italic>SRK</italic>, and other gene family members suggests that SI in this genus is based on genes that have diversified separately and are thus likely paralogous to Arabidopsis <italic>SRK</italic> and <italic>SCR</italic>. We also show that two separate losses of SI in one species of Leavenworthia (<italic>L. alabamica</italic>) are likely due to independent mutations in the <italic>SCR</italic>-like gene coding sequence and/or its promoter. Together these results portray SI as a reproductive system that is more evolutionarily plastic than previously believed.</p>

<title>Fosmid and PCR Cloning of the Lal2 Region in Different Races of <italic>Leavenworthia alabamica</italic></title>
<p><italic>Leavenworthia alabamica</italic> includes several races that differ in floral characteristics and mating system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Lloyd1">[20]</xref>. The <italic>L. alabamica</italic> populations studied here belong to three races. The a1 race consists of SI plants with large, strongly scented flowers, and outwardly dehiscing anthers. Plants of race a2 are SC, with large but weakly scented flowers, and partially inward dehiscing anthers, while a4 plants are also SC, but with small flowers lacking scent, and fully inward dehiscing anthers.</p>
<p>To better characterize the <italic>Leavenworthia alabamica Lal2</italic> (<italic>LaLal2</italic>) gene and gain knowledge about its genomic context, fosmid libraries were constructed from single individuals of all three races. Clones containing <italic>LaLal2</italic> were isolated after screening the libraries by PCR, and their sequences were obtained using 454 sequencing technology. The a1 race plant was heterozygous at <italic>LaLal2</italic>, whereas the a2 and a4 race plants were each homozygous for different <italic>LaLal2</italic> alleles (whose <italic>S</italic>-domain sequences match those previously reported in these races <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Busch3">[25]</xref>). One <italic>LaLal2</italic>-containing clone was obtained from each of the a1 race and a2 race libraries (35,750 bp and 39,236 bp, respectively). From the a4 race library, two overlapping clones were isolated; these assembled into one long contig of 64,895 bp. The assembled sequences from the different <italic>L. alabamica</italic> races cover a similar genomic region, and they share a number of structural features characteristic of other Brassicaceae <italic>SRK/SCR S</italic> loci. We therefore refer to them below as Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic> haplotypes. Also included in our analysis are partial sequences, obtained by PCR amplification, of an additional <italic>S</italic> haplotype found in a population of fully SI plants belonging to the a1 race. This <italic>S</italic> haplotype contains a <italic>LaLal2 S</italic>-domain sequence identical to that of the SC race a2. To distinguish between the a1 haplotype from the a1 fosmid clone and this second a1 haplotype, they are referred to below as a1-1 and a1-2, respectively.</p>

<title>The <italic>Leavenworthia alabamica Lal2</italic> Gene Encodes a Putative Receptor Kinase That Shares Highest Homology with a Paralog of <italic>SRK</italic> in <italic>A. lyrata</italic></title>
<p>Previous sequence information available for <italic>LaLal2</italic> was limited to the portion of the sequence corresponding to the extracellular domain of members of the <italic>S</italic>-domain 1 (SD-1) receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene family to which <italic>SRK</italic> belongs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Busch3">[25]</xref>. Analysis of the fosmid clones sequences allowed the full-length genomic sequence of <italic>LaLal2</italic> to be determined. Homology of the full-length genomic <italic>LaLal2</italic> sequence extends over the entire length expected for genes belonging to the SD-1 receptor kinase family. After excluding other Leavenworthia sequences, the highest match obtained from our BLASTn searches with the genomic <italic>LaLal2</italic> sequence was NCBI Gene ID 9305017 from <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> (coverage 41%, E value 2e-106), which has no characterized function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001560.s008">Table S1</xref>). For brevity the NCBI Gene ID 9305017 will be referred to as the <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata Lal2</italic> (<italic>AlLal2</italic>) gene. Other, lower similarity matches were to Brassicaceae <italic>SRK</italic> sequences. We determined the <italic>LaLal2</italic> coding regions by combining data obtained from RT-PCR and 5′/3′ RACE sequences, which show that the gene has seven exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001560.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), as observed in <italic>SRK</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Stein1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>The predicted amino acid sequences of <italic>LaLal2</italic> and <italic>AlLal2</italic> have signal peptide and transmembrane domain signature sequences, as expected for a transmembrane receptor coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001560.s001">S1B</xref>). Domain organization of LaLal2 and AlLal2 proteins predicted by the SMART/Pfam online program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Letunic1">[31]</xref> is as follows: two overlapping B-Lectin domains, an S_locus_glycoprotein domain and a PAN_APPLE domain in their extracellular domain, and an intracellular catalytic kinase domain, the latter being made up of the 11 subdomains described for protein kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001560.s001">S1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Hanks1">[32]</xref>.</p>

<p>The amino acid sequences of Leavenworthia a1-1, a2, and a4 <italic>LaLal2</italic> alleles, <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> AlLal2 (NCBI Gene ID 9305017), <italic>A. lyrata</italic> SRK14 (a class B <italic>SRK</italic> allele), <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> SRK12, <italic>Arabidopsis halleri</italic> SRK43, as well as <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ARK3 and ARK1 were aligned along with their annotated domains. Thick black bars represent amino acid regions, and thin lines represent gaps of one or more amino acids introduced to optimize the alignment. Red arrowheads highlight alignment gaps observed specifically in all Lal2 sequences. Red circles indicate alignment gaps found in region of all Lal2 sequences and in AlSRK14 corresponding to the DUF3660 and DUF3403 domains of all other sequences. Protein domains are represented with colored boxes and their accession numbers are indicated in parentheses next to corresponding names in the color legend.</p>

<p>In addition to these domains, most of the known <italic>SRK</italic> alleles as well as their most closely related SD-1 RLK gene family members, <italic>ARK1</italic> and <italic>ARK3</italic>, also possess DUF3660 and DUF3403 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Zhang1">[33]</xref>. Alignment of amino acid sequences of LaLal2 and AlLal2 to those of Brassicaceae SRK alleles (e.g., AlSRK14, BoSRK12, and AhSRK43) as well as to those of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ARK1 and ARK3 produced gaps in Lal2 sequences in regions corresponding to the DUF3660 and DUF3403 domains. Although <italic>A. lyrata</italic> and <italic>A. halleri</italic> SRK sequences belonging to the class B <italic>SRK</italic> alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Prigoda1">[34]</xref> also lack these two predicted domains (e.g., AlSRK14 and AhSRK28), their sequences cluster phylogenetically within the clade of <italic>SRK</italic> alleles and not with the <italic>Lal2</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001560.s002">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g002">2</xref>). Moreover, upon closer examination of the regions around the deletions of DUF3660 and DUF3403 in class B <italic>SRK</italic> alleles (around residues 535 and 870, respectively), the amino acid residues flanking the deletions are seen to be more similar to SRK and ARK than to Lal2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001560.s002">Figure S2</xref>). There are also a number of alignment gaps that were found to be specific to all LaLal2 and AlLal2 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001560.s002">S2</xref>).

<title>A Defensin-Like Encoding Gene Is Located in the Genomic Vicinity of <italic>LaLal2</italic></title>
<p>It has been noted that the <italic>SCR</italic> gene in previously characterized Brassicaceae <italic>S</italic>-locus haplotypes has the structure of a plant defensin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Chookajorn1">[36]</xref>.

This gene is referred to below as <italic>SCR-like</italic> (<italic>SCRL</italic>). The <italic>LaSCRL</italic> alleles of the a1-1 and a1-2 haplotypes contain full open reading frames and were used for further sequence analysis of the gene. Based on their cDNA sequences, we established that the <italic>SCRL</italic> gene consists of two exons, a characteristic common to the majority of plant defensin encoding genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Silverstein1">[37]</xref>. Analysis with the SignalP online tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Petersen1">[38]</xref> predicts that the coding sequences of a1-1 and a1-2 <italic>LaSCRL</italic> translate into preproteins composed of an N-terminal signal peptide, required for protein secretion, and a small hydrophilic mature protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The cleavage site of the signal peptide is predicted to be located after amino acid 25 in both a1-1 and a1-2 LaSCRL, generating mature proteins of 67 amino acids (aa) and 70 aa, respectively. While the signal peptide sequences of a1-1 and a1-2 LaSCRL are partially conserved (72% aa identity), the mature protein sequences are highly variable (32% identity), though like <italic>SCR</italic>, they contain eight cysteine residues (although their positions are not well conserved in the two sequences). Protein structure prediction using the modeling packages I-TASSER and DiANNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Ferre1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Zhang3">[40]</xref> suggests that the LaSCRL product has a compact tertiary structure formed by disulfide bridges between a number of the cysteine residues, as seen in the SCRs of other Brassicaceae.</p>

<p>Annotation of the fosmid sequences using the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> reference genome revealed that the conserved regions on each side of the Leavenworthia core <italic>S</italic> locus are syntenic with an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> chromosome 4 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

Moreover, there are no reports of an <italic>S</italic> locus in this region in other Brassicaceae species that have been examined to date, including <italic>A. lyrata</italic>. Therefore the existence of an <italic>S</italic> locus in this genomic region in Leavenworthia appears to be novel.</p>
<p>As noted above, however, <italic>LaLal2</italic> and <italic>LaSCRL</italic> do show sequence homology to annotated but uncharacterized genes in <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, with highest homology to, respectively, NCBI Gene ID numbers 9305017 (called here <italic>AlLaL2</italic>), and NCBI Gene ID numbers 9302985 and 9305018.

<p>The sequences of the a2 and a4 <italic>S</italic> haplotypes were obtained with the goal of determining the nature of loss of SI in these Leavenworthia SC races, particularly by analyzing sequences and expression of <italic>LaLal2</italic> and <italic>LaSCRL</italic> in plants homozygous for the a1-1, a2, or a4 haplotypes.

<p>In contrast, analysis of <italic>LaSCRL</italic> sequences and expression revealed that the a2 and a4 alleles, from the SC races, have various disruptive mutations. In our race a4 plant, no <italic>LaSCRL</italic> expression could be detected in anthers 2 d before anthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), a development stage at which the a1-1 <italic>LaSCRL</italic> allele is highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The coding region of the a4 <italic>LaSCRL</italic> allele deduced from the genomic DNA sequence contains a premature stop codon and the cleavage site of the signal peptide appears to be defective compared to that of the a1-1 and a1-2 <italic>LaSCRL</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Expression of the a2 <italic>LaSCRL</italic> allele was detected in anthers 2 d before anthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), but its translated sequence differs from that of a1-2 by one amino acid residue, and there is a premature stop codon after amino acid residue 45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We crossed plants homozygous for the a1-2 haplotype or the a2 haplotype, to determine whether their incompatibility reactions fit those expected based on the sequence differences outlined above. The plant with the a1-2 haplotype appears to be compatible as a pollen recipient when a2 plants are used as pollen donors (89% of nine crosses produced fruit or had germinated pollen tubes). In contrast, the reciprocal crosses (a2 recipient plants and a1-2 pollen donors) appear to be incompatible with only 10% of 20 crosses that produced a fruit or had germinated pollen tubes. These proportions are significantly different (Z = 4.135, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and support the hypothesis that SC in the a2 race is due to a mutation in <italic>SCRL</italic> (a1-2 pollen was shown to produce offspring when used in crosses with other pollen recipients). These results suggest that, as in other Brassicaceae, Leavenworthia possesses an <italic>S</italic> locus, which when disrupted leads to SC. Loss of SI in Leavenworthia a2 and a4 races is probably not due to loss of <italic>LaLal2</italic> function, but to mutations in the male function <italic>SCRL</italic> gene.

<title>The <italic>S</italic> Locus of Leavenworthia Is Unusual</title>
<p>We have characterized the Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic> locus in detail and have shown that it comprises two closely linked genes located in a genomic region of low sequence conservation among Leavenworthia haplotypes, as is also the case for the <italic>SRK</italic>/<italic>SCR S</italic> locus in other Brassicaceae members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Goubet1">[41]</xref>. The two Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic>-locus genes, <italic>LaLal2</italic> and <italic>LaSCRL</italic>, resemble the <italic>S</italic>-locus genes <italic>SRK</italic> and <italic>SCR</italic> in their sequence and expression pattern, but unlike their orthologs in populations of <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>, they are highly polymorphic. Phylogenetic trees constructed from Leavenworthia <italic>Lal2</italic> alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Busch3">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Herman1">[28]</xref> show a pattern of long terminal branches similar to that observed at <italic>SRK</italic>/<italic>SCR S</italic> loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Uyenoyama1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Schierup1">[54]</xref>.</p>
<p>While our previous studies indicated the existence of a functional <italic>S</italic> locus in the SI Leavenworthia races, the results reported here suggest that the genes comprising the Leavenworthia <italic>Lal2/SCRL S</italic> locus are unlike those of other Brassicaceae <italic>S</italic> loci that have been characterized to date. First, in Leavenworthia, <italic>SRK</italic> and <italic>SCR</italic> are absent from the syntenic block in which they occur in Arabidopsis and its close relatives, a genomic position that appears to be ancestral in the Brassicaceae. This is true in the case of the Brassica <italic>S</italic> locus as well, where it has been suggested that translocation of the entire <italic>S</italic> locus may have occurred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Kusaba1">[44]</xref>. However, the Brassica <italic>SRK</italic> sequences fall within the same clade as those of Arabidopsis and its relatives, despite the significantly greater phylogenetic distance between the genera as compared to Leavenworthia and Arabidopsis. By contrast, the Leavenworthia <italic>Lal2</italic> sequences and their sequence homologs in other Brassicaceae taxa form a distinct clade, which appears to have diverged from the <italic>SRK-ARK</italic> clade before allelic diversification at <italic>SRK</italic> that presumably occurred at the onset of the ancestral SI system of Brassicaceae. As well, the Lal2 amino acid sequences have distinct deletions compared with those of Arabidopsis and Brassica SRKs. Finally, although the <italic>SCR-like</italic> gene in Leavenworthia shares several features in common with <italic>SCR</italic>, including high sequence diversity, a coding sequence with eight cysteine residues, and a defensin-like protein predicted to form a compact tertiary structure held together by disulfide bridges, they align too poorly with those of SCRs to be orthologous. Instead, the <italic>LaLal2</italic> and <italic>LaSCRL</italic> sequences of Leavenworthia resemble SD-1 receptor kinase and defensin-like gene family members, respectively, found in a conserved syntenic block in <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, on the same chromosome as the <italic>SRK/SCR S</italic> locus but distant from it.</p>

<title>The Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic> Locus Appears to Have Evolved Secondarily from Paralogs of <italic>SRK</italic> and <italic>SCR</italic></title>
<p>Below we propose several possible explanations that could account for the distinct characteristics of the Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic> locus noted above. First we address the question of the time of the duplication event that gave rise to the separate <italic>SRK</italic> and <italic>Lal2</italic> lineages, and second we address the question of the time of acquisition of pollen-pistil recognition function by <italic>Lal2/SCRL</italic>. Regarding the first issue, focusing on the phylogenetic relationships of the <italic>Lal2</italic> and <italic>SRK</italic> sequences as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g002">Figure 2</xref>, we note that these two groups of sequences form separate clades, and that the <italic>Lal2</italic> group belongs to a lineage that apparently diverged from the <italic>SRK</italic> group before <italic>SRK</italic> became involved in self-pollen recognition and underwent allelic diversification. The alternative hypothesis—that there was a duplication of <italic>SRK</italic> that gave rise directly to <italic>Lal2</italic> and occurred while <italic>SRK</italic> was already functioning in SI and thus still undergoing allelic diversification, but before the divergence of genera Arabidopsis, Capsella, Leavenworthia, and Brassica—is unlikely for the following reasons: (1) it is at odds with the structure of the gene tree and with the high level of divergence of <italic>Lal2</italic> from <italic>SRK</italic> throughout the entire <italic>Lal2</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001560.s009">Table S2</xref>); (2) under this hypothesis one would expect to find a gene tree with <italic>Lal2</italic> and <italic>SRK</italic> sequences interspersed at the branch tips; and (3) if <italic>Lal2</italic> functioned as a pollen protein-receptor this early in the evolution of SI, one would expect the level of polymorphism at <italic>Lal2</italic> to be high. In earlier work we showed that there is a relatively low level of polymorphism at <italic>LaLal2</italic> compared with <italic>SRK</italic>, and we found evidence of strong positive selection in hypervariable regions of the <italic>S</italic>-domain thought to be involved in recognition, both in our earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Herman1">[28]</xref> and in the PAML branch-site model analysis described above. Strong positive selection is thought to provide an indicator of recent diversification of the <italic>S</italic> locus, since negative-frequency-dependent selection for new <italic>S</italic>-allele specificities is expected to be most pronounced when <italic>S</italic> allele numbers are low, as expected following recent evolution of an <italic>S</italic> locus, or a population bottleneck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Castric1">[55]</xref>. Moreover, we have shown that the <italic>A. lyrata Lal2</italic> and <italic>SCRL</italic> genes do not exhibit polymorphism.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the time of acquisition of pollen-pistil recognition function by <italic>Lal2/SCRL</italic>, we propose two alternative scenarios. In both cases we assume that divergence of <italic>SRK</italic> and <italic>Lal2</italic> predates the origin of SI in the Brassicaceae, and moreover, at the time of origin of SI in the family, these two genes were paralogous, with distinct functions and genomic locations. We assume that the lineage leading to <italic>SRK</italic> then acquired a role in SI and subsequently diversified leading to a large clade of <italic>SRK</italic> alleles that exhibit transgeneric polymorphism. It also likely gave rise to related genes (that do not have a function in SI) through duplication and translocation to new genomic locations unlinked to the <italic>S</italic> locus (e.g., <italic>ARK1</italic>). According to the first scenario (Scenario I), the ancestral <italic>S</italic> locus (i.e., with <italic>SRK/SCR</italic>) was lost at some point in the lineage leading to Leavenworthia, and so functional SI was lost as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Pollen-pistil recognition then re-evolved based on a receptor-ligand system using the <italic>LaLal2</italic> and <italic>LaSCRL</italic> genes, with a burst of diversification. Although this scenario involves a shift in the genes involved in pollen-pistil recognition in the SI system in the Leavenworthia lineage, it is possible that the genes involved in the signaling cascade leading to inhibition of pollen germination in the incompatibility reaction have remained the same as in the other lineages. Alternatively (Scenario II) the evolution of a new <italic>S</italic> locus in Leavenworthia could have been a two-step process, one in which SI was never completely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This could have occurred if one gene of the new <italic>S</italic> locus (e.g., <italic>LaLal2</italic>) evolved pollen-protein recognition function, followed by evolution of a role as a protein ligand in SI for the second gene (<italic>LaSCRL</italic>), a series of events that could have been favored under high inbreeding depression if the ancestral system was “leaky” and allowed some selfing. Then, the original <italic>SRK/SCR S</italic> locus could have later been lost in Leavenworthia (perhaps following polyploidization). These two scenarios both fit the pattern of earlier divergence of <italic>Lal2</italic> seen in the gene phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001560-g002">Figure 2</xref>), and are compatible with the evidence of relatively low diversity of <italic>Lalal2</italic> alleles, and detection of strong selection in hypervariable regions of <italic>LaLal2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Herman1">[28]</xref>.</p>

<p>The data from this study are insufficient to know whether SI was lost in the lineage leading to Leavenworthia (Scenario I), or whether it was retained without interruption of the SI response (Scenario II), but there are several reasons to consider that SI may have been lost in the Leavenworthia lineage before being regained. First, the loss of SI is indeed common in the flowering plants and in the Brassicaceae—it has been estimated that half the species in the family are self-compatible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Bateman2">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Stebbins1">[57]</xref>, and thus, the possible loss of SI within Leavenworthia cannot be considered as an atypical event. Second, Leavenworthia has recently been shown to be a paleopolyploid species (M. Lysak, A. Haudry, M. Blanchette, personal communication). As is the case in other such taxa, the evolutionary history of Leavenworthia likely involved interspecific hybridization followed by polyploidization. Hybridization and polyploidization in an individual possessing SI may lead to loss of fertility due to the absence of mates with gametes capable of producing viable offspring, which in turn could have led to selection for the loss of SI. That is, self-fertilization (as brought about by the loss of SI) may have increased the ability of an ancestral plant to form viable offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Grant1">[58]</xref>—this is not to say that polyploidy must necessarily have led to the immediate breakdown of SI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Mable2">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Tsuchimatsu1">[60]</xref> but rather that polyploidization could have provided a “selective filter” that favored its loss.</p>
<p>Clearly, Scenario I challenges the widely held notion that SI once lost is not easily regained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Igic1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Igic2">[6]</xref>. SI is, however, known to have evolved several times in the angiosperms, and so it is conceivable that it could re-evolve within the same family following loss of its pollen-pistil recognition system. It has been noted that the Brassicaceae is enriched for <italic>S</italic>-receptor kinase genes and these often occur near <italic>SCR</italic>-like genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Zhang1">[33]</xref>. Given the role that these genes play in recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Sanabria1">[7]</xref>, it is possible that they could have formed the basis for the evolution of the pollen-pistil recognition system in SI in this family more than once. As well, we note that, though not specific, the expression of <italic>Lal2</italic> and <italic>SCRL</italic> in stigmas and anthers, respectively, in both <italic>A. lyrata</italic> and Leavenworthia suggest the presence of regulatory elements necessary to bring about a new <italic>S</italic> locus in the lineage leading to Leavenworthia.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the loss of adaptations for outcrossing and transition to a high self-fertilization rate represent an evolutionary dead end, either because selfing lineages have higher extinction rates than outcrossing ones (due to accumulation of deleterious mutations), because of loss of adaptability, or because once lost, the purging of the genetic load leads to reduced inbreeding depression, so that outcrossing mechanisms cannot be easily regained via selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Stebbins1">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Takebayashi1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Wright1">[63]</xref>. If the <italic>Lal2</italic>/<italic>SCRL S</italic> locus arose following the loss of SI, the re-evolution of SI would require that the selective pressure, inbreeding depression, be retained. Theory suggests that if inbreeding depression is largely due to mutations with low selective coefficients, and if moderate levels of outcrossing persist following loss of SI, inbreeding depression may not necessarily be purged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Charlesworth2">[64]</xref>.</p>
<p>Scenario II is also interesting to consider. It would likely entail a period of evolutionary history in the Leavenworthia lineage in which two separate <italic>S</italic> loci could have co-existed within the same genome. SI systems with two unlinked recognition loci are known in the grasses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Langridge1">[65]</xref>.</p>

<title>The Genetic Basis of SC in Leavenworthia</title>
<p>We found different disabling mutations at the <italic>SCR-like</italic> gene in different SC populations of <italic>L. alabamica</italic>, suggesting independent loss of SI in these populations. The same conclusion was also inferred based on phylogenetic relationships among the SI and SC populations of this species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Busch4">[26]</xref>. The finding that mutations in the pollen gene are involved in each case where SI has been lost in <italic>L. alabamica</italic> parallels recent reports in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. kamchatica</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Tsuchimatsu1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Tsuchimatsu2">[66]</xref> and also lends support to a prediction from population genetic theory that mutations disabling the pollen gene (as opposed to those disabling the stigma gene) should more easily spread in populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Uyenoyama2">[67]</xref>. Moreover, the loss of SI in <italic>L. alabamica</italic> was probably recent, as <italic>LaLal2</italic> genes in the SC populations are apparently still intact and expressed, and at least one of the SC <italic>L. alabamica</italic> populations studied here (the a2 race population) exhibits mixed selfing and outcrossing. Had the loss of SI and breakdown of <italic>SCR</italic>-like genes in these populations occurred in the more distant evolutionary past, it would presumably have rendered the <italic>LaLal2</italic> gene selectively neutral and subject to mutational decay, and we would have expected to find a signature of such decay or neutrality in <italic>LaLal2</italic> sequences. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this gene also serves an additional unknown function, as suggested by the expression of <italic>LaLal2</italic> in tissues other than stigmas. For example, a dual function has been found for an <italic>SRK</italic> gene in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Tantikanjana1">[68]</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Future Research</title>
<p>The results of this investigation suggest that <italic>S</italic> locus evolution in Brassicaceae is more complex than initially thought. The vast majority of molecular-level studies of SI have been conducted with a limited number of model plant systems or their close relatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-FranklinTong1">[4]</xref>. The work we present here, on a non-model organism, underscores the importance of looking outside these systems to understand more broadly the evolution of SI. It will be important to examine the genetic basis of SI in more distantly related Brassicaceae species to determine whether there are other taxa with SI systems that appear not to be based on <italic>SRK</italic> and <italic>SCR</italic>.</p>
<p>Apart from the evidence that we have presented and discussed above, there are other types of information that could be useful in determining with greater certainty whether the <italic>S</italic> locus in Leavenworthia could have evolved as a duplication of the <italic>SRK</italic>/<italic>SCR S</italic> locus, rather than as a result of neo-functionalization, as we have proposed here. One potentially useful piece of information pertains to the role of <italic>Lal2</italic> and <italic>SCRL</italic> in other Brassicaceae taxa. Even though apparent <italic>Lal2</italic> sequence orthologs exist in other Brassicaceae species, there is no information available to test whether pollen recognition in SI is based on <italic>Lal2</italic> alleles in any of these taxa (apart from what we have presented for <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>, suggesting that it is not). To further rule out the possibility that <italic>Lal2</italic>/<italic>SCRL</italic>-based SI exists in other Brassicaceae genera, it would be valuable to explore the levels of polymorphism of <italic>Lal2</italic> and <italic>SCRL</italic> orthologs in other taxa and determine whether they are characteristic of an <italic>S</italic> locus. In addition, crosses could be conducted to reveal whether these genes co-segregate with SI reactions, as has been done in earlier studies that focused on the role of <italic>SRK</italic> and <italic>SCR</italic> in SI. The existence of a few rare <italic>S</italic> allele sequences in Leavenworthia with some similarity to those of <italic>A. lyrata</italic> and <italic>A. halleri SRK</italic>s (as noted above) could be interpreted as support for the duplication (as opposed to neo-functionalization) hypothesis. But such evidence is premature. These sequences could simply be pseudogenes that are linked to the Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic> locus, and therefore show cosegregation with SI. It would be useful to determine the genomic location of these sequences in the few plants where they occur, and whether they play any active role in SI.</p>
<p>Finally, in future research directed at understanding the evolution of the Leavenworthia <italic>S</italic> locus, it would also be interesting to attempt transformation of SC species of Arabidopsis or Brassica with Leavenworthia <italic>SCRL</italic> and <italic>LaLal2</italic> genes from the same haplotype, to determine whether these genes function within the context of the same downstream signaling pathway(s) as <italic>SRK</italic>/<italic>SCR</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Stone1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Nasrallah1">[51]</xref>.</p>

The resulting progeny were screened for homozygosity for the allele of interest. Plants from the a2 and a4 races of <italic>L. alabamica</italic> are homozygous for the a2 and a4 <italic>LaLal2 S</italic> haplotypes, respectively. Crosses and pollen tube staining were conducted according to previously published methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Busch3">[25]</xref>. Pollinations were considered compatible when more than five pollen tubes were visible in the style of the maternal parent or &gt;1 seed was produced in the mature silique.</p>
<p>The <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> plant used for <italic>AlLal2</italic> and <italic>AlSCRL</italic> expression analysis was obtained from a seed collected in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-KivimKi1">[70]</xref> and was grown in a Conviron PGW36 growth chamber under 16-h days at 22°C with a nighttime temperature of 18°C.</p>

<title>Nuclei Purification and DNA Extraction</title>
<p>Genomic DNA samples of plants of the a1-1, a2, or a4 <italic>S</italic> haplotypes used in fosmid library construction were extracted from purified nuclei. Nuclei were purified from fresh or frozen plant tissues. Tissues were grinded in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Powdered tissues were added to freshly made and ice-cold nuclei extraction buffer [10 mM Tris HCl (pH 9.5); 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); 100 mM KCl; 500 mM sucrose; 4 mM spermidine; 1 mM spermine; 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol] in a ratio of 20 ml of buffer per gram of tissue. Solution with added tissue was stirred using a magnetic stir bar for 10 min and then filtered through two layers of cheesecloth combined to one layer of Miracloth into a clean beaker. Cold lysis buffer (nuclei extraction buffer with 10% Triton X-100) was added at a ratio of 2 ml per 20 ml of nuclei extraction buffer. Solution was stirred for 2 min, poured into cold 50 ml polyethylene tubes, and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet nuclei. Supernatant was poured off, and the remaining supernatant was removed with a micropipette after a quick-spin.</p>
<p>DNA was extracted from purified nuclei using Genomic-tips 20/G and the Genomic DNA Buffer Set (Qiagen). Instructions given in the Qiagen Genomic DNA Handbook (August 2001) for Yeast starting at p. 37, step 8 were used except for this following modification: at step 9, Proteinase K was added and incubation was carried overnight with gentle shaking at 50 rpm on a MixMate Plate and Tube Mixer (Eppendorf) to lyse the nuclei. Genomic DNA samples used in standard DNA analysis were extracted with the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen).</p>

<title>Fosmid Library Construction and Screening</title>
<p>Fosmid libraries were constructed using the CopyControl HTP Fosmid Library Production Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies) as specified by the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications and specifications. Genomic DNA was sheared by passing gDNA samples 35 times through a Gastight 10 µl Hamilton syringe (model 1701). Sheared DNA was end-repaired and submitted to size separation by migration in a 1% low melting point agarose gel for 36 h at 35 V in 0.5× TBE buffer. Insert DNA ranging from 23 to 40 kb was recovered from the gel matrix using GELase. We used 250 µg of purified DNA for ligation into the pCC2FOS Vector. After titering the packaged fosmid clones, cells were grown overnight at 37°C in liquid gel pools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Elsaesser1">[71]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Hrvatin1">[72]</xref> in 96-deep-well plates at a density of either 100 or 250 cfu per pool [200 µl of LB SeaPrep Agarose (Lonza Rockland Inc.) supplemented with 12.5 µg/ml chloramphenicol (Cam)].</p>
<p>Clones containing the <italic>Lalal2</italic> gene were isolated by doing successive rounds of PCR screening on library pools of decreasing number of clones. In the first round, an aliquot of several library pools were combined to create superpools. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in sterile water. An aliquot of 0.5 µl each of resuspended cells was used in standard PCR reactions. In the second round, pools from the obtained positive superpools were screened. In the third round, positive pools were plated on LB agar plates supplemented with 12.5 µg/ml Cam to get isolated colonies. Colonies were individually picked and combined into pools of 10 colonies for PCR screening. Final screening round was carried on individual colonies grown on LB agar+12.5 µg/ml Cam plates from positive pools of 10.</p>
<p>To increase sensitivity of the screening, each round of screening consisted of two successive rounds of PCR reaction (primary and secondary). Primary PCR reactions were carried with primer pair Lal-Sdomain5′-F and Lal-Sdomain3′-R. Secondary PCR reaction used nested primer pair LalGenF and LalRcon.

<title>RNA Extraction and Expression Analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA samples were extracted from plant tissues by using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were purified from DNA contamination by carrying an on-column treatment with DNase as specified in the manufacturer's instruction manual. For expression analysis of <italic>Lal2</italic> and <italic>SCRL</italic> by RT-PCR, 1 ug of total RNA was used in reverse transcription reactions using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) and Oligo(dT)<sub>12–18</sub>. The 5′/3′ RACE reactions were carried with the FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Invitrogen) using 2 ug of total RNA. The 5′ adapter-ligated RNA was reverse transcribed with the M-MLV Reverse transcriptase provided with the kit and using either random decamers or the 3′ RACE adapter as primers. PCR amplifications on reverse-transcribed products were carried using the following conditions: 1 µl RT products, 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mM dNTP mix, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 µM forward primer, 0.4 µM reverse primer, and 0.75 U Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen), in a final volume of 20 µl. PCR cycling was done in a C1000 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) using the following program: initial denaturation at 94°C, 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 94°C, 30 s; 58°C, 30 s.; 72°C, 1 min; and a final elongation step at 72°C, 5 min.

<p>Illumina RNAseq reads from <italic>A. lyrata</italic> seedlings, roots, and stage 12 flowerbuds obtained courtesy of Dr. Richard Clark and Joshua Steffen were obtained using methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Gan1">[73]</xref>. RNAseq reads were aligned to the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> reference genome (strain MN47: JGI) using both novoalign (Novocraft) and spliceMap (PMID: 20371516). Novoalign was used in read quality re-calibration mode with a low level of mismatch permitted (t = 50) between read and reference. Independently spliceMap was used to map reads spanning exon junctions. For each gene model, an expression level was determined by adjusting the read-count per gene by the exon-length and total reads in the respective sequencing libraries.</p>

<title>DNA Sequencing and Sequence Analysis</title>
<p>Sanger, Illumina, and 454 sequencing were performed at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre. The genomes of <italic>Leavenworthia alabamica</italic> (a4 race), <italic>Sisymbrium irio</italic>, and the <italic>Leavenworthia</italic> short read data were gathered as part of an ongoing comparative genomics investigation involving these and other Brassicaceae species (Blanchette et al., unpublished data). The sequences of the a1-1, a2, and a4 fosmid clones were also assembled from 454 data. In the case of the genomes, reads were generated in accordance with the Illumina protocols, with special attention paid to gentle shearing of mate-pair circular DNA to ensure &gt;500 nt fragments, thereby reducing the probability of a read fragment-join chimera. Paired end (2×105, nominal 64 nt gap) Illumina reads were generated to a depth of 80× for each genome, trimmed for quality (3′ trimming where Q&lt;32) and assembled with the Ray assembler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Boisvert1">[74]</xref> using automatic coverage depth profiling and a Kmer of 31. Scaffolding of Ray contigs was then undertaken with the SOAPdeNovo (BGI) assembler using a combination of 5 and 10 KBase mate pair reads (Blanchette et al., unpublished data). Assembly of the fosmid sequences was undertaken in batches of pooled barcoded libraries covered by 1/8 of a flowcell of 454 sequencing (200× coverage). After stripping vector contaminants Newbler (Roche) was used to assemble the reads into ∼40 Kbase contigs using essentially default assembly parameters. Comparison of targeted fosmid assemblies (454) and short read whole genome assemblies (Illumina-Ray) from <italic>L. alabamica</italic> of the a4 race demonstrated high levels of concordance.</p>
<p>Standard sequence analyses were done using the Geneious v. 5.4.6 software (Auckland, New Zealand) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Drummond1">[75]</xref>. Amino acid and nucleotide sequences were aligned with MUSCLE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Edgar1">[76]</xref>. Fosmid sequences were aligned using VISTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Frazer1">[77]</xref>. Annotation of fosmid sequences was done by sequence blast against the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genome. Because of the high sequence diversity of <italic>LaSCRL</italic>, this gene could not be detected by blast search but was found by eye examination of short ORFs obtained from different translation frames for the presence of eight cysteines.

<title>Phylogenetic Analyses</title>
<p>In addition to the a1-1, a2, and a4 <italic>LaLal2</italic> sequences, we selected full-length coding <italic>SRK</italic>, and the closely related receptor-like kinase genes <italic>ARK1</italic>, <italic>ARK2</italic>, and <italic>ARK3</italic> sequences from several Brassicaceae taxa. We included the coding sequence of <italic>AlLal2</italic> (NCBI gene ID 9305017), the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> gene showing apparent orthology to <italic>LaLal2</italic> as based on sequence similarity and conserved synteny (see above). Sequences homologous to <italic>Lal2</italic> were identified in <italic>Capsella rubella</italic> (Carubv10025960m) and <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> (Bra010990). This was done as follows. First, pairwise alignments were generated between <italic>A. lyrata</italic> and <italic>L. alabamica</italic>, <italic>C. rubella</italic>, and <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> genomes, using lastz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Harris1">[79]</xref> in gapped, gfextend mode. These alignments were then chained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Kuhn1">[80]</xref> to generate extended sets of alignments split by gaps of less than 100 KBase. Low scoring chains were rejected and a subset of the highest scoring chains were annotated as candidate orthologous alignments between pairs of genomes. For the <italic>L. alabamica</italic> and <italic>B. rapa</italic> genomes, up to three orthologous chains were permitted for each region of the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> genome to represent orthology between the diploid and hexaploid contexts. The remaining chains were annotated as candidate homologous alignments. These alignment chains were used to identify candidate orthologs and homologs. The <italic>AlLal2</italic> (NCBI gene ID 9305017), Carubv10025960, and Bra010990 predicted coding sequences were edited by sequence alignment of their genomic sequences with the Leavenworthia and <italic>A. lyrata Lal2</italic> cDNA sequences obtained by sequencing. The outgroup for the analysis was selected from the sequences on the basis of closeness in evolutionary distance to the ingroup sequences as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-LyonsWeiler1">[81]</xref>, from the Brassicaceae family RLK sequences examined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001560-Zhang1">[33]</xref>.</p>
