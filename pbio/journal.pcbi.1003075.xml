<abstract>
<p>Transcript degradation is a widespread and important mechanism for regulating protein abundance. Two major regulators of transcript degradation are RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). We computationally explored whether RBPs and miRNAs cooperate to promote transcript decay. We defined five RBP motifs based on the evolutionary conservation of their recognition sites in 3′UTRs as the binding motifs for Pumilio (PUM), U1A, Fox-1, Nova, and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content>. Recognition sites for some of these RBPs tended to localize at the end of long 3′UTRs. A specific group of miRNA recognition sites were enriched within 50 nts from the RBP recognition sites for PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content>. The presence of both a PUM recognition site and a recognition site for preferentially co-occurring miRNAs was associated with faster decay of the associated transcripts. For PUM and its co-occurring miRNAs, binding of the RBP to its recognition sites was predicted to release nearby miRNA recognition sites from RNA secondary structures. The mammalian miRNAs that preferentially co-occur with PUM binding sites have recognition seeds that are reverse complements to the PUM recognition motif. Their binding sites have the potential to form hairpin secondary structures with proximal PUM binding sites that would normally limit RISC accessibility, but would be more accessible to miRNAs in response to the binding of PUM. In sum, our computational analyses suggest that a specific set of RBPs and miRNAs work together to affect transcript decay, with the rescue of miRNA recognition sites via RBP binding as one possible mechanism of cooperativity.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Transcript degradation represents an important mechanism of regulation used in diverse biological processes, including during development to eliminate maternally inherited transcripts, in adult tissues to define cell lineages, and as part of signaling pathways to down-regulate unneeded transcripts. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs are two major classes of molecules utilized to degrade transcripts. Using computational methods, we analyzed the genomewide cooperativity between microRNA and RBP recognition sites. We observed cooperativity between Pumilio (PUM) and specific microRNAs that impacts transcript decay. Our analysis suggests that approximately seven mammalian microRNAs preferentially co-localize with PUM binding sites, and these microRNAs have recognition motifs that are reverse complements to the PUM recognition motif. Their binding sites are more likely to form RNA hairpin structures with proximal PUM recognition sites that would limit microRNA efficiency, but would be more accessible to microRNAs in response to the binding of PUM. These results indicate that rescuing microRNA recognition sites from hairpin structures may be an important role for PUM.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transcript degradation is an important mechanism for regulating the levels of proteins in a time or space-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Mata1">[1]</xref>. One mechanism through which transcript degradation can be controlled is via miRNAs, short RNAs approximately 21–23 nucleotides in length that regulate diverse biological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Bartel1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Bartel2">[3]</xref>. miRNAs are initially transcribed as pri-miRNAs, processed to form pre-miRNAs, which are hairpins of approximately 70–80 nucleotides, exported from the nucleus, and further processed to generate the final mature dsRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Bartel1">[2]</xref>. Mature miRNAs are then loaded into the RISC complex, where they associate with target transcripts, resulting in transcript degradation and translation inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Gregory1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>miRNAs generally bind their targets through complementary pairing in a short 7 bp seed sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Lai1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Grimson1">[6]</xref>. There are likely other factors that also determine whether a miRNA will effectively target a particular recognition site, and some of these factors may be 3′UTR sequences that reside outside of the complementary sequence that the miRNAs bind. As an example, AU-rich sequences surrounding the miRNA binding sites have been reported to enhance the efficacy of miRNA-mediated mRNA decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Grimson1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Sun1">[8]</xref>. The location of the recognition site at the 5′ or 3′ end of the 3′UTR, and especially far away from the center of long 3′UTRs, has also been associated with improved miRNA efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Grimson1">[6]</xref>. Thus, given a target transcript with a specific miRNA recognition site sequence, its decay efficiency is likely to be determined by a number of variables not all of which are currently well-understood.</p>
<p>Transcript degradation can also be regulated by RNA binding proteins (RBPs). These proteins can affect transcript stability by binding to recognition sequences within 3′UTRs. Some RBPs, for instance, AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins or Pumilio (PUM), increase the degradation of target transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Barreau1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Goldstrohm1">[17]</xref>. Others, like the HuR family of ARE-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Brennan1">[18]</xref>, cause stabilization of the targeted message. Several genomewide studies have suggested that RBPs and miRNAs may functionally interact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Jiang1">[19]</xref>. Mukherjee and colleagues found that microRNA depletion had a less dramatic effect on sites at which the HuR binding protein could also bind, indicating that HuR was likely competing with microRNAs for binding sites and stabilizing the targeted transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Mukherjee1">[20]</xref>. In another study, an analysis of gene expression changes after miRNA transfection revealed that U-rich motifs similar to HuD binding sequences were associated with transcript down-regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Jacobsen1">[21]</xref>. Finally, immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the PUM protein followed by microarray analysis of surrounding RNA sequences revealed that miRNA binding sites are overrepresented in 3′UTR sequences within close proximity to PUM binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Galgano1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Specific instances in which RBPs enhance or inhibit the effectiveness of miRNAs have been experimentally verified. Competition between miRNAs and RBPs for the same sequence has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Bhattacharyya1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Elcheva1">[25]</xref>. For example, down-regulation of the cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1) mRNA by miR-122 is inhibited by stress, and the de-repression requires binding of HuR to the 3′UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Bhattacharyya1">[23]</xref>. As another example, the RBP CRD-BP binds to the coding region of TrCP1 mRNA and stabilizes it by competing with miR-183 and thus preventing miRNA-dependent processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Elcheva1">[25]</xref>. miRNAs and RBPs have also been reported to cooperate. HuR and the miRNA <italic>let-7</italic> repress c-MYC expression though a mechanism that requires both HuR and <italic>let-7</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kim1">[26]</xref>. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> PUM homolog puf-9 is required for 3′UTR-mediated repression of the <italic>let-7</italic> target hbl-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Nolde1">[27]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, an association between the RBP dFXR and RISC is required for efficient RNA interference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Caudy1">[28]</xref>. As a final example, an AU-rich motif located upstream of the miR-223 binding site in the 3′UTR of RhoB has been reported to enhance miRNA function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Sun1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>One specific mechanism through which the Pumilio RNA binding protein has been proposed to modulate miRNA function is by binding to sequences that can hybridize with miRNA recognition sites and thereby make them more accessible for the RISC complex. Binding of PUM to the 3′UTR of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> has been reported to cause a local change in structure that promotes p27<sup>Kip1</sup> repression by miR-221/miR-222 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kedde2">[29]</xref>. Another study demonstrated that binding of PUM facilitated miR-503 regulation of the E2F3 3′UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Miles1">[30]</xref>. The authors hypothesized PUM binding was able to relax the 3′UTR secondary structure elements that would otherwise block miR-503 binding sites. A final study on the pyrimidine-tract-binding (PTB) protein proposed that PTB binding can modulate the secondary structure of the GNPDA1 3′UTR to facilitate let-7b binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Xue1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that miRNAs and RBPs might cooperate to facilitate transcript decay more extensively than had been realized. Using computational models, we systematically explored RBP-miRNA interactions within human and mouse 3′UTRs and discovered that RBP recognition sites co-occur with subsets of miRNA recognition sites. Our analyses revealed that PUM is likely to cooperate with specific miRNAs to promote decay. Moreover, we found that a subset of miRNAs that co-occur with PUM recognition sites have recognition seed sequences that are the reverse complements of the PUM recognition motif, and thus, may form hairpin secondary structures that would be disrupted by PUM binding. Based on our computational analysis, we discovered seven miRNAs in human and five in mouse that followed this pattern. Approximately 4% of the target sites for these miRNAs colocalize with PUM sites in a pattern that would have the potential for miRNA binding site rescue.</p>

<title>RBP and miRNA recognition motif selection</title>
<p>We performed a literature search and identified 15 instances in which an RBP and its putative recognition motif were reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Hudson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Hogan1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Hafner1">[37]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We reasoned that true RBP recognition motifs that are functional in 3′UTRs would be present more frequently than expected by chance, especially at high levels of evolutionary conservation. Using a method adapted from Kellis and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kheradpour1">[38]</xref>, we found 5 out of the 15 RBPs had significantly increased conservation frequencies compared to their shuffled control motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s002">Figure S2</xref>). All five of these motifs have been demonstrated to be present in 3′UTRs by previous studies.

<title>Identifying RBPs with binding sites evolutionarily conserved in 3′UTRs.</title>
<p>(A, B) For each instance of a putative RBP recognition motif site in 3′UTRs, the Branch Length Score (BLS) was determined based on multiple genome alignments. The number of motifs at different levels of conservation (BLS) is plotted. The area below the curve for the true RBP is shaded green. The frequency with which randomly shuffled motifs were present in the genome is indicated in gray according to the y-axis on the left. Error bars indicate the standard deviation for the different shuffled versions of the motif. The precision ratio (1-[The average number of matches of shuffled motifs]/[The number of matches of the canonical motif]) is indicated by the red line according to the y-axis on the right. (C) CLIP-Seq binding regions for Fox-2 were mapped on human 3′UTRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Yeo1">[47]</xref>. At each conservation BLS threshold, an enrichment ratio was determined by comparing the density of binding sites within the CLIP region versus outside the CLIP region for the Fox-1 and Fox-2 binding motif <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UGCAUGU</named-content> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kuroyanagi1">[46]</xref>. The BLS threshold is shown on the X-axis and enrichment is shown on Y axis. As a control, enrichment of the Fox-1 and Fox-2 motif in PUM2 Par-CLIP sequences was also plotted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Hafner1">[37]</xref>.</p>

<p>For the PUM recognition motif, for instance, there is a large increase in the number of observed recognition sites compared with the number expected based on shuffled controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, U2B is reported to bind the sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AUUGCAG</named-content> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Price1">[45]</xref>, however, its putative binding sites were present a comparable number of times in 3′UTRs compared with shuffled versions of the motif at all levels of evolutionary conservation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). U2B and the nine other such RBPs were therefore not included in our subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>One example of a RBP motif that passed our threshold was the Fox-1 family binding site (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UGCAUGU</named-content>), which represents a family of RBPs that are well-conserved in metazoans. In mammals, there are three members of the Fox-1 family, Fox-1, Fox-2 and Fox-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kuroyanagi1">[46]</xref>. The Fox-1 RBP family recognizes sites with a consensus sequence of <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UGCAUGU</named-content> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Auweter2">[39]</xref> and matches to this sequence were consistently present in 3′UTRs at a higher frequency than shuffled controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This was somewhat unexpected because Fox-1 family RBPs are generally considered to be splicing factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kuroyanagi1">[46]</xref>. To further confirm that the recognition sites on 3′UTRs that we designated as a Fox-1 family binding sites are bound by Fox-1 family RBPs, we analyzed 34,111 non-overlapping regions on human 3′UTRs identified in a previous study of Fox-2-associated sequences using next generation sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Yeo1">[47]</xref>. As a member of the Fox-1 RBP family, Fox-2 also binds <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UGCAUGU</named-content>, so we compared the density of Fox-1 family motifs within the immunoprecipitated 3′UTR sequences with the density in 3′UTRs outside the immunoprecipitated sequences. The enrichment for the Fox-1 family motif increased monotonically with an increasing conservation threshold, from twice as frequent for all binding sites to 4 times more frequent when requiring perfect conservation through all placental mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As a control, we didn't observe a significant enrichment for the Fox-1 motif within sequences immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PUM2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Hafner1">[37]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We conclude that the computational approach that we are using to define RBPs that bind 3′UTRs is consistent with experimental data, and that members of the Fox-1 family likely do bind 3′UTRs.</p>

<title>RBP motifs tend to localize to the end of long 3′UTRs</title>
<p>Previous analyses showed human miRNA recognition motifs tend to localize at the 5′ beginning or 3′ end of long 3′UTRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Majoros1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Gaidatzis1">[49]</xref>. For the five RBP recognition motifs included in this study, we investigated the localization of the associated RBP binding sites along 3′UTRs. We first classified the human 3′UTRs into three length categories: 3′UTRs with length &lt;500 nts (6622 transcripts), 3′UTRs with length  = &gt;500 nts and &lt;2000 nts (7385 transcripts) and 3′UTRs with length &gt; = 2000 nts (3759 transcripts). Within each length category, we divided 3′UTRs into 10 equal parts and counted the percentage of motif occurrences in each of the 10 bins. We observed that for RBP motifs PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content>, the number of recognition sites is highest at the very end of the 3′UTRs longer than 500 nts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). For 3′UTRs longer than 2000 nts, we created ten 100-nt-windows from the 5′ beginning and 3′ end of the full UTR and counted the percentage of RBP motifs found in each window. The number of RBP motifs PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> was highest in windows located 100 nts and 200 nts from the end of the 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>RBP motifs tend to localize to the end of long 3′UTRs.</title>
<p>(A) All human 3′UTRs were classified into three length categories: smaller than 500 nts, longer than 2000 nts, or between 500 and 2000 nts. Each 3′UTR was equally divided into ten bins, numbered from 0.0 to 0.9. Within each length category, the percentage of RBP recognition sites in each bin was plotted. (B) For 3′UTRs longer than 2000 nts, ten 100-nt-windows from the 5′ start towards downstream and the 3′ end towards upstream were analyzed. The percentage of RBP recognition sites in each window was plotted. (C, D) Human (<italic>Home sapiens</italic>), mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) and fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) (but not the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) contain 3′UTRs longer than 2000 nts. The localization patterns of PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> recognitions sites were plotted in ten bins for 3′UTRs longer than 2000 nts.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003075.g002" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>For RBP motifs such as PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> with high AU content, their preferential distribution at the very end of 3′UTRs could, in principle, reflect the higher AU-content at the end of long 3′UTRs. We analyzed the fraction of AU base pairs in different deciles of 3′UTRs and found that 3′UTRs tend to have high AU-content at the 3′ end region in human, mouse, fly and worm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In order to control for AU-content, we generated shuffled control motifs that have the same base pair composition as the initial motif for each RBP. We compared the percentage of RBP recognition sites in each 3′UTR bin with the average from all shuffled RBP motifs in the same bin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In the human genome, PUM recognition sites (binomial test <italic>p</italic>-value = 2.24E-23) and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> (binomial test <italic>p</italic>-value = 6.57E-3) were significantly more frequent at the very 3′ end of 3′UTRs, even after correcting for the high AU content in this region of 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s004">Figure S4A</xref>, B).</p>
<p>Having discovered that certain RBP recognition motifs are enriched at the 3′ ends of long 3′UTRs in human, we then asked whether this localization pattern is present in other species as well. PUM is part of a well-conserved family of PUF proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Wickens1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Spassov1">[50]</xref>.

We analyzed the localization of the PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> consensus sequence within 3′UTRs in these four species and discovered that the preference for the 3′ most region of long 3′UTRs exists in human and mouse, but not fly and worm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g002">Figure 2C, D</xref> for 3′UTRs longer than 2000 nts and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s005">Figure S5</xref> for 3′UTRs shorter than 2000 nts but longer than 500 nts). For mouse, we also determined the extent to which AU content can explain the enrichment for PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> at the 3′ end of longer 3′UTRs. In a pattern similar to that observed in human, PUM strongly localized to the most 3′ decile of mouse 3′UTRs compared to shuffled control motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s004">Figure S4C</xref>, binomial test <italic>p</italic>-value = 1.95E-9). However, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> was present in a similar percentage of 3′UTRs compared to shuffled control motifs with the same AU content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s004">Figure S4D</xref>), even though it is highest in the most 3′ decile. Thus, for mouse 3′UTRs, both PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> are enriched at the very end of 3′UTRs, but the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> enrichment is likely explained by the high AU-content at the end of mouse 3′UTRs.</p>

<title>Recognition sites for RBPs and specific miRNAs colocalize</title>
<p>We then asked whether the recognition sites of RBPs and miRNAs tend to be present close to each other on the same transcripts, as previous studies have reported that RBPs and miRNAs that functionally interact are often located close to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Sun1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kim1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Nolde1">[27]</xref>. For each pair of RBP and miRNA, we counted the number of neighboring RBP and miRNA recognition sites within 50 nts. As a control, we shuffled the identities of predicted miRNA recognition sites, while keeping their positions intact. An empirical <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated by comparing the observed number of neighboring RBP and miRNA recognition sites within 50 nts with the number of neighboring sites when the miRNA identities were randomized. For each RBP, miRNAs were classified as “interacting miRNAs” if they had a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 as determined by the Benjamini Hochberg procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Benjamini1">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>Among the five RBPs investigated, only PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> have miRNAs that are more abundant than expected within 50 nts of the RBP recognition site using this procedure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s016">Table S1</xref>). For ten 50-nt windows upstream and downstream from RBP recognition sites, we plotted the ratio of the observed number of miRNA recognition sites to the expected number of sites, as estimated by randomly shuffling miRNA site identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, for interacting miRNAs, the ratio of observed to expected events is high around the RBP sites, and is lower in more distant windows.</p>

<p>We performed a similar analysis to determine interacting miRNAs for the same RBPs in mouse and discovered that there are miRNAs that colocalize with the PUM recognition site or <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> in mouse 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Some miRNAs have recognition sites that co-localize with PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). For example, five of the seven miRNAs identified as PUM-interacting miRNAs in the human genome are also PUM-interacting miRNAs in mouse.</p>
<p>For the interacting miRNAs, we calculated the percentage of all miRNA recognition sites that are located within 50 nts from the sites of their preferentially co-localized RBPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s006">Figure S6</xref>). For both PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content>, the fraction of their interacting miRNA binding sites that are found proximal to RBP sites is around 4%. As expected, a smaller fraction of binding sites are proximal to the RBP recognition sites for non-interacting miRNAs in both human and mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p>We further tested whether PUM and its predicted interacting miRNAs are enriched in experimental data in which the binding sites for both PUM2 and AGO were experimentally profiled in HEK293T cells by Par-CLIP (Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside Enhanced Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Hafner1">[37]</xref>. We restricted the predicted PUM and miRNA recognition sites to only those identified by Par-CLIP analysis of PUM2 and AGO and counted the number of miRNA sites within 50 nts of PUM recognition sites. To define the background expectation, we permuted the identities of miRNA sites across chromosomes and counted the number of neighboring sites after restricting our analysis to sites within Par-CLIP regions. For each miRNA, an enrichment ratio was calculated as (the true number of neighboring sites)/(the average number of neighboring sites from 10000 shuffles). The interacting miRNAs showed significantly higher enrichment ratios than non-interacting miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s007">Figure S7A</xref>).</p>
<p>We also recognized that not all miRNAs are expressed in all cells. To address this issue, the interacting miRNAs were further classified based on the sequence read abundance in HEK293T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Hafner1">[37]</xref>. Expressed miRNAs, which were defined as the miRNAs with the top 25% read frequency, showed significantly higher enrichment ratios than non-expressed miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). Thus, the set of interacting miRNAs we predicted based on computational analysis of the genome sequence are also enriched based on Par-CLIP experimental data, and this enrichment shows the expected dependency on cell type-specific miRNA expression.</p>
<p>We also assessed the possible effects of AU content on co-localization of miRNA and RBP recognition sites. AU content has been reported to affect miRNA site effectiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Grimson1">[6]</xref>. Indeed, the recognition motifs for PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> and their co-localizing miRNA recognition seeds tend to be AU-rich (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s017">Table S2</xref>). To ensure that the co-occurrence observed between miRNAs and RBPs was not caused exclusively by the high AU composition of these motifs and their colocalization in AU-rich regions of 3′UTR, we evaluated shuffled RBP motifs with the same AU composition (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). For the two RBPs with co-occurring miRNAs, miRNA recognition motifs exhibited enrichment around true RBP recognition motifs compared to shuffled RBP control motifs generated to preserve AU content in the windows 50 nts up- or down-stream of the RBP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s008">Figure S8</xref>). The signal remained strong for PUM in both mouse and human, but was weaker for <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> after this correction. Thus, the RBP-miRNA co-localization that we observed, especially for PUM, cannot be explained simply by the AU composition of the recognition sites.</p>
<p>Using the same procedure as for human and mouse, no interacting miRNAs were predicted for fly and worm. We also determined the enrichment of miRNA recognition site density around each RBP site compared to the overall miRNA site density across all 3′UTRs with a RBP or miRNA recognition site. With this analysis, enrichment near the RBP recognition site for two RBP motifs was higher in human and mouse than the other two organisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s018">Table S3</xref>). However, since the quality of the 3′UTR annotations or the miRNA family member annotations may differ across organisms, more research will be needed to determine whether RBP-miRNA interactions are prevalent or limited to specific species.</p>

<title>PUM and miRNAs cooperate to affect mRNA decay</title>
<p>We next examined the functional effect of RBPs and miRNAs on transcript decay using three genome-wide mRNA half-life datasets. These datasets are genomewide measurements of mRNA half-lives in human B cells and mouse fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Friedel1">[58]</xref> and mRNA decay rates in human HepG2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Yang1">[59]</xref>. We determined the median half-life or decay rate for the set of transcripts that contain each of the recognition sites of interest. Transcripts containing a 3′UTR PUM or <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> site decayed faster than transcripts containing shuffled RBP motifs in all datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s009">Figure S9</xref>). The presence of Fox-1, U1A or Nova recognition sites was not consistently associated with faster decay.</p>
<p>Having determined that for certain pairs of RBPs and miRNAs, their binding sites are frequently present in 3′UTRs in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g003">Figure 3</xref>), we set out to further dissect the cooperativity between RBPs and miRNAs in mediating transcript decay. For each RBP, we divided all transcripts into four categories: “Int-proximal”: transcripts containing RBP recognition sites, and within 50 nts, a miRNA recognition site for one of the interacting miRNAs for that RBP; “Int-distant”: transcripts containing RBP recognition sites and miRNA recognition sites for one of the interacting miRNAs for that RBP, but none of the miRNA recognition sites and RBP recognition sites are within 50 nts of each other; “Nonint-proximal”: transcripts containing RBP recognition sites with at least one miRNA recognition site within 50 nts, but the miRNA is not an interacting miRNA for that RBP; “Nonint-distant”: transcripts containing RBP recognition sites with at least one non-interacting miRNA recognition site, but none of the RBP recognition sites and miRNA recognition sites are within 50 nts of each other.</p>
<p>For each RBP, mRNA half-life values or decay rates determined experimentally by Friedel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Friedel1">[58]</xref> and Yang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Yang1">[59]</xref> were considered for all transcripts in each of the four classes of transcripts defined above. For each mRNA decay dataset, data from small RNA sequencing experiments in the same cell line were used to define the set of miRNAs expressed, and only those miRNAs in the top 25% most sequenced miRNAs were considered for further analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Landgraf1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-1">[62]</xref>. For PUM, the presence of nearby interacting miRNA recognition sites, but not distant miRNA sites or nearby non-interacting miRNA sites, consistently increased the decay rate in both human B cells and mouse fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Friedel1">[58]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g004">Figure 4A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s019">Table S4</xref>).

Moreover for transcripts with recognition sites for PUM and its interacting miRNAs within 50 nts, expressed miRNAs promote decay consistently faster than non-expressed miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s011">Figure S11</xref>).</p>

<title>Pumilio recognition sites promote decay more effectively and are better conserved when present with interacting miRNAs.</title>
<p>Transcripts with a specific RBP recognition site were divided into four groups. Group “Int-proximal” contained transcripts with at least one RBP site and its interacting miRNA recognition site within 50 nts. Group “Int-distant” contained transcripts with both a RBP recognition site and a recognition site for its interacting miRNA, but no pair of RBP-miRNA site is within 50 nts. Group “Nonint-proximal” and “Nonint-distant” were similar to group “Int-proximal” or “Int-distant” except non-interacting miRNAs (not predicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g003">Figure 3</xref>) were analyzed. For each group of transcripts, the half lives (or conservation scores) were ranked and the (25%, 75%) range of the data were extracted and plotted with box-plots for visualization.

<p>We also tested whether the more rapid decay observed in transcripts with recognition sites for both PUM and miRNAs was a consequence of the high AU-content of the PUM recognition sites and the recognition sites of its interacting miRNAs. We utilized shuffled control motifs of PUM and miRNAs that have the same AU-content as the real motif. We established three groups of transcripts according to the presence of PUM and miRNA recognition sites on 3′UTRs: (Real), real RBP recognition sites and real recognition sites for interacting miRNAs within 50 nts; (miR_control), real RBP recognition sites and sites for shuffled interacting miRNA motifs within 50 nts; and (RBP_control), shuffled RBP motif sites and real interacting miRNA sites within 50 nts. We observed that transcripts with real PUM and interacting miRNA recognition sites have consistently shorter half-lives compared to transcripts in the two other control groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s012">Figure S12</xref>). Thus, the more rapid decay rate observed in 3′UTRs with interacting PUM and miRNA recognition sites is not simply a consequence of the high AU content of recognition motifs of PUM and its interacting miRNAs.</p>
<p>For <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content>, transcripts with both <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> sites and recognition sites of its interacting miRNAs in close proximity tend to have shorter mRNA half lives than transcripts in other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g004">Figure 4A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s010">Figure S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s011">S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s012">S12</xref>). However, the effect is less strong than the effect observed for PUM.</p>
<p>In addition to analyzing mRNA decay, we also extended our observations to evolutionary conservation. We discovered that for both PUM and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content>, recognition sites that are located within 50 bps of an interacting miRNA are better conserved than recognition sites located more than 50 bps from an interacting miRNA or within 50 bps of a non-interacting miRNA in both human and mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g004">Figure 4C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s010">Figure S10B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s020">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>We also ran Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for human genes with colocalized PUM and interacting miRNA recognition sites in their 3′UTRs. We found GO categories related to transcriptional regulation were enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s021">Table S6</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the synergistic effects of PUM and miRNAs on mRNA decay rate will subsequently affect the initiation of transcription for genes.</p>

<title>PUM rescues recognition site accessibility for PUM-interacting miRNAs</title>
<p>We further investigated why a specific group of miRNA recognition sites tend to be localized proximal to PUM recognition sites and promote decay. Previous studies have reported that for miR-221/222 and miR-410, PUM can alleviate the constraints of RNA secondary structure and make miRNA binding sites more accessible to the RISC complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kedde2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Leibovich1">[63]</xref>. We hypothesized that the genome-wide co-occurrence of PUM and a specific set of miRNAs is related to the ability of PUM to rescue miRNA recognition site accessibility.</p>
<p>To address this issue on a genome-wide scale, we used a computational approach to estimate the frequency of RBP regulation of local 3′UTR secondary structure. For each pair of neighboring RBP-miRNA recognition sites, we determined the number of base pairs of miRNA recognition site that RBP binding can rescue from pairing with other nucleotides within the 3′UTR as estimated by RNAfold (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Leibovich1">[63]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kertesz1">[65]</xref>. As an example, when we used RNAfold to determine the secondary structure for the p27<sup>Kip1</sup> 3′UTR, we discovered that 6 out of 7 base pairs of the miR-221/222 recognition seed site were hybridized to other nucleotides and therefore inaccessible due to the sequence's secondary structure. When we simulated PUM binding by converting all of the bases in the PUM recognition sites to N's, and thus made them unavailable to hybridize to other bases in the sequence, 0 base pairs of the miR-221/222 seed site were blocked. We calculate the amount of miRNA site rescue as 6−0 = 6.</p>
<p>For each RBP, we plotted the histogram of miRNA site rescue counts for RBP sites in close proximity to recognition sites for interacting miRNAs, and non-interacting miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g005">Figure 5A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s013">Figure S13A</xref>, B). When we performed this analysis for PUM, interacting miRNAs produced significantly higher rescue counts than non-interacting miRNAs in both human and mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g005">Figure 5A, B</xref>, Wilcoxon <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;1E-10 for both human and mouse).

For PUM, the proportion of RBP recognition sites with large rescue counts was consistently higher in the true histogram than in the background model, while the proportion of smaller rescue counts was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g005">Figure 5C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s014">Figure S14</xref>, Wilcoxon <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;1E-10 for both human and mouse).

In summary, miRNA recognition sites located near a PUM site have a significantly increased frequency of high recognition site rescue by simulated PUM binding than expected by chance.</p>

<p>By comparing real and shuffled PUM motifs, we found that the reverse recognition motifs for PUM tend to have larger alignment scores with interacting miRNA seed sequences than shuffled PUM motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s015">Figure S15</xref>). Thus, the observed enrichment of higher miRNA rescue counts for PUM is likely to derive from its reverse complementarity with a specific group of miRNA seeds that also have recognition sites preferentially co-localized with PUM recognition sites. For all interacting miRNAs in human or mouse, we diagrammed their 8mer seed (7mer+1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Grimson1">[6]</xref>) sequences aligned to the reverse PUM motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

<title>Prevalent models for RBP-miRNA interactions</title>
<p>Some previous studies on RBP-miRNA interactions have experimentally demonstrated specific instances in which RBPs and miRNAs compete with each other, sometimes for the same binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Mukherjee1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kedde1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Elcheva1">[25]</xref>. In this model, the presence of a RBP recognition site would protect the associated transcript from miRNA-mediated decay and stabilize it. However, this mode of interaction does not seem to be prevalent among the RBP-miRNA interactions we uncovered from our transcriptome-wide analysis as the presence of both a recognition site for a RBP and a miRNA did not result in a global shift toward more stable transcripts using the methodology we employed.</p>
<p>Another model for RBP-miRNA interactions involves RBPs binding closely to miRNA sites and altering the local secondary structure to make miRNA sites more accessible to the RISC complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kedde2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Leibovich1">[63]</xref>. When PUM was computationally folded with nearby miRNA recognition sites, the presence of the RBP resulted in increased availability of the miRNA recognition sites. For PUM, the rescue counts were higher for the interacting miRNA sites than for non-interacting miRNAs and background models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>For the PUM recognition site, we are able to develop a computational model to explain the miRNA-specific interactions based on reverse complementarity between the recognition seeds for miRNAs and the PUM recognition motif, which is advantageous for formation of hairpin loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g006">Figure 6</xref>). A previous report described a case study in which miR-221/222 pairs up with the PUM recognition sequence to achieve condition-specific miRNA-mediated decay of the p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, based on PUM expression and its phosphorylation state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kedde2">[29]</xref>. Our analysis indicates that the mechanism described for this particular case may also occur for other miRNAs. Further, selective pressure for this mechanism may have shaped the localization pattern of a group of miRNAs by enriching them to be close to PUM recognition sites. Regulation of the levels or activity of RBPs represents a previously unappreciated mechanism for increasing or decreasing the efficiency of many miRNA binding sites simultaneously.</p>
<p>For the ARE element <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content>, we identified a group of miRNAs that are enriched in their co-localization with its recognition sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These sites may have a function because <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> motifs are more evolutionarily conserved if they are proximal to an interacting miRNA recognition site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g004">Figure 4C, D</xref>) and they did promote more rapid decay, although the effect was not as significant as the effect observed for PUM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g004">Figure 4A, B</xref>). However, the presence of <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> demonstrated no capacity to rescue miRNA binding sites from secondary structure. Our data suggest that <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content> may cooperate with nearby miRNAs to affect transcript decay through a different mechanism, but more studies will be needed to clarify whether there is an effect of proximal <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content>-interacting miRNA sites on transcript decay and its mechanistic basis.</p>
<p>In sum, our results estimated the prevalence of synergistic interactions between PUM and miRNAs. Some previous observations about miRNA targeting, including the efficiency of miRNA recognition sites in 3′UTRs, in AU-rich regions and at the beginning and end of the 3′UTR may be partially explained by synergistic interactions with RBPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Grimson1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Forman1">[69]</xref>. Currently, 829 human proteins are annotated as having RNA binding capacity by Gene Ontology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Ashburner1">[70]</xref> and we have only investigated the small fraction of them for which recognition site information is available. Other RBPs may also mediate the accessibility of miRNA recognition sites. A more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between miRNAs and RBPs could improve our ability to predict their targets and physiological functions, and provide insight into the mechanistic basis for their action.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Multiple genome alignment and 3′UTR annotation</title>
<p>Gene annotations for human, mouse, fly and worm were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>). Multiple genome alignments for the human genome (hg19) aligned with 32 placental mammals and mouse genome (mm9) with 29 vertebrates were also downloaded from the UCSC genome browser. 3′UTR regions were extracted for further analysis. Branch lengths for the associated phylogenetic tree were also downloaded.</p>
<p>The 3′UTR was defined as the region between the last stop codon and the 3′ end of the spliced mRNA. In some unusual cases, 3′UTRs are formed by the union of several distinct exons and cannot be mapped to a single continuous region on the genome assembly. For ease of analysis, we considered the last spliced exon, excluding any overlap with the protein-coding region, to be the 3′UTR. We also required that each 3′UTR was longer than 10 nts. In total, we analyzed 18,854 human 3′UTRs with average length 1,292.3 +/− 1,480.3 as standard deviation. Among these 3′UTRs, 17,766 were initiated at the stop codon and had no overlap with any coding region, and thus 94.2% of the 3′UTR annotations are complete.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>RBP and miRNA recognition motif selection</title>
<p>All RBP binding motifs were first converted to consensus sequences. We expressed the consensus sequences as regular expressions, and used the regular expressions to search for recognition sites within the genomic sequence. We searched the 3′UTRs of the transcribed strands in multiple genome alignments for RBP recognition motifs in all aligned sequences. For each motif hit in the reference genome, we determined whether the same recognition motif was present within 10 nts in either direction in each of the other genomes. Based on the presence or absence of the motif within the investigated genomes, we calculated the branch length score (BLS) by defining the minimum phylogenetic sub-tree that includes all conserved instances of the motif. The BLS is the branch length of this sub-tree as a fraction of the entire tree. Using this method, the BLS of individual motif hits can be inflated by a single hit to a distant species. To avoid this, we assigned no score to the most distant hit if there was a gap to that species that included more than one-third of the number of aligned genomes, and if the evolutionary distance from the most distant genome to the reference genome was more than twice as large as the distance to the second-most distant genome.</p>
<p>In order to assess the extent of conservation for each RBP motif, we generated 200 shuffled motifs by randomly swapping the nucleotides within the recognition motif. To remove redundant shuffled motifs, we profiled the similarity of each pair of motifs using Tomtom to generate <italic>p</italic>-values among the canonical and shuffled recognition motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Gupta1">[71]</xref>. We ranked the <italic>p</italic>-values and determined the 10% threshold for the pairs with the most similar <italic>p</italic>-values. We eliminated shuffled motifs if they fell within this range and thus were considered too similar to any previously generated shuffled motif or the canonical motif. From the remaining motifs, we selected ten or the maximum possible number of shuffled motifs. When possible, we selected shuffled motifs that had a similar number of hits (±20%) to the canonical motif from the reference genome. Through these criteria, we largely corrected for differences in the frequencies of di and tri-nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Lewis1">[72]</xref>. For certain recognition motifs, nearly all shuffled motifs were associated with significantly fewer hits than the canonical motif. In this case, we selected 10 or the maximum possible number of arbitrary shuffled motifs as controls. For some RBP motifs with low complexity, for instance, sequences that were represented by a string of U's, we could not create three distinct shuffled motifs. These motifs were eliminated from further analysis.</p>
<p>We compared the conservation BLS scores for the canonical motif and each shuffled motif within the genome. We then determined the number of occurrences of hits to the genome for the canonical motifs and the average among shuffled motifs for 100 different BLS thresholds from 0 to 1 with increments of 0.01. For each BLS threshold, we determined the precision as 1 – (the average number of matches of shuffled motifs)/(the number of matches of the canonical motif). We selected for further analysis RBPs for which the recognition motif contained more than 10 motif hits above a precision threshold of 0.6.</p>
<p>Mature human, mouse, fly and worm miRNA annotations were downloaded from Targetscan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://targetscan.org" xlink:type="simple">http://targetscan.org</ext-link>). Two types of miRNA seeds were used: miRNA nucleotides 2–8 (m8) and nucleotides 2–7 with an adenosine opposite miRNA position 1 (1A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Grimson1">[6]</xref>. miRNA recognition seed motifs were defined as the complements of the miRNA seed and only conserved miRNA families were considered in further analyses.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4c">
<title>RBP-miRNA motif site interaction</title>
<p>For each pair of miRNA and RBP, we defined the position of the RBP recognition motifs and identified the locations of the neighboring miRNA recognition sites in either direction. We generated histograms to depict the frequency with which the closest miRNA recognition motifs were present at ten different 50 nt windows 5′ and 3′ of the RBP motif. To generate a background model, we shuffled the identities of the miRNAs within each chromosome while keeping their positions intact. By shuffling the miRNA identities, we specifically tested the importance of co-localization with that particular miRNA. This approach eliminates any bias introduced by the fact that miRNA binding sites tend to be present together. Ten thousand shuffles were generated.</p>
<p>For each RBP, in each 50-nt-window, we compared the number of miRNA recognition sites for the real distribution versus the number derived from shuffled distributions. For each miRNA seed, the empirical <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated as the proportion of times that the number of miRNA sites was equal to or larger than the real number of miRNA sites when 10,000 shuffles were performed. We then applied the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure on the <italic>p</italic>-values, and selected interacting miRNAs for each RBP with a FDR&lt; = 0.05 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Benjamini1">[57]</xref>. Since for each miRNA there are two possible types of miRNA recognition seeds (1A and m8) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Grimson1">[6]</xref>, we required both of them to pass the FDR threshold of 0.05 to be included as an interacting miRNA.</p>
<p>Both RBPs and miRNAs tend to have recognition sites located at the beginning or end of 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g002">Figure 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Majoros1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Gaidatzis1">[49]</xref>. The miRNAs are more effective when localized in AU-rich regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Grimson1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Sun1">[8]</xref>. Further, several of the RBP recognition motifs investigated have high AU content, with the most extreme instance being <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUUUAU</named-content>. Thus, it is possible that the RBP-miRNA site colocalization we observed is a reflection of the similar positional preference of RBPs and miRNAs or their similarity with respect to the AU-richness of both types of motifs. In order to control for positional preference and AU content, we derived additional miRNA site identity shuffling procedures. To control for positional preference, all 3′UTRs were equally divided into 10 deciles and miRNA recognition sites were grouped according to the 3′UTR decile to which they belong. Then the identities of the miRNAs were shuffled among each 3′UTR decile group; in this way, miRNA sites located at the very end (or beginning) of 3′UTRs were swapped exclusively with other miRNA sites located at the very end (or beginning) of 3′UTRs.</p>
<p>To control for AU content, miRNA recognition seeds of 1A and m8 were classified into 3 groups based on the number of nucleotides that are an A or U out of the seven base pairs in the seed sequence. Category 1 contained miRNAs with a high (6 or 7) number of A/U nucleotides; category 2 contained miRNAs with a medium (3–5) number of A/U nucleotides; and category 3 contained miRNAs with a low (0–2) number of A/U nucleotides. The identities of miRNAs were shuffled with other miRNAs within the same category. In this way, AU-rich miRNA recognition sites were swapped exclusively with other AU rich miRNA sites. Empirical <italic>p</italic>-values and Benjamini-Hochberg correction were performed as described above.</p>
<p>We only accepted miRNAs identified by the intersection of all three methods as interacting miRNAs for each RBP in each window. We found the window of 50 nts closest to the RBP site contained the largest number of interacting miRNAs, while windows that were more distant contained fewer or none (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s016">Table S1</xref>). To compile our final set of interacting miRNAs for each RBP, we only considered the miRNAs identified in the first 50 nt window. For each 50 nt window, an enrichment ratio was defined and visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) as the minimum ratio of (number of miRNA sites)/(expected number) among the three different shuffle methods.</p>

<title>Test for the effect of AU content on RBP-miRNA interaction</title>
<p>When defining interacting miRNAs for each RBP, we explicitly accounted for the AU content of miRNAs by only shuffling across miRNAs with similar recognition seed AU content. In order to test the impact of the AU content of the RBP motifs, we generated window plots comparing the distribution of true RBP motifs to the distribution of shuffled RBP motifs (generated in the RBP recognition motif selection section). We created ten 50 nt windows upstream and downstream of each RBP motif and shuffled RBP motifs and counted the number of real miRNA recognition sites. For each window, the enrichment ratio was defined as ([Number of pairs for real RBP site and real miRNA site]/[Number of pairs for shuffled RBP site and real miRNA site]) normalized by an overall ratio of ([Number of pairs for real RBP site and real miRNA site across all windows]/[Number of pairs for shuffled RBP site and real miRNA site across all windows]). For each RBP and its interacting miRNAs, enrichment ratios were visualized with heatmaps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003075.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of RBPs on miRNA site accessibility</title>
<p>To test whether the binding of RBPs makes miRNA recognition sites more accessible, we analyzed sequences that contain RBP and miRNA recognition sites within 50 nts of each other, and included an extra 5 nts upstream of the 5′ most site and 5 nts downstream of the 3′ most site. We computationally folded these sequences using RNAfold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Hofacker1">[64]</xref> and determined the count C1 as the number of base pairs within the miRNA recognition seed site that are paired. Then, we converted all of the nucleotides within the RBP recognition site and one flanking nucleotide on each side to an ‘N’ to mask them from pairing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Leibovich1">[63]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Kertesz1">[65]</xref>, and reran RNAfold to determine the number of base pairs within the miRNA site that were paired as count C2. For RNAfold predicted structure with folding energy larger than −1 kcal/mol, we considered this structure to be totally open and ignored any base pairing predicted. Finally, we calculated the rescue count C = C1–C2.</p>
<p>In order to generate a background distribution of rescue counts, for each pair of neighboring miRNA and RBP sites localized within 50 nts, we randomized the sequence itself, but preserved the relative positions of the miRNA and RBP recognition sites. For this randomization, we preserved the mono and di-nucleotide frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Altschul1">[66]</xref>, as RNA folding energy is known to depend on di-nucleotide base stacking energies, and certain known RNA structures, such as tRNAs, have indistinguishable folding energy from di-nucleotide-preserving shuffles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Krogh1">[67]</xref>. After randomizing the sequence for all miRNA-RBP neighboring sites, we repeated the rescue count calculation again. Ten randomizations were generated to estimate the average and standard deviation of the rescue counts in the background model.</p>
<p>To score the ability of miRNA recognition seed sequences to hybridize with the reverse RBP recognition motif, we used a simple scoring scheme in which A-U, G-C and G-U base pair matches were scored as 2, mismatches were scored as 0, and insertions and deletions were penalized with −1. The Smith-Waterman algorithm was then applied to find the best alignment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003075-Smith1">[68]</xref>.</p>

<p><bold>miRNA-RBP colocalization is not simply a consequence of AU-content.</bold> For RBPs and their interacting miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003075-g003">Figure 3</xref>), we considered each of ten 50-nt windows upstream and ten 50-nt windows downstream of a RBP binding motif. We determined the enrichment ratio of the number of miRNA recognition sites located in that window compared to the number of miRNA sites localized to shuffled RBP motifs with the same nucleotide content, normalized by their overall numbers across all 50-nt windows (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).
