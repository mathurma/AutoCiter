<p>Directional control of bacterial motility is regulated by dynamic polarity inversions driven by pole-to-pole oscillation of a Ras family small G-protein and its associated GTPase-activating protein.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Regulated cell polarity is central to many cellular processes. We investigated the mechanisms that govern the rapid switching of cell polarity (reversals) during motility of the bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>. Cellular reversals are mediated by pole-to-pole oscillations of motility proteins and the frequency of the oscillations is under the control of the Frz chemosensory system. However, the molecular mechanism that creates dynamic polarity remained to be characterized. In this work, we establish that polarization is regulated by the GTP cycle of a Ras-like GTPase, MglA. We initially sought an MglA regulator and purified a protein, MglB, which was found to activate GTP hydrolysis by MglA. Using live fluorescence microscopy, we show that MglA and MglB localize at opposite poles and oscillate oppositely when cells reverse. In absence of MglB, MglA-YFP accumulates at the lagging cell end, leading to a strikingly aberrant reversal cycle. Spatial control of MglA is achieved through the GAP activity of MglB because an MglA mutant that cannot hydrolyze GTP accumulates at the lagging cell end, despite the presence of MglB. Genetic and cell biological studies show that the MglA-GTP cycle controls dynamic polarity and the reversal switch. The study supports a model wherein a chemosensory signal transduction system (Frz) activates reversals by relieving a spatial inhibition at the back pole of the cells: reversals are allowed by Frz-activated switching of MglB to the opposite pole, allowing MglA-GTP to accumulate at the back of the cells and create the polarity switch. In summary, our results provide insight into how bacteria regulate their polarity dynamically, revealing unsuspected conserved regulations with eukaryots.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Motile cells have evolved complex regulatory networks to respond to environmental cues and change their direction of movement appropriately. In this process, an arsenal of receptor-coupled small G-proteins acts as a cellular compass to dynamically polarize the leading edge and regulate the motility response. However, the precise mechanism of action of these G-proteins in controlling bacteria movement on solid surfaces has remained an enigma. We investigate this process in Gram negative <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> cells. Surprisingly, we find that the Ras-like small G-protein MglA polarizes the cell by accumulating at the leading cell pole in its active GTP-bound form. This localization is dependent on MglB, a GTPase-activating protein that converts MglA to its inactive form specifically at the opposite, lagging cell pole. Furthermore, we show that a receptor-coupled signal transduction cascade can activate re-localization of MglA and MglB at opposite poles in a synchronous manner, resulting in inversion of the polarity axis and cell movement in the opposite direction. Thus, a simple, eukaryote-like signaling module also governs dynamic polarity mechanisms in bacteria, demonstrating broader conservation of these signaling systems than initially suspected.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In living cells, environmental changes and cell-cell regulations require transient cellular processes relying on the ability of the cells to regulate their underlying ultrastructures dynamically. For example, during chemotaxis, eukaryotic cells sense and migrate towards a chemical gradient, which requires complex spatial regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Janetopoulos1">[1]</xref>. The cells use a directional sensing system as a compass to favor the formation of pseudopodia towards or away from a source of chemoattractrant or repellent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Janetopoulos1">[1]</xref>. In this process, the cell adopts a polarized morphology, to define a front and a rear to coordinate actin polymerization at the leading edge with contractile forces generated by myosin motors at the rear. The actin cytoskeleton and the membrane are rearranged by a complex signaling network involving Receptor/G-proteins and, centrally, small GTPases of the Ras superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Charest1">[2]</xref>. For example, in leukocytes, or in the amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoidum</italic>, polarization is achieved by a complex interplay of multiple small GTP-binding proteins at the front and the rear involving Ras, Rac, Cdc42, and Rho (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Charest1">[2]</xref> for a detailed review of these regulations).</p>
<p>Owing to the small size of the bacterial cell, it is generally accepted that dynamic processes such as motility are regulated at the temporal rather than at the spatial level. For example, chemotaxis in liquid media relies on a temporal signal transduction cascade that switches the rotation of the flagellum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Wadhams1">[3]</xref>. However, one conspicuous example of dynamic cell polarization occurs during <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> motility over solid surfaces (gliding motility): rod-shaped <italic>myxococcus</italic> cells control their direction of movement by inverting their polarity, rapidly switching their leading pole into their lagging cell pole (cellular reversal) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mignot1">[4]</xref>. Cellular reversals are highly regulated and mutants with impaired reversal frequencies cannot accomplish complex multicellular behaviors such as predation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Berleman1">[5]</xref> and the capacity to develop fruiting bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Bustamante1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Cellular reversals imply that the directionality of the motility machinery can be rapidly inverted. In <italic>Myxococcus</italic>, two motility engines power locomotion: the first motility engine, a type-IV pilus, polymerizes fibers at the leading cell pole, which act as “grappling hooks” as they extend and retract to pull the cell forward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Sun1">[7]</xref>. The pili constitute the so-called Social (S)-motility system because they are involved in the movement within large cell groups, presumably because they allow tight cell-cell interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Li1">[8]</xref>; the second motility system is not as well characterized and involves dynamic eukaryotic-like focal adhesions and the secretion of a polysaccharidic slime <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mignot2">[9]</xref>. This system is usually referred to as the Adventurous (A)-motility system because in contrast to the pili, it promotes the movement of single isolated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Hodgkin1">[10]</xref>. Recently, (A)- and (S)-motility components have been tracked in live gliding cells by time lapse fluorescence microcopy using chimeric fluorescent reporter proteins. Core type-IV pilus sub-units were found to be pre-assembled at both cell poles, but some key subunits, the extension and retraction ATPases and the FrzS protein, shuttled from pole-to-pole and were only clustered at one pole, suggesting that reversals occur following completion of an active pilus machine at the leading cell pole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Bulyha1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mignot3">[12]</xref>. Likewise, the A-motility focal adhesions, visualized by the AglZ-YFP protein, are assembled at the leading cell pole and are slowly moved to the rear where they are dispersed; at the time of reversal, the existing AglZ clusters are first dispersed and then reassembled from the new leading pole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mignot4">[13]</xref>. A-motility also involves proteins that accumulate and switch at the back of the cell (RomR), showing that motility requires both a head and a tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Leonardy1">[14]</xref>. The two motility systems must be coordinated not to counteract each other, meaning that their directionality must be switched together when the cell reverses. Consistent with this, FrzS (S-motility) and RomR (A-motility) have been shown to oscillate synchronously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Leonardy1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Synchronous pole-pole oscillations of proteins belonging to the (A)- and (S)-motility are regulated by the Frz chemotaxis-like system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mignot3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mignot4">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Leonardy1">[14]</xref>. The Frz core components involve a cytosolic chemoreceptor-like protein FrzCD, its coupling protein FrzA, and a cognate histidine kinase FrzE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Bustamante1">[6]</xref>. Auto-phosphorylation of FrzE following receptor activation allows transfer of phosphoryl groups to the downstream response regulator FrzZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Inclan1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Inclan2">[16]</xref>. <italic>frz</italic>-null mutations decrease the cellular reversal frequency dramatically, whereas <italic>frz</italic>-gain of function mutations (<italic>frzCD<sup>c</sup></italic>) increase the reversal frequency. Consistent with this, both classes of mutations respectively abolish or increase spatial oscillations of the (A)- and (S)-motility protein reporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mignot3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mignot4">[13]</xref>. It was suggested that the Frz system constitutes a biochemical oscillator to regulate a downstream spatial oscillator, thus acting as a molecular clock to finely tune the reversal frequency to the ever-changing environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Igoshin1">[17]</xref>. However, proving this attractive hypothesis will require extended characterization of the regulation mechanism.</p>
<p>How is the cell dynamically polarized to target motility proteins to opposite cell poles when cells reverse? A likely candidate for such regulation is the MglA protein, a bacterial small G-protein of the Ras-superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mauriello1">[18]</xref>. Previously, it was shown that MglA interacts directly with FrzS and AglZ and that FrzS, AglZ, and RomR are mislocalized in an <italic>mglA</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Leonardy1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mauriello1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Yang1">[19]</xref>. Assembly of the focal adhesion clusters specifically requires MglA to cooperate with the MreB actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mauriello1">[18]</xref>. A difficulty is that MglA is required for the functionality of the motility engines themselves; thus, it could not be determined if MglA also has a role in directional control.</p>
<p>In this work, we investigated the role of the MglA GTP cycle and found that MglA acts as a cornerstone to coordinate spatial assembly and activity of the motility engines. We found that the establishment of a dynamic polarity axis relies directly on the sequestration of the MglA GTP-bound form at the leading cell pole and characterized a novel GTPase Activating Protein responsible for this spatial regulation.</p>

<title>MglB Is a Guanine Nucleotide Hydrolysis Activating Protein (GAP) for MglA</title>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, small G-proteins are critically regulated by Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) and GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Bernards1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Bos1">[21]</xref>. We have previously established that MglA can hydrolyze GTP, albeit at very slow rates in vitro, suggesting that an MglA-regulator with GAP activity could exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mauriello1">[18]</xref>. Based on sequence conservation, extensive search of the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> genome did not reveal eukaryotic-like regulators. Yet MglA is co-expressed with MglB, the founder member of a family of proteins that contains a so-called roadblock domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Hartzell1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Koonin1">[23]</xref>. The function of roadblock domains has not been demonstrated experimentally, but bioinformatics suggested that they might regulate the activity of a cognate NTPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Koonin1">[23]</xref>. Thus, MglB and MglB-like proteins could be prokaryotic regulators of bacterial small G-proteins such as MglA. To test this possibility, we purified recombinant MglA and MglB proteins to analyze in vitro whether MglB could act as a GAP for MglA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In vitro, MglA bound but did not significantly hydrolyze radio-labeled GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). This result is consistent with previous results, showing that MglA hydrolyzed GTP at an extremely low rate in an enzyme-coupled assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mauriello1">[18]</xref>. In marked contrast, addition of MglB stimulated GTP hydrolysis by MglA in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). MglB alone did not bind radioactive GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, MglB was not found to affect GDP/GTP exchange on MglA: MglB stabilized the GTP bound form slightly (like a classical G-protein effector, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) but did not modify the GDP off rate of MglA (unpublished data). Thus, MglB is an MglA GAP, which functions by switching MglA-GTP to MglA-GDP.</p>

<title>MglB Is an Inhibitor of Cellular Reversals</title>
<p>What is the function of MglB in vivo? mglAB are encoded within a putative operon. In a previous work, deletion of <italic>mglB</italic> resulted in a dramatic reduction of the MglA levels, which precluded in-depth study of the function of MglB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Hartzell2">[24]</xref>. MglB was proposed to have a chaperone function for MglA explaining the observed lack of MglA stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Hartzell2">[24]</xref>, yet the low levels of MglA expression could also have been due to polar effects of the <italic>mglB</italic> deletion. To test the function of <italic>mglB</italic> in vivo, we deleted the region encoding residues 10–159 of <italic>mglB</italic> (MglB contains 159 residues). To show that this <italic>mglB</italic> deletion created no downstream polar effects on the expression of <italic>mglA</italic>, we successfully complemented the Δ<italic>mglB</italic> mutant by integrating another copy of <italic>mglB</italic> at an ectopic site on the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> chromosome (the Mx8-phage attachment site, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000430.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).

<p>We tested the motility of the <italic>ΔmglB</italic>, <italic>ΔmglA</italic>, and <italic>ΔmglAB</italic> mutants in the hard (testing both A- and S-motility) and soft (testing S-motility only) agar assays.

The motility defect of the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant may be due to defects of the motility engines, aberrant directional control, or both. Time-lapse analysis of <italic>ΔmglB</italic> motile cells revealed that the cells moved with WT velocities (unpublished data).

<p>The Frz pathway regulates the reversal frequency of <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Blackhart1">[25]</xref>. We wondered where MglB acts in the pathway.

To confirm the epistastic relationship between <italic>mglB</italic> and <italic>frz</italic>, we also combined a <italic>frzCD<sup>c</sup></italic> mutation (a mutation that hyperactivates Frz signaling) with the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> deletion. Both mutants hyper-reverse but they have significantly distinct reversal frequencies: the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant has an average frequency of ∼10 rev.hour<sup>−1</sup>, while the <italic>frzCD<sup>c</sup></italic> has an average frequency of ∼40 rev.hour<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). A <italic>frzCD<sup>c</sup> ΔmglB</italic> mutant reversed with frequencies that were indistinguishable from the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant (∼10 rev.hour<sup>−1</sup>), confirming that <italic>mglB</italic> acts downstream from the Frz-pathway. Agar swarming assays showed that the swarming pattern of the <italic>ΔfrzE ΔmglB</italic> was almost identical to the swarming pattern of the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant, confirming that <italic>mglB</italic> acts downstream from the Frz pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000430.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>To clarify whether the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant is indeed distinct from the <italic>ΔfrzE ΔmglB</italic> mutant, we measured the average distances traveled by the cells between reversals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that the <italic>ΔfrzE ΔmglB</italic> mutant cells moved on average a distance corresponding to 4–5 cell lengths before they reversed (versus ∼8 cell lengths for the WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). On the contrary, the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant cells almost systematically reversed after moving a distance corresponding to one cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, see below).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that the Frz pathway activates cellular reversals by relieving an inhibition that <italic>mglB</italic> exerts on <italic>mglA</italic>: low reversal frequencies in <italic>frz</italic>-null mutants can thus be explained by a failure to relieve MglB inhibition, a mechanism that depends on FrzZ. However, Frz must also be able to signal to MglA independently from MglB because Frz-dependent regulation (albeit highly abnormal) is still detected when the reversal frequency of <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant is compared to the reversal frequency of double <italic>ΔfrzE ΔmglB</italic> mutant (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).

<title>MglA and MglB Oscillate Synchronously and Inversely</title>
<p>Our genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that MglB inhibits reversals by activating GTP hydrolysis by MglA at the lagging cell pole. In a previous work, we constructed a partially functional MglA-YFP chimera: cells expressing MglA-YFP alone were motile but significantly impaired in their reversal frequency, precluding studies of MglA dynamics during the reversal cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000430.s003">Figure S3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mauriello1">[18]</xref>). To monitor the dynamics of MglA-YFP in reversing cell, we expressed MglA-YFP in the presence of MglA. In these merodiploid cells, expression of MglA-YFP was not associated with detectable motility defects (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000430.s011">Protocol S1</xref> for details on the construction and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000430.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, we conclude that MglA-YFP dynamics during reversal can be studied using the merodiploid system, which will be systematically used for the rest of this study.</p>
<p>In a fluorescent time-lapse motility assay, MglA-YFP localized at the leading cell and within fixed internal clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g004">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000430.s004">S4B</xref>). MglA-YFP oscillated from pole to pole and was systematically redirected to the new leading pole at the time of reversal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). Cross-correlation analysis also confirmed that MglAYFP oscillations are coupled with the reversal cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, the localization of MglA-YFP is coupled to the reversal cycle. MglA-YFP dynamics were clearly regulated by the Frz pathway: in a <italic>ΔfrzE</italic> mutant oscillations of MglA-YFP were abolished (unpublished data), while they were enhanced and correlated with increased cellular reversals in a <italic>frzCD<sup>c</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g004">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000430.s005">S5</xref>), confirming that MglA is a downstream component of the reversal switching machinery.</p>

<p>MglB could inhibit cellular reversals by catalyzing the transition from MglA-GTP to MglA-GDP at the lagging cell pole.

If so, a mutation that locks MglA in its GTP-bound form should mimic the <italic>mglB</italic> mutation. We designed an MglA mutant where Glutamine 82 is replaced by a Leucine, a mutation predicted to lock MglA in its GTP-bound state by inhibiting GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000430.s006">Figure S6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Klein1">[26]</xref>). In vitro, MglA<sub>Q82L</sub> bound GTP stably like the WT MglA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000430.s006">Figure S6B</xref>), but contrarily to WT MglA and as expected, addition of MglB failed to activate hydrolysis, showing that MglA<sub>Q82L</sub> cannot hydrolyze GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

<title>The MglAB Module Creates Dynamic Cell Polarity</title>
<p>Our results suggest that the MglA and MglB proteins define the polarity switch that controls cellular reversals. However, an outstanding question remains: Why are cells still reversing in absence of a GTP hydrolysis cycle (for example in <italic>ΔmglB</italic> and <italic>mglA<sub>Q82L</sub></italic> cells)? This seems paradoxical because a simple assumption was that in absence of dynamic polarization, the cells would be non-reversing rather than hyper-reversing. A clue, however, is that in all cases the cells reverse after they moved the distance of one cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Since single motile cells move essentially by A-motility, we analyzed AglZ-YFP dynamics in the <italic>mglA<sub>Q82L</sub></italic> mutant. In WT cells, AglZ-YFP localizes at the leading pole and assembles within fixed adhesion clusters dispersed at the back of the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000430.s008">Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mignot4">[13]</xref>).

Cells systematically reversed once the AglZ-YFP clusters accumulated at the lagging cell end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Comparable results were obtained in the <italic>mglB</italic> mutant (unpublished data). Thus, AglZ-YFP no longer oscillates between poles in absence of the MglA GTP-cycle. Instead, we propose that the cells reverse because the A-motility system is intrinsically capable to switch its own directionality, for example, once key regulatory proteins such as AglZ accumulate at the lagging cell pole (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

It is thus especially striking that the cellular regulatory mechanisms governing motility control in <italic>M. xanthus</italic>, a prokaryot, are conceptually similar. In this organism, a small G-protein (MglA) is spatially restricted to the leading cell pole in its GTP-bound form because its cognate GAP (MglB) excludes it from the opposite pole.

<title>How Does MglAB Create Dynamic Cell Polarity?</title>
<p>MglA-binding cues may in fact exist at both cell poles because MglA-GTP is bi-polar in absence of MglB regulation (i.e., MglA<sub>Q82L</sub> or MglA in the <italic>mglB</italic> mutant).

<p>Several lines of evidence suggest that MglAB is the polarity generator that creates cellular reversals: (i) MglA acts downstream from the Frz pathway and switches systematically to the new leading pole. (ii) Expression of an MglA variant locked in its GTP-bound state is epistatic over <italic>Δfrz</italic> and <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutations, showing that MglA is the most downstream component of the regulatory cascade that controls reversals. (iii) MglA interacts directly with FrzS and AglZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mauriello1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Yang1">[19]</xref> and is essential for the dynamic localization of FrzS, AglZ, and RomR. (iv) The perturbations of the MglA GTP cycle affect dynamic polarity of MglA itself and creates aberrant dynamic behaviors of the downstream proteins FrzS, AglZ, and RomR. (v) MglA is a <italic>bona fide</italic> small G-protein, a class of essential polarity regulators in eukaryotic cells. The results suggest that MglB acts to sequester MglA-GTP at the leading cell pole where it would activate both motility systems, for example, by engaging FrzS and AglZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Consistent with this, MglA<sub>Q82L</sub>-YFP, a GTP-locked mutant, accumulates at the lagging cell pole, despite the presence of MglB. MglB may also trigger dispersal of the focal adhesion clusters by inactivating cluster-associated MglA and preventing uncontrolled A-motility directional switches (see below). Thus, a Frz-dependent mechanism could simply invert the polarity axis by switching MglB to the opposite cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>

<p>This model is attractive but still has a number of unresolved questions. How are MglA and MglB switched to generate reversals? MglA- and MglB-YFP do not accumulate gradually at opposite poles but rather are rapidly relocated at the time of reversal (within ∼30 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g004">4B</xref>), arguing that a transient signal input triggers the switch. Interestingly, bursts of phosphorylated FrzZ are predicted by mathematical modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Igoshin1">[17]</xref>. If true, FrzZ may trigger re-localization of MglB to the opposite cell pole directly, potentially by inhibiting the MglB GAP activity. However, this scenario is probably over-simplistic: our results clearly point to the existence of additional MglA regulators: the “pendulum” motility of the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant can be suppressed partially by deletion of either <italic>frzE</italic> or <italic>frzZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting the existence of an additional Frz-modulated regulator of MglA. <italic>frz</italic> suppression does not occur in cells expressing the MglA GTP-locked variant; thus, the suppression mechanism specifically occurs at the level of the MglA GTP cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, MglA may be mostly in its GTP-bound form in the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant because the reversal frequency and localization of MglA-YFP were very similar in the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> and <italic>mglA<sub>Q82L</sub></italic> mutants. Thus, <italic>frz</italic> suppression of the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant pendulum motion argues that the MglA GTP-cycle is somewhat restored in the double mutant (albeit incompletely), for example because of an additional MglA GAP.</p>

<title>MglB Defines a Novel Family of Bacterial GAPs</title>
<p>Eukaryotic small G-proteins are often controlled through the balancing actions of GAPs and GEFs, each catalyzing opposite steps of the GTP switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Bos1">[21]</xref>. A GEF may be necessary to switch MglA back to the GTP bound form after MglB activation of GTP hydrolysis, but MglA could also spontaneously switch back to the GTP-bound state if the GTP/GDP balance is favorable in the cell. Small GTPase regulation by bacterial proteins is common during pathogenesis where invasive bacteria inject effectors that mimic GAPs and GEFs directly into the host cell to disrupt small GTPase signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Finlay1">[35]</xref>. However, none of these virulence factors are related to MglB and there is no evidence that they have a physiological function in bacteria that express them. Thus, MglB-like proteins are probably major regulators of bacterial small GTPases. How MglB activates GTP hydrolysis by MglA is an interesting question because MglB contains a widespread so-called LC7/roadblock domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Koonin1">[23]</xref>. LC7/roadblocks are ancient protein domains conserved in all three eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and archeal kingdoms, yet very little information is available about their function. It was suggested that the members of this family regulate NTPases because proteins that contain roadblock domains are almost invariably linked to an NTPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Koonin1">[23]</xref>. For example, the LC7 protein is a conserved component of the Dynein light chain and has an important regulatory role on the activity of this motor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Bowman1">[36]</xref>. However, the lack of a simple biochemical system to test LC7 function has hampered our understanding of how these domains work. Thus, understanding how MglB regulates MglA at the molecular level is potentially of great significance to understand the function of a widely conserved protein domain.</p>

<title>The “Pendulum” Motion Highlights Unexpected Properties of the A-Motility Machinery</title>
<p>The oscillation dynamics of FrzS-GFP and RomR-GFP were abrogated in absence of the MglA-GTP cycle, suggesting that the MglAB proteins polarize the cell dynamically to regulate cellular reversals. Thus, we were surprised to find that the cells still reversed in absence of the MglA GTP-cycle. This was puzzling because the dynamics of RomR, an A-motility protein, are not coupled to the reversal cycle in the <italic>ΔmglB</italic> mutant. So how were these reversals generated if the cells are not dynamically polarized? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000430-g007">Figure 7B</xref> depicts a proposed mechanism. In absence of the MglA GTP switch, active engine units may be assembled at the cell pole and produce movement. When these units reach the lagging cell end, they are not disassembled because MglB cannot activate MglA-GTP hydrolysis within the complexes. Instead, we propose that a threshold is reached at the pole, activating a built-in capacity in the machinery to reverse its directionality and resume movement in the opposite direction. The cycle can thus be repeated endlessly resulting in the “pendulum” behavior. The term “pendulum gliding” was borrowed from studies on Plasmodium sporozoites (apicomplexan parasites) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Kappe1">[37]</xref>. We previously discussed that A-motility may be analogous to Apicomplexan gliding motility because the parasites assemble focal adhesion complexes at their apical end and glide forward by moving these adhesions rearward in an actomyosin motorized process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mignot4">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Sibley1">[38]</xref>. Strikingly, mutant sporozoites expressing a truncated version of the adhesion factor TRAP also move like a pendulum, most likely because they fail to relieve TRAP-dependent adhesions at their trailing end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Kappe1">[37]</xref>. In <italic>Myxococcus</italic>, failure to relieve focal adhesions at the back of the cells could also trigger a switch to the opposite direction. Thus, a critical function of MglB is to suppress these periodic switches and allow the cell to move distances corresponding at least to several cell lengths before it reverses. The molecular basis for directional inversion needs investigation both in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Myxococcus</italic>.</p>
<p>In a previous work, we showed that A-motility complexes require the bacterial MreB actin cytoskeleton and MglA, much like focal adhesion complexes that drive eukaryotic cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Mauriello1">[18]</xref>. Thus, the mechanisms underlying <italic>Myxococcus</italic> motility are remarkably similar to the mechanisms that drive eukaryotic cell motility. In <italic>Dictyostelium discoidum</italic>, chemotaxis involves a complex arsenal of receptor-activated small GTPases and their cognate regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Janetopoulos1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Charest1">[2]</xref>. In <italic>Myxococcus</italic>, polarity seems to be controlled by a single small G-protein switch that acts downstream of a chemotaxis-like signal transduction pathway. It is thus an ideal model system to dissect molecular regulations that may be extremely widespread. Finally, MglA and MglB homologues are also widespread in prokaryots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Dong1">[39]</xref>, many of which are not motile, suggesting that small GTPase switches also regulate multiple biological processes in bacteria, a field of research that has not received the attention it deserves.</p>

<title>Expression and Purification of MglA and MglB</title>
<p>MglA-His<sub>6</sub> and His<sub>6</sub>-MglB were expressed from the expression vector pET28(a) (Novagen).

Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 10 min, resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazol, and lysed with a French press. The lysates were centrifuged twice (18,000 rpm, 4°C, 30 min) to remove debris prior to the purification. Supernatants were incubated with Nickel beads for 1 h at 4°C and the beads were collected and loaded into 5 ml HisTrap™ nickel columns (GE Healthcare). The elution was performed by using a buffer containing 50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazol, and for MglA, GDP 30 µM.

<title>Time Lapse Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
<p>Time lapse experiments were performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Ducret1">[43]</xref>. Microscopic analysis was performed using an automated and inverted epifluorescence microscope TE2000-E-PFS (Nikon, France). The microscope is equipped with “The Perfect Focus System” (PFS) that automatically maintains focus so that the point of interest within a specimen is always kept in sharp focus at all times, in spite of any mechanical or thermal perturbations. Images were recorded with a CoolSNAP HQ 2 (Roper Scientific, Roper Scientific SARL, France) and a 40×/0.75 DLL “Plan-Apochromat” or a 100×/1.4 DLL objective. All fluorescence images were acquired with a minimal exposure time to minimize bleaching and phototoxicity effects.</p>
<p>Cell tracking was performed automatically using a previously described macro under the METAMORPH software (Molecular devices); when appropriate, manual measurements were also performed to correct tracking errors with tools built into the software.

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Cells (<italic>n</italic>&gt;100) were automatically segmented by successive morphological operations: h-dome extraction, gray-scale reconstruction, binary images, and morphological opening. To optimize segmentation, binary frames were sometimes corrected manually with appropriate tools built into the software. A binary mask was then used to perform integrated morphometric analysis and cell tracking. Cell tracking was performed following standard mathematical procedures already described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000430-Ducret1">[43]</xref>. Computational scoring of cell reversals was obtained by tracking cells that showed clear directional changes, moving at least a 10<sup>th</sup> of their cellular length in the opposite direction. To correlate these reversals to changes in fluorescence at the cell poles, the cell poles were automatically detected using a custom automation script (Visual Basic) under Metamorph 7.5 (Molecular Devices, Molecular Devices France, France). In this system, polar fluorescence inversions were systematically scored when the difference between the average grey intensity values of the poles became significantly different from the standard deviation of the average intensity value along the length of the cell. All selected cells were verified manually to ensure that the automatic process always scored actual reversals and polar fluorescence inversions. The cross-correlation coefficient (Rxy) between scored reversals and fluorescence pole-to-pole switchings for a time of delay (m) was calculated with the following equation:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000430.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The maximum value is Rxy = 1 for a perfect correlation. The time lapse movies are composed of 30 s time frames due to illumination constraints (toxicity and bleaching). In these conditions, a Rxy&gt;0.5 for a time delay = 0 (±30 s) means that the two events, fluorescence polar inversions (x(t)) and cellular reversals (y(t)), are highly correlated.</p>
