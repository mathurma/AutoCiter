      <abstract>
        <p>The formation of the complex network architecture of neural systems is subject to multiple structural and functional constraints. Two obvious but apparently contradictory constraints are low wiring cost and high processing efficiency, characterized by short overall wiring length and a small average number of processing steps, respectively. Growing evidence shows that neural networks are results from a trade-off between physical cost and functional value of the topology. However, the relationship between these competing constraints and complex topology is not well understood quantitatively. We explored this relationship systematically by reconstructing two known neural networks, Macaque cortical connectivity and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal connections, from combinatory optimization of wiring cost and processing efficiency constraints, using a control parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and comparing the reconstructed networks to the real networks. We found that in both neural systems, the reconstructed networks derived from the two constraints can reveal some important relations between the spatial layout of nodes and the topological connectivity, and match several properties of the real networks. The reconstructed and real networks had a similar modular organization in a broad range of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, resulting from spatial clustering of network nodes. Hubs emerged due to the competition of the two constraints, and their positions were close to, and partly coincided, with the real hubs in a range of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values. The degree of nodes was correlated with the density of nodes in their spatial neighborhood in both reconstructed and real networks. Generally, the rebuilt network matched a significant portion of real links, especially short-distant ones. These findings provide clear evidence to support the hypothesis of trade-off between multiple constraints on brain networks. The two constraints of wiring cost and processing efficiency, however, cannot explain all salient features in the real networks. The discrepancy suggests that there are further relevant factors that are not yet captured here.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>What are essential relationships between fundamental physical constraints and the architecture of neural systems? Most existing investigations have considered a single constraint, either wiring cost or processing path efficiency, and little is known about how characteristic neural network features, such as the simultaneous existence of modules and hubs, are related to the constraints from multiple requirements. Here we emphasized the competition between the global wiring cost and an important functional requirement, path efficiency, as factors in forming Macaque cortical connectivity and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal connections. By comparing real to reconstructed networks using optimization under multiple constraints, we found that several network features are related to the competition of these two constraints, in particular the simultaneous formation of network modules and hubs. However, not all the properties of the real networks could be attributed to these two constraints, suggesting that, likely, there exists additional structural or functional requirements.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>It is widely appreciated that complex neuroanatomical networks are the physiological basis for brain dynamics, information processing and mental function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bressler1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Buzski1">[5]</xref>. In the last years, understanding the organization of neural systems and structural-functional relationship using graph theoretical approaches and methods of complex network research has attracted a great deal of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Sporns1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-ZamoraLpez1">[16]</xref>. Neural systems possess several pronounced network features, including the small-world property <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Watts1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Liu1">[19]</xref> characterized by short path lengths and high clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bassett1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Reijneveld1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Stam1">[13]</xref>, hub nodes with much larger degree than the average node degree of the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Sporns2">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-ZamoraLpez2">[22]</xref> and network modules broadly coinciding with functional subdivisions of the systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bullmore1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Young1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Costa1">[27]</xref>. While these features of neural networks are similar to those in many other real-world complex networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Girvan1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Ravasz1">[30]</xref>, the mechanisms underlying the formation of such complex network organization are still poorly understood.</p>
      <p>The simultaneous existence of modules and hubs is an ubiquitous mesoscopic structural property in neural networks, and may play a significant role in the information processing and functioning of the systems. It was shown that cortical brain connectivity comprises dense communities, which are more densely linked internally than externally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Hilgetag1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Hilgetag2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Costa1">[27]</xref>. Such a modular organization was observed in structural networks obtained from tract-tracing studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bullmore1">[14]</xref>, or diffusion spectrum imaging tractography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Hagmann1">[21]</xref>, across various species, such as human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Hagmann1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Schwarz1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Meunier1">[33]</xref>, cat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Scannell1">[34]</xref>, rhesus Macaque monkey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Young2">[35]</xref> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Pan1">[36]</xref> as well as in functional networks derived from EEG/MEG, fMRI and MEA experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Schwarz1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Schneidman1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bettencourt1">[39]</xref>. The modules of the cortical network, in broad agreement with functional subdivisions of the cerebral cortex, are spatially segregated — as the areas within the same functional subsystems (visual, auditory etc.) are mostly spatially co-localized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-ZamoraLpez2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Pan1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Salvador1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Henderson1">[41]</xref>. A recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Vrtes1">[42]</xref> showed that that modularity similar to that in human functional networks can be obtained based on an objective function combining the number of common nearest neighbors with a power-law decay of connections over distance, implying that modularity may be closely related to local connections.</p>
      <p>Highly connected hub nodes have been shown in the structural network of the human brain, constructed by diffusion tensor approaches and based on 70–90 cortical gray matter areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-IturriaMedina1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Gong1">[45]</xref> or in cortical networks based on 998 region-of-interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Hagmann1">[21]</xref>, as well as in functional networks using fMRI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Achard1">[46]</xref> or other imaging techniques (EEG, MEG, MEA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bettencourt1">[39]</xref>, also in other species, such as Macaque cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Sporns2">[20]</xref> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Varshney1">[47]</xref>. Hubs could effectively integrate information that is segregated due to the existence of modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-ZamoraLpez2">[22]</xref>. In agreement with this idea, the identified high-degree hubs were mostly multimodal association regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-ZamoraLpez1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-ZamoraLpez2">[22]</xref>. Moreover, in a recent study of brain pathology, a MEG study of connectivity provided additional evidence that a degradation of the small-world property in patients with Alzheimer's disease was due to disease-related changes in hubs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-He1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>What factors influence the formation of modules and hubs is still an open question. Nonetheless, the organization of neural networks is frequently attributed to fundamental constraints, such as metabolic cost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Laughlin1">[49]</xref>, signal propagation efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Laughlin2">[50]</xref>, evolutionary history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Striedter1">[51]</xref> and others. It has been speculated that the network organization is the result of an economical trade-off between the physical cost and the functional values of the topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bullmore2">[52]</xref>. But it is still not well understood what these functional constraints are and what the relationship is between network properties and functional values, in spite of intensive research on complex brain networks over the last decade.</p>
      <p>One of the most extensively discussed aspects is the constraint of wiring cost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Mitchison1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Budd1">[68]</xref>, which is related to the possible minimization of neural wiring volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chklovskii3">[62]</xref> or wiring length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak2">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chklovskii1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Klyachko1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chklovskii2">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chen1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-PrezEscudero1">[69]</xref> in the nervous system. Most previous studies investigated whether the actual component placement layout of neural systems has been optimized for wiring minimization, by comparing the actual wiring cost to the perturbed component placement while keeping the network connectivity as in the real systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak2">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Klyachko1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chen1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-PrezEscudero1">[69]</xref>. In coarse-grained data sets, it was found that the wiring length of the Macaque prefrontal areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Klyachko1">[59]</xref> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> ganglia is optimized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak2">[55]</xref>. However, in other networks, such as those linking Macaque or cat visual cortical areas, the wiring was found not to be fully optimized, but relatively more optimal than other subsets of the cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak4">[64]</xref>. Moreover the wiring of the whole neural network of the Macaque cortex and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network appeared not to be optimized under the single wiring cost constraint– the total wiring could be decreased to 64% of the original length in Macaque and to 52% in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref> when applying the component placement optimization (CPO) to minimize the total wiring length while preserving the specific network connectivity. Alternatively, it has been suggested that constraints such as signal propagation efficiency, measured by the global minimization of processing steps across the network, may shape the organization of neural systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Budd1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Koulakov1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Karbowski1">[71]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Generally none of the single constraints is likely able to account for all the functional values of the network. However, the processing efficiency perhaps is the most established network measure shown to correlate with functional performance in normal subjects and dysfunction in various brain diseases. As large-scale information processing and communication systems, neural networks favor reducing the number of intermediate transmission steps in order to respond quickly, with the tendency to minimize the average shortest path length (i.e., graph distance) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Laughlin2">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Hilgetag3">[72]</xref>. Minimizing the graph distance has some important functional advantages. First, a small number of intermediate transmission steps might reduce energy consumption during signal processing. In fact, about 50% of the brain's energy is used to drive signal processing, suggested by halved brain energy consumption in deep anesthesia that blocks neural signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Ames1">[73]</xref>. Second, minimizing the graph distance would increase the speed of signal processing, ultimately leading to faster behavior for decisions and actions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Laughlin2">[50]</xref>. Third, minimizing the graph distance enables neighboring and distant brain areas (or neurons) to receive signals nearly simultaneously to allow synchronous functional processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-VonDerMalsburg1">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Masuda1">[77]</xref>. Fourth, since there exists abundant noise in signal transmission (e.g., ionic channel noise or synaptic noise) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Laughlin2">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Faisal1">[78]</xref> as well as a high failure rate for signal transmission (between 50% and 90% in individual synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Laughlin2">[50]</xref>), minimizing the path length would limit the interference by noise and increase the robustness of neural systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Hilgetag3">[72]</xref>. Indeed, the global efficiency (the inverse of the average shortest paths) of the resting-state brain network has been found to be strongly associated with the intelligence quotient(IQ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bassett2">[79]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Deary1">[82]</xref>. In disease, it was found that the efficiency of the human cortical network was disrupted in a manner proportional to the extent of white matter lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Dehaene1">[83]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Sporns3">[87]</xref>. Therefore, the graph distance/processing efficiency could be taken as a representative measure conferring functional value of brain networks.</p>
      <p>To date, however, most studies either considered the influence of just a single constraint (mostly wiring minimization) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Mitchison1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak2">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak3">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chklovskii3">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak4">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Ahn1">[66]</xref>, or evaluated two constraints (such as the metabolic cost constraint and the propagation efficiency constraint) separately <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>. However, this approach does not mean that the two constraints are independent. In fact, they may have partly opposite impact on network organization. The processing efficiency constraint favors network shortcuts that link topologically distant parts of the network, which may take the form of long-distance connections, in which case they would act against the metabolic cost constraint of wiring length minimization. Conversely, wiring minimization favors the creation of links among spatially adjacent network nodes, which may also be topological neighbors (cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s003">Fig. S3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>). Such networks with mainly local connections typically possess low path efficiency due to a large average number of processing steps. In conclusion, the two constraints need to be considered in combination. The coexistence of modular organization and hubs in networks could be, at least partially, understood by a balance of these two constraints. Indeed, there is growing evidence to support the idea that neural network connectivity is not optimized either to minimize connection costs or to maximize advantageous topological properties, but rather is an economical trade-off between the physical cost and the adaptive value of its topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bassett3">[88]</xref>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bullmore2">[52]</xref> for a recent extensive review. It has been proposed that the cost-efficiency balance of the human functional network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Achard2">[89]</xref> may be related to the behavioral performance in cognitive tasks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bassett2">[79]</xref>, but the anatomical mechanism underlying such desirable functional connectivity is not clear.</p>
      <p>In the present work we explored the relationship between multiple constraints and complex network architecture by systematically testing the effect of the competition of multiple constraints. We considered the neuronal network of <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chen1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-White1">[90]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Oshio1">[91]</xref> and the cortico-cortical network of the non-human primate (Macaque) brain based on tract-tracing studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Ktter1">[92]</xref>, for which information is available for both the spatial positions of the nodes and the network connectivity. In a previous analysis of the Macaque cortical network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Costa1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>, the division of the motor areas was not very highly resolved, which feature might induce biased results when analyzing network modules and spatial clustering. Therefore, in the present work we first improved the data set by a more detailed division of the motor areas based on the CoCoMac database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Ktter1">[92]</xref>, extending the former 6 motor areas to 15 areas with an additional 128 connections (see <italic>Materials and Method</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s001">Fig. S1</xref> for the adjacency matrix). Different from the CPO method, in our scheme we compared the real network connectivity to reconstructed networks derived from multiple constraints by fixing the spatial position of each network node and the total number of (directed) connections as in the real networks. The reconstructed networks were obtained under various balancing conditions of wiring cost and processing efficiency constraints. As in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Mitchison1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak2">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak3">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Ahn1">[66]</xref>, we used the total physical distance of the wiring <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to represent the effect of the wiring cost constraint, and the total graph distance of the shortest paths <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to represent the influence of the processing efficiency constraint, and defined an objective function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a combination of both constraints using a weight parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, namely, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> appropriately normalized. So <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponds to a single constraint of path efficiency or wiring cost, respectively. Then we reconstructed the connections of the network with the help of a simulated annealing approach to minimize the objective function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, starting from 50 random configurations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). We studied the general properties of the competition between the two constraints in a 1D model with one-dimensional uniform spatial layout of nodes and directed connections. For the real neural networks, we investigated the modularity and hub properties of the reconstructed networks and studied the relationship to the spatial layout and compared them to those of the real networks. We found that for certain intervals of balancing these two constraints, the reconstructed networks showed a very similar modular structure and similar spatial positions of the hubs as the real networks. These results are also related to the nonuniform layout and clustering of the network nodes (neurons for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and areas for Macaque cortical brain) in space. Despite the observed agreements, there still exists significant discrepancies between model and real networks, suggesting that there are additional functional requirements to be considered in the future.</p>

        <p>At <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the network is only optimized by the processing efficiency constraint and achieves minimization of the topological distance. The optimal network configuration depends on the density of connections. If the initial network is sparse (roughly, connection probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), as in the 1D model (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) or <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>)), the reconstructed network is characterized by a single hub connecting to all other nodes while the rest of connections appears to be random. The position of the hub node is arbitrary. A single hub is very effective for reducing the graph distance when the network is sparse enough, because the path length between any pair of nodes is either 1 (direct link) or 2 (connected through the hub). When the network becomes denser (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), such as the Macaque cortical network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the pathlength between any pair of nodes in a random network cannot be larger than 2. It is then very unlikely to obtain a single hub when optimizing from an initially random configuration. Thus, the reconstructed network connections appear to be random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The dependence of the network configuration on the connection density is also more systematically shown in the 1D model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>At <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the processing efficiency constraint plays no role while the wiring cost constraint is fully dominant, and the network has the minimal total wiring length. Most of the connections are local and there is no hub (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in any of the three systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g001">Figs. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g002">2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g003">3F</xref>). For the 1D model or the reconstructed networks of the Macaque, all the connections are local (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Fig. 4J,K</xref>); <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is reduced to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of that in the real Macaque network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). As for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> network, many neurons in the head and tail are very densely distributed with very small distance among them, while the distance between neighboring neurons in the ventral cord is much larger. Therefore, significant numbers of non-nearest but short-distant connections within the head or the tail let the physical distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> become very small, only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the real <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), but <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is clearly smaller than 1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Fig. 4L</xref>)). And in the real networks, the spatial layout of the network nodes is non-uniform, forming spatial clusters; these local connections make the adjacency matrix become non-uniform, showing some clustered pattern similar to the original network connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g002">Figs. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g003">3F</xref>).

        <p>For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the processing efficiency and wiring cost constraints combine their impact, resulting in two distinct regimes, depending on the networks. When <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is positive, but not very large, such as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the 1D model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g001">Fig. 1B,C</xref>), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Macaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), there is a single hub connecting to all the other nodes in all the three systems (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Most of the other connections are linked to the nearest neighbors, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is close to 1.0 in the 1 D model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Fig. 4J</xref>) and the reconstructed networks of Macaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Fig. 4K</xref>), but is clearly smaller in <italic>C. elegans</italic> for the reason stated above (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Fig. 4L</xref>). This single, global hub is a very effective configuration to provide high efficiency, when the other connections are short-distance due to the cost constraint. While the placement of the hub is arbitrary in the 1D model due to a symmetrical spatial layout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g001">Fig. 1B,C</xref>), it is unique in the reconstructed networks of Macaque and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, located close to the global geographical center of the whole network, as will be discussed in detail below. In this regime, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are all constant with respect to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, since the optimal network configuration does not change with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, though the speed of convergence in the optimization process does. While both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the reconstructed networks are smaller than those in the real networks in this region, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is much more smaller (reduced to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in Macaque and to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Fig. 4B,C</xref>).</p>
        <p>The insensitivity of the optimal configuration to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in this regime can be understood from the objective function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The variation is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The network configuration would change with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> only if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, for the Macaque network, we found that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for any perturbation to the configuration obtained at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (a single global hub and all other local links). When <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, thus <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the configuration change cannot be accepted by the optimization. Only when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), it becomes possible to have <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for certain perturbations, and a configuration change will happen. For this reason, in all the three networks, the optimal solution is the same in a range of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values, depending on the spatial layout of the network.</p>
        <p>With further increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the influence of the wiring cost constraint becomes stronger. A single hub is no longer found, because very long-distant connections are prohibited and the systems move into a different regime (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the 1D model, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Macaque and for <italic>C. elegans</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Several smaller hubs emerge, with connections extending to nodes in their spatial neighborhood, and the connection range of such regional hubs becomes smaller at larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as can be most clearly seen in the 1D model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g001">Figs. 1D,E</xref>), and is also true in the real networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g002">Figs. 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g003">3E</xref>). Consequently, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is further reduced slightly, but <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases and is close to that of the real network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Fig. 4B,C</xref>). As shown below, the spatial positions of the hubs in the reconstructed networks are close to the real hubs in the two original networks.</p>
        <p>When <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is very close to 1.0, where the efficiency constraint is weak while the wiring cost constraint is almost fully dominant, most of the connections are local and there are no pronounced hubs (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases quickly and becomes larger than that in real networks.</p>
        <p>We also found that for all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values, the input and output degrees of the nodes in the reconstructed networks are largely symmetrical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s003">Fig. S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s003">Fig. S3C</xref>). While the input and output degrees were found to be significantly correlated in the real networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s003">Fig. S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s003">Fig. S3D</xref>), the discrepancy between the optimization model and real data is quite large, because this model does not include possible requirements that could generate the asymmetry, for instance, input-output information flowing as in real networks (e.g., from sensory neurons to motor neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>).</p>
        <p>The above results show that the coexistence of local connections and hubs in the cortical networks could be a solution to the multiple constraints of wiring cost and processing efficiency. There is a regime (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Macaque and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <italic>C. elegans</italic>) in which the competition of the constraints can allow the formation of several hubs connecting to many of the nodes in the neighborhood. Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the reconstructed networks is very close that of the real networks, but <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be much smaller. In the following sections, we show that both the modular structure and the positions of hubs are quite similar to the real networks in this regime.</p>

        <p>The above results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g002">Figs. 2D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g003">3D–F</xref>) showed the emergence of a modular organization in the reconstructed networks similar to the real ones, which is derived from the non-uniform spatial distribution of the nodes and the local connections due to the constraints.

          <title>Macaque cortical network</title>
          <p>In the the real Macaque cortical network, the nodes (which represent the centers of mass of the cortical areas) are distributed non-uniformly in the three-dimensional space due to size variations of the areas. Visual inspection of a two-dimensional layout in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5A</xref> suggested that the nodes could be divided into two spatially separated clusters. This was confirmed by clustering analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>), shown by different colors (blue and red) of the nodes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>. Such spatial clustering was found to be quite robust in data sets with different parcellations of the areas. The clustering of this more highly resolved data set with finer division of the motor areas (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was compared with a parcellation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Paxinos1">[93]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>) and was found to be very similar. The clustering boundaries of the two data sets differed only by 5 areas (referring to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> dataset) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s004">Fig. S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s005">S5</xref>). Unfortunately, network connectivity is not available for this finest parcellation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> areas. We also examined the spatial density of the nodes within a radius around a given node, which we called the <italic>neighborhood density</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>), and found that it was also quite non-uniform due to heterogeneous area size. As shown in the following sections, many properties of the reconstructed and original networks of the Macaque cortex are related to these properties of the spatial layout of the network nodes.</p>

          <p>The connectivity in the original Macaque cortical network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5A</xref> also suggests that the connections are denser within spatial clusters than between clusters, indicating that the spatial clustering of the areas and densely connected network modules are related to each other. We analyzed modules in the original Macaque cortical network and the reconstructed networks (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). The optimal modularity is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the original Macaque network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), corresponding to two modules shown by open and filled circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>. The modularity did not show uncertainty with respect to the modular boundaries and is quite significant when compared to the corresponding random networks with the same number of nodes and connections (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). We can see that the modules and spatial clusters have strong overlap, and only 14.6% of the total nodes are mismatched. An example of a reconstructed network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, which has much fewer connections between the two spatial clusters than the real network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, therefore has a larger optimal modularity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (also two modules, without uncertainty). The two modules from the reconstructed networks overlap almost completely with the two spatial clusters, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>), with only one mismatched areas (0.97%). We examined the mismatched areas between the module partitions of the original and the reconstructed network at various <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and found that they were consistent.

          <p>The spatial layout and connectivity of the real C. elegans neural network are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>.

Using the spatial clustering method, the neurons were grouped into three clusters (shown by different colors). Interestingly, the relationship between connectivity modules and spatial clusters is similar to the Macaque cortical network. While not perfect, there exists some overlap between modules and spatial clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), about 30.8% of the neurons are mismatched. For the reconstructed network of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, quite similar to the Macaque cortical network, there are fewer connections between different spatial clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) when compared to the real network, consistent with a larger modularity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for four modules. The overlap between the modules and the spatial clusters is stronger than in the real network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>), and the ratio of mismatched neurons is reduced to 11.96%. The number of mismatched neurons between the modular partitions of the original and the reconstructed networks remains small (about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all neurons) for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, approaching the smallest value (nearly 23%) when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but increasing clearly for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> very close to 1.0 (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (blue bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>).

          <p>We would like to emphasize that the results reported above have already taken the uncertainty of module partition and spatial clustering into consideration (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). First, the uncertainty in the module partition is quite small. The Macaque cortex did not show degeneracy in module partition when (the toolbox of brain connectivity) BCT method was applied for many times, although degeneracy was indeed observed in a corresponding random network with the same number of nodes and connections (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, here the error-bar is from 50 applications of the BCT method). The real network in <italic>C. elegans</italic> did not have degeneracy either, but there was a small uncertainty in the reconstructed networks (with a typical fluctuation of 1–5 neurons from run to run). Second, we used 8 different distance measures to detect the hierarchical clustering. When comparing the clustering partition from these 8 methods to the modular division, the partition based on inner squared distance generated the minimal set that matched the module partition. The rest of the nodes formed the largest possible mismatched group that covered all the mismatched groups from different clustering methods (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). In particular, there were 89 cortical areas in the Macaque which match between the modules and the clusters from all the 8 methods; the remaining set of 14 areas is thus the largest possible group covering all the unmatched groups across different methods of clustering and was reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5B</xref> (among these 14 unmatched areas, 5 areas appear to be the unmatched areas in all these 8 methods, 1 area in 7 methods, 6 areas in 5 methods, and the 2 areas in 3 methods). In the real network of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, this set of most stable nodes contains 191 neurons and the remaining 85 neurons are considered as the the largest group of mismatched neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). In the same vein, the reported mismatching between the module partitions of real and reconstructed networks is the largest possible group when taking the uncertainty into consideration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Figs. 5E,F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g006">6E,F</xref>).</p>
          <p>These results show that the modular structure of the original networks is strongly related to the fact that the network nodes are spatially clustered, and many of the connections are contained within the clusters due to the effect of the wiring cost constraint. However, the best match of the modular partition with the real network involves the processing efficiency constraint (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) that enforces some long-range connections between the clusters.</p>

        <title>Location of hubs</title>
        <p>The results in Section I. showed that the emergence of hubs could be the result of the combination of the wiring cost and path efficiency constraints, since hubs connecting to many nodes are very effective for improving path efficiency, while allowing most of the other connections to remain local to satisfy the cost constraint. If the hub is a global one, connecting to all the nodes, then it is reasonable to expect that the position of the hub is not arbitrary, but is near the geographical center (the node with minimal total distance to all the other nodes) of the whole network in order to maximally reduce the total wiring length of the connections from the hub. If the hub is a regional one, connecting to most of the nodes within the local region (e.g., within one of the spatial clusters), then the position should be close to the geographical center of this region. Thus, a node with many other nodes densely distributed in the neighborhood (having a high neighborhood density, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>), could be an candidate for a hub under the two constraints.</p>
        <p>In the following section, we present findings regarding the location of the hubs in the reconstructed as well as the real networks. In our analysis, network nodes with z-score of total degrees (input and output) larger than 2 (see <italic>Material and Methods</italic>) are considered as hubs. The locations of the hubs in all 50 realizations of the reconstructed networks at each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were identified. We would like to point out that identifying hubs in this way is heuristic and may introduce some ambiguity when comparing different networks (real or reconstructed at different <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). However, hubs that were defined in this way indeed provided a plausible way to describe the variation of the nodes with the largest degrees in the network as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> changes.</p>

Further increasing of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be very close to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> prevents the emergence of hubs, because the impact of the wiring cost constraint becomes too strong relative to the influence of the processing efficiency constraint. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> around 0.9, four areas, V5/MT, area 46, MSTm and MSTd appeared as hubs in many realizations of the reconstructed networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>, green stars). It is important to note that area V5/MT and area 46 are respectively the biggest hubs in the original network in terms of total degree and output degree (these two areas are also identified as hubs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Sporns2">[20]</xref>). V5/MT has a total of 112 input and output links, with 87 of them from the red spatial cluster (connecting to 87.9% of nodes in this cluster) and 25 from the blue cluster. The location of area V5/MT and its all connections in the real network are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g007">Fig. 7 C</xref>. Although V5/MT is only ranked No. 27 in terms of the global geographical centrality, it is ranked No. 3 of the regional geographical centrality of the red cluster. It is also ranked No. 1 in terms of high neighborhood density in a range of radius (specifically, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, see <italic>Material and Methods</italic>).

The other two areas MSTm and MSTd were selected as hubs in the reconstructed networks, because they are respectively ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in terms of the geographical centrality of the red cluster and No. 2 and No. 4 by neighborhood density. But these two areas are not hubs in the real network.</p>
          <p>Apart from the biggest hub area V5/MT, there are five more hubs (z-score above 2.0 either in total, input or output degree) in the real Macaque cortical network, areas 7a, VIPl, 7b, LIPv and area 46. All the hub areas are shown by the red bullets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>, with the size of the symbol indicating the total degree. Except for area 46 located close to the geographical center of the blue cluster, the other five hubs are all located within the red cluster and are among the top 18.5% in terms of the regional geographical centrality of this cluster. The ranking of a few nodes with the largest total degrees in terms of neighborhood density and geographical centrality is also shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s007">Fig. S7</xref>. The positions of the real hubs thus coincide or are close to those hubs in the reconstructed networks which are located in the regional geographical centers.</p>

Interestingly, these hubs in the reconstructed networks (green triangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g008">Fig. 8</xref>) were close in location to the 4 real hubs (red bullets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). In fact, these 14 neurons are among the top 8.33% in terms of the regional geographical centrality in the head. Notably, we also found an overlap of reconstructed with real hubs. When <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e193" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the real hub AVBR has a relatively small probability (24%) to be chosen as the hub in the reconstructed network (marked as the blue bullet in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g008">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
          <p>One may wonder whether it is meaningful to say that the hubs were spatially close when most neurons are located in the tiny head of the worm. Therefore, a more quantitative comparison is desirable to support the visual inspection. We calculated the sum distance for each of the 166 neurons in the head to the 4 real hubs and sorted the neurons in the order of increasing distance (Fig.S8). It is clear that most of the neurons taken as hubs in the reconstructed networks are among the closest neurons to the real hubs.</p>
          <p>While generally there is ambiguity in defining hubs in the networks, our observation is clear: with stronger influence from the wiring cost constraint, the reconstructed networks shift from a configuration with a single global hub to configurations having several nodes with relatively large degrees, and their spatial locations move from the global geographical center to the regional geographical centers accordingly. In real networks, the nodes with the largest degrees are close to the regional geographical centers, showing that both the processing efficiency and cost constraints are at work. This finding is strong evidence to support the hypothesis of a trade-off, though it appears there are more nodes with larger degrees in the real networks than the reconstructed networks.</p>

        <title>Degrees of nodes and correlation with neighborhood density of nodes</title>
        <p>The results in the above sections suggested that the mesoscopic properties of networks, the simultaneous formation of modules and hubs, can be partially explained by the combination of the wiring cost and processing efficiency constraints. Now we examine the degree of nodes in the original and reconstructed networks.</p>
        <p>When constructing networks under the wiring cost constraint, the nodes tend to connect to their nearest spatial neighbors, which is confirmed by a high value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, the number of connections of a node (degree) is expected to be related to the neighborhood density of the node in a certain spatial range.

        <p>Interestingly, the correlation between degrees and density is also significantly present in the real network (colored curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g009">Fig. 9A,B</xref>). For example, the correlation can reach 0.49 at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Macaque and 0.29 at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, much larger than the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the significance level in the corresponding surrogate data. The results are consistent with the observation above that hubs in the real network are ranked high in term of the neighborhood density.</p>
        <p>Although the correlation between degree and neighborhood density is significant in both real and reconstructed networks, the discrepancy is also quite large. In particular, the degree distribution in the real network was not well reproduced in the reconstructed network (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s009">Fig. S9</xref> for a comparison). In both neural systems, the real networks have higher probabilities to have large-degree nodes, but the reconstructed networks have higher probabilities to generate intermediate-degree nodes, because the connections in the reconstructed networks are much more strongly determined by the neighborhood density. It has been shown that both the in- and out- degree of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network obey a power-law distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Varshney1">[47]</xref>. Our test of the significance of the power-law fitting to the distribution (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>) confirmed this statement (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for in-degree and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e209" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the out-degree, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). The real Macaque cortical network and the reconstructed networks of both systems do not show scale-free features. For all these networks, the largest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e210" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value is 0.02<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e211" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>0.02 for the out-degree distribution of <italic>C. elegans</italic> obtained at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e212" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>These results indicate that degrees of the individual nodes reflect the impact of the wiring cost constraint, however there are still some other unknown factors in addition to the wiring cost and processing efficiency constraints that may strongly influence the node degrees in the original network.</p>

        <title>Link recovery</title>
        <p>In the above sections we explored the similarity between reconstructed and real networks in global network measures (e.g., physical and graphical distance), and in mesoscopic properties (e.g., modules, hubs, degree and degree distribution). Next we analyzed how well the reconstruct networks recovered the connections in the real network. We calculated the recovery rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e213" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by comparing the overlap of the adjacency matrices of the original and reconstructed networks entry by entry, taking both asymmetry of 0's and 1's entries and the directionality of connections into consideration (see <italic>Material and Methods</italic>). <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e214" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is maximal at 1.0 when two networks are identical in all connected and un-connected pairs.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Importantly, the recovery rate is not uniform in the networks. It is higher within the spatial clusters, but lower between the clusters, as shown as green bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g010">Figs. 10C, D</xref> for Macaque and <italic>C. elegans</italic> respectively (both for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Notably, for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the recovery rate of the connections within clusters could approach 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g010">Fig. 10 D</xref>), almost doubling that of the random networks (blue bars). For the connections between the clusters, the recovery rate is even smaller than that in the random benchmark networks in both systems, especially significant for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, because the connections between clusters become too sparse in the reconstructed networks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Figs. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g006">6C</xref>). The real neural network has more long-range connections between spatial clusters, likely due to additional functional requirements.</p>
        <p>Although the recovery rate within modules (red bars) is also larger than that of the random networks, particularly within spatial clusters, the recovery rate between modules is much higher than for random benchmarks for both systems, in contrast to the case between spatial clusters. The different results between clusters and between modules originate from the mismatching of modules and clusters.</p>
        <p>In the combination of wiring cost and efficiency constraints, most of the connections are local. Therefore, the recovery rate is expected to be higher for the local connections. Our more detailed analysis of the recovery rate for the connections of different physical distance confirmed this expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g010">Fig. 10E,F</xref>). In both the reconstructed and real networks, the probability of two nodes to be connected decreases with distance (insets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g010">Fig. 10E,F</xref>). However, in real networks, the connection probability for very short distance is much smaller than in the reconstructed network, but it decays more slowly with the distance; therefore there is much higher probability of long-range connections, especially in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, likely due to other functional requirements. Nevertheless, the recovery rate is much higher for short-distant links, around 50% in both systems.</p>
        <p>There are some differences between the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network and Macaque cortical network. (1) The <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network is quite sparse (connection probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), while the Macaque cortical network is rather dense (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Therefore the recovery rate of the random benchmark networks is smaller in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) than Macaque (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Furthermore, when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e227" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (efficiency constraint only), the reconstructed networks of <italic>C. elegans</italic> possess a global hub, but for the Macaque network they are quite similar to random networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g003">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Thus for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e229" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is even smaller than that of the random networks (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e230" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). (2) About <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e231" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> gather in the tiny head, and the others scatter in the ventral cord and tail. This highly heterogeneous spatial distribution of neurons requires more long-distant connections in the real network. Indeed, <italic>C. elegans</italic> has a smaller fraction of local connections (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e232" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) when compared to Macaque (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e233" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Fig. 4K, L</xref>, dashed lines).

        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>The formation of complex neural networks is subject to many structural and functional constraints. In particular, it has been speculated that the network organization is the result of an economical trade-off between the physical cost and the functional value of the topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bullmore2">[52]</xref>. Among various graph theoretical measures, the average shortest pathlength representing the processing efficiency can be taken as an essential representative of functional constraints. In this study, we showed in a systematic and quantitative manner that the competition between these two straightforward constraints, the overall wiring cost and signal propagation efficiency, plays an important role in the network organization of Macaque cortical connectivity and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal connections. By reconstructing network connections using optimization under multiple constraints, while fixing the component layout as in the real network and comparing the properties the reconstructed to the real networks at different topological scales, we revealed that the connectivity in both neural networks is closely related to the spatial arrangement of the nodes. The main findings are as follows. <italic>i</italic>) The combination of the wiring cost and processing efficiency constraints can lead to the simultaneous formation of local connections and hubs. <italic>ii</italic>) When the spatial layout of the nodes is not uniform, but clustered as seen in the real networks, this combination will lead to the formation of modules and hubs. The modules have strong overlap with the spatial clusters and the hubs are located at global or regional geographical centers. <italic>iii</italic>) In certain regimes of competition between the two constraints, the reconstructed networks have a modular organization quite similar to that in real networks, and the positions of the hubs coincide or are close to the actual hubs. <italic>iv</italic>) The analysis also revealed that the degrees of nodes in the real networks are correlated with their neighborhood density, and the reconstructed networks can recover a significant portion of the individual links of the real networks, especially for short-distant connections. These observations support the idea of a trade-off between cost and functional values. The two constraints, however, cannot fully explain all the properties in the real networks. There are discrepancies in several important aspects: (1) There are significantly more long-range connections in both real systems when compared to the model. (2) The correlation between the individual degree and the neighborhood density in the real networks is much lower than in the optimization model. (3) The degree distribution in the real network is different from that in the reconstructed network. (4) The model cannot generate asymmetry in the input and output degrees as in the real networks. All these differences suggest that there are additional important factors influencing the formation of real neural networks. In the following sections we discuss these points in more detail.</p>

        <title>Real neural networks are not optimized solely to minimize wiring length or to maximize processing efficiency</title>
        <p>It is clear that real networks are not solely optimized by topological efficiency, due to a large number of local connections. Neither are they optimized only for minimal wiring cost, even though this cost constraint is playing a significant role. Previous studies investigated whether the component placement layouts in the real neural networks satisfy the concept of wiring length minimization, by comparing the wiring cost of real networks to perturbed component placement while keeping the network connectivity fixed. The accumulated evidence showed that the wiring cost constraint indeed plays an important role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak2">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chklovskii1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Klyachko1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chklovskii2">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chen1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-PrezEscudero1">[69]</xref>. However, for the Macaque cortical network and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network, previous work using CPO while fixing the network connectivity showed that the wiring length is not minimized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>. Here we reconstructed the network connectivity while keeping the component placement layout as in the real network. Under only the wiring cost constraint at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e234" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the reconstructed network differed significantly from the real networks: all the connections were short-distant and there were no hubs and no long-range connections as in the real networks.</p>
        <p>The following comparison between real networks and reconstructed networks at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e235" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> showed more clearly that the wiring cost constraint is at work, but the real neural networks are not solely optimized by minimal wiring length. (1) The wiring cost <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e236" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the reconstructed networks is clearly lower than that of the real networks (53.5% for Macaque but only 1.25% for <italic>C. elegans</italic>), although the link recovery rate is still significant (60.8% for Macaque and 27% for <italic>C. elegans</italic>), since the wiring cost constraint does impose many short-range connections in the real networks. In the CPO solutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>, by fixing the network connections as in the real networks, the wiring lengths were 68% and 52% of the real values of the networks in the Macaque and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, respectively. This finding shows that allowing hubs as in the real network is costly in wiring, especially for <italic>C. elegans</italic>. (2) The processing efficiency is much lower than in the real networks.

In particular, the recovery rate of the connections within the Macaque visual system (covering <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e243" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> areas of the red cluster of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e244" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and it is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e245" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the rest of the connections of the network, which is consistent with previous observations that the wiring among the Macaque visual cortex is relatively more wiring cost optimal than other cortical subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Cherniak4">[64]</xref>.

        <title>Overlap between network modules and spatial clusters reflects the impact of the wiring cost constraint</title>
        <p>We showed that the wiring cost constraint can predominantly determine the modular organization in real neural networks, and the partition of the modules is not very sensitive to the effect of the processing efficiency constraint at different <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e248" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. More precisely, the spatial clustering governs the connectivity modules in the reconstructed networks where most of the connections are extended to the spatial neighbors under the wiring cost constraint. Modules in the reconstructed network overlap largely with the spatial clusters. In the Macaque cortical network, the mismatched areas (mainly of the somatosensory system) are near the boundary of two spatial clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). This arrangement reduces the wiring cost when these areas make more connections to the other cluster to form a module, likely due to some further functional requirements.</p>
        <p>Notably, the modular organization in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network is most likely determined by the combination of the wiring cost and path efficiency constraints. With only the wiring cost constraint at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e249" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the reconstructed network of <italic>C. elegans</italic> did not show strong modularity as seen in the real network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s006">Fig. S6B</xref>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e250" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e251" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The main reason is as follows. About <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e252" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the neurons gather in the tiny head, while other neurons scatter in the ventral cord and the tail with much longer physical distance between them. At <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e253" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, almost all the links in the reconstructed networks were put in the head to form a highly connected core. The rest of the nodes in the body and tail form an approximately one-dimensional array with a minimal number of necessary links in order to avoid disconnection from the main core, but do not form dense modules. However, when the path efficiency constraint becomes effective for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e254" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> slightly smaller than 1.0, some long-range connections are forced between the hubs in the head and the other parts of the network. These long-range connections from the hubs now can also take the role of avoiding disconnection of the nodes into subsets. Now the remainder of the connections is allowed to be more short-ranged in the tail and in the ventral cord, which form modules that coincide with the spatial clusters. With suitable combinatorial influence of the two constraints at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e255" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the fraction of mismatched neurons is reduced to about 23% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g006">Fig. 6F</xref>).</p>
        <p>In both systems, the best overlap between the modules in the reconstructed networks and real networks appears for a region <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e256" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, suggesting that the combination of the two constraints plays an important role in the formation of real neural networks which possess both modules and hubs.</p>

        <title>The processing efficiency constraint creates hubs by competition with the wiring cost constraint</title>
        <p>The emergence of hubs can be attributed to the combination of the wiring cost and path efficiency constraints, because a single constraint on its own, either efficiency (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e257" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or wiring cost (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e258" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), does not support hubs in networks as dense as the Macaque cortical network. For sparse networks, such as the one of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the efficiency constraint on its own can generate a global hub, but the hub position is arbitrary. The wiring cost constraint is effective even for small <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e259" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values. In both systems, there is a broad range of the competing parameter (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e260" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Macaque and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e261" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <italic>C. elegans</italic>) where the reconstructed networks are composed of local connections and just one dominant hub. For larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e262" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the wiring cost constraint becomes stronger and several regional hubs emerge, similar to the organization in real networks. However, the wiring cost constraint on its own (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e263" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) cannot enforce hubs in the reconstructed networks.</p>
        <p>The nodes chosen as the hubs in the reconstructed networks occupy the highest ranks of the regional geographical centrality and neighborhood density in order to be wiring economic. Interestingly, real hubs are found close to these nodes with high centrality. Quite strikingly, in the Macaque cortical network, the location of the biggest hub at area V5/MT and the output hub of area 46 in the real network of the Macaque cortical network can be reproduced in the reconstructed networks by the combination of the wiring cost and path efficiency constraint at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e264" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The strong impact from the wiring cost constraint in real networks is further reflected by the economic wiring of these hubs nodes: (1) the areas V5/MT and area 46 stay near the geographical centers of the red and blue clusters, ranked No. 3 and No. 2 of the regional geographical centrality of the red and blue clusters, respectively; these areas have most of their connections within their respective cluster. (2) V5/MT and area 46 are ranked No. 1 and No. 3 in terms of high density of nodes in the neighborhood within a certain range of radius. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the locations of hubs in the reconstructed network were also found to be very close to or overlapping with the position of real hubs, and there is also a regime (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e265" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which best matches modules and hubs to those of the real network. In this regime, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e266" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is close to the real networks, but <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e267" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is much smaller, especially in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neural network.</p>
        <p>It appears in both systems that there are more nodes with larger degrees in the real networks than the reconstructed networks. However, importantly, the nodes with the largest degrees are close to the regional geographical centers similar to the model. Although one cannot expect that only two constraints can recover all the features of the real networks, the observation of the overlapping and close spatial locations of the reconstructed and real hubs (i.e., economic wiring of the hubs) provided clear evidence that probably both cost and efficiency constraints are at work in the real neural systems, supporting the idea of a trade-off between cost and functional values of the networks.</p>

        <title>Robustness against node failure might be an additional constraint</title>
        <p>In a broad range of the balance parameter (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e268" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Macaque and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e269" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <italic>C. elegans</italic>), the reconstructed networks have a single dominant hub linking to most of the nodes. Such a configuration is due to a strong impact of the path efficiency constraint, however, it is not functionally robust. Failure of the single dominant hub node greatly degrades the efficiency in information processing, because without the central hub, the network has mainly local connections. We performed a systematic analysis of the impact of removing the node with the largest degree in the reconstructed networks and measured the increase of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e270" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser3">[94]</xref>. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s010">Fig. S10</xref>. It is seen that in the regime with a single, global hub, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e271" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the reconstructed networks increases significantly when the hub is removed. The degrading effect is much more serious in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, because the reconstructed networks without the hub contain an almost one dimensional array for the neurons in the body that separates head and tail. In the next regime with several regional hubs, (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e272" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Macaque and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e273" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <italic>C. elegans</italic>), the reconstructed networks are much more robust against the removal of the node with the largest degree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s010">Fig. S10</xref>), very close to that in the real network. Thus, while hubs enhance the processing efficiency significantly, they are also the points of vulnerability to pathological damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bullmore2">[52]</xref>. The high energy consumption of the brain puts it under high vulnerability for energy undersupply, and the metabolically most expensive node is particularly vulnerable in pathological circumstances. There is evidence that metabolic costs of a node are proportional to its degree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Vaishnavi1">[95]</xref>; thus some brain disorders may be closely related to hubs' abnormalities. For example, this effect has been speculated to be a network mechanism for Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-He1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bullmore2">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Lo1">[96]</xref>. In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network, laser ablation of hub neurons (AVA and AVB interneurons) generated uncoordinated phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chalfie1">[97]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Schaefer1">[98]</xref>. In particular, laser ablation experiments have demonstrated that AVA neurons are required for normal spontaneous and evoked backward locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bono1">[99]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Chronis1">[101]</xref>, while AVB neurons are responsible for forward locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Gray1">[100]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Wadsworth1">[102]</xref>. Therefore, avoiding the configuration of a single dominant hub could indeed be functionally significant. In conclusion, the robustness requirement might be an additional important factor that generates the evolutionary pressure for the real networks to have more hubs, so that both in Macaque cortical network and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal networks, the competition between the two constraints is settled down to a regime with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e274" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> smaller, but very close to 1.0.</p>

        <title>Differences between reconstructed and real networks imply additional constraints</title>
        <p>We have shown that there is a regime (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e275" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the competition between the two constraints of wiring cost and processing efficiency where the reconstructed networks can reproduce some major properties of the real networks, including the simultaneous formation of hubs and modules, locating hubs or other large-degree notes close to the regional centers of the spatial clusters and similar resilience to node failure. However, there are still significant differences. The reconstructed networks have much smaller wiring length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e276" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (about 54% of the real wiring length for Macaque and nearly 5% for <italic>C. elegans</italic>). This difference stems from the fact that the real networks have more long-range connections: there are more large-degree nodes or hubs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g004">Figs. 4E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), the fraction of spatially local connections <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e277" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is much smaller and the probability of long-range connections is much larger (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g010">Figs. 10E,F</xref>). Moreover, the number of connections is not strongly determined by the neighborhood density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>
        <p>Another significant difference is the asymmetry in the in- and out-degrees in real networks. Although directed links are used in our model influencing the calculation of processing efficiency, the objective function did not contain possible constraints that can reflect the functional role of the asymmetry in the input and output links; the reconstructed networks are thus highly symmetric. In fact, the asymmetry in the biological neural networks may be closely related to functional requirements of specific signal processing flow. For instance, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, there are more connections from the sensory neurons to motor neurons than vice versa. Also from the connection matrix of the Macaque cortical network, there are more connections from some visual areas to the motor system, and fewer along the opposite direction. Therefore, in future work, one may include additional constraints to enforce information flow between different types of nodes, such as input nodes (the sensory neurons or primary sensory areas) and output nodes (the motor neurons or motor areas).</p>
        <p>In our view, the differences imply that most likely real neural networks are influenced by additional functional requirements and constraints. The trade-off between the wiring cost and the processing efficiency with these new constraints could give a better account of the asymmetry and other properties of the real neural networks.</p>

        <title>Conclusion and outlook</title>
        <p>We studied the formation of complex network connectivity derived from multiple constraints, in particular the competition between wiring cost and path efficiency requirements. By reconstructing networks while preserving the spatial layout of the components, we obtained an understanding of the relationship between the spatial layout and network connectivity derived from the multiple constraints. This understanding guided us to investigate the relationship between the spatial layout and network connectivity of the real Macaque cortical network and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network. The results are consistent with previous observations that wiring cost and efficiency constraints are playing an important role in shaping the network organization and provide evidence to support the idea of a trade-off between them. While significant, the wiring cost and path efficiency constraints cannot completely explain all the features in the connectivity patterns of the real Macaque cortical network and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network. Other factors, such as robustness of networks against node failure, more long-range connections and asymmetric input and output information flow appear to be important. Moreover, with our combinatory optimization model, we have mainly discussed the question of which constraints are at work to influence the neural network properties, but have not yet addressed possible mechanisms underlying the biological implementation of these constraints. Exploring additional functional constraints and incorporating them into growth or generative models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Vrtes1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser4">[103]</xref> may be worthwhile directions in the future research.</p>
        <p>The present study on the impact of multiple constraints on the architecture of neural systems might also provide an anatomical foundation for the cost-efficiency balance in human functional networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Bassett2">[79]</xref>.

          <title>Primate cortico-cortical network</title>
          <p>We analyzed the connectivity of Macaque cortical network and its relationship with the three-dimensional spatial layout of the components and compared it to the reconstructed networks in order to understand the impact of multiple constraints. The Macaque network is largely based on a dataset with 94 cortical areas and 2,390 directed projections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>. This data set is more suitable for our purpose compared to other connectivity data sets (e.g., cortical network of cat), since both the spatial positions of the components and the network connectivity are available. The connectivity data and three-dimensional spatial position (the average surface coordinate) of each cortical area were provided by M. Kaiser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biological-networks.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.biological-networks.org/</ext-link>) and amended with the help of the CoCoMac database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cocomac.org" xlink:type="simple">http://cocomac.org</ext-link>).</p>
          <p>This dataset is extensive, but is still partly incomplete. Especially the divisions of motor regions are quite coarse with incomplete connections among several areas (e.g., the motor areas 4 and 6 cover a large territory, 6.5% of neocortex). Generally, it is a challenge to define anatomical parcellations that provide a high spatial resolution as well as a high density of the associated connectivity data. In this study we first improved the data set with a more detailed parcellation of the motor areas based on CoCoMac <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Ktter1">[92]</xref>, which consists of three primary databases: literature, mapping, and connectivity. For the motor areas, there were 39 unique brain maps, 84 unique literature sets, and 454 unique records interrelating brain maps to each other. However, there are many types of inconsistency, including the lack of connectional information of some brain maps in the database, the supra-structure relations not being the symmetric transpose of sub-structure relations, typographical errors, brain regions with different acronyms, but with the same full name, etc. We checked the inconsistent and conflicting data. For instance, those maps lacking of connectional information in the connectivity database or with different acronyms but representing the same regions would not be included in the updated Macaque network. Those connections from the source sites A to the target sites B, if not consistent with the connections of region B receiving from region A, were removed. And connections between a motor area and different sub-structure areas of an existing area in the former database were merged. This expanded collation of data extended the former 6 motor areas to 15 areas (4, 4C, 6, 6D,6DC, 6DR, 6DS, 6m, 6Va, 6Val, 6Vam, 6Vb, SMA, SMAr, SMA-proper) with an additional 128 projections. Spatial positions of these areas were taken as the average surface coordinate, as in a previous approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Kaiser1">[63]</xref>. This improved dataset of the Macaque cortical network has 103 areas and 2518 connections in total. The labels of the areas are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s011">Table S1</xref> of SI, and the adjacency matrix is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, where the new areas and links are highlighted by blue color. Although we applied a detailed dataset for the Macaque cortical network, the connectivity data may still be incomplete. We noticed that the motor region owns relatively low connection density (21.3%), comparing to the connection density of the whole Macaque cortex (23.7%). However, strong fluctuations of node degree and regional connection density have also been observed in most known connectivity data sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Young2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Felleman1">[104]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Markov1">[105]</xref>.</p>
          <p>To examine the reliability of the spatial clustering (see “Spatial clustering” in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>) of the components in this new dataset with 103 areas, we analyzed the clustering in another dataset -“PHT data” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Paxinos1">[93]</xref> with 176 areas from a finer parcellation of the subcortex and parts of the cortex in high magnification.

However, connectivity information for this finer parcellation of areas is not available, and we only used the spatial positions of these areas for the spatial clustering analysis.</p>
          <p>Spatial distance between the areas was calculated as Euclidean distance between the spatial positions of the areas, and the wiring length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e278" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the sum of the distances between connected areas.</p>

Thus the original database of Kaiser with 2105 connections was extended to 2902 connections. The links considered here are all chemical synapses. The formation of gap junctions may require direct contact of cell membrane at certain stage of development, and they are not considered in this study of wiring cost and processing efficiency. The updated network has 276 neurons and 2902 links. The names of the neurons are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002937.s012">Table S2</xref> of SI.

          <title>Spatial clustering</title>
          <p>As seen from two-dimensional projection of the spatial layout and the connectivity of the Macaque cortical network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, the nodes can be roughly divided into two dense groups which are spatially distant from each other. To perform a quantitative analysis of the spatial clustering, we computed the pair-wise Euclidean distance of the nodes to obtain the distance matrix and applied the hierarchical clustering algorithm in MATLAB (linkage.m and cluster.m) to the distance matrix. With a suitable threshold, we could obtain the same number of clusters as network modules in order to compare them appropriately.</p>
          <p>There are various ways to compute distance in agglomerating the hierarchical cluster tree, including <italic>centroid distance, inner squared distance, the shortest distance, the furthest distance, average distance, weighted average distance, and weighted center of mass distance between clusters</italic>. In addition to hierarchical clustering, we also applied the K-means method to minimize the within-cluster sums of point-to-cluster-centroid distances. While the results are deterministic for a given distance measure, they differ slightly for different distance measures. To take this uncertainty into consideration, in this work, we applied the different methods to the real networks of Macaque and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and compared the clusters from different methods to the modules of the real network obtained by the BCT method (see sections “Modularity analysis” and “Matching between partitions” in <italic>Method</italic>). We found that in both systems, the clusters by inner squared distance has the minimal matching rate with the modules, and the group of mismatched nodes is the largest possible to cover all the mismatching sets in the other methods (centroid distance produced the same result as inner squared distance in Macaque). This means that the set of matching areas resulting from the inner squared distance is most stable when different possible clusterings are considered. Thus we used the clusters from the inner squared distance for further comparison with the modules in reconstructed networks.</p>
          <p>The method was applied to the Macaque cortical network to obtain two clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) and to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network to obtain four clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

This maximally covered number in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e327" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is added to the matched set and the rest of the nodes are counted in the mismatched set. Note that it is possible that two or more groups in B can belong to the same group in A. In this way, we identified all the nodes matching the two partitions.

          <p>We also developed a way to judge the significance of matching between partitions by comparing the results to “shuffled modules”. We kept the size of all subgroups <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e328" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of partition B, but randomly shuffled two elements in different subgroups. Such shuffled data have the same n groups as in the real partition B, but the labels of nodes are randomized. We obtained an ensemble of such shuffled modules and calculated the average mismatching rate with the real partition A. In fact, this average value is independent of the group number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e329" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the size of the groups when the ensemble is large enough.

The standard deviation is not small in our work, therefore we heuristically identified hubs in the real and reconstructed networks by the z-score of the degree <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e335" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the node, which is defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e336" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e337" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the average degree of the network and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e338" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the standard deviation of the degree distribution. In a previous analysis of hubs in cortical network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Sporns2">[20]</xref>, a node was regarded as a hub when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e339" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To focus on nodes with the degree significantly larger than the average degree, in our analysis, a node was regarded as a hub when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e340" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

          <p>Under the multiple constraints of wiring cost and processing efficiency, the centrality of a node in the spatial layout of the network, called <italic>geographical centrality</italic> here, may be closely related to its connectivity. To quantify the geographical centrality, we computed the total Euclidean distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e362" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from a node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e363" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to all the other nodes in the network, and ranked the nodes according to this distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e364" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The node with the smallest total distance has the highest geographical centrality.</p>
          <p>We can also measure the geographical centrality with respect to a subset of nodes, for example, within one of the spatial clusters of nodes.</p>

          <title>Comparing the connectivity of reconstructed and real networks and computing the recovery rate</title>
          <p>The most direct way to compare the connectivity of the reconstructed network with the original network is to compare the adjacency matrices using measures such as the Hamming distance. One can measure the number of overlapping entries <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e373" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the two adjacency matrices and obtain the recovery rate as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e374" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (without considering the diagonal entries). However, this result could be biased when the number of 1's (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e375" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the number of 0's (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e376" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are strongly asymmetrical in the network. This is the case for both the Macaque cortical network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e377" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e378" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e379" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e380" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). We followed the method proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Costa1">[27]</xref> to compute the recovery rate as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e381" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e382" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e383" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the recovery rate for 1's and 0's, respectively. In particular, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e384" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e385" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e386" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e387" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the number of overlapping entries with value 1 and 0, respectively.</p>
          <p>The same method can be applied to obtain the recovery rate for subnetworks by considering the corresponding sub-matrices, for example, the connections within and between the spatial clusters or the modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002937-g010">Fig. 10C,D</xref>).

          <title>Testing whether degrees follow power-law distribution</title>
          <p>We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and maximum-likelihood fitting methods (MLEs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002937-Clauset1">[111]</xref>, to test whether the degree distribution in real or reconstructed networks can be fitted by a power-law function. First, the following power-law model<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002937.e388"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e388" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

Then an ensemble of surrogate data (with the same number of data points as in the degree distribution) is generated from the above power-law function with the estimated <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e391" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e392" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e393" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e394" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>th surrogate data set and the model function can be obtained and compared to the distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e395" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between the degree distribution and the model. A <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e396" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value is obtained as the fraction of surrogate data sets in the ensemble with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e397" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e398" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is large (close to 1), then the difference between the degree distribution and the power-law model can mainly be attributed to the statistical fluctuation. But if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e399" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is small (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e400" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), then the power-law can be ruled out for this degree distribution.</p>

          <title>Significance test of correlation</title>
          <p>We studied several types of correlations between two data sets of small sizes, e.g., correlation between degrees and density in the reconstructed and real networks. To evaluate the significance of the correlation between two finite-size data sets, we used the method of surrogate data. We randomly reshuffled the order of one of the data sets and computed the correlation values for 100 realizations of the random reshuffling. From the distribution of the correlation of such surrogate data one can obtain the standard deviation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002937.e401" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.
