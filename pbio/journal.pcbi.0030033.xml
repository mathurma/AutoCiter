Recent examples have shown that sequence changes introduced by AS may be comparable to those introduced by GD. In addition, the two processes are inversely correlated at the genomic scale: large gene families are depleted in splice variants and vice versa. All together, these data strongly suggest that both phenomena result in interchangeability between their effects. Here, we tested the extent to which this applies with respect to various protein characteristics. The amounts of AS and GD per gene are anticorrelated even when accounting for different gene functions or degrees of sequence divergence. In contrast, the two processes appear to be independent in their influence on variation in mRNA expression. Further, we conducted a detailed comparison of the effect of sequence changes in both alternative splice variants and gene duplicates on protein structure, in particular the size, location, and types of sequence substitutions and insertions/deletions. We find that, in general, alternative splicing affects protein sequence and structure in a more drastic way than gene duplication and subsequent divergence. Our results reveal an interesting paradox between the anticorrelation of AS and GD at the genomic level, and their impact at the protein level, which shows little or no equivalence in terms of effects on protein sequence, structure, and function. We discuss possible explanations that relate to the order of appearance of AS and GD in a gene family, and to the selection pressure imposed by the environment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Alternative splicing (AS) and gene duplication (GD) followed by sequence divergence constitute two fundamental biological processes contributing to proteome variability. The former reflects the ability of many genes to express different products, while the latter results in several copies of the same gene that are similar but not identical. In spite of these obvious differences, recent computational studies as well as anecdotal experimental evidence suggested that AS and GD produce functionally interchangeable protein variants. We provide a detailed study of the differences between alternative splicing and gene duplication and discuss potential interchangeability with respect to variation in expression, protein structure, and function.

Interestingly, several recent studies point to a direct equivalence between AS and GD. There are some cases where alternative splice variants in one organism are similar to gene duplicates in another organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b009">9</xref>]. For example, the eukaryotic splicing factor U2AF35 has at least two functional splice variants in human, U2AF35a and U2AF35b, which differ by seven amino acids in the RNA recognition motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). The fugu orthologue U2AF35-a has no splice variant; instead there is a duplicate gene U2AF35-b with changes identical to those found in the human splice variant U2AF35b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b009">9</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0030033-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030033.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Equivalence between Alternative Splicing and Gene Duplication</title><p>(A) The alignment shows an example of molecular equivalence between the effects of AS and GD. The human U2AF35 gene has two known splice variants, Hs_U2AF35a and Hs_U2AF35b, that differ along the region marked with a red box. The fugu orthologue Fr_U2AF35-a does not have known splice variants, but instead has a paralogue, Fr_U2AF35-b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b009">9</xref>]. All sequences have kindly been provided by T. R. Pacheco and M. Carmo-Fonseca. For some residues (bold, highlighted in light blue), the substitutions amongst the human splice variants are equivalent to those in the fugu GD. The cartoon illustrates the relationship between the human and fugu sequences. The names of genes and their protein products are denoted in small and capital letters, respectively. At the molecular level, AS and GD show equivalent changes to sequence, and therefore are likely to have interchangeable effects on structure and function of the proteins. In this work we study whether such molecular interchangeability holds in general.</p><p>(B) We compared the characteristics of two types of sequence changes, indels and substitutions, between AS (both shown in dark blue) and GD (shown in dark and light blue). On top, we illustrate an indel event (the deleted stretch is highlighted in red, and two dotted lines denote its location); at the bottom, we illustrate substitution events (red lines represent residue matches between sequences, linked by dotted lines; the continuous lines between alternative splice isoforms represent the boundaries of the interchanged stretches).</p><p>(C) We used this protocol in all sequence comparisons between AS and GD. Changes between alternative splice isoforms are obtained after comparing the SwissProt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b044">44</xref>] reference isoform with the remaining isoforms. Changes between duplicates are obtained by comparing the SwissProt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b044">44</xref>] reference isoforms of the genes that are part of one GD family.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030033.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Further, the changes introduced to a sequence are constrained by the need to preserve a stable and functional three-dimensional (3-D) fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b010">10</xref>]. Indeed, structural studies have shown that insertions and deletions between gene duplicates tend to happen at sequence locations where they are less damaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b011">11</xref>], such as loops at solvent-accessible locations. These restrictions will apply irrespective of the source of the changes and thus may introduce a certain degree of similarity between the sequence changes associated with GD and AS. Finally, recent studies have shown that AS and GD are inversely correlated on a genome-wide scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b013">13</xref>], i.e., small gene families tend to have more genes with alternative splice variants than do large families. These findings together—i.e., anecdotal examples, structural constraints, and anticorrelation at the genomic level—suggest that AS and GD are interchangeable sources of functional diversification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b012">12</xref>]. Genes with AS would not need to produce additional variants in the form of duplicates, and vice versa<italic>.</italic></p><p>Here, we first tested the anticorrelation between AS and GD with respect to sequence divergence, function, and gene expression. Second, we studied the interchangeability hypothesis at the protein structure level and asked to what extent AS and GD introduce changes to the sequence that are equivalent in their nature and effect on structure and function. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparison of the effects of AS and GD on human and mouse proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g001">1</xref>C; the results for the analysis of the mouse data can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). For the vast majority of cases, the two processes result in different protein modifications with different functional implications. This finding, while consistent with the different molecular mechanisms underlying both phenomena, contradicts the anticorrelation observed at the genomic level. We discuss some possible explanations for this paradox.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genomic Analysis</title><p>In accordance with recent findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b013">13</xref>], AS and GD are anticorrelated at the genomic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). There are fewer alternatively spliced genes in large families of gene duplicates than expected in an unbiased distribution. This depletion is strongest in gene families of high sequence identity (seq.id) (&gt;80% seq.id., GD80, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), and weaker but still present for more diverged families (&gt;40% seq.id, GD40).

Information on AS has been taken from the AltSplice database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b043">43</xref>]. GD families were obtained by clustering all sequences of more than 40%, 60%, 80%, or 90% seq.id., respectively, using CD-HIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b047">47</xref>]. The dashed line marks the expected fraction of genes with AS, given an unbiased distribution of all known genes with splice variants across the whole genome.

At the same time, these functions are depleted amongst genes with alternative splice variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b015">15</xref>], which is also reflected in our data (E-value &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup>).</p><p>When removing from our dataset the 855 and 293 proteins predicted to be G protein–coupled receptor-like or ribosomal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b014">14</xref>], respectively, the bias against genes with both AS and GD (AS+/GD+) is still strongly significant (<italic>p</italic>-value ≪ 0.001). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-st003">Table S3</xref> for details. Thus, the anticorrelation between AS and GD is not due to biases amongst genes of different functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Variation in expression patterns.</title><p>We further characterized the relationship between AS and GD by comparing their patterns of expression among different tissues, which reflect corresponding regulatory processes. A previous study reported that AS and general transcription regulation act independently on different groups of genes with tissue-specific expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b016">16</xref>]. Here we do not compare tissue specificity, but the overall extent of variation in expression introduced by AS and GD. More precisely, we studied whether the extent of coexpression (i.e., the lack of expression variation) between alternative splice isoforms is comparable to that found between duplicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). If AS and GD are functionally interchangeable, then we would expect a similar amount of coexpression amongst their products.</p><p>The level of coexpression was measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PC) between the expression patterns of two isoforms among a set of tissues, in the case of AS, or of two duplicates, in the case of GD. When more than two isoforms (or duplicates) were available, we averaged the PCs resulting from all the possible comparisons between them (see Material and Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-sg010">Figure S10</xref>). PC values near 1 or 0 correspond to high or low coexpression, respectively.</p><p>We directly compared the coexpression in alternative splice variants (AS coexpression) and in gene duplicates (GD coexpression) using data from the same microarray experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b017">17</xref>] (white diamonds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">Figure 2</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">2</xref>D). We observe that the overall AS coexpression (PC = 0.27 ± 0.23) is comparable to the overall GD coexpression of GD families with &gt;40% sequence similarity (PC = 0.24 ± 0.33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">Figure 2</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">2</xref>D, red line and diamond). This suggests that AS and GD40 may have comparable levels of coexpression—that is, they both span similar ranges of tissue expression, though the underlying molecular regulation generating coexpression of AS isoforms and GD40 transcripts is different. However, due to the relatively small size of the dataset and the use of exon junctions as a proxy for alternative splice variants, this result should be treated with care.</p><p>We also explored whether we can observe, at the expression level, an anticorrelation in analogy to that found at the sequence level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). A previous study has shown that duplicates diverge quickly in their expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b018">18</xref>], so we would expect a smaller amount of GD coexpression for genes without AS (AS–/GD+) than for those with AS (AS+/GD+). However, we find the opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), although the trend is very weak and in most cases the statistical power is low. This reverse trend suggests that in AS+/GD+ families, expression variation amongst alternative splice isoforms may contribute independently of the GD expression variation to the overall expression variation amongst all AS and GD variants of the gene; we observe some additivity rather than complementarity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">Figure 2</xref>D confirms this finding for AS coexpression: there is no obvious anticorrelation between AS and GD in terms of their effect on expression variation amongst their variants.</p><p>We note that the coexpression analysis is at present still limited by the amount of data available.

There are two basic types of sequence changes in both AS and GD: substitutions, and insertions or deletions (indels) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Both can be described in terms of their length, the nature of the affected amino acid residues, and their location in the structure or relative to each other in the sequence. We use these properties as changes in their values can be directly related to changes in protein structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b019">19</xref>].

However, GD data at the 80% seq.id. level may display only a few sequence changes, resulting in larger than expected differences between AS and GD. To avoid this bias we have also considered more diverged families, defined by a 40% seq.id. threshold. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-sg005">Figure S5</xref> contains additional analyses on GD, using families defined by common protein domains.

However, same global seq.id. values may correspond to very different distributions of amino acid replacements along the sequence.

However, we also observe a small number of cases in which the interchangeability hypothesis may be true, and the sequence changes introduced by AS and GD are equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0030033-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030033.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of the Effects of Alternative Splicing and Gene Duplication on Sequence and Structure</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030033.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Substitutions or Insertions/Deletions</td><td><hr/>Characteristic</td><td><hr/>Alternative Splice Variants</td><td><hr/>Gene Duplicates</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>Substitutions</bold></td><td>Sequence identity</td><td>Global: high (&gt;90&percnt;)</td><td>Global: depends on cutoff (&gt;40&percnt; or &gt;80&percnt;)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Local<sup>a</sup>: low (&lt;30&percnt;)</td><td>Local<sup>b</sup>: high (&gt;70&percnt; for GD80), medium (&gt;40&percnt; for GD40)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Nature of the amino acid changes</td><td>Mostly nonconservative</td><td>Mostly conservative (GD80), less conservative (GD40)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Size (maximal mismatch distance) and location</td><td>Small (&lt;20&percnt; of sequence length), localized to one region</td><td>Long (&gt;80&percnt; of sequence length), distributed along the whole sequence</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Insertions/Deletions</bold></td><td>Size of indels at N- or C-terminus of sequence</td><td>Very long (&gt;100 aa)</td><td>Short (&lt;15 aa)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Size of indels between sequence termini</td><td>Mid-size to long (&gt;15 aa)</td><td>Very short (&lt;5 aa)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Location</td><td>Usually do not overlap with GD indels; possibly at a large variety of locations, from exposed to buried, and from loop to helix and/or beta strand</td><td>Preferably at exposed loop locations &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b011">11</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>This table summarizes the differences between changes in sequence and structure that are observed in AS and GD, respectively.

Duplicated genes tend to have fewer exons than genes that have no duplicates but alternative splice variants (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-sg008">Figure S8</xref>). This trend may in part be due to retrotransposition events which create duplicates which are single-exon genes that cannot have splice variants. However, when accounting for single-exon genes, the anticorrelation between AS and GD is still observed (see Kopelman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b012">12</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-sg011">Figure S11</xref>). In addition, the anticorrelation may arise from a combination of the negative selection pressures introduced by dosage balance effects. In singleton genes that have evolved a splice variant, duplication may be disfavoured due to a multiple simultaneous dosage balance effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b036">36</xref>]: a single duplication event would produce a multitude of additional gene variants whose functions interfere with the existing, tightly regulated system of biological processes. This effect would be weaker for genes without AS, thus introducing a bias towards their duplication. This bias may be reinforced, under conditions of environmental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b038">38</xref>], by the need to increase expression levels of a desirable function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b040">40</xref>]. Further, the retention of duplicates as a potential backup system may be fostered if a gene is essential for the cell's survival upon gene knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b041">41</xref>]. In contrast, the introduction of AS in essential genes does not directly support robustness against null-mutations, and may even be slightly deleterious. Thus, essentiality of genes may contribute to the inverse relationship between AS and GD.</p><p>Finally, if a gene with AS has duplicated, subsequent loss of an isoform in one of the copies may be tolerated due to the existence of an identical version of this isoform in the other copy of the gene. This explanation is supported by recent findings on the evolution of AS upon GD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b013">13</xref>], and the fact that the depletion in AS is stronger for closely related duplicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, 80% seq.id.). Such a scenario would also be an extension of the backup role shown for paralogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b042">42</xref>].</p><p>A combination of these effects would, in general, result in a smaller proportion of genes with AS in gene families with more than one duplicate, in particular for recent duplicates, suggesting that the chronological order of events plays a role. Subsequent divergence of the gene duplicates may alleviate the negative impact of the dosage balance effect, allowing the evolution of AS and reducing the anticorrelation between AS and GD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Genomic Analysis</title><sec id="s3a1"><title>Datasets.</title><p>To test the relationship between GD and AS at the genomic level, we used: (i) clusters of homologous sequences inferred from the seq.id. (equivalent to gene families); (ii) sets of known or predicted alternative splice variants, or isoforms, for a particular gene. An overview of the data is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-st001">Table S1</xref>. For AS genes, we primarily used the datasets downloadable from EBI AltSplice server (releases 2.0 for both mouse and human) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b043">43</xref>].</p><p>In addition, we compared the findings using the AltSplice dataset with findings using data from the SwissProt database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b044">44</xref>] and the Ensembl predictions of splice variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b045">45</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-st001">Table S1</xref>). Genes that have more than one transcript variant in either one of the three sets are denoted AS+. A small number of false positives can be expected in each of the three AS+ sets. Within the set of sequences without AS (AS−), we expect a fraction of false negatives, that is, genes that splice alternatively but for which we have no data yet. However, it is unlikely that these false positives or false negatives coincide across each dataset, as each database used its own approach to derive the data, and we expect no systematic error. All three datasets show the same trends (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-st001">Table S1</xref>), consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b013">13</xref>].</p><p>To estimate GD, we used the Ensembl protein predictions for human (version 37.35j) and mouse (version 37.34e) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-st001">Table S1</xref>). Both genomes were made nonredundant in that we only included the longest, predicted transcript for each gene, and the sequences were filtered for low-complexity regions using the seg program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b046">46</xref>]. To obtain families of paralogous genes, the sequences were clustered to 40%, 60%, 80%, and 90% seq.id. using CD-HIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b047">47</xref>]. The higher the seq.id. cutoff for a family, the more conserved are the family members: clusters of 40% seq.id. are expected to be larger and contain more distantly related sequences than clusters of 80% seqid. Clusters with more than one sequence are termed GD<italic>+</italic>, denoting the existence of homologues. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-sg001">Figure S1</xref> shows the distribution of human sequences across GD families of different sizes, using a variety of seq.id. cutoffs.

To test for a possible bias in GD families (GD+) stemming from retrotransposition, we examined the distribution of single-exon genes across AS and GD sets using the SEGE database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b049">49</xref>], similar to an approach described by Kopelman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b012">12</xref>]. The procedure followed was: (i) all human genes were clustered according to 80% seq.id.; (ii) all genes were labelled according to their known AS; and (iii) the number of single-exon genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b049">49</xref>] amongst singletons, gene families, and genes with/without AS was calculated. This distribution across genes with AS and/or GD is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-st002">Table S2</xref>. If retrotransposition was a major source of GD without AS (AS−/GD+), then we would expect to see a bias towards single-exon genes in this category. This is not the case; also see Kopelman et al.

We measured GD coexpression of a GD family, i.e., the amount of coexpression amongst gene duplicates, as the average pairwise PC between the gene expression vectors of all family members. For gene families of &gt;80% seq.id., the 3,840 genes in the dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b017">17</xref>] did not provide enough families with more than two members to be suitable for further analysis.

While the data may be biased by the curation process, several facts suggest that this potential bias would not affect our results. First, the proportions of isoforms showing indels and substitutions in our sample, 73% and 27%, respectively, are comparable with those inferred from other studies: 76% and 24% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b058">58</xref>], and 67% and 33% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b059">59</xref>]. Second, the anticorrelation observed between AS and GD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030033-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) can be reproduced with SwissProt data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b044">44</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-sg011">Figure S11</xref>). Third, our data could be biased by the existence of nonfunctional isoforms targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b060">60</xref>]. When repeating our analysis after eliminating those isoforms that can be targeted to NMD (about 8% of the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030033-b061">61</xref>]), there was no difference in the results compared with those from the original data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030033-sg006">Figure S6</xref>A).

The redundancy correction consisted of dividing the contribution of each indel in the frequency histogram by the number of sequences in the family cluster.

The maximal mismatch distance is the number of residues between the two most distant, nonconservative substitutions, normalized by whole sequence length. Nonconservative mismatches have a negative value in the Blosum62 matrix and were chosen for their stronger impact in protein structure and function.
