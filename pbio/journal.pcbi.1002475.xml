        <p>Well-studied innate immune systems exist throughout bacteria and archaea, but a more recently discovered genomic locus may offer prokaryotes surprising immunological adaptability. Mediated by a cassette-like genomic locus termed <underline>C</underline>lustered <underline>R</underline>egularly <underline>I</underline>nterspaced <underline>S</underline>hort <underline>P</underline>alindromic <underline>R</underline>epeats (CRISPR), the microbial adaptive immune system differs from its eukaryotic immune analogues by incorporating new immunities unidirectionally. CRISPR thus stores genomically recoverable timelines of virus-host coevolution in natural organisms refractory to laboratory cultivation. Here we combined a population genetic mathematical model of CRISPR-virus coevolution with six years of metagenomic sequencing to link the recoverable genomic dynamics of CRISPR loci to the unknown population dynamics of virus and host in natural communities. Metagenomic reconstructions in an acid-mine drainage system document CRISPR loci conserving ancestral immune elements to the base-pair across thousands of microbial generations. This ‘trailer-end conservation’ occurs despite rapid viral mutation and despite rapid prokaryotic genomic deletion. The trailer-ends of many reconstructed CRISPR loci are also largely identical across a population. ‘Trailer-end clonality’ occurs despite predictions of host immunological diversity due to negative frequency dependent selection (kill the winner dynamics). Statistical clustering and model simulations explain this lack of diversity by capturing rapid selective sweeps by highly immune CRISPR lineages. Potentially explaining ‘trailer-end conservation,’ we record the first example of a viral bloom overwhelming a CRISPR system. The polyclonal viruses bloom even though they share sequences previously targeted by host CRISPR loci. Simulations show how increasing random genomic deletions in CRISPR loci purges immunological controls on long-lived viral sequences, allowing polyclonal viruses to bloom and depressing host fitness. Our results thus link documented patterns of genomic conservation in CRISPR loci to an evolutionary advantage against persistent viruses. By maintaining old immunities, selection may be tuning CRISPR-mediated immunity against viruses reemerging from lysogeny or migration.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Most microbes appear unculturable in the laboratory, limiting our knowledge of how virus and prokaryotic host evolve in natural systems. However, a genomic locus found in many prokaryotes, CRISPR, may offer cultivation-independent probes of virus-microbe coevolution. Utilizing nearby genes, CRISPR can serially incorporate short viral and plasmid sequences. These sequences bind and cleave cognate regions in subsequent viral and plasmid insertions, conferring adaptive anti-viral and anti-plasmid immunity. By incorporating sequences undirectionally, CRISPR also provides timelines of virus-prokaryote coevolution. Yet, CRISPR only incorporates 30–80 base-pair viral sequences, leaving incomplete coevolutionary recordings. To reconstruct the missing coevolutionary dynamics shaping natural CRISPRs, we combined metagenomic reconstructions with population-scale mathematical modeling. Capturing rare and rapid sweeps of CRISPR diversity by highly immune lines, mathematical modeling explains why naturally reconstructed CRISPR loci are often largely identical across a population. Both model and experiment further document surprising proliferations of old viral sequences against which hosts had preexisting CRISPR immunity. Due to these deadly blooms of ancestral viral elements, CRISPR's conservation of old immune sequences appears to confer a selective advantage. This may explain the striking immunological memory documented in CRISPR loci, which occurs despite rapid viral mutation and despite rapid deletions in prokaryotic genomes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Innate immune systems with built-in self/non-self recognition mechanisms have long been known to protect prokaryotic genomes against insertions of foreign DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Labrie1">[1]</xref>. For example, well-studied restriction-modification systems often preserve genomic integrity by methylating prokaryotic DNA, enabling prokaryotes to recognize and cleave unmethylated foreign DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Wilson1">[2]</xref>. Yet, the foreign DNA attacking prokaryotes includes the most abundant and rapidly diversifying members of the biosphere, viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Edwards1">[3]</xref>. With viruses quickly evolving counter-strategies against prokaryotic immune systems, prokaryotes require immunological plasticity to keep pace. Here we computationally predict and directly document the evolution of an adaptive immune system that enables prokaryotes to serially acquire new immunities against diversifying viruses and plasmids. Importantly, the prokaryotic adaptive immune system is genomically encoded (i.e., hereditable) and acquires new immune elements unidirectionally, making this adaptive immune system distinct from its eukaryotic analogues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Barrangou1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Marraffini1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The microbial adaptive immune system is mediated by a genomic locus termed <underline>C</underline>lustered <underline>R</underline>egularly <underline>I</underline>nterspaced <underline>S</underline>hort <underline>P</underline>alindromic <underline>R</underline>epeats (CRISPR). CRISPR loci have been found in approximately 45% of sequenced bacteria and over 90% of sequenced archaea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Marraffini2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Horvath1">[7]</xref>. Utilizing adjacently encoded <underline>C</underline>RISPR-<underline>a</underline>ssociated (Cas) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Makarova1">[8]</xref>, CRISPR loci incorporate short 21–72 base-pair sequences from targeted regions in invading viruses and plasmids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Barrangou1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Marraffini2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Horvath1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Makarova2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Garneau1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Mojica1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-vanderOost1">[12]</xref>. Once transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNAs, these viral and plasmid-derived sequences confer sequence-specific immunity by binding and cleaving cognate viral and plasmid regions during subsequent genomic invasions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Manica1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Brouns1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The viral and plasmid binding sequences incorporated into host CRISPR loci are termed ‘spacers,’ reflecting their addition interspacing highly synonymous 23–47 base-pair sequences, termed ‘repeats’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Barrangou1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Deveau1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Horvath2">[16]</xref>. Correspondingly, the targeted viral and plasmid sequences are known as ‘proto-spacers’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Barrangou1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Deveau1">[15]</xref>. With spacer immunity specific to a matching proto-spacer sequence, viruses can escape CRISPR targeting by mutating their proto-spacers or by mutating nearby <underline>p</underline>roto-spacer <underline>a</underline>djacent <underline>m</underline>otifs (PAMs), regions which likely act as recognition sites for the CRISPR/Cas machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Barrangou1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Deveau1">[15]</xref>. Natural selection favors the emergence of viruses with mutations in CRISPR-targeted regions, leading to a coevolutionary arms race <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Dawkins1">[17]</xref> as hosts incorporate new spacers to combat viral adaptations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Makarova1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Deveau1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Andersson1">[18]</xref>. Coevolutionary arms races have been well-documented in other virus-microbe systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Brockhurst1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Gomez1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Morran1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Paterson1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Buckling1">[23]</xref>. Yet, unlike previously studied coevolutionary wars, CRISPR recorded arms races naturally differentiate current host adaptations from previous host adaptations. This is because new spacers are added unidirectionally, adjacent to a leader sequence at a single end of the locus termed the ‘leader-end.’ Previously acquired spacers are also commonly maintained, leaving a cassette-like recording of current (i.e., spacers closest to the leader-end) and past (i.e., spacers farther from the leader-end) adaptations. Partial timelines of coevolution can thus be constructed for host and viral species refractory to laboratory challenge experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Edwards1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Previously, we described one CRISPR recording through metagenomic reconstructions of the CRISPR loci sampled from floating microbial biofilms in an <underline>a</underline>cid <underline>m</underline>ine <underline>d</underline>rainage (AMD) system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Denef1">[24]</xref>. The prime advantage of probing these generally closed, acidophilic environments is that they are dominated by relatively few species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Wilmes1">[25]</xref>. Our AMD research targeted the extremophilic archaeon I-plasma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Andersson1">[18]</xref>. Growing in an AMD biofilm matrix at temperatures ranging from approximately 30° to 48° Celsius and pHs ranging from approximately 0.3 to 1.2, I-plasma is one of around 12 species in the acidophilic order Thermoplasmatales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Dick1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Baker1">[27]</xref>. Reconstructing the CRISPR loci of I-plasma, we noted that the newest, leader-end spacers emerged highly diverse and cell-specific. In contrast, the trailer-end spacers (i.e., the oldest spacers found farthest from the leader sequence) were highly clonal population-wide, matching earlier observations of trailer-end clonality in acidophilic <italic>Leptospirillum</italic> bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Tyson1">[28]</xref> and more recent observations in bacterial <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and archaeal <italic>Sulfolobus islandicus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Held1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-DiezVillasenor1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, I-plasma's trailer-end spacers appeared conserved despite appearing to provide no immunity against current viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In reconstructions (∼20-fold coverage) of the I-plasma locus in the AMD biofilm, only newly acquired leader-end CRISPR spacers matched currently sampled viruses, implying that previously targeted viral sequences had since evolved or disappeared. Similarly, laboratory challenge experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Barrangou1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Deveau1">[15]</xref> document rapid viral evolution in the face of CRISPR targeting.</p>
      <p>Here we sought to understand why trailer-end spacers are often conserved despite failing to confer immunity against current viruses. Trailer-end conservation is especially surprising in light of the genomic compactness of Bacteria and Archaea, whose genomes rarely exceed 13MB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Koonin1">[31]</xref>. Prokaryotes have also been shown to delete genetic material approximately ten times as frequently as they insert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Kuo1">[32]</xref>. With a bias toward genomic deletions, we hypothesized that bacteria and archaea would only preserve CRISPR's genetic material if natural selection favored it.</p>
      <p>To find and probe the selection pressure driving the preservation of CRISPR trailer-ends, we combined metagenomic reconstructions of CRISPR loci across a multi-year period with a population-genetic mathematical model of virus-CRISPR dynamics in a natural system. Three previous studies have constructed mathematical models of virus-host dynamics in the CRISPR system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-He1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Levin1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Haerter1">[35]</xref>, but none were built to explain why CRISPR loci emerge with both trailer-end clonality and trailer-end conservation. Building a model in which CRISPR locus length is an emergent property of the model parameters, we probe whether tuning parameters to increase trailer-end conservation increases prokaryotic fitness even when viruses mutate rapidly. We further capture the dynamics through which the trailer-ends of CRISPR loci are purged of spacer diversity.</p>

        <title>Model</title>
        <p>A population-genetic model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s010">Text S1</xref> for the full algorithm) was built to analyze how the intracellular processes of CRISPR and virus mutation drive the long-term development of natural CRISPR loci captured via metagenomic analysis. For simplicity, the model restricts its study of host and viral genomes to monitoring host spacers and viral proto-spacers. All other elements in the genomes are ignored. Host and viral populations are then divided into ‘strains’: all hosts sharing the same ordered set of spacers are assigned to a single host strain while all viruses with identical proto-spacers are assigned to a single viral strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Each strain's cumulative frequency is tracked across thousands of iterations, as mutations alter host immunity and viral infectivity.</p>
        <p>The iterations of the model are not directly dependent on time. Each iteration is instead defined to be the period of variable duration in which a large, preset number of virus-host interactions occurs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002475-t001">Table 1</xref>). During each virus-host interaction, one of two possible outcomes generally occurs. If the host and viral strains share a spacer, the host survives and the virus is cleared. Conversely, if no spacer is shared, the virus kills the host and the virus survives. Of course, exceptions to both of these situations are allowed in the model. Hosts are given a small probability of surviving even when lacking spacers against an invading virus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002475-t001">Table 1</xref>). Further, CRISPR is given a small probability of failing to provide immunity even when a host spacer matches an infecting virus' proto-spacer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002475-t001">Table 1</xref>). This failure rate has been measured in viral plaquing assays conducted by two independent groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Barrangou1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Semenova1">[36]</xref>.</p>

        <p>With a large number of interactions per iteration, virus-host interactions are assumed to be well-mixed and distributed according to strain frequencies. Since viruses are most likely to encounter high-frequency host strains, this selects for the viral lines that can kill the dominant hosts, resulting in negative frequency-dependent selection, a process termed ‘kill the winner’ in microbial ecology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Thingstad1">[37]</xref>. During some interactions, stochastic mutations create new host and viral strains, as hosts unidirectionally add spacers and viruses mutate random proto-spacers. Old host and viral strains are simultaneously depressed in frequency and driven extinct when no longer immune and infective, respectively. At the end of an iteration, the model takes a metagenomic snapshot of the surviving host and viral populations. We analyzed these snapshots across model iterations to capture patterns of CRISPR-driven immunity as they emerge.</p>
        <sec id="s1a1">
          <title>Model assumptions</title>
          <p>Here we describe the main assumptions of the model; a more in-depth analysis of each model assumption can be found in the Supplementary Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s011">Text S2</xref>). First, the model assumes that virus and host populations do not go irreversibly extinct. With host and viral populations continually extant, in each iteration the model can simply wait until any preset number of virus-host interactions occurs. We can thus define iterations to be the variable duration period in which such a preset number of interactions occurs. Empirical support for assuming the long-run coexistence of virus and host in natural environments comes from two metagenomic studies. In the first study, Rodriguez-Brito <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-RodriguezBrito1">[38]</xref> recovered consistently high amounts of virus and host genomes in four aquatic regions across a year-long period. Similarly, in the experimental part of our study, we reconstructed the relative abundances of CRISPR loci and viruses in an acid mine drainage system across the last two years of our six-year metagenomic time series experiment. In each sampling, both host and viral genomes were recovered.</p>
          <p>Large microbial population sizes limit the effect of sampling noise in modulating the frequencies (genetic drift) of established strains in our model. But since new mutants arise at low frequencies, we incorporated demographic stochasticity in their ability to establish (<italic>i.e.</italic>, avoid extinction due to a low initial frequency). We did so by allowing new mutants randomly distributed ‘emergence periods’ during which they were not subject to the model's clearance of low-frequency strains. All strains, excluding new mutants in their randomly-sized emergence periods, are cleared when their frequencies drop below a threshold, effecting mutation-selection balance and preventing the model from accumulating an uncontrollable number of strains as new mutants are created. Thus, without the randomness component, the emergence period allows new mutants a chance to reach ‘establishment frequencies,’ after which each mutant can compete in the model solely via its CRISPR-determined fitness.</p>
          <p>By increasing the rate at which viable mutants establish, the emergence period increases competition between distinct spacer-adding lines (clonal interference). This promotes ‘kill the winner’ dynamics, making it harder for individual lines to sweep. Despite this increase in competition among beneficial mutants, below we capture losses of trailer-end diversity and rapid selective sweeps. To assure that these results also occur without the emergence period, we tested the model without an emergence period and found both trailer-end clonality and stochastic sweeps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

        <title>CRISPR trailer-end conservation across multi-year reconstructions</title>
        <p>Before analyzing the selective pressure responsible for trailer-end conservation in the single snapshot of CRISPR loci shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s001">Figure S1</xref>, we first sought to rigorously determine whether hosts actually preserve CRISPR trailer-ends across evolutionary timescales. To do so, we metagenomically tracked CRISPR spacer content and structure in a natural system over a six-year period. Our analyses focused on an archaeal G-plasma population and abundant viruses that target it. Like I-plasma, G-plasma is a species in the order Thermoplasmatales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Dick1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Baker1">[27]</xref>. Yet, G-plasma and I-plasma are sufficiently divergent at the rRNA gene sequence and amino acid level to be considered distinct genera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Yelton1">[39]</xref>. Moreover, the lineages show limited genome synteny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Yelton1">[39]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the extent to which G-plasma CRISPR locus spacers are conserved across time, we metagenomically reconstructed G-plasma CRISPR fragments seven times during the six-year study. In each sampling, the spacers in the CRISPR loci were aligned based on flanking genome sequences and paired read information (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Notably, trailer-end spacers were conserved in both loci across the multi-year period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g002">2</xref>).</p>

In each sampling, the CRISPR spacers (boxes) are aligned horizontally according to their ordering in the metagenomic reads, with CRISPR repeats removed for compactness. Overlapping 454 spacer patterns are also condensed (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The left-ends are the leader-ends, where new spacers are unidirectionally incorporated. Boxes filled with the same color represent identical spacers, with two exceptions. Black-filled boxes show flanking genetic material and white-filled boxes denote cell-specific spacers found only once in the dataset. White gaps reflect unsequenced regions in the metagenomic reconstructions. When separated spacers can be linked via paired reads, the intervening region is shown as a grey bar. Boxes containing a black ‘X’ indicate probable spacer deletions. When spacers match reconstructed AMDV3b viral sequences, diamonds are inserted, with filled diamonds showing perfect matches and open diamonds reflecting imperfect matches. Trailer-end conservation (presumed immunological memory) and clonality are pronounced in this locus, with large numbers of matching spacers preserved across the six-year period. Another example of trailer-end conservation and clonality—in the CRISPR loci of archaeal I-plasma—is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p>

        <p>Spacer preservation occurs despite deletions of single and multiple spacer-repeat units. Deletions of old spacers have also been observed in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Horvath1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Deveau1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Horvath2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Tyson1">[28]</xref>. With new spacers more likely to provide immunity against current co-evolving viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Andersson1">[18]</xref>, we wondered why trailer-end CRISPR spacers are maintained. To probe whether natural selection conserves old spacers to maintain immunity against persisting viruses, we used the community genomic data across time to reconstruct putative viruses throughout the multi-year period (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We previously noted that the first reconstructed virus, AMDV3, targets G-plasma. We inferred G-plasma targeting by detecting matches between G-plasma's CRISPR spacers and corresponding ‘proto-spacer’ sequences in AMDV3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Andersson1">[18]</xref>. In the current study, a variant of AMDV3, denoted AMDV3b, was reconstructed and shown to also target G-Plasma. Importantly, each viral population is genomically heterogeneous due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and sequence insertions and deletions.</p>
        <p>To test whether conserved trailer-end spacers may provide immunity to persisting viruses, we mapped G-plasma CRISPR spacers onto the reconstructed viral genomes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). While most spacers shared between host and viral genomes were found at the new ends of G-plasma loci, several spacers with perfect identity to AMDV3b persist in older regions across all sampled times. The spacers matching AMDV3b are shown with black diamonds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

        <title>Modeling reconstructs rapid depletions of CRISPR diversity</title>
        <p>In addition to maintaining trailer-end spacers (‘trailer-end conservation’), reconstructed CRISPR loci show far less spacer diversity at trailer-end positions than leader-end positions (‘trailer-end clonality’). Unlike conservation, trailer-end clonality could have been expected from single time-point reconstructions, as have been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Tyson1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Held1">[29]</xref>. Yet, previous analyses could not explain the dynamics through which trailer-end clonality emerges in natural CRISPR loci. In the I-plasma locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s001">Figure S1</xref>), all but the four newest spacer positions are clonal population-wide, indicating a recent selective sweep by an immune host lineage. Such a selective sweep is surprising in light of the cell-specific spacer diversity at the new ends of CRISPR loci. With a spacer addition rate high enough to enable numerous lines to acquire distinct beneficial spacers before any one line has swept (<italic>i.e.</italic>, new-end diversity), one expects that competition between spacer-adding lines would prevent selective sweeps in a process known as clonal interference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Gerrish1">[40]</xref>. Further complicating the question of how trailer-end diversity is purged from CRISPR loci is the fact that the loss of trailer-end diversity does not have to occur via selection: it could result from the unidirectional nature of spacer addition. With spacers only incorporated at new-ends, trailer-end spacer diversity cannot increase once trailer-end positions have been filled, because no distinct spacers are incorporated there. Thus, as time progresses, all but one trailer-end lineage, the ‘coalescent,’ will necessarily go extinct even without selection, resulting in trailer-end clonality.</p>
        <p>To ascertain whether selection drives losses of diversity at CRISPR trailer-ends despite high spacer addition rates (an average of eight spacer additions occur per iteration; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002475-t001">Table 1</xref>), we followed the spacer diversity of computationally reconstructed locus positions for thousands of iterations. We aimed to discover how rapidly locus positions evolved from highly polyclonal to clonal, using rapidity as a marker for sweeps. For simplicity, spacer deletions were removed from the model for this step, as we focused on the role of beneficial mutations (spacer additions) in driving losses of diversity.</p>
        <p>As could be expected from the unidirectionality of spacer addition, after thousands of iterations, long-run model trajectories converge to the familiar pattern in which trailer-end spacers are clonal population-wide, while only polyclonal new-end spacers match co-evolving viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g003">Figure 3</xref> Left Panel). As in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s001">Figure S1</xref>, the majority of the locus is clonal (as noted on the figure, 128 clonal columns were removed for space conservation). Despite the eventual emergence of trailer-end clonality, CRISPR trailer-ends were initially highly diverse leader-ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g003">Figure 3</xref>, Right Panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Interestingly, we reconstructed an intermediate stage in which the trailer-ends can be grouped into several sub-populations distinguished by their oldest spacers, indicating that gradual losses of diversity occur in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g003">Figure 3</xref> Middle Panel). Trailer-end sub-populations were similarly reported in metagenomic reconstructions from natural environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Tyson1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Held1">[29]</xref>. By tracking the frequencies of the top 14 spacers in one of the oldest CRISPR locus positions across thousands of iterations, we further verified that spacer fixations can require thousands of iterations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

Circles indicate spacers perfectly matching any of the 300 most frequent viral strains in that iteration. To preserve space, 128 clonal columns are removed in iteration 7000 prior to the divergence of sub-populations from a common ancestor (arrow). Notably one ancestral population still at low frequency (∼0.007 as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s004">Figure S4</xref>) in the 100<sup>th</sup> iteration is the common ancestor of all surviving strains.</p>

        <p>Yet, in addition to gradual fixations, model results demonstrate rapid selective sweeps of individual host sub-populations. In order to identify sweeps, we created an algorithm that clusters CRISPR loci into an optimized number of sub-populations in any given iteration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s012">Text S3</xref>). To decide on an ‘optimal’ number of clusters in an iteration, we utilized a machine learning cluster validation technique called the ‘silhouette width’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Rousseeuw1">[41]</xref>. We then captured iterations in which the predicted number of CRISPR sub-populations precipitously drops to one, indicating a sweep by a member of one ancestral sub-population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To verify sweeps, we tracked the frequencies of all spacers in a new-end locus position through the period during which the clustering-predicted sweep occurs. Despite competition from numerous other spacers, a single spacer, unique to one diversifying host sub-population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s012">Text S3</xref>), rapidly rises to high frequency in this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, the vast majority of virus-host interactions are immune during the sweep period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g005">Figure 5</xref>), showing that the rapid loss of host diversity was due to a sweep by a highly immune host rather a bottleneck due to a lack of host fitness.</p>

            <p>(A) Hosts CRISPR loci from the simulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g003">Figure 3</xref> are clustered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s012">Text S3</xref>) into distinct sub-populations every 100 model iterations to capture how trailer-end clonality emerges. Cluster heights represent the cumulative frequencies of all strains in a given cluster, cluster widths show the number of distinct strains in that cluster, and the combined height of all clusters in an iteration reflects the fraction of virus-host interactions that is immune (i.e., host mean fitness). A marked loss of host diversity occurs prior to iteration 3800 (→), after which the sweeping sub-population diversifies through distinct leader-end spacer incorporations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s006">Figure S6</xref>). (B) The frequencies of all host spacers at a single leader-end column are tracked during the clustering-predicted sweep. A single spacer (shown in black) rapidly rises in frequency before iteration 3800 as predicted by the clustering. Subsequent ‘kill the winner’ oscillations occur before all competing hosts go extinct. A second sweep purges the remaining diversity at this locus position.</p>

In green, we track the fraction of immune virus-host interactions. The lower panel shows the frequencies of the three corresponding proto-spacers in the viral population. The inverse fluctuations in viral proto-spacer frequencies show that the viruses fail to lose all three proto-spacers on a single line until just prior to iteration 3800, after the sweep. The host line thus sweeps due to immunity to both viral sub-populations.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>To understand how a sweep could occur despite model-implemented ‘kill the winner’ dynamics, we reconstructed the strain containing the sweeping spacer identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g004">Figure 4B</xref>. We noticed that the two subsequent spacers added on this strain targeted distinct viral sub-populations, immunizing the host against both dominant viral sub-populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In this particular case, the viruses were unable to mutate both matching proto-spacers on a single line prior to the host sweep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, while adding spacers that confer immunity to one viral sub-population is common in the model and results in clonal interference among similarly partially immune lines, rapidly acquiring immunity to all viral subpopulations is a rare, ‘multiple mutation’ event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Desai1">[42]</xref>, which leads to a uniquely immune line that can sweep. More generally, this captures how ‘kill the winner’ cannot maintain spacer diversity in CRISPR loci. Viruses cannot always make the requisite mutations needed to kill a host before that host sweeps. Once trailer-end diversity is lost in even a single rare sweep, trailer-end diversity cannot be regained because distinct spacers are only added at the leader-end.</p>

        <title>Incorporating deletions into the model explains trailer-end memory</title>
        <p>While unidirectional spacer addition alone explains the emergence of trailer-end clonality, it does not explain the more basic question of why trailer-end spacers are at all preserved despite rarely matching current viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g001">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g002">2</xref>). To probe the potential fitness cost associated with rapidly deleting CRISPR spacers, we introduced random spacer deletions into our <italic>in silico</italic> evolving system. Spacer deletion was implemented by allowing a preset fraction of spacer additions to occur with the loss of a randomly-sized, contiguous spacer block from a random starting point in the locus. A combined add/loss mechanism is consistent with experimental evidence indicating that spacer deletion occurs via homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Garrett1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Gudbergsdottir1">[44]</xref> and data showing that losses often occur with simultaneous new-end spacer additions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Deveau1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Palmer1">[45]</xref>.</p>
        <p>If selection played no role (<italic>i.e.</italic>, spacers conferred no immunity) in CRISPR evolution, the equilibrium number of spacers in a strain's CRISPR locus would roughly be the ratio of spacer addition to loss rates. This is the steady state of the linear differential equation dN/dt = <italic>a</italic>−<italic>d</italic>*N, where N is the number of spacers, <italic>a</italic>, the spacer addition rate, and, <italic>d</italic>, the spacer deletion rate. Thus, even with selection extending the size of CRISPR loci to maintain spacer immunity, the long-run equilibrium lengths of CRISPR loci should be inversely proportional to their spacer deletion rates. By incorporating the deletion process into our model, we find that when only 5% of spacer additions occur with deletions, CRISPR locus lengths look qualitatively similar to model results with no deletions, with trailer-end conservation and clonality largely preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Conversely, allowing 50% of spacer additions to result in deletions of random spacer blocks purges CRISPR trailer-ends entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Given our experimental data showing that CRISPR loci conserve trailer-ends over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g001">Figures 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g002">2</xref>), model results predict that the rate of spacer deletion is maintained below a threshold in many natural systems.</p>

            <p>The model is extended to allow a parameterized fraction of (single) spacer additions in host CRISPR loci to occur with deletions of randomly-sized blocks of spacers from random locus positions. The lower panels in (A) and (B) plot host immunity (blue) against maximum viral strain frequency (red) in each iteration. (A) When 5% of additions occur with deletions, trailer-end memory and clonality are preserved. Only new-end spacers target current viruses and CRISPR's antiviral immunity is maintained at high levels across thousands of model iterations. (B) When 50% of spacer additions occur with deletions, trailer-end memory and clonality are purged. Depletions in host immunity occur (lower panel), indicating viral blooms due to the large fraction of interactions in which CRISPR fails to provide immunity (<italic>i.e.</italic>, host and virus do not share spacers). During the predicted bloom at iteration 768, immunity against the top 300 viral strains is conferred by two older spacers, which are lost from most host lines prior to the bloom (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

        <p>To understand why selection would maintain spacer deletion rates below a threshold, we compared the mean fitness of host strains across time under both low and high-loss regimes. Our measure of host mean fitness in an iteration is the fraction of virus-host interactions in which CRISPR provides immunity. While a low-loss rate (5%) produces consistently high levels of host immunity and thus fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6A</xref> Lower Panel), dramatic dips in host immunity are observed when the probability of spacer deletion is increased to 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6B</xref> Lower Panel). Troughs in host immunity predict rapid viral blooms due to the large number of productive virion producing interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
        <p>To understand why host immunity is depressed when CRISPR's spacer deletion rate is increased, we reconstructed host CRISPR loci from the time point at which the fraction of immune hosts is at a trough (iteration 768 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). During this predicted viral bloom, the few hosts immune to the top 300 viruses are surprisingly protected by two older spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6B</xref> Upper Panel). These older spacers were previously far more prevalent among hosts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Viral proto-spacer mutation eliminated the selection pressure maintaining the two spacers in the hosts, resulting in the rapid loss of the two spacers from most hosts due to the high spacer deletion rate. Viruses managing to preserve the targeted proto-spacers while avoiding extinction could then bloom, free from spacer-driven immunological control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
        <p>Importantly, the viral bloom is not monoclonal: a number of sub-populations can be found within the blooming viral population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Further, the main viral sub-population, which contains the two older proto-spacers, is rife with new mutants containing polymorphisms in their proto-spacer sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Blooming viral diversity matches the host diversity evident from the CRISPR loci reconstructed during the bloom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). To quantify the correlation between virus and host polyclonalities, we superimposed virus and host strains onto a single matrix, with viral strains allayed along the rows and host strains allayed along the columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Each (row, column) entry of the matrix represents the number of shared spacers between the row's viral strain and the column's host strain (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the level of immunity). This results in horizontal immunity vectors for each virus and vertical immunity vectors for each host. We then clustered the viral immunity vectors into an optimal number of viral sub-populations by maximizing the ‘silhouette width’ as above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s012">Text S3</xref>) and analogously optimally clustered the column-wise host immunity vectors. Immunity clustering shows a clear pattern of specialization in which distinct host sub-populations coexist through immunity to distinct viral sub-populations in what could be termed ‘cloud on cloud’ immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The presence of distinct immunological niches explains why only seven host strains matched the top 300 viral strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6B</xref>); the other hosts survived through immunity to less frequent viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>

We tracked the relative abundances of a number of host and viral species in the AMD consortium through a series of samples collected at a single AMD location between June 2006 and August 2007 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002475.s009">S9</xref>).

        <p>Further supporting model predictions, the viral bloom is polyclonal with a number of sub-populations clearly recognizable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g009">Figure 9</xref>). A monoclonal rather than polyclonal bloom is the expected outcome when viruses out-mutate host immunity (i.e., the successful viral mutant alone blooms), indicating that the bloom was not the result of a recent viral mutation but instead due to CRISPR failing against a wide range of extant viral sequences. Correspondingly, there is no evidence of diminished CRISPR diversity among bloom-surviving G-plasma hosts. In fact, two G-plasma sub-populations, differentiated by distinct trailer-end spacers, precede and survive the crash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g002">Figure 2</xref>) as occurs in model simulations in which the deletion rate is high enough to prevent the formation of clonal trailer-ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

            <p>Sequence variation within a gene of the blooming AMDV3b viral population (345 bp field of view). The top bar of the figure represents an 18 kb contig sequence of AMDV3b, with predicted genes shown as boxes. Below the contig, is a close-up view of sequence variation within a single gene. White bars represent aligned sequencing reads, while colored bars indicate SNPs relative to the composite sequence. The black region is a large deleted sequence block in one individual viral genome. Distinct viral sub-populations are captured during the bloom, each sharing common SNPs. Also shown in the figure are regions of the AMDV3b contig that match G-plasma spacers: closed circles in the contig represent perfect matches and open circles represent imperfect matches. When the match between G-plasma spacer and AMDV3b protospacer occurs within a predicted gene, the circle is placed inside the corresponding gene box; matches to intergenic regions are shown below on the contig line.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we metagenomically track virus and host populations across time in a natural environment and use a mathematical model to reconstruct the dynamics through which CRISPR loci could evolve between these snapshots. We first capture surprising selective sweeps through which highly diverse CRISPR ‘leader-ends’ become clonal ‘trailer-ends’ across time. Our results also explain why CRISPR loci maintain trailer-end immunities for thousands of microbial generations (immunological memory). Both model and metagenomic data capture blooms of persisting viral sequences against which hosts had preexisting spacer immunity. The model directly shows how accelerated spacer deletions drive these blooms, with precipitous drops in host fitness occurring when spacer deletion is increased. Without viral persistence as a selection pressure favoring memory in CRISPR loci, genomically compact prokaryotes would be expected to purge trailer-end spacers given documented genomic deletion biases and the eventual cost of maintaining excess genomic material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Kuo1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Of course, the genomic cost is likely not significant for each short spacer added. Yet, if CRISPR loci grew without bound, at some point there would be a cost associated to maintaining and transcribing enormous loci. Evidence for a genomic length cost emerges in two recent studies. An elegant analysis noted that highly expressed eukaryotic genes possess significantly shorter introns than less expressed genes, a fact attributed to the ATP-cost of transcribing even short DNA regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-CastilloDavis1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Carmel1">[47]</xref>. In <italic>Salmonella</italic>, Kuo and Ochman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Kuo2">[48]</xref> noted that bacterial pseudogenes are deleted faster than they would be by drift alone (which has exponential waiting times), pointing to selection as a driver of genomic compactness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Kuo2">[48]</xref>. As in the eukaryote study, the few enduring bacterial pseudogenes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Kuo2">[48]</xref> appear to be less expressed. Interestingly, elongated CRISPR loci may have an answer to the transcriptional cost problem: they appear to disproportionately produce CRISPR RNA at the leader end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Marraffini2">[6]</xref>. An intriguing possibility is that CRISPR loci could bet-hedge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Beaumont1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Cohen1">[50]</xref>, with selection tuning the level of trailer-end spacer transcription to scale with the probability of encountering matching viral sequences.</p>
      <p>In pinpointing blooms of persisting viruses as the selection pressure favoring CRISPR memory, we noted a surprising polyclonality in both virus and host in the natural system. Had this been the expected, laboratory-observed bloom in which a virus simply mutates around host immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Barrangou1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Deveau1">[15]</xref>, the result would have been a monoclonal bloom of the viral variant for which the hosts were not able to acquire spacers in time. For a polyclonal bloom to occur, rather than a single lucky viral mutation, host immunity must fail against a large swath of viruses. There are thus two possibilities for how this polyclonal bloom occurred: either the CRISPR system did not provide any immunity at all (<italic>i.e.</italic>, spacers are not immunogenic), or, as in the model, the hosts prematurely deleted key spacers allowing diversified viruses sharing these key old spacers to resurge and bloom. While we cannot entirely dismiss the first possibility, we did simulate the model under the null hypothesis in which spacers are not immunogenic. In that case, when CRISPR loci evolve neutrally, simulated loci emerge with few spacers and no trailer-end clonality. In contrast, naturally sampled G-plasma loci contain tens of spacers and exhibit dichotomous patterns of trailer-end clonality and new-end diversity. More generally, because the rate of neutral fixation of trailer-end spacers scales inversely with the effective population size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Barrett1">[51]</xref>, large microbial populations make genetic drift an unlikely driver of observed CRISPR locus patterns.</p>
      <p>Three previous models have been built to study questions surrounding CRISPR-based immunity. Haerter and colleagues studied how viral diversity is maintained against CRISPR, but their model did not track and reconstruct spacer patterns within CRISPR loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Haerter1">[35]</xref>. Levin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Levin1">[34]</xref> focused on the fundamental question of why CRISPR loci are found in some but not all microbes, but did not include virus and host mutational processes. It thus could not capture the long-run evolution of CRISPR loci within microbes that do maintain CRISPRs. To model this long-run evolution, He and Deem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-He1">[33]</xref> elegantly applied an HIV-derived differential equation model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Nowak1">[52]</xref>. Yet, in using an HIV model, He and Deem assumed that CRISPR-immunized Bacteria and Archaea control viral abundances in the same way that cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells target HIV virions. Thus, viral populations surprisingly decline in their system if all host strains (the viral growth source) are increased by a constant factor, as roughly occurs after an influx of resources. Further, in assuming pre-stipulated locus lengths in which each leader-end spacer addition occurs with a corresponding trailer-end spacer deletion, the model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Nowak1">[52]</xref> could not probe whether reducing spacer deletions to increase CRISPR locus lengths is an evolutionarily beneficial strategy.</p>
      <p>In protecting against blooms of old viral sequences, model predictions and metagenomic data suggest that CRISPR's immune memory makes it suited for environments in which viruses persist for long periods or remigrate from adjacent regions. CRISPR-based immunity may thus be more prevalent in biofilms than in dilute ocean environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Sorokin1">[53]</xref>. Immunity against persistent viruses may also explain CRISPR's presence in 90% of sequenced Archaea, which have disproportionately been sampled from extreme environments where viruses tend not to lyse their hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Manica1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Prangishvili1">[54]</xref>.</p>
      <p>More generally, proviral latency is a viral persistence strategy and a clear barrier to eradicating pathogens. A fascinating study recently showed that of the 132 spacers matching viruses in CRISPR loci reconstructed from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> hospital populations, all spacers matched lysogenic but not lytic viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Cady1">[55]</xref>. And while these spacers do not appear to block lysogenization, the same group and others have demonstrated CRISPR-mediated control on inserted lysogens, apparently preventing lysogenic induction and infectious spread across susceptible populations such as biofilms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Cady2">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Palmer2">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Zegans1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Edgar1">[59]</xref>. A potential explanation for the demonstrated connection between CRISPRs and lysogenic viruses could be CRISPRs immunological memory. By maintaining old immunities, CRISPR may have evolved to safeguard against reemergences of ancestral viruses from lysogenic dormancies.</p>

To further remove contaminating extracellular polysaccharides, the DNA was subsequently run on a gel and purified via a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). Preparation of shotgun metagenomic libraries and pyrosequencing using the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX-Titanium system were performed at the W. M.

        <p>Sequencing reads from the five libraries were co-assembled using Newbler (GSassembler v. 2.0.01, Roche) using default parameters except for a 95% nucleotide identity and 40 nt minimum overlap requirement. Replicated reads were identified using a previously described protocol based on CD-HIT clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-GomezAlvarez1">[63]</xref> (&gt;95% identity, &gt;five identical bases at the start of the read, no equal length requirement).

Additional filtering of reads containing ambiguous bases, resulted in a total of 990,386 reads (∼350 Mbp). A second assembly, using identical parameters, was performed using this filtered reads dataset.</p>
        <p>For community profiling, read assignment to previously identified genomic sequence bins was performed by blastn analysis (e-value cutoff of e<sup>−20</sup>) using a database of contigs previously assembled and binned from four other Richmond Mine biofilm samples: 5-way, collected in March 2002 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Simmons1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Tyson2">[65]</xref>, UBA and UBA filtrate collected in June 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Baker1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Lo1">[61]</xref>, and UBA-BS collected in November 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Dick1">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Contigs representing virus genome fragments were identified based on (a) similarity to previously identified virus contigs recovered from the same system, (b) extreme high depth of sequence coverage (in the case of AMDV3b), (c) assembly curation into genome fragments with detectable sequence similarity to the known viruses, and (in all cases) (d) targeting of the genome sequence fragments by CRISPR spacers. Viruses were determined to replicate in specific hosts based on extensive targeting of their genomes by spacers from host-specific CRISPR loci. Curation of contigs containing reads identified as viral was carried out using Consed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002475-Gordon1">[66]</xref>. Contigs were then imported into GSMapper and extended manually and joined, where appropriate, so that regions fragmented by elevated sequence divergence could be condensed. Cases of extreme divergence were treated as separate contigs. Locations where genomic datasets were fragmented by gene content differences were noted, and the information used as part of the binning procedure. Viral genomes related to the previously studied AMD viruses but that assembled separately were distinguished. For example, the deeply sampled AMDV3b genome is related to the previously reported AMDV3 population and also to a shallowly sampled AMDV3c population (results not shown) that is also present in the C +75 m dataset.</p>

Sanger reads (mate-paired ∼800 bp sequences from each end of an ∼3 kb clone) from the 5-way, UBA, UBA-BS, and UBA filtrate datasets, and 454 reads from the C +75 m series, were used in the reconstruction of both G-plasma CRISPR loci (data are separated by time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g002">2</xref>).

        <p>Sequencing reads that sampled the CRISPR loci were identified based on the presence of specific repeat sequences (see below). Custom Ruby scripts were used to extract CRISPR spacer sequences from 454 and Sanger sequencing reads. We allowed for variation in the repeat sequences to avoid omitting spacer sequences due to errors in sequencing (e.g., homopolymer runs). Spacers were grouped using blastclust (using parameters of 85% identity and 85% length overlap) to remove duplication of groups due to sequencing error. Custom Ruby scripts were used to array CRISPR spacers back onto sequencing reads. Assembly of each locus was manually performed in Microsoft Excel based on overlapping spacer patterns and sampling of the flanking genome on part of the read or its mate pair (in the case of Sanger reads). Where possible, 454 reads were arrayed so that patterns of sequential spacers matched locus regions defined based on Sanger reads. For data presentation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g002">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g003">3</xref>, unique patterns defined by multiple overlapping 454 reads were condensed to report the longest possible sequence of spacers.</p>

          <p><bold>Predicted viral bloom in high-deletion regime occurs due to host spacer deletions.</bold> In the main text, a nadir in host immunity was shown at the 768th iteration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6B</xref>. Hosts with two key older spacers survived this predicted viral bloom. Here we tracked the frequency of these two spacers through the bloom in both host (top panel) and viral (bottom panel) populations. Spacer 39184 is shown in black and spacer 49611 in red. Note that most hosts lose these two contiguous spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002475-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) prior to the 740th iteration, when almost all viruses have mutated the corresponding two proto-spacers. Yet, a small remnant viral population maintains these two proto-spacers, proliferating and diversifying against newly non-immune hosts.</p>
