<abstract>
<p>Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors are required for induction of T-cell cytokine production and effector function. Although it is known that activation via the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) results in 2 critical steps, calcineurin-mediated NFAT1 dephosphorylation and NFAT2 up-regulation, the molecular mechanisms underlying each are poorly understood. Here we find that T cell p38, which is activated by an alternative pathway independent of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade and with different substrate specificities, directly controls these events. First, alternatively (but not classically) activated p38 was required to induce the expression of the AP-1 component c-Fos, which was necessary for NFAT2 expression and cytokine production. Second, alternatively (but not classically) activated p38 phosphorylated NFAT1 on a heretofore unidentified site, S79, and in its absence NFAT1 was unable to interact with calcineurin or migrate to the nucleus. These results demonstrate that the acquisition of unique specificities by TCR-activated p38 orchestrates NFAT-dependent T-cell functions.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The p38 MAP kinase, which is required for a large number of important biological responses, is activated by an enzymatic cascade that results in its dual phosphorylation on p38<sup>T180Y182</sup>. T cells have evolved a unique pathway in which T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation results in phosphorylation of p38<sup>Y323</sup> (the alternative pathway). Why T cells acquired this pathway is the subject of conjecture. In this study, we examine the activation of 2 members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family, which, when dephosphorylated by calcineurin, migrate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In T cells with the alternative pathway ablated by a single amino acid substitution (p38<sup>Y323F</sup>), NFAT1 remained in the cytoplasm after stimulation via the TCR. Studies identified NFAT1<sup>S79</sup> as a target for alternatively (but not classically) activated p38, and phosphorylation of this residue was required for binding calcineurin and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, although classically activated p38 induced NFAT1 translocation in the absence of NFAT1<sup>S79</sup> phosphorylation, unlike alternatively activated p38 it did not cause NFAT2 up-regulation. This paradox was resolved by the finding that only the latter induces c-Fos, which binds to the NFAT2 promoter and participates in its up-regulation. These T-cell-specific p38 activities provide a strong rationale for the acquisition of the alternative mechanism for activating p38.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many activation events downstream of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) are up-regulated by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref001">1</xref>]. There are 5 NFAT family members: NFAT1 (also known as NFATc2 or NFATp), NFAT2 (NFATc1 or NFATc), NFAT3 (NFATc4), NFAT4 (NFATc3 or NFATx), and NFAT5 (tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein [TonEBP]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref002">2</xref>]. T cells express NFAT1, NFAT2, and NFAT4, which are activated by TCR-mediated stimulation to induce proliferation and cytokine secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref002">2</xref>]. Whereas expression of NFAT2 is inducible, NFAT1 and NFAT4 are constitutively expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref002">2</xref>]. In resting cells, NFATs are highly phosphorylated by a number of serine/threonine kinases (e.g., casein kinase 1, glycogen synthase kinase 3, Jun N-terminal kinases, and p38), with as many as 21 phosphorylation sites having been identified in NFAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref003">3</xref>]. The phosphorylated species are retained in the cytosol (and thus inactive) by binding cytoplasmic proteins such as 14-3-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref004">4</xref>]. Stimuli that increase cytosolic calcium activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFATs and allows their migration to the nucleus, where they induce gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref002">2</xref>]. In T cells, stimulation via the TCR also induces NFAT2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref005">5</xref>]. NFATs often up-regulate gene transcription in cooperation with other transcription factors, most commonly AP-1, the combination being required for the expression of interleukin (IL)-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref006">6</xref>], IL-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref007">7</xref>], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref008">8</xref>], IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref009">9</xref>], IL-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref010">10</xref>], IL-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref006">6</xref>], interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref011">11</xref>], Fas ligand (FasL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref012">12</xref>], CD25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref013">13</xref>], Cox2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref014">14</xref>], IL-8, and migration inhibitory factor 1 alpha (MIF-1Î±) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref011">11</xref>]. Other reported partners include Sp1 and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2)/Jun to induce expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref015">15</xref>] and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2) to induce Nurr77 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>p38, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), has important positive regulatory roles in a variety of cellular functions, including proliferation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref017">17</xref>]. In the classical MAPK cascade, stimuli such as environmental stress or proinflammatory cytokines activate a kinase cascade that results in the phosphorylation of p38 on Thr-180 and Tyr-182 (T180/Y182) in the activation loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref017">17</xref>]. In addition to this enzymatic cascade, T cells possess a unique mode of p38 activation that is downstream of the TCR. Stimulation via the TCR activates the protein tyrosine kinase zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70), which phosphorylates p38 on Tyr-323 (p38 pY323), leading to autophosphorylation on Thr-180 (the p38 alternative pathway) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref018">18</xref>]. The adaptor protein hDlg1 has been implicated in coupling TCR signaling to alternative p38 activation, as its small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown reduces p38 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref019">19</xref>]. The alternative p38 pathway is essential for the expression of several key T-cell effector functions, best shown in mice lacking the alternative pathway because of knock-in of p38Î± and p38Î² in which Tyr-323 was replaced with Phe (double knock-in [DKI] mice) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref020">20</xref>]. TCR-activated cells from such animals produce low levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, and IL-17A compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Importantly, the mice are resistant to the autoimmune disease models collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref020">20</xref>], have less aggressive Kras-induced inflammatory pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref021">21</xref>], and fail to mount an effective IL-17A-dependent immune response to <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>In T cells, p38 activated via the MAPK cascade phosphorylates NFAT1 and NFAT2 on serine/threonine residues, resulting in cytosolic retention and inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref023">23</xref>]. It is well documented, however, that p38 is also a positive regulator of TCR-induced and NFAT-dependent cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref024">24</xref>]. For instance, p38 is upstream of the up-regulation of NFAT2 upon TCR stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref005">5</xref>] and activates NFAT1 via phosphorylation of S54 in its transactivation domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref019">19</xref>]. In this study, we have addressed the molecular mechanisms by which p38 regulates NFAT1 and NFAT2. We found that the T-cell-specific p38 alternative pathway controls NFAT activation and dependent cytokine secretion by 2 mechanisms: (1) up-regulating c-Fos, which is required for induction of NFAT2 expression, and (2) phosphorylating NFAT1 S79 to allow its interaction with calcineurin and subsequent nuclear translocation.</p>

<title>TCR-mediated up-regulation of NFAT2 requires p38 pY323-dependent induction of c-Fos</title>
<p>Activation of p38 via the alternative pathway (but not the classical MAPK cascade) is required for up-regulation of NFAT2, its downstream target IRF4, and proinflammatory cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref022">22</xref>]. In T cells, NFAT2 expression has been reported to be regulated by NFAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref025">25</xref>] and/or NFAT2 itself in association with the AP-1 transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref026">26</xref>]. AP-1, a heterodimer of c-Fos and c-Jun, plays an important role along with NFATs in the induction of a number of T-cell products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref026">26</xref>]. Because c-Fos is expressed only at low levels in resting T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref027">27</xref>], we asked if its induction upon activation is dependent on p38. Little c-Fos was detected in primary resting T cells, but it was markedly induced after stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left lanes). The induction was blocked by the p38 catalytic inhibitor SB203580, suggesting a role for this kinase. Notably, activation of T cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin, which activates p38 via the classic MAPK cascade, was relatively ineffective at inducing c-Fos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, right lanes). Unlike anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, PMA/ionomycin poorly induced c-Fos expression, which peaked at 3 hours but was not sustained at the later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This was not due to the poor activation by PMA/ionomycin, because the combination induced robust IL-2 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, right panel). To directly test if alternatively activated p38 was required, c-Fos expression was measured in primary T cells from WT or p38Î± and Î² DKI mice that lack the alternative pathway. In contrast to WT T cells, there was little if any c-Fos upregulation in T cells from DKI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). There was no difference in c-Jun expression between the WT and DKI T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004111.s007">S1 Fig</xref>). Therefore, alternatively activated p38 is necessary for c-Fos induction in cells activated via the TCR.</p>

<p>Given that up-regulation of both c-Fos and NFAT2 requires alternative p38 activation and that c-Fos is an immediate early gene, whereas NFAT2 induction is late [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref022">22</xref>], we asked if c-Fos regulates NFAT2 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed on extracts from primary T cells using anti-c-Fos. In cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28, but not with PMA/ionomycin, there was clearly inducible binding of c-Fos to the NFAT2 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). To determine if this binding was functionally important, the AP-1 binding site GTCAG in the <italic>nfat2</italic> promoter was mutated to AAAAA, inserted into a luciferase reporter plasmid, and transfected into the human Jurkat T leukemia cell line. Anti-CD3/CD28 induced luciferase production from a vector containing the WT <italic>nfat2</italic> promoter but had no effect when the AP-1 binding site was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). To determine if p38-mediated c-Fos up-regulation was the only limiting factor in NFAT2 induction in DKI T cells, we infected primary mouse WT or DKI T cells with a retrovirus encoding <italic>c-fos</italic>. The expression vector included an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of a sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) so that transfection efficiency could be monitored. Transfection efficiency was comparable for the empty vector (EV) control and the vector encoding <italic>c-fos</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004111.s008">S2A Fig</xref>). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that anti-TCR-mediated activation of WT T cells transduced with EV up-regulated <italic>nfat2</italic> mRNA, whereas there was no response in EV-transduced DKI T cells, consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref022">22</xref>]. Importantly, DKI T cells in which <italic>c-fos</italic> was introduced up-regulated <italic>nfat2</italic> in response to TCR signaling. Interestingly, the baseline <italic>nfat2</italic> levels in <italic>cfos</italic>-transduced cells was elevated, probably reflecting the fact that the cells had recently been activated to facilitate retroviral transduction. Similar experiments were performed with PMA/ionomycin-stimulated WT cells, in which NFAT2 is poorly induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref022">22</xref>]. Enforced expression of <italic>c-fos</italic> allowed T cells to up-regulate <italic>nfat2</italic> when stimulated with PMA/ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g001">Fig 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004111.s008">S2B Fig</xref>). Therefore, p38 activated via the TCR uniquely up-regulates c-Fos expression, which is essential for downstream induction of NFAT2.</p>

<title>TCR-induced nuclear translocation of NFAT1 requires the p38 alternative pathway</title>
<p>Unlike NFAT2, NFAT1 is constitutively expressed, and activation-induced increases in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> cause its dephosphorylation by calcineurin and nuclear migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref002">2</xref>]. Because NFAT1 activity was increased in T cells in which hDlg1 was overexpressed and decreased when p38 was inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref019">19</xref>], we directly asked if p38 is required at this early step. Purified T cells from WT or DKI mice were cultured in medium alone or stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 for 3 hours, and the cytoplasmic versus nuclear distribution of NFAT1 was determined. As expected, in resting WT T cells, NFAT1 was entirely cytoplasmic, but after anti-TCR-mediated activation, it was found in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In contrast, in T cells from DKI mice that lack the alternative p38 activation pathway NFAT1 did not translocate to the nuclear fraction after activation. This was specific to TCR-mediated signaling, because NFAT1 translocated to the nucleus in both WT and DKI T cells stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin. This was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Whereas in resting T cells of both genotypes NFAT1 was largely excluded from the nucleus, after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation NFAT1 translocated to the nucleus only in WT T cells, remaining in the cytosol of DKI T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Therefore, the p38 alternative activation pathway is required for NFAT1 activation after TCR-mediated stimulation.</p>

<title>ZAP-70-activated, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MKK6)-activated, p38 phosphorylates NFAT1 on S79</title>
<p>NFAT1 is a target of classically activated p38, but these phosphorylation events are thought to be responsible for cytosolic retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref023">23</xref>]. The finding that p38 activity was actually required for NFAT1 translocation downstream of the TCR, therefore, raised the possibility that the classic and alternative p38 pathways lead to differential NFAT1 phosphorylation. To determine if NFAT1 is a substrate of alternatively activated p38 and, if so, whether the sites of phosphorylation differ from those of MKK-activated p38, an in vitro kinase assay was performed using recombinant p38 that had been activated by ZAP-70 (alternative pathway) or MKK6 (MAPK cascade). As substrate we used an NFAT1 fragment containing the first 350 amino acids (tNFAT1), in which the bulk of the known phosphorylation sites have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref003">3</xref>], or ATF2 as a positive control. Both ZAP-70- and MKK6-phosphorylated p38 phosphorylated ATF2, the former actually having more activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, left panel). They also phosphorylated tNFAT1, with MKK6-activated p38 presumably phosphorylating more sites as manifested by slower migration in SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, right panel). This was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Whereas 5 phosphorylated serine residues (54, 110, 136, 150, and 223, 4 of which have been reported in a resting T-cell clone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref003">3</xref>]) were identified in tNFAT1 incubated with classically activated p38, only one phosphorylation site was detected in tNFAT1 incubated with ZAP-70 activated p38, serine 79 (S79) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004111.s009">S3 Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004111.s013">S1 Table</xref>).

<p>We generated a rabbit antiserum against an NFAT1 peptide containing phosphorylated Ser-79 (pNFAT1<sup>S79</sup>). The affinity-purified antibodies were highly selective for the phosphorylated species, as measured by ELISA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004111.s010">S4 Fig</xref>). In vitro kinase assays with recombinant p38 confirmed that ZAP-70-activated (but not MKK6-activated) p38 phosphorylated NFAT1 on Ser-79 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The anti-pNFAT1<sup>S79</sup> antibody was used in confocal imaging of T cells that were stimulated with either anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin. NFAT1 (green) was non-nuclear (blue) in unstimulated cells, and no pNFAT1<sup>S79</sup> (red) was detected. NFAT1 migrated to the nucleus upon both anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin stimulation, but Ser-79 phosphorylation was only detected in the nuclei of T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

<title>Phosphorylation of NFAT1<sup>S79</sup> is required for TCR-mediated IL-2 and TNF-Î± production</title>
<p>To determine the biological relevance of NFAT1<sup>S79</sup> phosphorylation, NFAT1 was targeted using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in Jurkat cells (N1KO cells). WT Jurkat and 2 independent N1KO clones (#9 and #18) had similar levels of TCR-Î² and CD3 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004111.s011">S5 Fig</xref>). In contrast to WT Jurkat cells, the N1KO cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin failed to produce IL-2 or TNF-Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Interestingly, despite a report that NFAT1 is upstream of NFAT2 in murine primary T cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref025">25</xref>], in the absence of NFAT1, anti-TCR activation of the N1KO clones induced NFAT2 expression to the same level as in WT Jurkat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Therefore, at least in Jurkat cells, NFAT1 is not required for NFAT2 expression. As previously shown, stimulation with PMA/ionomycin induced little if any NFAT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref022">22</xref>].

Importantly, introduction of NFAT1 but not NFAT<sup>S79A</sup> restored activation-induced IL-2 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004111.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).

For example, germ line deletion of NFAT2 results in embryonic lethality due to a failure of cardiac valve formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref028">28</xref>], and its disruption in embryonic stem cells causes a substantial defect in osteoclast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref029">29</xref>]. NFAT1 knockout mice survive but have a substantial reduction in mast cell cytokine production and T-cell-produced TNF-Î±, but not IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref031">31</xref>]. Functional redundancy between some family members was inferred from the mild phenotypes found in some single-gene disruptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref032">32</xref>], and a number of studies have been carried out in animals in which multiple family members were deleted For example, deletion of NFAT3 and NFAT4 resulted in excessive and disorganized neural tubes in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref033">33</xref>], and deletion of NFAT1, NFAT3, and NFAT4 impaired axonal outgrowth in the central and peripheral nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref034">34</xref>]. Although T cells express NFAT4, NFAT1 and NFAT2 appear to play the predominant role in T-cell activation and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref035">35</xref>]. Deletion of both NFAT1 and NFAT2 prevented cytokine production by T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref011">11</xref>], whereas the introduction of constitutively active forms of both increased the expression of many cytokines in response to anti-CD3/CD28 or PMA/ionomycin stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref037">37</xref>]. Nonredundant functions of NFAT1 and NFAT2 in T cells were revealed in studies of mice deficient in one or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref038">38</xref>]. When immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to induce EAE, NFAT1-deficient mice produced less TNF-Î±, whereas NFAT2-deficient mice produced less IL-17A and IL-10. Consistent with this, overexpression of NFAT1 (but not of NFAT2) induced TNF-Î± production in human T cells stimulated via the TCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Although NFATs have been extensively investigated, much of the mechanistic information about their regulation has come from studies using Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophores rather than physiologic stimuli. Whereas NFAT1 expression is constitutive, NFAT2 is expressed at low levels in resting T cells and induced by stimulation via the TCR. We have previously shown that the alternative p38 pathway is required for up-regulation of NFAT2, because it is poorly induced in either WT T cells activated with PMA/ionomycin or, notably, in DKI T cells stimulated via the TCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref022">22</xref>]. This was in agreement with the finding that siRNA-mediated knockdown of the p38-binding scaffold protein Dlgh1 inhibited TCR-mediated p38 activation and downstream <italic>Nfat2</italic> mRNA induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref019">19</xref>]. There is relatively little known about the transcription factors that mediate TCR-signaled <italic>nfat2</italic> up-regulation. The role of NFAT1 is controversial. Although NFAT2 expression was higher in the nucleus of <italic>nfat1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref038">38</xref>], NFAT2 reporter activity was decreased in NFAT1-deficient T cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref025">25</xref>]. NFAT2 may itself participate in its own up-regulation via a positive feedback loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref040">40</xref>], which leaves open the identity of the initiating factors. One clue suggesting the possibility that T-cell c-Fos may be involved comes from bone marrow-derived macrophages, in which receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation was impaired in <italic>c-fos</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> cells because of lack of NFAT2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref029">29</xref>]. This, and the fact that AP-1 is often required as an NFAT1 cofactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref042">42</xref>], led us to examine <italic>c-fos</italic> expression downstream of TCR stimulation. c-Fos, like NFAT2, was up-regulated robustly, in marked contrast to the poor and transient induction in response to PMA/ionomycin. Analysis by ChIP showed that c-Fos bound the <italic>nfat2</italic> promoter, and enforced expression of c-Fos allowed NFAT2 up-regulation in PMA/ionomycin-stimulated WT T cells and TCR-stimulated DKI T cells, demonstrating that c-Fos is a limiting factor for NFAT2 expression. Although PMA/ionomycin induced c-Fos expression, it was not sustained, consistent with the ChIP assay performed 16 hours after stimulation. What is downstream of alternative p38 signaling that up-regulates c-Fos expression is not known. One possibility is c-Fos itself, as it has been suggested that it can participate in its own up-regulation. In one example in National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3T3 cells (mouse fibroblast cell line), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated phosphorylation of c-Fos on serine/threonine residues preceding prolines recruits Pin1, a prolyl isomerase, resulting in further induction of <italic>c-fos</italic> in a feed-forward manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref043">43</xref>]. It is possible that p38 (also a proline-directed kinase) phosphorylates c-Fos on residues involved in Pin1 recruitment and c-Fos induction. Further studies will be required to elucidate the mechanism.</p>
<p>NFAT1 has been reported to have at least 21 serine phosphorylation sites, 13 of which are in the regulatory domain and are conserved among NFAT family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref003">3</xref>]. Although investigation of activation of NFATs has largely focused on their dephosphorylation, one inducible phosphorylation site in the NFAT1 transactivation domain, S54, has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref003">3</xref>]. In that report, it was found that inducible phosphorylation of S54 was critical for its transcriptional activity in PMA/ionomycin-stimulated Jurkat cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref003">3</xref>]. We also found that MKK-phosphorylated p38 (classical pathway) caused NFAT1 S54 phosphorylation, along with 4 other sites critical for cytosolic retention. In contrast to MKK6-activated p38, ZAP-70-activated p38 phosphorylated NFAT1 at a single residue in the transactivation domain, S79, which we found was necessary for nuclear translocation. Nuclear shuttling of NFATs is largely regulated by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation, which exposes nuclear localization signal (NLS) regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref044">44</xref>], but how calcineurin targets NFATs in response to elevations in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not well understood. Here we have identified a new phosphorylation site, S79, that is necessary for calcineurin-NFAT1 association in TCR-signaled T cells. Both coimmunoprecipitation assays and PLAs demonstrated that phosphorylation of this site, which is near the NFAT1 calcineurin-binding sequence PxIxIT (residues 111â€“116), promotes NFAT1-calcineurin interactions. Whether this is a direct effect on NFAT-1-calcineurin binding or is indirect via, for example, enhanced phosphorylation of other residues or dissociation of an inactive cytoplasmic protein complex containing NFAT1 remains to be determined. Although we observed NFAT1 nuclear translocation in response to PMA/ionomycin, we were unable to detect phosphorylation of NFAT1<sup>S79</sup>. In this case, it may be that phosphorylation of NFAT1<sup>S54</sup> is the functional equivalent. The identification of a mechanism for regulated access of calcineurin to its substrate NFAT1 identifies a new rate-limiting step in the propagation of signals from the TCR to the nucleus and eventual induction of effector cytokines.</p>
<p>MAPKs are proline-directed serine/threonine (S/T) kinases, meaning that the targeted S/T residues are followed by a proline (+1). Whereas ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) have been shown to be strictly proline guided, p38 is more promiscuous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref045">45</xref>]. Unlike ERK and JNK, in in vitro kinase assays, MKK6-activated p38 phosphorylated microtubule-associated Tau protein on residues in which proline was at the +1 position or the +3 position. Interestingly, among the latter was Tau residue Ser-185 in the sequence pSGEPPKS, which is quite similar to the region following NFAT1 Ser-79, pSGEPPGR. Note that in our case p38 was activated by ZAP-70, not MKK6, so this specificity is not inherent in the mode of activation but reflects a laxity in the consensus sequence not shared by other members of the MAPK family.</p>
<p>There is a longstanding paradox in T cells that activation of p38 is upstream of both NFAT1 inhibition (by phosphorylating residues that cause cytoplasmic retention) and the production of NFAT1-dependent cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref023">23</xref>]. The findings in the present report resolve this paradox by demonstrating that the alternative p38 pathway, which is the physiologic pathway downstream of TCR signaling, and the classic pathway have very different effects on NFAT1 and NFAT2 activation because of different substrate specificities. The widely studied stress-induced classic p38 pathway leads to phosphorylation of NFAT1 on inhibitory residues, preventing its nuclear migration, and fails to induce c-Fos and thus NFAT2. In contrast, alternatively activated p38 phosphorylates NFAT1 on S79, which promotes recruitment of calcineurin, dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites, and nuclear migration. Moreover, alternatively activated p38 signals for c-Fos up-regulation, which is required for NFAT2 induction. We have previously shown that differences in the substrate specificity of classically activated versus alternatively activated p38 result in antagonism of TCR-induced cytokine production and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004111.ref022">22</xref>]. In that case, the latter induced NFAT2 expression, but the former blocked its function by directly phosphorylating S/T residues that prevented nuclear translocation. This report demonstrates the converse, in which the alternatively activated p38 has a specificity not shared by the classically activated form. T cell p38 is therefore a master regulator of NFATs, controlling the production of effector cytokines essential in adaptive immunity.</p>
