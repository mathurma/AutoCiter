<abstract>
<p>Many mRNAs specifically localize within the cytoplasm and are present in RNA-protein complexes. It is generally assumed that localization and complex formation of these RNAs are controlled by trans-acting proteins encoded by genes different than the RNAs themselves. Here, we analyze <italic>slow as molasses</italic> (<italic>slam</italic>) mRNA that prominently colocalizes with its encoded protein at the basal cortical compartment during cellularization. The functional implications of this striking colocalization have been unknown. Here, we show that <italic>slam</italic> mRNA translation is spatiotemporally controlled. We found that translation was largely restricted to the onset of cellularization when Slam protein levels at the basal domain sharply increase. <italic>slam</italic> mRNA was translated locally, at least partially, as not yet translated mRNA transiently accumulated at the basal region. <italic>Slam</italic> RNA accumulated at the basal domain only if Slam protein was present. Furthermore, a <italic>slam</italic> RNA with impaired localization but full coding capacity was only weakly translated. We detected a biochemical interaction of <italic>slam</italic> mRNA and protein as demonstrated by specific co-immunoprecipitation from embryonic lysate. The intimate relationship of <italic>slam</italic> mRNA and protein may constitute a positive feedback loop that facilitates and controls timely and rapid accumulation of Slam protein at the prospective basal region.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>While proteins and their encoding messenger RNAs share the same intracellular space during the translation process, thereafter they are usually spatially and biochemically separated. RNA localization follows a specific subcellular pattern—such as apical or basal—and is thought to have important physiological implications during development, which are generally independent from the protein function. Here, we investigate the potential mutual dependencies between <italic>slam</italic> mRNA and its encoded protein during cellularization in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein are known to colocalize and are essential for epithelial compartmentalization and timely invagination of the plasma membrane between adjacent nuclei. We now show that Slam protein is required for RNA localization at the basal domain and that this event is needed for efficient translation. In addition to the functional interactions, we find that <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein are both present in a specific molecular complex. Our findings indicate that <italic>slam</italic> is locally translated and that the interaction between Slam protein and RNA constitutes a self-enhancing mechanism leading to the fast accumulation of Slam protein at the basal domain during the first minutes of cellularization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Subcellular RNA localization is a widespread phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref004">4</xref>]. A large-scale survey of RNA localization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos by RNA in situ hybridization with fluorescent probes revealed that about 70% of all tested transcripts were distributed in a specific subcellular pattern, such as apical or basal localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref005">5</xref>]. The physiological relevance of RNA localization is unknown for most of these transcripts, however. The function and mechanism of RNA localization have been studied in detail in numerous cases. Specific localization is usually mediated by cis-acting elements within the transcript and trans-acting factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref009">9</xref>]. Trans-acting factors are encoded by transcripts different than the localizing RNA, in most cases.</p>
<p>We reported previously that <italic>slow as molasses</italic> (<italic>slam</italic>) RNA and protein strikingly colocalize during early <italic>Drosophila</italic> development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref010">10</xref>]. However, the function and underlying mechanism of <italic>slam</italic> mRNA-protein colocalization have so far not been analyzed. <italic>slam</italic> is a key player in the change from syncytial to cellular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref014">14</xref>]. <italic>slam</italic> is specifically expressed during this stage and is required for furrow invagination and separation of cortical domains during cellularization and, later, for germ cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref016">16</xref>]. <italic>slam</italic> mRNA and protein strongly accumulate at the basal cortical domain, which forms the so-called furrow canal (FC). For the specification of the basal domain, <italic>slam</italic> functions redundantly with <italic>nullo</italic>. Markers of the FC such as Dia are present in <italic>slam</italic> mutants but are uniformly distributed in <italic>slam nullo</italic> double mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>An important feature of the transition from syncytial to cellular development is the rapid and coordinated change of several processes within a few minutes only. As zygotic gene expression gradually increases during the course of many minutes, additional posttranscriptional mechanisms potentially control the temporally and spatially regulated activity of the key players such as <italic>slam</italic> to ensure a switch-like change in behavior of the cellular processes from nuclear cycle 13 to cycle 14.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the functional and molecular interactions of <italic>slam</italic> mRNA and protein and address the function of <italic>slam</italic> RNA localization and RNA-protein colocalization. In addition to functional interactions, we identified a specific biochemical interaction, in that Slam protein specifically coprecipitated with <italic>slam</italic> mRNA.</p>

<title>Temporal and spatial regulation of Slam protein expression</title>
<p><italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein (about 4,000 nucleotides and 1,173 amino acid residues, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) mark the basal region of the cellularization furrow, the FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref010">10</xref>]. Morphologically visible furrows emerge within a few minutes after the last mitosis by invagination of the plasma membrane between adjacent nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein colocalization was also observed when Slam was ectopically localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We achieved ectopic Slam protein localization by employing embryos from <italic>nuf</italic> females, which are impaired for the recycling endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref018">18</xref>]. In these embryos, we detected <italic>slam</italic> RNA together with Slam protein at the apical membrane. These data show that <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein colocalize also in situations of ectopic localization and indicate that the mechanisms controlling <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein localization are interconnected.</p>

<p>Previous expression and histological analysis indicated an up-regulation of <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein during the blastoderm stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref016">16</xref>]. Expression analysis by NanoString technology defined the window of strong up-regulation to nuclear cycle 13 and early cellularization (cell cycle 14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref019">19</xref>]. We confirmed these data by measuring total RNA and protein levels. We found an about 10-fold up-regulation of total RNA levels during cellularization (2–3 h) by quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and a peak of total protein levels in extracts from embryos in cellularization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Slam is required for formation of the cellularization furrows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref016">16</xref>] and identity of the basal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref010">10</xref>]. As <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein are strongly enriched at the FC, we next analyzed accumulation of <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein specifically at the FC in fixed and stained embryos, which were staged by nuclear cycle and by the length of the furrow and nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). By quantification of the fluorescence signal at the FC, we observed a strong (6-fold) up-regulation of both localized RNA and protein within a short period of a few minutes at the transition from mitosis 13 to interphase 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Following this up-regulation, protein levels remained constant, whereas RNA levels gradually decreased after 30 min during the second half of cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the colocalization of RNA and protein, we hypothesized that translation of <italic>slam</italic> might be linked to RNA localization. To address this hypothesis, we first defined Slam protein stability and the timing of translation. <italic>slam</italic> RNA may be translated with a constant rate throughout cellularization or specifically during onset of cellularization. To separate the contribution of translation and degradation to the steady state levels of Slam protein, we first measured the stability of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-slam protein during cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). GFP-slam serves as a proxy for untagged Slam, because GFP-slam can rescue the cellularization phenotype of <italic>slam</italic> mutants. Furthermore, the dynamics of GFP-slam largely reflect the dynamics of Slam protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref017">17</xref>]. To measure the half-life of GFP-slam, we injected cycloheximide into embryos in cellularization to stop new translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s003">S3A–S3C Fig</xref>) and recorded the persistence of GFP-slam fluorescence. From the measured decay of GFP-slam during periods of 10 min, we extrapolated an estimated half-life of approximately 40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). A half-life of 40 min is in the range of the length of cellularization and thus indicates that GFP-slam is quite a stable protein. Together with the relatively stable expression levels of GFP-slam as well as endogenous Slam protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), the long half-life indicates a low translation rate of <italic>slam</italic> mRNA after the initial phase of cellularization. We could not measure the role of GFP-slam synthesis for the dynamics of GFP-slam during the onset of cellularization, as injection of cycloheximide would induce a mitotic arrest.</p>

</fig>
<p>Secondly, we analyzed the mobility of GFP-slam by quantifying fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Previously, we found that the recovery of GFP-slam fluorescence dramatically changes from fast and complete during the onset of cellularization to slow and incomplete recovery during the course of cellularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref017">17</xref>]. The slow fluorescence recovery after the initial phase of cellularization may be due to the exchange of bleached and unbleached molecules by mobile GFP-slam molecules. Alternatively, fluorescence recovery may be due to translation of new GFP-slam molecules. We distinguished these 2 options by FRAP experiments in embryos, in which new GFP-slam synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide. We observed a comparable recovery rate with and without cycloheximide. Thus, new GFP-slam translation does not contribute to fluorescence recovery during cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>). These data are consistent with the long half-life of GFP-slam during cellularization. Furthermore, the slow exchange of Slam molecules did not require vesicle budding, because a mutation in Dynamin (<italic>shibire</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref020">20</xref>] had little influence on the recovery rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). In summary, our data suggest that Slam protein is largely synthesized during a short period of a few minutes at the transition from mitosis 13 to interphase 14. Following this initial phase, Slam protein is subject to low turnover during the remainder of cellularization.</p>

<title>Not yet translated <italic>slam</italic> mRNA transiently accumulates at the prospective basal domain</title>
<p>Next, we addressed the spatial and temporal dimension of Slam protein accumulation at the basal domain. Protein accumulation may be due to recruitment of Slam protein from the cytoplasm to the basal compartment or, alternatively, to local translation of <italic>slam</italic> RNA. To distinguish these 2 options, we employed a recently developed method to fluorescently label not yet translated mRNA molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref022">22</xref>]. We generated genomic transgenes with a bacteriophage PP7 (PP7) hairpin loop inserted in the <italic>slam</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We inserted the PP7 sites close to the stop codon of the mRNA in order to assay all <italic>slam</italic> transcripts, including the mRNAs, which have initiated but not completed translation. Corresponding transcripts bind a bacteriophage PP7 coat protein (PCP)-GFP marker protein only until a ribosome has moved over the PP7 site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref022">22</xref>]. Thus, only not yet translated transcripts are labelled by PCP-GFP fluorescence. The <italic>slamPP7</italic> RNA shows a spatial and temporal expression pattern similar to endogenous <italic>slam</italic> RNA, persisting until the second half of cellularization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). In fixed embryos, we detected a dotted PCP-GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). PCP-GFP staining largely colocalized with Slam protein at the basal region. The staining was dynamic and only visible in embryos in early cellularization. Time-lapse imaging allowed a precise timing of PCP-GFP dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The dotted signal was largely observed during the onset of cellularization and quickly disappeared during the following minutes. These data show that a proportion of <italic>slam</italic> mRNA molecules reaches the basal domain before the first ribosomes have passed 3′-located PP7 sites and the first round of translation has been completed. Correspondingly, these data suggest that the synthesis of at least a fraction of the Slam protein molecules is completed at the FC. As the localized PCP signal quickly disappears, much fewer or no new and not yet fully translated <italic>slam</italic> RNA molecules reach the FC during cellularization.</p>

<p>Given the peculiar temporal and spatial restrictions of <italic>slam</italic> translation, we functionally analyzed the role of RNA protein colocalization.

<p>In a simple model, <italic>slam</italic> RNA would accumulate independently of Slam protein at the basal region. Alternatively, Slam protein may be involved in the localization of its mRNA. To distinguish these 2 options, <italic>slam</italic> RNA with an early stop codon (GFP-stop-slam RNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) was introduced into embryos that are maternally and zygotically deficient for the <italic>slam</italic> locus (“m−z−”[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref017">17</xref>]). Such embryos were derived from females with <italic>slam</italic> germ line clones crossed to <italic>slam</italic> heterozygous males. Fifty percent of the embryos from such a cross are <italic>slam</italic> (”m−z−“) deficient and 50% of the embryos zygotically express <italic>slam</italic> (“m−z+,” zygotic rescue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These 2 genotypes were easily distinguished by staining for endogenous Slam protein and by their morphology. The zygotically rescued embryos served as an internal reference for the injection and staining procedure. We could score for localization of the injected RNA also in <italic>slam</italic> deficient embryos, because the FC/basal domain is specified even in the absence of <italic>slam</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref017">17</xref>]. We did not detect localizing RNA in <italic>slam</italic> deficient embryos. The signal for GFP-stop-slam RNA was uniformly distributed at the apical surface. In contrast, in control embryos, the injected RNA colocalized with endogenous Slam protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). The GFP-stop-slam RNA localization in control embryos may be due to an interaction with Slam protein or with the endogenous <italic>slam</italic> RNA. We favor the first option, because injected <italic>slam</italic> RNA encoding functional Slam protein is sufficient for <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein localization in embryos lacking endogenous <italic>slam</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s004">S4A Fig</xref>).

<title>Slam protein has an intrinsic RNA-independent affinity for the FC</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether <italic>slam</italic> RNA localization is required for protein localization. For this, we mapped multiple regions within the 5′ untranslated region and the coding sequence, which are sufficient for localization at the FC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Given the complexity of multiple parts contributing to RNA localization, we generated a novel <italic>slam</italic> gene, <italic>slam</italic> alternative codon usage ([ACU]), in which a majority of the codons were replaced by synonymous codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s005">S5</xref> Figs). <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] RNA lost the ability to localize to the FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] RNA was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm in the presence or absence of endogenous <italic>slam</italic>, when expressed from a transgene (myc-GFP-slam[ACU]) or injected as synthetic RNA (myc-<italic>slam</italic>[ACU]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>).

<p>Having generated a nonlocalizing <italic>slam[ACU]</italic> RNA, we could test whether Slam protein accumulation at the FC would depend on RNA localization. We stained embryos injected with the nonlocalizing <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] mRNA for Slam protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). <italic>slam</italic> embryos were recognized by the absence of overall <italic>slam</italic> RNA or protein signal. Staining restricted to the injected site is due to the injected construct. We clearly detected Slam protein at the FC in <italic>slam</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We conclude that Slam protein has an intrinsic RNA-independent affinity for the FC. These data also indicate that we preserved the coding capacity of <italic>slam</italic>[ACU].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Translational control of <italic>slam</italic> at the FC</title>
<p>We got the impression that protein levels with <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] were lower than with wild-type <italic>slam</italic>. The difference may be due to inefficient translation of <italic>slam</italic>[ACU], to inefficient localization of Slam protein, or to the injection procedure resulting in lower mRNA levels than endogenous <italic>slam</italic> expression.</p>
<p>In order to test translation efficiency in embryos, we generated a genomic transgene with the <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] sequence, preserving introns, 5′ untranslated regions, and 3′ untranslated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). A corresponding genomic transgene with the endogenous coding sequence fully complements a <italic>slam</italic> deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref017">17</xref>]. <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] RNA expressed from the genomic transgene was comparably abundant as the endogenous wild-type allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), confirming the integrity of the transgene and transcript. <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] RNA showed a low degree of FC localization in wild-type background and slightly more so in <italic>slam</italic> deficient embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This low degree of localization is likely due to the 5′ untranslated region, which is sufficient to localize at the FC in the injection assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we assayed protein levels by embryo staining and western blot with total extracts. Staining for Slam protein in <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] embryos in comparison to rescued siblings revealed strongly reduced protein levels at the FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5C and 5E</xref>). A similarly clear difference in total protein levels was detected by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). For this, we manually sorted embryos according to stage (mid-cellularization) and genotype. No Slam was detected in <italic>slam</italic> deficient embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] embryos contained much less Slam protein than the rescued siblings, which zygotically expressed Slam from the endogenous gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). These data indicate Slam protein derived from <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] is much less abundant and that <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] was thus much less translated than wild-type <italic>slam</italic>.</p>
<p>The reduced translation may be due to secondary RNA structures or codon usage affecting translation efficiency. We distinguished these options by expression of <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] in comparison to <italic>slam</italic>[WT] in cultured <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Schneider 2 cells (S2 cells). S2 cells do not express Slam protein in detectable levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Following transient transfection, we detected comparable <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein levels for <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] and wild-type <italic>slam</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s006">S6B and S6C Fig</xref>). These data indicate that generic translation in S2 cells is comparably efficient for <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] and wild-type <italic>slam</italic>. These data do not rule out the conceivable option that <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] contains secondary RNA structures or peculiar codon usage affecting translation efficiency that are specifically present in the embryo but not in S2 cells.</p>
<p>Consistent with the reduced protein expression from <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] in embryos, the <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] genomic transgene only partially complemented the cellularization phenotype and did not rescue the lethality of a <italic>slam</italic> deficiency. Embryos maternally and zygotically deficient for <italic>slam</italic> but with <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] only formed a short cellularization furrow and did not complete cellularization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003315.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). This functional test showed that efficient expression of <italic>slam</italic> is physiologically important. Taken together, these data suggest that localization of <italic>slam</italic> RNA at the basal domain or its colocalization with Slam protein are important for full translation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary function of <italic>slam</italic> RNA is encoding Slam protein. In addition to coding information, <italic>slam</italic> RNA contains 2 more pieces of noncoding information: (1) information for specific subcellular localization of the RNA at the FC, which is at least partially mediated by an interaction with Slam protein, and (2) information for spatial and temporal control of translation, which is high at the FC during the onset of cellularization. By comparing wild-type RNA with a variant RNA, <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] with the same coding information, the relevance of the noncoding information was uncovered. <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] RNA is widely distributed in the cell and gives rise to much less Slam protein. Containing coding and noncoding information distinguishes <italic>slam</italic> RNA from generic mRNAs, which contain only coding information. <italic>slam</italic> RNA may be related to the growing class of mRNAs with coding and noncoding functions (cncRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Using the injection assay with synthetic RNA transcribed from truncation constructs, we identified several regions of <italic>slam</italic> RNA that are sufficient for localization to the FC in wild-type embryos. This includes the 5′ untranslated region and at least 2 large regions within the coding sequence, which we have so far not further defined. Each of these regions is able to localize to the FC on its own in wild-type embryos, which indicates redundancy in the mechanism of RNA localization. Interpretation of these data is difficult, however, given that endogenous <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein were present in our assay, which may lead to localization by oligomerization or other indirect binding mechanisms.</p>
<p><italic>slam</italic> RNA is subject to spatiotemporal control of translation. Although the RNA is present in high levels during the first half of cellularization, translation is restricted to the initial minutes of cellularization. The almost constant protein levels throughout cellularization are due to the stability of Slam protein, as inhibition of new synthesis by cycloheximide leads only to a weak decrease of GFP-slam fluorescence. In contrast to these constant levels during cellularization is the sharp increase in protein levels during the onset of cellularization.</p>
<p>This initial rise in protein levels is partly due to the transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>slam</italic>. The transcriptional regulation appears not to be sufficient, as we observed a striking difference between <italic>slam</italic>[wild-type] RNA with <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] RNA. Although both RNAs contain the same coding information and give rise to similar amounts of Slam protein in cultured cells, <italic>slam</italic>[wild-type] RNA is more efficiently translated than <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] RNA in blastoderm embryos. Based on the correlation of impaired RNA localization and reduced translational efficiency, we favor the model that efficient translation is linked to RNA localization or interaction with Slam protein at the FC. However, the embryo-specific lower efficiency of <italic>slam</italic>[ACU] translation may alternatively be due to secondary RNA structures or disadvantageous codons, which were introduced in our mutagenesis.</p>
<p>A particular feature of <italic>slam</italic> is that the encoded protein is required for the elaboration of noncoding features. <italic>slam</italic> RNA requires Slam protein for accumulation at the FC. Not only do we observe a functional interaction of the RNA and protein but also colocalization and biochemical association, indicating molecular interactions. These molecular interactions between RNA and protein may be direct or indirect. They are likely to be indirect, as Slam protein does not contain a canonical RNA binding domain or does not share any detectable sequence homology to RNA binding proteins. Analysis of transcripts associated with Slam protein provided distinct lists depending on the experimental procedure. Importantly, <italic>slam</italic> RNA was identified by both approaches, which is consistent with our quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis for a few selected genes. The list of associated transcripts contained transcripts with high and low abundance, indicating that the procedure was sufficiently sensitive to also detect weakly expressed genes. Screening through the gene functions, we did not detect a specific set of genes, such as genes involved in cellularization or cytoskeletal organization.</p>
<p>The biological function of the intimate relationship of <italic>slam</italic> mRNA and its protein has been unclear. Given the observed specific spatiotemporal profile of <italic>slam</italic> translation and Slam dynamics, we propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Initially, Slam protein accumulates in low levels at the FC independently of its mRNA. Starting with the onset in zygotic transcription, <italic>slam</italic> mRNA exits the nucleus as part of a complex that is not competent for efficient translation. At least a fraction of <italic>slam</italic> RNA molecules accumulates at the basal domain forming the FC prior to the first round of translation. At the basal domain, <italic>slam</italic> mRNA becomes competent for efficient translation, which leads to an increase in Slam protein at the FC. The increased amounts of Slam protein further promote accumulation of <italic>slam</italic> mRNA, leading to even more Slam protein. Such a mechanism constitutes a positive feedback loop, which provides an explanation for the observed switch-like profile of Slam protein staining at the FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Some minutes later, when full Slam levels have been reached, translation is turned off. Slam protein then functions in spatially restricted activation of Rho signaling, actomyosin organization, Patj recruitment, cortical compartmentalization, and furrow invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003315.g008">Fig 8</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref025">25</xref>]. As <italic>slam</italic> is a key regulator of cellularization, the rapid increase of Slam protein may be important for a coordinated and timely onset of its downstream processes.</p>

<p>We identified <italic>slam</italic> as an mRNA with noncoding information for localization and translational control in addition to its coding information. On the molecular level, <italic>slam</italic> is special in that mRNA and protein associate in a complex as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. This unconventional relationship of <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein may be important for the tightly restricted subcellular localization and strong increase in protein levels at the FC. The functional interaction of <italic>slam</italic> RNA and protein constitutes a positive feedback loop, which contributes to the fast increase in Slam protein levels at the FC.</p>

A 200-μl sample was taken from the supernatant (unbound fraction). Beads were then washed 4 times with cold YSS buffer. 200 μl of YSS buffer was added to the bound samples. Unbound and bound samples were complemented with 20 μl 10% SDS and 0.5 μl glycogen (20 μg/ml). Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol. Protein was precipitated from the organic phase with 1 ml acetone. RNA was precipitated by the addition of 40 μl Na-acetat (3 M) and 500 μl 100% ethanol to the aqueous phase. Protein and RNA samples were analyzed by western blot, quantitative RT-PCR, and next generation sequencing, respectively. For co-immunoprecipitation with the single-chain GFP antibody (GFP binder or GFP-TRAP, Chromotek), staged embryos from GFP-slam transgenic or wild-type flies were collected and lysed as described above, except for the following: 0.5 μl biotinylated-GFP binder (50 mM) was mixed with cleared embryo lysate for 1 h at 4°C. Then, 20 μl PBS-washed streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads were added and mixed for a further 1 h at 4°C.</p>

<title>Western blots and analysis of manually selected embryos</title>
<p>SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and western blot were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref010">10</xref>]. Primary antibodies were guinea pig or rabbit-α-Slam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref010">10</xref>], mouse-α-tubulin-α (Sigma), and rabbit or guinea pig-α-Dia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref022">22</xref>]. Western blots were developed with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (800CW Donkey-α-guinea pig/mouse/rabbit IgG) and detected with a LICOR system. Sixteen-bit images were processed by Photoshop and FIJI/ImageJ. For analysis of embryos with defined genotype and stage, embryos were heat fixed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003315.ref010">10</xref>], stained for Slam and DAPI, and mounted in 50% glycerol. Under fluorescent microscope, embryos in cellularization were sorted by their zygotic genotype and stage. Sorted embryos (<italic>N</italic> = 10–20) were lysed in Laemmli buffer with a Dounce homogenizer and analyzed by western blot.</p>
