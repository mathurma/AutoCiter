				<article-title>Human Gut Hosts a Dynamically Evolving Microbial Ecosystem</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The adult human intestine contains trillions of bacteria, representing hundreds of species and thousands of subspecies. Little is known about the selective pressures that have shaped and are shaping this community's component species, which are dominated by members of the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes divisions. To examine how the intestinal environment affects microbial genome evolution, we have sequenced the genomes of two members of the normal distal human gut microbiota, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacteroides vulgatus</named-content> and <italic>Bacteroides distasonis,</italic> and by comparison with the few other sequenced gut and non-gut Bacteroidetes, analyzed their niche and habitat adaptations. The results show that lateral gene transfer, mobile elements, and gene amplification have played important roles in affecting the ability of gut-dwelling Bacteroidetes to vary their cell surface, sense their environment, and harvest nutrient resources present in the distal intestine. Our findings show that these processes have been a driving force in the adaptation of Bacteroidetes to the distal gut environment, and emphasize the importance of considering the evolution of humans from an additional perspective, namely the evolution of our microbiomes.</p>

          <p>The total number of microbes that colonize the surfaces of our adult bodies is thought to be ten times greater than the total number of our human cells. Our microbial partners provide us with certain features that we have not had to evolve on our own. In this sense, we should consider ourselves to be a supraorganism whose genetic landscape includes both our own genome as well as the genomes of our resident microbes, and whose physiologic features are a synthesis of human and microbial metabolic traits. The largest collection of microbes resides in our gut, which harbors trillions of bacteria, representing hundreds of species, most falling into two groups‚Äîthe Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. We have sequenced the genomes of two human gut-dwelling Bacteroidetes, and compared their genomes to the genomes of other bacteria that live both inside and outside of our bodies. Our results illustrate that adaptation to the gut habitat is a dynamic process that includes acquisition of genes from other microorganisms. These findings emphasize the importance of including the evolution of ‚Äúour‚Äù microbial genomes when considering the evolution of humans.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Our distal gut is one of the most densely populated and most thoroughly surveyed bacterial ecosystems in nature. This microbiota contains more bacterial cells than all of our body's other microbial communities combined. The gut microbial community and its collective genome (microbiome) endow us with physiological attributes that we have not had to evolve on our own, including the ability to break down otherwise indigestible polysaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b002">2</xref>]. The most complete 16S rRNA gene sequence‚Äìbased enumerations available indicate that more than 90% of phylogenetic types (phylotypes) belong to just two of the 70 known divisions of Bacteria, the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes, with the remaining phylotypes distributed among eight other divisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b003">3</xref>]. With an estimated 500‚Äì1,000 species, and over 7,000 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b004">4</xref>], the evolutionary tree of our distal intestinal microbiota can be visualized as a grove of ten palm trees (divisions), each topped by fronds representing divergent lineages, and with each frond composed of many leaves representing closely related bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b001">1</xref>]. In contrast, soil, Earth's terrestrial ‚Äúgut‚Äù for degrading organic matter, can be viewed as a bush, composed of many more intermediate and deeply diverging lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b005">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is unclear how selective pressures, microbial community dynamics, and the environments in which we live shape the genomes and functions of members of our gut microbiota, and hence our ‚Äúmicro-evolution.‚Äù Ecological principles predict that functional redundancy encoded in genomes from divergent bacterial lineages ensures against disruption of food webs. These principles also predict that host-driven, ‚Äútop-down‚Äù selection for such redundancy should produce a community composed of distantly related members, whose genomes convergently evolve functionally <italic>similar</italic> suites of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b004">4</xref>]. Lateral gene transfer (LGT), which allows for rapid transfer of genes under strong selection, such as the genes encoding antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b006">6</xref>], represents one way that members of the microbiota could share metabolic and other capabilities. In contrast, competition between members of a microbiota should exert a ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù selective pressure that produces specialized genomes with functionally <italic>distinct</italic> suites of genes. These distinct suites define ecological niches (professions), and once established, could be maintained by barriers to homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b004">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>To explore whether and how these principles apply to the gut microbiota and its microbiome, we have determined the complete genome sequences of two Bacteroidetes with highly divergent 16S rRNA phylotypes that are prominently represented in the distal gut of healthy humans‚Äî<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacteroides vulgatus</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacteroides distasonis</named-content> (now also known as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Parabacteroides distasonis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b007">7</xref>]). <italic>B. distasonis</italic> is basal to the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> clade, and diverged from the common ancestor of the other <italic>Bacteroides</italic> prior to their differentiation. The results of comparisons with other sequenced gut- and non-gut‚Äìassociated Bacteroidetes, described below, provide insights into the evolution of niche specialization in this highly competitive ecosystem, including the role of LGT.</p>

These genomes were initially compared to the genomes of two other Bacteroidetes that live in the distal human gut: <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> (type stain ATCC 29148 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b002">2</xref>] and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. fragilis</named-content> (strains YCH 46 and NCTC 9343 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b009">9</xref>]). We identified 1,416 sets of orthologous protein-coding genes shared among these gut Bacteroidetes; 1,129 (79.7%) of these conserved gene sets were assigned to Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-sg002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st002">Table S2</xref> for a COG-based categorization). The two most prominently represented COG categories in each of the gut-associated Bacteroidetes proteomes are G (carbohydrate transport and metabolism) and M (cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis). The two most prominent COG categories in their shared proteome are E (amino acid transport and metabolism) and J (translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The average pairwise amino acid‚Äìsequence identity among the shared orthologs was 82.0% for <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron‚ÄìB. fragilis,</italic> 72.1% for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content>‚Äì<italic>B. vulgatus,</italic> 62.1% for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content>‚Äì<italic>B. distasonis,</italic> and 61.7% for <italic>B. vulgatus‚ÄìB. distasonis</italic>. These values are consistent with the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree for Bacteroidetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Although the evolution of these gut Bacteroidetes is characterized by comprehensive deterioration of global synteny (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), a total of 257 ‚Äúpatches‚Äù of local synteny were identified, composed of adjacent orthologous genes encompassing 765 of the 1,416 shared orthologs (54%; average of 3.0 orthologs per cluster).</p>

        <p>The distal gut microbiota is exposed to several prominent nutrient sources: (1) dietary plant polysaccharides that are not digested in the small intestine by the host because our human proteome lacks the requisite glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases (see the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database [CAZy] at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cazy.org</ext-link> for a comprehensive annotation of the human ‚Äúglycobiome‚Äù), (2) undigested plant proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b010">10</xref>], and (3) host glycans associated with the continuously renewing epithelium that lines the gut and with the even more rapidly replenished mucus layer that overlies this epithelium.</p>
        <p>To identify genomic features related to adaptation to life within this distal human gut habitat, we compared shared orthologs among all five completely sequenced gut Bacteroidetes genomes to the subset that is shared with the two Bacteroidetes that occupy non-gut habitats. These non-gut Bacteroidetes are <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Porphyromonas gingivalis</named-content> W83, a member of the human oral microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b011">11</xref>], and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Cytophaga hutchinsonii</named-content> ATCC 33406, which is found in soil (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=genomeprj&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=Overview&amp;list_uids=54" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=genomeprj&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=Overview&amp;list_uids=54</ext-link>). Each proteome was searched for conserved domains. These domains were used to assign a functional identifier (InterPro ID) that was then mapped onto Gene Ontology (GO) terms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b012">12</xref>] using InterProScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b013">13</xref>]. The results were compiled and statistical comparisons made between the number of genes assigned to each GO term in different genomes. The complete list of GO assignments for all seven Bacteroidetes genomes is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050156" xlink:type="simple">http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050156</ext-link> (5.3 MB).</p>
        <p>The subset of orthologs <italic>shared</italic> with non-gut Bacteroidetes is enriched for core metabolic activities, suggesting that all Bacteroidetes have inherited a core metabolome from their common ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, compare data in column 7w versus data in 5w). The subset of orthologs <italic>unique</italic> to the gut Bacteroidetes is enriched for genes related to amino acid biosynthesis, membrane transport, carbon-oxygen lyases, and environment sensing/regulation (see GO terms highlighted in red/pink in the column labeled 5wU in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Furthermore, although a comparison of each gut-dwelling Bacteroidetes proteome to the proteomes of its non-gut relatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) revealed that the four gut species are all enriched for genes that belong to GO categories related to three general functions‚Äî(1) polysaccharide metabolism, (2) environmental sensing and gene regulation, and (3) membrane transport‚Äîmost of these GO categories are depleted among the subset of orthologs that are unique to the gut-associated Bacteroidetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g005">5</xref>w versus Bt-G). Thus, even though all four sequenced gut Bacteroidetes species have increased numbers of genes in categories (1) through (3), this analysis suggests that each species has evolved a divergent array of sensing, regulatory, and polysaccharide degradation genes that augment the core metabolome they share with other members of their division.</p>

Significant enrichment is denoted by pink (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) or red (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), whereas depletion is indicated by light blue (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) or dark blue (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), as calculated by a binomial comparison followed by Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate correction (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
            <p>(A) Genes assigned to GO terms related to core metabolic functions are enriched in the subset of common gut-associated Bacteroidetes orthologs shared with non-gut Bacteroidetes (seven-way comparison; abbreviated 7w), compared to the reference set of 1,416 orthologs common to the five sequenced gut Bacteroidetes genomes (5w), suggesting that all Bacteroidetes have inherited a core metabolome from their common ancestor. The set of orthologs that is not shared with non-gut‚Äìassociated Bacteroidetes (five-way unique; 5wU) is enriched, relative to all orthologs (5w), for genes in three classes‚Äîamino acid biosynthesis; membrane transport; and two-component signal transduction systems‚Äîsuggesting that these genes were important in the process of adaptation to the gut and/or other habitats by the common ancestor of gut Bacteroidetes.</p>
            <p>(B) Various GO terms related to environmental sensing, gene regulation, and carbohydrate degradation are enriched in gut Bacteroidetes relative to <italic>Cy. hutchinsonii</italic> (Ch)<italic>.</italic> A similar pattern is observed relative to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. gingivalis</named-content> (Pg) (unpublished data).

Thus, these classes of genes, though enriched in all gut Bacteroidetes, are widely divergent between them.

        <title>Niche Specialization of Bacteroidetes</title>
        <p>To further define the niches occupied by the gut Bacteroidetes, we compared each one to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content>. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> was selected as the reference species because there is a wealth of information about its functional attributes. Scanning electron microscopy, whole-genome transcriptional profiling, and mass spectrometry‚Äìbased metabolomic studies performed in gnotobiotic mice colonized with this prominent human gut symbiont have shown that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> is a remarkably flexible forager for polysaccharides that opportunistically deploys different subsets of its 209 paralogs of SusC and SusD (two outer membrane proteins involved in the binding and import of starch and maltooligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b015">15</xref>]), and its 226 predicted glycoside hydrolases plus 15 polysaccharide lyases, so that it can feast on dietary or host mucus glycans, depending upon the polysaccharide content of the host's diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b016">16</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Compared to the other Bacteroidetes, the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> proteome has the most glycoside hydrolases known or predicted to degrade plant glycans (e.g., 64 arabinosidases; our human proteome has none), and the most enzymes for harvesting host glycans (e.g., sulfuric ester hydrolases, hexosaminidases, and fucosidases) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st003">Table S3</xref>). It is also the only sequenced gut Bacteroidetes that possesses candidate polysaccharide lyases for degrading animal tissue glycans (e.g., heparin, chondroitin, and hyaluronan; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st003">Table S3</xref>). <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s ability to opportunistically use many glycan sources likely makes it an important generalist among intestinal Bacteroidetes.</p>
        <p>Compared to <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis</italic> is a specialist. It has the smallest genome among the sequenced human gut-associated Bacteroidetes, the smallest repertoire of genes that are members of the environmental sensing and gene regulation GO categories, and the smallest number of genes associated with carbon source degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st001">Table S1</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. distasonis</named-content> lacks many accessory hemicellulases (arabinosidases, Œ±-glucuronidases), pectinases, and other polysaccharidases that target non-plant carbohydrates, such as chitinases. Moreover, the number of genes present in each CAZy enzyme class represented in its proteome is markedly reduced compared to the other intestinal Bacteroidetes (e.g., <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. distasonis</named-content> has only one candidate Œ±-fucosidase, whereas the other gut-associated species have nine or ten) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st003">Table S3</xref>).</p>
        <p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. distasonis</named-content> has two classes of carbohydrate-processing enzymes that are more abundant in its proteome than in the proteomes of other gut Bacteroidetes: CAZy glycoside hydrolase family 13 (Œ±-amylase‚Äìrelated proteins), and family 73 (N-acetylhexosaminidases, which can target host glycans as well as bacterial cell walls). Its proteome also contains more polysaccharide deacetylases (seven versus four in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron,</italic> and one to two in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. fragilis</named-content> strains, as characterized by InterPro ID IPR002509; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050156.a" xlink:type="simple">http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050156.a</ext-link> for a complete list of InterPro ID assignments). Host epithelial glycans contain O-acetylated sugars, including sialic acids, that protect them from direct cleavage by microbial glycoside hydrolases. Thus, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. distasonis</named-content> has the capacity to make the deacetylated products available for itself and other components of the microbiota. Finally, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. distasonis</named-content> devotes a greater proportion of its genome to protein degradation than does <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> (GO:0006508, ‚Äúproteolysis‚Äù; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0003 by binomial test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. vulgatus</named-content> glycobiome has features consistent with ex vivo studies indicating that its substrate range for polysaccharides is intermediate between that of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. distasonis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b017">17</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. vulgatus</named-content> has the largest and most complete complement of enzymes that target pectin, a common fruit-associated class of glycans (includes pectin methylesterases, pectin acetylesterases, polygalacturonases, and accessory Œ¥-4,5 unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases). According to the CAZy classification scheme, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. vulgatus</named-content> is the only sequenced gut Bacteroidetes with a gene encoding a xylanase (Bv0041c). Together, these findings reveal overlapping, but distinct, niches among these gut Bacteroidetes. We next examined the role of LGT in shaping their genomes.</p>

        <title>Lateral Gene Transfer</title>
        <p>Determining whether a gene is laterally transferred is widely acknowledged to be a difficult problem (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b018">18</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b021">21</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-sd001">Text S1</xref>). We chose a phylogenetic approach (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) to identify genes that appeared to have been laterally acquired and probably selected for after the divergence of individual gut species. Our approach could potentially identify two types of genes: genes that were laterally transferred only into one lineage, and genes that were lost in all lineages except one. We also had to acknowledge the possibility that random errors in phylogenetic tree reconstruction could produce false-positive results. We confirmed that LGT was the more likely scenario for these genes by demonstrating that they differed in composition from the rest of the genome. This approach allowed us to investigate the adaptations of individual lineages to their specific niche. For simplicity, we refer to these genes as ‚Äúlaterally transferred‚Äù in the remainder of this study, although a minority of them may actually represent differential gene loss, which would still likely indicate species-specific selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b022">22</xref>].</p>
        <p>Our approach was to use sensitive, iterated profile searches to retrieve homologs of each protein-coding gene in the genomes of interest from publicly available databases. We then built phylogenetic trees of the related sequences and bootstrapped them to minimize noise, keeping only those nodes that were supported by 70% of the replicates. We subsequently used the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy database to assign taxonomy information to each sequence, and employed the Fitch parsimony algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b023">23</xref>] to assign the most likely bacterial taxon to each internal node. This analysis allowed us to differentiate four classes of genes: (1) those whose closest relatives are outside the gut Bacteroidetes, suggesting a lateral transfer event and/or differential gene loss; (2) those whose closest relative is within the gut Bacteroidetes, indicating likely vertical inheritance; (3) those without any homologs in the database (i.e., ‚Äúnovel‚Äù); and (4) those whose pattern of inheritance, whether lateral or vertical, could not be determined (i.e., ‚Äúunresolved‚Äù). Parsimony was used to assign a likely direction (‚Äúin‚Äù or ‚Äúout‚Äù) to each lateral transfer event where possible (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st004">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>We did not attempt to resolve lateral transfer events within the gut Bacteroidetes in this study, primarily because the lack of sufficient taxonomic sampling within the Bacteroidetes made it impossible to distinguish transfer from biased sampling. Previous studies have observed that a number of novel genes in other bacterial genomes seem to be laterally acquired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b024">24</xref>]. However, for the purposes of our functional analyses, these novel genes were excluded because little functional information is available about them. Because we wished to analyze adaptation to the gut, we also excluded genes that appeared to have been transferred out of the Bacteroidetes.</p>
        <p>Our method identified an average of 5.5% of the genes in each genome as being laterally transferred from outside the gut Bacteroidetes (312 for <italic>B. distasonis,</italic> 184 for <italic>B. vulgatus,</italic> 277 for <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron,</italic> 199 for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. fragilis</named-content> NCTC 9343, 214 for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. fragilis</named-content> YCH 46, and 103 for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. gingivalis</named-content>). We verified that the genes we identified as ‚Äúlaterally transferred‚Äù differed from those classified as ‚Äúnot transferred,‚Äù both in terms of GC content (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for each genome by two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test using Welch's correction for unequal variances) and codon bias (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 for each genome by chi-square test). These results, together with the functions represented by this class of genes (see below), confirm that LGT is the most likely scenario accounting for these genes, although we cannot rule out ancient paralogs from the data available because of different rates and patterns of evolution in different lineages, and other confounding factors.</p>
        <p>A complete classification of laterally transferred protein-coding genes in the gut Bacteroidetes, and <italic>P. gingivalis,</italic> is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st004">Table S4</xref>. Genes involved in core cellular processes, such as translation (e.g., ribosomal proteins), are less susceptible to LGT than other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b025">25</xref>]. Primary metabolism (GO:0044238) and protein biosynthesis (GO:0006412) are among the GO terms most enriched in the set of genes <italic>not</italic> subject to LGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

The excess of LGT genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. distasonis</named-content> is also not simply attributable to its more distant phylogenetic relationship to the other gut Bacteroidetes, because <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. gingivalis</named-content> does not share this feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

The result is a balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine profile that should help promote co-existence with a microbiota and, perhaps, tolerance to a variety of environmental antigens, including those found in food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b029">29</xref>].</p>

        <title>The Role of Gene Duplication in Diversification of Gut Bacteroidetes: A Case Study of SusC/SusD Paralogs</title>
        <p>As noted above, the gut Bacteroidetes genomes contain large numbers of paralogs involved in environmental sensing and nutrient acquisition. We used one of the largest families, the SusC/SusD paralogs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st001">Table S1</xref>), as a model for investigating relationships among members. SusC paralogs are predicted to be TonB-dependent, Œ≤-barrel‚Äìtype outer membrane proteins. Thus, in addition to binding nutrients such as polysaccharides, SusC paralogs likely participate in their energy-dependent transport into the periplasmic space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b034">34</xref>]. SusD paralogs are predicted to be secreted and to have an N-terminal lipid tail that would allow them to associate with the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b014">14</xref>]. Genes encoding SusC and SusD paralogs are typically positioned adjacent to one another in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> genome (102 of 107 loci encoding SusC paralogs), and are often part of multigene clusters that also encode enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (62 of 107 loci) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b002">2</xref>]. Eighteen of the 62 clusters that encode SusC/SusD paralogs and glycoside hydrolases also contain ECF-œÉ factors and adjacent anti-œÉ factors. A subset of SusC paralogs contain an extra N-terminal domain with homology to the N-terminal domain of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> FecA iron-dicitrate receptor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b035">35</xref>]. FecA interacts directly with an anti-œÉ factor (FecR) via this domain, thereby controlling gene expression through modulation of its associated ECF-œÉ factor (FecI).</p>
        <p>These clusters provide case studies of the evolution of gut Bacteroidetes genomes. Their glycoside hydrolase content varies considerably within a given species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st007">Table S7</xref>). Our studies in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> indicate that ECF-œÉ factors are required for transcription of their adjacent polysaccharide utilization gene clusters, and that chromosomally linked anti-œÉ factors act as repressors of this transcription. Moreover, several <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> loci containing ECF-œÉ and anti-œÉ factors are differentially regulated during growth on various complex glycans ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b016">16</xref>]; E. C. Martens and J. I. Gordon, unpublished data), suggesting that these systems act as components of carbohydrate sensors responsible for regulating loci appropriate for utilizing available nutrients.</p>
        <p>Six of these clusters in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. distasonis</named-content> (clusters 2‚Äì6 and 16 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st007">Table S7</xref>-A) include predicted sulfatases, whereas there are fewer such loci in the other genomes: two clusters in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. vulgatus</named-content> (clusters 5 and 11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st007">Table S7</xref>-B), four in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron,</italic> and three in each of the two <italic>B. fragilis</italic> strains. These enzymes could be involved in the desulfation of sulfomucins that contain galactose-3-sulfate, galactose-6-sulfate, and <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate residues. These or other sulfatases could also be involved in the desulfation of glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin and heparin.</p>
        <p>To explore the role of gene duplication in the diversification of the Bacteroidetes, we generated lists of all paired SusC and SusD paralogs from the four gut- and one non-gut‚Äìassociated Bacteroidetes species (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. gingivalis</named-content> has four such pairs, whereas the other five intestinal Bacteroidetes species have a total of 370 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-st001">Table S1</xref>). A cladogram generated from the multiple sequence alignment shows that many SusC/SusD pairs have close relatives among several Bacteroidetes. However, certain specialized groups are unique to each species, with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> containing one particularly large expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Gene clusters encoding related SusC/SusD pairs also contain other genes that are closely related to one another. The homology and synteny of these loci suggest that genomic duplication is a mechanism driving their amplification and diversification (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g005">5</xref>C). An intriguing feature of some of these amplified loci is that they contain clusters of genes with unique functions that are located downstream of the ‚Äúcore‚Äù duplicated genes; this may serve to further diversify the roles of these loci in nutrient acquisition (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050156-g005">Figure 5</xref>B in which diverse dehydrogenase, sulfatase, and glycoside hydrolase functions are included downstream of a syntenic core of amplified genes).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The trillions of bacteria that colonize our distal gut largely belong to two bacterial divisions, and can be classified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis into hundreds of ‚Äúspecies‚Äù that share a common ancestry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b036">36</xref>], but whose genome content may vary considerably. Forces that shape the genome content of bacteria in the gut include the intermicrobial dynamics of competition and cooperation in resource partitioning that shape complex food webs, as well as other community-shaping forces, such as phage attacks, that can result in ‚Äúselective sweeps‚Äù that remove cells with similar susceptibilities. In a competitive environment in which innovation in resource acquisition strategies can breed success, and resistance to phage can mean surviving a phage selective sweep, bacteria can be expected to differentiate their genome content. For the host to thrive and produce more gut habitats (by reproducing), the gut microbial ecosystem must be functionally stable over time despite the internal dynamics of the community. The constituent bacteria might therefore be expected to have a high degree of functional redundancy between species, so that the loss of one lineage would not adversely impact ecosystem services to the host. Our investigation of the genomes of human gut Bacteroidetes species shows that the ‚Äútop-down‚Äù forces imposed by selection at the host level that would result in a homogenized microbiome, and the ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù forces of intermicrobial dynamics that would result in completely differentiated genomes, are both at work in the distal gut. The genomes of the gut Bacteroidetes species that have been sequenced harbor suites of genes with similar functions, but differ in the number of genes within functional categories and their specific sequence. It appears that the differences between genomes are enough to carve out specific niches within the gut habitat, such that the species are not in direct competition, but are sufficiently similar to confer resistance to disturbance to the host through functional redundancy.</p>
      <p>Our findings demonstrate a key role for LGT in shaping the adaptation of individual Bacteroidetes to distinct niches within the human gut. It is unclear how and when laterally transferred genes were introduced during evolution of distal gut Bacteroidetes. We have performed 16S rRNA gene sequence‚Äìbased enumeration studies of the fecal microbiota of 59 different mammalian species: the results reveal that none of the four sequenced gut Bacteroidetes species is restricted to the human gut (R. E. Ley and J. I. Gordon, unpublished data). Nonetheless, the impact of LGT is likely profound for these gut symbionts and their human hosts. A large and varied gene pool of glycosyltransferases provides a capacity for diversification of surface polysaccharide structures that could endow symbionts with varied capacities to shape a host immune system so that it can accommodate a microbiota (and perhaps related food and other environmental antigens). Because the environment surrounding each human being varies, this gene flow may promote the generation of host-specific microbiomes. Acquisition of new types of carbohydrate binding proteins, transporters, and degradation enzymes through both LGT and gene amplification should influence the types of substrates that can be exploited for energy harvest. It may also affect our predisposition to conditions such as obesity in which the efficiency of caloric harvest may be influenced by the relationship between an individual's microbial glycoside hydrolase repertoire and the glycan content of his/her diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b038">38</xref>].</p>
      <p>These considerations emphasize the need to have a more comprehensive view of our genetic landscape as a composite of human and microbial genes, a transcendent view of human evolution as involving our microbial partners, and a commitment to investigating human biology in the larger framework of environmental microbiology. Attention to these issues is timely, given the onset of efforts to sequence the human ‚Äúmicrobiome‚Äù [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b039">39</xref>]. These metagenomic studies will allow investigators to address new, but fundamental, questions about humans. Do we share an identifiable core ‚Äúmicrobiome‚Äù? If there is such a core, how does the shell of diversity that surrounds the core influence our individual physiologic properties? How is the human microbiome evolving (within and between individuals) over varying time scales as a function of our changing diets, lifestyle, and biosphere? Finally, how should we define members of the microbiome when microbes possess pan-genomes (all genes present in any of the strains of a species) with varying degrees of ‚Äúopenness‚Äù to acquisition of genes from other microbes?</p>

For each genome, both Phrap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phrap.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.phrap.org/</ext-link>) and PCAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b040">40</xref>] assemblies were generated and then compared, resulting in a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù assembly that takes advantage of the strength of both assemblies. Regions that contained a gap in one assembly, but not in the other, were made contiguous in the final assembly for finishing by using Consed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b041">41</xref>].</p>
        <p>Sequence gaps were filled by primer-walking on spanning clones. Physical gaps were amplified by PCR and closed by sequencing the PCR products. Poor quality regions were detected using Consed, amplified with PCR, and resequenced. The integrity and accuracy of the assembly were verified by clone constraints. Regions of lower coverage, or that contained ambiguous assemblies, were resolved by sequencing spanning individual fosmids. Regions that underwent sequence inversions were identified based on inconsistency of constraints for a fraction of read pairs in those regions. The final assemblies consisted of 12.6X and 13.2X sequence coverage for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. vulgatus</named-content> and <italic>B. distasonis,</italic> respectively. For each base, the Phred quality value was at least 40.</p>
        <p>rRNA and tRNA genes were identified with BLASTN and tRNA-Scan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b042">42</xref>], respectively.

WUBLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.wustl.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://blast.wustl.edu</ext-link>) was used to identify all predicted proteins with significant hits to the non-redundant (nr) database. Predicted protein-coding genes containing fewer than 60 codons and without significant homology (e-value threshold of 10<sup>‚àí6</sup>) to other proteins were eliminated. Gene start-site predictions were fine-tuned using MED-Start [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b046">46</xref>] and BLAST homology. In general, no overlapping genes were allowed. Potential frameshift errors were identified by sequence alignment with known proteins, and confirmed or corrected by resequencing. The final set of genes, compiled from the analysis described above, was manually curated. Protein annotation was based on homology searches against public databases and domain analysis with HMMER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://selab.janelia.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://selab.janelia.org/</ext-link>). Functional classification was based on homology searches against COG categories using WU-BLAST and COGnitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b047">47</xref>], followed by manual curation. Metabolic pathways were constructed with reference to KEGG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b048">48</xref>].

        <p>Orthologs of the five intestinal Bacteroidetes genomes were identified based on (1) mutual BLASTP best hits with an e-value threshold of 10<sup>‚àí6</sup> and (2) a requirement that each pairwise protein alignment cover at least 60% of query length in both search directions. The amino acid sequences of each set of orthologs were aligned using ClustalW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b050">50</xref>] and processed with Gblocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b051">51</xref>].</p>
        <p><italic>CPS</italic> loci in the five intestinal Bacteroidetes genomes were defined with the following criteria. First, an intact <italic>CPS</italic> locus included a <italic>UpxY</italic> homolog (as annotated) and a number of downstream genes on the same strand. These downstream genes included those that encoded functions related to surface polysaccharide synthesis (such as glycosyltransferases, carbohydrate export proteins, epimerases, glycoside hydrolases, etc.), conserved hypothetical proteins, or hypothetical proteins. Second, the 5‚Ä≤ boundary of each locus was determined by the <italic>UpxY</italic> homolog. Third, the 3‚Ä≤ end of each locus generally was positioned where switch of coding strand occurred. Alternatively, the 3‚Ä≤ end of the locus was positioned where downstream genes on the same strand encoded functions that were defined, but unrelated, to capsular polysaccharide synthesis (e.g., rRNA/tRNA and two-component signaling systems). However, the 3‚Ä≤ end of the locus was extended if the coding strand was disrupted by a single hypothetical protein (to accommodate possible annotation errors), or a mobile element composed of one or multiple genes.</p>
        <p>GO categories and InterPro ID were assigned using InterProScan release 12.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b013">13</xref>]. The number of genes in each genome assigned to each GO term, or its parents in the hierarchy (according to the ontology description available as of June 6, 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b012">12</xref>]), were totaled. All terms assigned to at least ten genes in a given genome were tested for overrepresentation, and all terms with a total of ten genes across all tested genomes were tested for underrepresentation. Significantly over- and underrepresented genes were identified using a binomial comparison with the indicated reference set. To control for differences in the specificity of gene prediction, genes that could not be assigned to a GO category were excluded from the reference sets. A correction was then applied to each distinct set of tests (e.g., over- or underrepresentation in a genome) to achieve a false discovery rate of 0.05 for each set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b052">52</xref>].

        <p><italic>Identifying classes of genes that were potentially laterally transferred or otherwise under selection in the gut Bacteroidetes.</italic> We identified genes that were laterally acquired and probably selected for after the divergence of gut Bacteroidetes species, and thus potentially involved in niche differentiation. These genes could either have been transferred into an individual species by LGT, or retained in that species despite being lost in all other related sequenced species. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to distinguish these two cases using the tree topology alone. We identified this class of genes by determining whether each gene met one of the following criteria. (1) No homologs were found in an augmented NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database (plus the proteins from the newly sequenced strains). This case indicated that either the gene has been lost in every other sequenced organism but retained in this genome, or that the gene was laterally transferred from an organism that is not represented in the database. (2) The only homologs found were from the same species. This case is the same as case (1), except that either the gene was sequenced multiple times and deposited in the database under separate records, or there are paralogs, i.e., multiple copies of the gene in the genome being analyzed. Both case (1) and (2) were termed ‚Äúnovel.‚Äù (3) The only homologs found are either from the same species or from other divisions or non-gut Bacteroidetes. This case indicates that the sequence is in this genome, and also in the genome of distantly related organisms, but not in the closely related gut Bacteroidetes genomes that have been completely sequenced. This case also provides evidence that the gene was either transferred or retained despite loss in related organisms. (4) The gene is more closely related to genes from other divisions or to non-gut Bacteroidetes than it is to other gut Bacteroidetes that are in the tree, and parsimony analysis indicates that the direction of transfer was into rather than out of the genome. This pattern is most consistent with LGT, although differential gene loss cannot in principle be ruled out (however, differences in composition between this class of genes and the rest of the genome provide compelling supporting evidence). Both cases (3) and (4) above were termed ‚Äúlaterally transferred‚Äù (LGT).</p>
        <p><italic>Genomes.</italic> We carried out the analysis on six different genomes: <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacteroides vulgatus</named-content> ATCC 8482 and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacteroides distasonis</named-content> ATCC 8503, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacteroides fragilis</named-content> NCTC 9343 (NC_0023338), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacteroides fragilis</named-content> YCH 46 (NC_006347), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</named-content> ATCC 29148 (NC_004663), and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Porphyromonas gingivalis</named-content> W83 (NC_002950).</p>
        <p><italic>Finding homologs.</italic> For each gene in each genome, we identified potential homologs using PSI-BLAST against NCBI's nr protein database. In order to use all of the available data for the Bacteroidetes and their relatives, we augmented this database with proteins predicted by Glimmer (v. 2.0) from draft genomes in the Bacteroidetes group that were available at NCBI. These additional genomes included <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Prevotella ruminicola</named-content> 23 (The Institute for Genomic Research; TIGR; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tigr.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.tigr.org</ext-link>), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Prevotella intermedia</named-content> 17 (TIGR), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Pelodictyon phaeoclathratiforme</named-content> BU-1 (Deptment of Energy‚ÄìJoint Genome Institute [DOE-JGI]; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgi.doe.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://www.jgi.doe.gov</ext-link>), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Pelodictyon luteolum</named-content> DSM 273 (DOE-JGI), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Chlorobium phaeobacteroides</named-content> DSM 266 (DOE-JGI), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Chlorobium limicola</named-content> DSM 245 (DOE-JGI), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Chlorobium chlorochromatii</named-content> CaD3 (DOE-JGI), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. forsythus</named-content> (TIGR), and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. fragilis</named-content> 638R (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>To find the top BLAST hits using the most stringent e-value threshold possible, we used a multistep PSI-BLAST. In the first PSI-BLAST iteration, we used an e-value threshold of 10<sup>‚àí50</sup> or lower. If fewer than 50 hits were found, we used the hits to make a profile for a subsequent PSI-BLAST that was four orders of magnitude less stringent (i.e., with an e-value of 10<sup>‚àí46</sup>). We repeated this procedure, increasing the e-value by a factor of 10<sup>‚àí4</sup> at each iteration, until either 50 hits were found or, after 12 iterations, the maximum allowed e-value of 10<sup>‚àí6</sup> was reached. To remove from consideration sequences that were significant only because of a conserved domain rather than similarity over the whole gene, we excluded genes that differed from the length of the query sequence by more than 30%. We also omitted hits that contained gaps greater than 50 amino acids in length or that contained gaps at greater than 50% of the positions after performing a multiple sequence alignment with the other sequences in the set.</p>
        <p><italic>Making phylogenetic trees.</italic> We performed multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b055">55</xref>], omitting sequences that were poorly aligned to the query sequence as described above. We used this alignment to make a neighbor-joining tree using ClustalW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b050">50</xref>]. We used bootstrapping to collapse nodes that were not statistically supported. Specifically, we randomly resampled columns from the alignment 100 times and made new neighbor-joining trees with ClustalW. We collapsed into polytomies all nodes in the original tree that were recovered in fewer than 70% of the bootstrap replicates.</p>
        <p><italic>Assigning taxonomy information to sequences.</italic> We parsed the NCBI taxonomy database and used it to assign division and genus information for each PSI-BLAST hit in the phylogenetic tree. Sequences that could not be assigned to any particular division were removed from the tree. We also removed nematode and arthropod genomes because we found that these often provided close hits to the Bacteroidetes genomes. We expect that these bacteria-to-eukaryote hits actually arise because gut and/or salivary gland bacteria contaminated the DNA preparations used for genomic sequencing. We also used the genus annotations in the taxonomy to determine whether sequences from the Bacteroidetes division were from the gut. We assigned sequences as gut Bacteroidetes if they were in the genera <italic>Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Tannerella, Dysgonomonas,</italic> or <italic>Bacteroides,</italic> and as non-gut Bacteroidetes otherwise.</p>
        <p><italic>Finding genes that are laterally transferred or differentially lost (under recent selective pressure).</italic> We used the bootstrap neighbor-joining trees to identify genes that met any of the four criteria described above. We first marked genes ‚Äúnovel‚Äù if the PSI-BLAST protocol returned only the query gene, indicating that they met criterion (1), or if all of the genes in the tree were from the same species, indicating that they met criterion (2). We assigned each sequence to a species using the NCBI taxonomy. If genes from other species were present in the tree, we used the following algorithm. (1) Start at the query sequence. (2) Step back in tree until a bootstrap-supported node containing sequences from a different species is found. If this node has, as descendants, sequences from other gut Bacteroidetes only, mark the gene as not laterally transferred (not selected for). If the node has, as descendants, sequences from both gut Bacteroidetes and other divisions or non-gut Bacteroidetes, mark the gene as unresolved. If the node has, as descendants, sequences from other divisions or non-gut Bacteroidetes only, mark the gene as laterally transferred (selected for) and proceed to the parsimony analysis. (3) Use parsimony analysis to determine whether a potential transfer would have been into the Bacteroidetes species (indicating that it is important for the gut), or out of the Bacteroidetes species into another lineage. Assign division information to all internal nodes in the tree using the Fitch parsimony algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b023">23</xref>]. These assignments minimize the number of transfers between divisions needed to explain the distribution of divisions in the modern sequences. If the query sequence is surrounded by many sequences from unrelated divisions, the parsimony analysis will indicate that the most likely event was a transfer into the species. As noted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050156-sd001">Text S1</xref> (Overview of Strategy Used to Identify LGT)<bold>,</bold> the method we used provides an automated technique for assigning taxon labels to individual gene trees. Specifically, we treat each taxon label (division labels, ‚Äúgut Bacteroidetes‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-gut Bacteroidetes‚Äù) as a character state, and use the Fitch parsimony algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b023">23</xref>] to infer the ancestral state at each node. We are not using this method in the sense of a formal evolutionary model of taxon switching, but as a heuristic that recaptures the intuition that a phylogenetic tree with a clade leading to sequences from one taxon that sprouts from within a clade leading to sequences from a completely different taxon probably represents a LGT event, even if the inner clade is represented by more sequences. This type of strategy has been widely applied both manually and computationally to detect lineage-specific transfers (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b056">56</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b058">58</xref>]), and is related to a method used in studies of host‚Äìparasite co-speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050156-b059">59</xref>], a problem that is mathematically equivalent to LGT detection.</p>

        <title>SusC/SusD alignments.</title>
        <p>Pairs of genes encoding SusC and SusD paralogs were identified in the Bacteroidetes genome sequences by performing individual BLASTP searches against each genome using amino acid sequences of previously annotated SusC and SusD paralogs as queries. The low-scoring hits from each search (e-values between 10<sup>‚àí4</sup> and 10<sup>‚àí10</sup>) were themselves used as BLASTP queries to reveal more divergent putative paralogs in each genome. This process was repeated until no new paralogs were identified. Lists of putative SusC and SusD paralogs were compared for each species. Paralogs were included in subsequent ClustalW analysis based on the requirement that each had a separately predicted, adjacent partner. This process was instrumental in excluding related TonB-dependent hemin, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and iron-siderophore receptors from the list of putative SusC paralogs. The resulting dataset included 374 paralog pairs: 102 in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron,</italic> 69 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. fragilis</named-content> NCTC 9343, 65 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. fragilis</named-content> YCH 46, 80 in <italic>B. vulgatus,</italic> 54 in <italic>B. distasonis,</italic> and four in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">P. gingivalis</named-content>.
