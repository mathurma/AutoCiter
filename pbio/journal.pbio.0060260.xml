        <p>As the nervous system develops, there is an inherent variability in the connections formed between differentiating neurons. Despite this variability, neural circuits form that are functional and remarkably robust. One way in which neurons deal with variability in their inputs is through compensatory, homeostatic changes in their electrical properties. Here, we show that neurons also make compensatory adjustments to their structure. We analysed the development of dendrites on an identified central neuron (aCC) in the late <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo at the stage when it receives its first connections and first becomes electrically active. At the same time, we charted the distribution of presynaptic sites on the developing postsynaptic arbor. Genetic manipulations of the presynaptic partners demonstrate that the postsynaptic dendritic arbor adjusts its growth to compensate for changes in the activity and density of synaptic sites. Blocking the synthesis or evoked release of presynaptic neurotransmitter results in greater dendritic extension. Conversely, an increase in the density of presynaptic release sites induces a reduction in the extent of the dendritic arbor. These growth adjustments occur locally in the arbor and are the result of the promotion or inhibition of growth of neurites in the proximity of presynaptic sites. We provide evidence that suggest a role for the postsynaptic activity state of protein kinase A in mediating this structural adjustment, which modifies dendritic growth in response to synaptic activity. These findings suggest that the dendritic arbor, at least during early stages of connectivity, behaves as a homeostatic device that adjusts its size and geometry to the level and the distribution of input received. The growing arbor thus counterbalances naturally occurring variations in synaptic density and activity so as to ensure that an appropriate level of input is achieved.</p>

          <p>As the nervous system develops, an intricate web of connections forms between nerve cells, leading to the assembly of signalling networks that are capable of complex computations. However, the number and strength of connections formed between nerve cells varies. We ask how nerve cells deal with this variability so that the circuits they form are nicely matched to the functions they perform. Nerve cells are known to adjust their sensitivity to compensate for changes in the strengths of inputs they receive from other cells. In this study, we have identified a structural counterpart to this compensatory mechanism, and find that developing nerve cells respond to variation in the number of connections they receive by adjusting the size of their receiving structures (known as dendrites). Working with the same nerve cell in different embryos, we show that this cell reduces the size of its dendrites as the number of connections increases while allowing its dendrites to grow more extensively if inputs are reduced. These findings suggest that, at least during the early stages of wiring the nervous system, nerve cells regulate the growth of their dendrites, to compensate for variability and attain an optimal number of connections.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>It is known that synapse formation on central neurons is subject to some degree of variability. This variability includes the positioning of synapses, their numbers, density, and strength. Despite the stochastic nature of the input that neurons receive, in normal circumstances, neural circuits are able to cope with the intrinsic variability of their connectivity and perform their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b001">1</xref>]. The robustness of these systems is a remarkable property. However, we have relatively little knowledge about how it is achieved. The work that we present here is intended to gain new insights into how neurons compensate for changes in the level, distribution, and density of the presynaptic input they receive. One attractive hypothesis is that neurons might actively modify the extent of their dendritic arbors to compensate for naturally occurring variations in synaptic input.</p>
      <p>The relationship between synaptic input and dendritic development has been extensively investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b002">2</xref>]. However, there is no clear agreement about the role of synaptic input in controlling arbor growth. In some cases, the arrival of synaptic input has been shown to induce an increase in postsynaptic dendritic elaboration. In these instances, the synaptic input would act as a trophic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b005">5</xref>]. Other authors, however, have reached different conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b011">11</xref>], suggesting that the arrival of presynaptic input could act as a stop-growing or stabilization signal for the postsynaptic dendritic arbor. Comparing these different studies is difficult because many of them have been carried out in different systems and at different developmental stages. In addition, interpretations of the data are complicated by the fact that the results summarize the average effect of synaptic input on a more or less heterogeneous cohort of neurons rather than identified postsynaptic neurons.</p>
      <p>One way of analyzing the role of presynaptic input in shaping the postsynaptic dendritic arbor would be to focus repeatedly, and under different experimental conditions, on the same developing neuron. At the same time, since synaptic contacts are likely to regulate dendritic growth, it would be important to be able to visualize not only the dendrites, but also the presynaptic contacts on them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b013">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>For these reasons, we decided to investigate the effect of synaptic activity and synaptic distribution on the growing dendritic arbor of a single identifiable neuron in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, namely the aCC motor neuron. This system, in comparison to vertebrate models, has the advantage of relying on the phenotypic analysis of a well-defined postsynaptic cell for which the developmental stage can be accurately determined, the synaptic input quantified, and whose presynaptic partners can be genetically manipulated.</p>
      <p>Although a number of studies have focused on the genetic control of dendritic arbor development, the role of presynaptic activity in regulating the growth and branching of postsynaptic partner dendrites in <italic>Drosophila</italic> remains a largely unexplored question. Studies of the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system, however, suggest that visual activity regulates the volume of presynaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b014">14</xref>], but does not impinge on postsynaptic dendritic arbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b015">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>The development of the electrical properties of the aCC motor neuron has been characterised in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b016">16</xref>]. It is therefore possible to correlate the development of the dendritic arbor morphology with the acquisition of electrical characteristics. The only known excitatory inputs that the aCC motor neuron receives during embryogenesis are cholinergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b017">17</xref>], and the set of presynaptic cholinergic neurons can be manipulated genetically using the Gal4/UAS system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b019">19</xref>]. We used this system to investigate in detail how the dendritic morphology of a single neuron changes as it develops, when the activity level and/or the density of its synaptic input are altered.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that the development of the dendritic arbor is tightly regulated by the synaptic input received. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence in <italic>Drosophila</italic> of dendritic remodelling in response to presynaptic activity. We show that abolishing presynaptic neurotransmitter synthesis or release results in an increase in dendritic complexity and in an increase of dendritic extension in a window of time that coincides with the onset of the first recordable excitatory postsynaptic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b016">16</xref>]. On the other hand, an increase in presynaptic density induces the opposite effect, resulting in a reduced dendritic arbor compared to controls.</p>
      <p>The dendritic rearrangements that we observe in the course of these manipulations appear to occur locally, affecting branches in the proximity of synaptic sites. Through a survey of candidate genes, we were able to identify protein kinase A (PKA) signalling in the postsynaptic cell as the molecular pathway that mediates these activity-dependent dendritic rearrangements. These findings suggest that the dendritic arbor, at least during the initial stage of connectivity, behaves as a homeostatic structure that adjusts its geometry to compensate for changes in the activity or density of presynaptic release sites.</p>

        <title>Development of the aCC Dendritic Arbor</title>
        <p>The aCC motor neuron can be identified in abdominal hemisegments of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval ventral nerve cord (VNC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b020">20</xref>]. The precision and the ease with which aCC can be located and manipulated make it a good model for studying dendritic development. In order to understand the dynamics of dendritic arbor growth, we followed the development of aCC over time, focusing on the developmental stages before and after connections first form on aCC, 14–18 h after egg laying (AEL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b016">16</xref>]. We injected the aCC neuron with Lucifer Yellow, and we then imaged it using confocal microscopy. We used custom-made software (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details) to reconstruct dendritic arbors and obtain quantitative data about their geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b023">23</xref>].</p>
        <p>From 14–16 h AEL, the length of the dendritic arbor increases linearly with an average growth rate of 23 ± 2 μm per hour (tree length at 14 h: 45 ± 7 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 8; 15 h: 69 ± 3 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 9; and 16 h: 90 ± 5 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g001">Figure 1</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g001">1</xref>F). Between 16 and 18 h AEL, growth diverges from a linear increase as the average extension rate decreases by about 43% (13 ± 4 μm per hour; tree length at 17 h: 99 ± 8 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 8; and 18 h: 115 ± 7 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Interestingly, 16 h AEL is the first stage at which evoked postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) can be recorded from aCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b016">16</xref>]. It seemed therefore possible that the onset of electrical activity might be the cause of the reduced rate of dendritic growth as of 16 h AEL, and we decided to investigate this further.</p>

        <title>A lack of Presynaptic Neurotransmitter Synthesis Induces Overgrowth of the Postsynaptic Dendritic Arbor</title>
        <p>Since cholinergic neurons provide the only known excitatory input to <italic>Drosophila</italic> motor neurons in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b016">16</xref>], we first analyzed the effect of the lack of neurotransmitter (synthesis) in the cholinergic neurons on the development of the aCC dendritic arbor. Acetyl choline is not synthesized in animals mutant for choline acetyl transferase (<italic>Cha</italic><sup>l13</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b024">24</xref>], which are therefore immobile and unable to hatch. We charted the development of aCC dendritic arborisations in animals homozygous for the null mutation <italic>Cha</italic><sup>l13</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b024">24</xref>]. In <italic>Cha</italic> mutant embryos, we find that the development of the aCC dendritic arbor proceeds normally until 16 h AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). However, in the interval between 16 to 18 h AEL, <italic>Cha</italic> mutants, unlike controls, fail to reduce the rate of dendritic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). As a result, at 18 h AEL, the extent of the aCC dendritic arbor is increased by about 26% in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants as compared to controls (from 115 ± 7 μm in control animals, <italic>n</italic> = 13; to 145 ± 14 μm in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants, <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>A with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). We conclude that in the window of development, when in normal embryos acetyl choline–dependent excitation of aCC first begins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b016">16</xref>] and the rate of dendritic growth declines, the absence of neurotransmitter in presynaptic neurons allows postsynaptic growth to continue linearly at an undiminished constant rate. These findings suggest that the aCC dendritic arbor reacts to the loss of synaptic input by increasing in size. A consequence of this increase in overall dendritic length is that it allows the dendritic arbor to explore a larger portion of the neuropile than in normal animals. In fact, we observe that in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants, the dendritic arbor of aCC extends into regions of the neuropile that are not normally invaded in control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, arrowhead). This change in the dendritic distribution is also confirmed by the shift of the peak in the Sholl analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>F).</p>

        <title>Blocking Evoked Presynaptic Neurotransmitter Release Also Induces Overgrowth of the Postsynaptic Dendritic Arbor</title>
        <p>We next investigated whether the dendritic phenotype observed in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants is indeed due to the silencing of the cholinergic population presynaptic to aCC or simply reflects a generic developmental defect caused by the absence of acetyl choline from such embryos. To this end, we specifically blocked evoked presynaptic release of neurotransmitter by targeting expression of tetanus toxin light chain (TNT-G) to cholinergic neurons using the GAL4/UAS system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b025">25</xref>]. We found that the growth of the aCC dendritic arbor in these embryos did not differ from that observed in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants: the length of the aCC dendritic arbor is increased significantly with respect to controls (115 ± 7 μm) in embryos that are <italic>Cha-GAL4; UAS-TNT-G</italic> (from hereon abbreviated as <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic>; 149 ± 10 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 10; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>A with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), but is comparable to that seen in the <italic>Cha</italic> mutants (149 ± 10 μm in <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 10; <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). As is the case in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants, the arbor also explores a larger portion of the neuropile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>F).</p>
        <p>Next, we sought to confirm that these effects on the aCC dendritic arbor are indeed due to blocking evoked neurotransmitter release in the subset of cholinergic neurons rather than a secondary consequence of general nerve cord development under these conditions. For instance, it has been reported that blocking evoked activity throughout the entire nervous system can impinge on the condensation of the VNC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b027">27</xref>], which could lead to enlarged dendritic trees as we observe in the above manipulations. We therefore measured nerve cord condensation in <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic> embryos 18 h AEL and found this to be normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060260-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Taken together, these data suggest that the overgrowth of the postsynaptic arbor that we observed in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants is a consequence of the absence of evoked presynaptic neurotransmitter release.</p>

        <title>Neurons Have Cell-Specific Programmes of Dendritic Growth and Branching on Which Presynaptic Input Impinges Quantitatively, but Not Qualitatively</title>
        <p>The expansion of the aCC dendritic arbor, which results from an absence of evoked presynaptic neurotransmitter release, could be achieved in more than one way. One strategy would be an acceleration of the normal “programme of growth”: increasing the average growth rate of dendritic neurites while maintaining the normal frequency at which they branch. Alternatively, the same outcome of an enlarged dendritic tree could also be generated by changing the relationship between growth and branching, for instance, by increasing the rate at which dendritic neurites branch (and hence multiply) without altering their rate of extension. To understand how neurons adjust their dendritic arbors in response to alterations in input, we sought to distinguish between these alternative strategies. To do so, we asked what the relationship is between dendritic growth and branching. For the aCC neuron, there is a strong linear relation between dendritic tree length and number of branch points in control animals (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.75, <italic>F</italic>-value = 33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 13). In animals from which presynaptic input had been removed (<italic>Cha</italic> mutants and <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic>), this linear relation between tree length and branch points still holds (<italic>Cha</italic>: <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.64, <italic>F</italic>-value = 11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic>: <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.65, <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>F</italic>-value = 11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 10). Moreover, aCC arbors in the three genotypes (control, <italic>Cha</italic> mutants, and <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic>) are comparable in the average ratios between tree length and branch point number, and therefore have similar linear regression coefficients (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, one-way ANOVA). This suggests that the ratio of dendritic length and number of branch points, i.e., the frequency of branching events per unit dendritic length, is an autonomous property of the aCC neuron that is not significantly altered by changes in presynaptic input. The extra dendritic growth observed in the absence of presynaptic input is therefore generated by the normal programme of (relationship between) growth and branching, which fails to decelerate between 16 and 18 h AEL under these conditions, as would be the case in the wild type.</p>
        <p>It is conceivable that we observed a constant ratio between tree length and branch numbers under different experimental conditions because it reflects mechanical or cell biological constraints. If this were the case, then other neurons would be predicted to have the same ratio of tree length to branch number as aCC. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the arborisation pattern of another motor neuron, RP1. The RP1 motor neuron also shows a linear relation between tree length and branch points (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.93, <italic>F</italic>-value = 25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 5). However, in the case of RP1, the ratio between tree length and branch points is significantly different from that observed for aCC (compare the two average tree-length/branch-point ratios in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g003">Figure 3</xref>F, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, unpaired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, no equal variance assumed).</p>

        <p>We conclude therefore that different neurons generate arbors with different intrinsic relationships between tree length and branch points.

We therefore sought to further our analysis by characterising the distribution of presynaptic sites formed on the aCC dendritic arbor, which is initially innervated, apparently exclusively, by cholinergic interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b017">17</xref>].

In addition, we visualised as absolute reference points in the neuropile a set of axon bundles by anti-fasciclin II (FasII) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). We then used custom-made software (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) to calculate from confocal image stacks of labelled specimens the areas of reconstructed aCC dendritic arbors closely apposed (within a 300-nm radius) by synaptotagmin-GFP puncta of cholinergic presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g004">Figure 4</xref>E) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b022">22</xref>]. From hereon, we consider synaptotagmin-GFP puncta within a 300-nm radius of the dendritic arbor as indicative of presynaptic sites.

        <title>Increased Density of Presynaptic Sites Induces a Compensatory Decrease in Postsynaptic Arbor Size</title>
        <p>Our findings show that the absence of synaptic input (e.g., in <italic>Cha</italic> mutant or <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic> animals) induces an increase in dendritic arbor extension. This indicates that evoked neurotransmitter release acts as a stop-growing signal. This finding further suggests that the additional dendritic growth, which is induced by the absence of evoked neurotransmitter release, might be exploratory and represent a homeostatic mechanism that balances the growth of the dendritic arbor with the state of its connectivity. If this were the case, one would expect that increasing the density of synaptic sites (from which the stop-growing signal[s] originate) should induce the opposite effect, namely a reduction of dendritic arbor extension. To test this idea, we generated embryos in which the number of presynaptic sites on aCC was increased. At the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction, the number of presynaptic release sites formed by the motor neuron on the postsynaptic target muscle can be increased considerably by neuronal (presynaptic) overexpression of the deubiquitination enzyme fat-facets (Faf) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b030">30</xref>]. When we overexpressed <italic>faf</italic> in the cholinergic neurons (<italic>Cha::faf</italic>), we found that this manipulation caused an increase in the density of synapses formed on the aCC motor neuron. In order to obtain a quantitative readout of synaptic density, we measured the surface of cholinergic synapses on the aCC dendritic arbor and normalized this for arbor length (μm<sup>2</sup> of synaptic surface divided by μm of dendritic length). Overexpressing <italic>faf</italic> in cholinergic neurons does indeed significantly increase the density of presynaptic sites on the aCC dendritic arbor at 18 h AEL (in control animals, the synaptic density is 0.22 ± 0.03 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 12; in <italic>Cha</italic>::<italic>faf</italic>, 0.54 ± 0.07 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 10; <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).</p>

        <p>We next asked how the dendritic arbor responds to this increase in synaptic density.

        <p>These results are consistent with the notion that a homeostatic mechanism operates to match the extent of dendritic growth to the availability of presynaptic sites. Abolishing synaptic activity, as shown in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants and when TNT-G is expressed presynaptically, induces an increase in dendritic arbor extension. On the other hand, an increase in the density of presynaptic sites induces the opposite effect, namely a decrease of arbor size.</p>

        <title>The Postsynaptic Dendritic Arbor Responds to an Increase in Density of Presynaptic Sites Rather Than to Elevated Neurotransmitter Release</title>
        <p>The previous experiment shows that an increase in the density of presynaptic sites induces a reduction of the postsynaptic dendritic arbor extension. The cause of this effect could be that a higher density of presynaptic sites might lead to elevated amounts of neurotransmitter being released onto the arbor as a whole. In this case, the dendritic arbor would respond to overall levels of neurotransmitter across its entirety. Alternatively, dendritic size might be regulated locally, at each point of synaptic contact. In this second scenario, the critical point of dendritic growth regulation is the increase in the number of sites where neurotransmission can feed back on neurite extension. In order to distinguish between these alternatives, we analyzed the morphology of the aCC dendritic arbor and the density of its presynaptic sites in embryos mutant for acetyl choline esterase (<italic>Ace</italic>). In these mutants, presynaptically released acetyl choline fails to be degraded. As a result, overall levels of neurotransmitter are elevated, and there is an increase in cholinergic neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b031">31</xref>]. Our analysis shows that the number of presynaptic sites contacting aCC and their distribution are unchanged in <italic>Ace</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). We could also not detect any significant change in the extent and morphology of aCC dendritic arbors (124 μm ± 14 μm, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g005">5</xref>D). These results show that increasing overall neurotransmitter levels, while leaving the density and distribution of presynaptic sites on the arbor unchanged, does not result in a growth adjustment of the dendritic arbor.</p>
        <p>We therefore conclude that it is the density of sites where neurotransmitter release occurs that regulates dendritic tree size, rather than overall levels of neurotransmitter.</p>

        <title>Synaptic Sites Exert Local Inhibitory Effects on Dendritic Growth and Branching</title>
        <p>We have shown that the growth response of the postsynaptic dendritic arbor is regulated by the density of presynaptic sites. The implication of this finding is that dendritic growth is modulated locally at synaptic sites and that therefore the arrangement of synapses on the arbor might be important for shaping the dendritic geometry. To investigate this further, we asked whether, and to what extent, the inhibition of growth caused by presynaptic neurotransmitter release is spatially restricted to the particular neurite receiving the synaptic contact. We began our analysis with control animals, identifying all neurites of the dendritic arbor that are contacted by presynaptic sites. Next, for each branching order, we calculated and compared the dendritic length downstream of the following types of neurites: (1) “synaptic neurites” (those contacted by presynaptic sites); (2) “nonsynaptic sister neurites” (neurites originating form the same parental branch as a “synaptic neurite,” but not contacted by presynaptic sites); and (3) “other nonsynaptic neurites” in the arbor. We performed this analysis for the first five orders of the arbor. These comparisons show that both “synaptic” and “nonsynaptic sister neurites” have less dendritic length downstream than “other nonsynaptic neurites” of the same order (<italic>p</italic> &lt;&lt; 0.005 for orders 1–3; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for order 4–5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). This result further suggests that dendritic growth appears to be regulated locally at sites of putative synaptic contacts.</p>

        <p>To investigate the role of evoked neurotransmitter release in this local regulation of dendritic growth, we analysed aCC dendritic trees in animals in which evoked release was blocked by presynaptic expression of tetanus toxin (<italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic>). In both control and <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic> animals, neurites contacted by presynaptic sites are comparable in length. The dendritic length downstream of these neurites is significantly shorter than that of “other nonsynaptic neurites” of the same order (in <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic>, <italic>p</italic> &lt;&lt; 0.005 for orders 1–3; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for order 4, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 for order 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). This suggests that dendritic extension is inhibited locally by the presence of presynaptic sites, though independent of their ability to release neurotransmitter.</p>
        <p>However, when comparing the “nonsynaptic sister neurites between <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic> animals and controls, we find that a block of evoked neurotransmission has an effect. The dendritic length downstream of nonsynaptic sister neurites is significantly longer in <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic> animals than in controls (<italic>p</italic> &lt;&lt; 0.005 for all orders; compare red box-plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g006">6</xref>D). In <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic> animals, nonsynaptic sister neurites are also longer than synaptic neurites of the same order (<italic>p</italic> &lt;&lt; 0.005 for all orders, compare red and green box-plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). This indicates that the presence of presynaptic sites inhibits growth of neighbouring (sister) neurites in an activity-dependent manner.</p>
        <p>In summary, these results highlight two interesting features. First, neurites contacted by presynaptic sites extend less than nonsynaptic neurites. This inhibitory effect on these dendritic segments is not dependent on evoked neurotransmitter release since it is present in both control and <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic> animals. Second, another inhibitory effect of synaptic sites on dendritic growth exists, which extends to neighbouring (sister) neurites. Interestingly, this type of inhibition requires evoked neurotransmitter release, since this is absent in <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic> animals.</p>

        <title>Dendritic Growth Is Inhibited by Contact with Presynaptic Terminals Independent of Neurotransmitter Release</title>
        <p>These results suggest that the local inhibition of dendritic growth at the site where putative synapses form depends on mechanisms other than evoked release. This hypothesis predicts that the postsynaptic dendritic arbor would respond with overgrowth to the absence of contact with presynaptic partner terminals. To test this, we sought to prevent the normal formation of contacts between pre- and postsynaptic partners by shifting the presynaptic terminals of cholinergic neurons to a more medial portion of the neuropile. To do so, we expressed in the cholinergic cells (with <italic>Cha-GAL4</italic>) the chimeric Robo<sup>ectodomain</sup>-Frazzled<sup>cytoplasmic</sup> guidance receptor, which has been shown to induce a strong medial shift of axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b032">32</xref>]. The expression of this chimeric receptor in the cholinergic population does indeed induce a shift of cholinergic synaptic terminals out of the lateral and into the medial neuropile (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g007">Figure 7</xref>M with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g007">7</xref>N and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g007">Figure 7</xref>O with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g007">7</xref>P).</p>

        <p>So as to be able to differentiate clearly between contact- and activity-dependent effects, we focused on aCC arbors in 16-h-old specimens. At this stage, presynaptic sites can be detected on the aCC dendrites in positions resembling those of more mature arbors. However, these synapses are largely immature, as evoked synaptic currents are only just beginning to occur in aCC at 16 h AEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b016">16</xref>], and a lack of transmission at this stage fails to induce a postsynaptic response of dendritic overgrowth, as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>We find that shifting the presynaptic cholinergic terminals into the medial part of the neuropile results in a significant reduction in presynaptic sites on the aCC dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g007">Figure 7</xref>L).</p>
        <p>Next, we compared the extent of the dendritic arbor at 16 h in three different genotypes: control condition (<italic>Cha::SytGFP</italic>), <italic>Cha</italic> mutants (<italic>Cha</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ; <italic>Cha::SytGFP</italic>), and in animals in which the Robo<sup>ectodomain</sup>-Frazzled<sup>cytoplasmic</sup> chimeric receptor was expressed in the cholinergic population (<italic>Cha::SytGFP::Robo-Frazzled</italic>). As we have shown before, at 16 h, the extent of the aCC arbor in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants is comparable to that of control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g007">Figure 7</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g007">7</xref>Q), demonstrating that up to this stage, dendritic growth is not obviously modulated by the presence or absence of neurotransmitter. However, displacing the presynaptic terminals causes a significant increase in the dendritic arborisation of aCC with respect to both control and <italic>Cha</italic> mutant animals: tree length in controls, 89.5 ± 5 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 11; in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants, 81 ± 6.5 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 8; in <italic>Cha::Robo-Frazzled</italic>, 123 ± 7 μm, <italic>n</italic> = 9; <italic>p</italic>(control, <italic>Cha</italic>) &gt; 0.5; <italic>p</italic>(control, <italic>Cha::Robo-Frazzled</italic>) = 0.02; <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Cha</italic>, <italic>Cha::Robo-Frazzled</italic>) = 0.009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g007">Figure 7</xref>L–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g007">7</xref>Q). We find that this effect persists at least until 18 h AEL: tree length in controls, 115 ± 7 μm; in <italic>Cha::Robo-Frazzled</italic>, 146 ± 5 μm; in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants 145 ± 11 μm; <italic>p</italic>(control, <italic>Cha::Robo-Frazzled</italic>) = 0.009; <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Cha</italic>, <italic>Cha::Robo-Frazzled</italic>) &gt; 0.05.</p>
        <p>The comparison at 16 h between <italic>Cha</italic> mutants and animals with displaced presynaptic cholinergic terminals (<italic>Cha::Robo<sup>ectodomain</sup>-Frazzled<sup>cytoplasmic</sup></italic>) indicates (1) that simple contact between pre- and postsynaptic partners has an inhibitory effect on the growth of the postsynaptic dendritic arbor, and (2) that this effect is not due to, and therefore independent of, neurotransmitter release. By 18 h AEL, the effect of displacing presynaptic terminals has become less pronounced and is comparable to the increase in dendritic tree size that results when neurotransmission is absent (e.g., in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants).</p>
        <p>It has been suggested that alterations to the Slit distribution affect dendritic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b033">33</xref>]. The set of FasII fascicles has been used as a standard indicator for Slit signalling in the VNC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b035">35</xref>], and few <italic>Cha-GAL4</italic> positive axons contribute to this set (unpublished data). Quantifications show that the distribution of the FasII fascicles is unaltered between <italic>Cha::Robo-Frazzled</italic> and control animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060260-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). This suggests that the Slit distribution is not affected by our manipulations and that the dendritic phenotype that we observe is indeed the result of the shift of the presynaptic partners.</p>
        <p>On the basis of these observations, we speculate that the local inhibition of growth evident in neurites with presynaptic sites is contact mediated. In contrast, the inhibitory effect that extends to the nonsynaptic sister neurites is likely to be transmitter dependent, since this inhibition is lost in the absence of evoked presynaptic release (<italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic>).</p>

        <title>Presynaptic Release of Neurotransmitter Signals through Postsynaptic Protein Kinase A Activation to Repress Dendritic Growth</title>
        <p>We have shown that presynaptic sites exert an “extended” inhibitory effect on the growth of neighbouring (sister) neurites and that this inhibition requires presynaptic release of neurotransmitter. However, the nature of the postsynaptic signals that mediate this effect is unclear. The activation of a number of postsynaptic signalling cascades has been proposed as a response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release. The best-characterised ones rely on Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry following synaptic excitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b036">36</xref>]. For aCC, alterations in synaptic input have been shown to induce rapid changes in its excitability that are mediated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b031">31</xref>]. We therefore asked whether PKA might also be involved in the regulation of dendritic growth in response to variations of presynaptic neurotransmitter release.</p>
        <p>In order to test this hypothesis, we first targeted expression of a dominant-negative regulatory subunit of PKA, <italic>PKAinh</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b037">37</xref>], to aCC using the <italic>RN2-GAL4</italic> line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b038">38</xref>]. This manipulation induces dendritic overgrowth similar to that observed in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants (tree length: 167.5 ± 16.1 μm, <italic>p</italic> (control) = 0.03, <italic>n</italic> = 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g008">Figure 8</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g008">8</xref>D). Next, we overexpressed a constitutively active form of PKA, <italic>PKAact</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b037">37</xref>]. Interestingly, this has no effect on the dendritic phenotype when overexpressed in aCC in otherwise wild-type animals (tree length: 105 μm ± 9 μm, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, <italic>n</italic> = 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g008">Figure 8</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g008">8</xref>D). Since PKA is probably downstream of several signalling pathways, the observation that overexpressing the dominant-negative form induces dendritic overgrowth does not in itself prove that PKA is acting downstream of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. To provide evidence on this point, we asked whether postsynaptic expression of the constitutively active form of PKA could rescue the dendritic overgrowth phenotype induced by the absence of neurotransmitter in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants. We find that <italic>PKAact</italic> overexpression in aCC does indeed fully rescue the postsynaptic overgrowth observed in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants (tree length: 112 μm ± 10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, <italic>n</italic> = 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g008">Figure 8</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g008">8</xref>D). This observation together with the fact that the overexpression of <italic>PKAact</italic> in otherwise wild-type animals does not induce a dendritic phenotype supports the idea that PKA signalling is part of the postsynaptic mediator of the dendritic morphological adjustments induced by presynaptic neurotransmitter release.</p>

        <title>Naturally Occurring Variations in the Density of Cholinergic Terminals in the Motor Neuropile Correlate with Variations in aCC Dendritic Arbor Extension</title>
        <p>We have used various genetic approaches to manipulate the synaptic input received by the aCC motor neuron. We have shown that in response, the aCC dendritic arbor modifies its dendritic morphology based on the density of active synaptic contacts. These findings suggest that in normal conditions, naturally occurring variations in the density of presynaptic cholinergic terminals in the motor neuropile might also be counterbalanced by homeostatic changes in the geometry of the aCC dendritic arbor.</p>
        <p>We put this prediction to the test.

          <p>Cartoons of postsynaptic dendrites (green), presynaptic partner neurons (magenta), and synaptic sites (yellow).</p>
          <p>(A) In the wild type, (synaptic) contacts by presynaptic terminals act locally to restrict growth of the contacted postsynaptic neurites. This effect is independent of activity. Synaptic input exerts a second “extended” inhibitory effect on neighbouring nonsynaptic sister neurites. This second effect is activity dependent and mediated through PKA signalling.</p>
          <p>(B) In the absence of presynaptic neurotransmitter release (e.g., in <italic>Cha</italic> mutant and <italic>Cha::TNT-G</italic> animals), there is no activity-dependent, PKA-mediated “extended” inhibition. As a result, nonsynaptic neurites adjacent to presynaptic sites can continue to grow. In contrast, growth of synaptic neurites remains repressed by local contact-meditated, activity-independent mechanisms. Regions of the dendritic arbor that lack presynaptic input explore the neuropile further.</p>
          <p>(C) Increasing the density of active presynaptic terminals (e.g., in <italic>Cha::faf</italic> animals) leads to less extended and elaborate postsynaptic dendritic arbors. Active presynaptic sites are in immediate reach of dendrites and, after establishing contact, exert local contact-mediated and “extended” activity-dependent inhibition of further dendritic growth.</p>
          <p>(D) Displacement of presynaptic partner terminals (e.g., in <italic>Cha::Robo-Frazzled</italic> animals) eliminates contact with the postsynaptic arbor and thereby also relieves both local and “extended” inhibition. As a result, the postsynaptic arbor responds with extended growth.</p>

      <p>These growth adjustments by the aCC arbor appear to operate sequentially at two levels. In the first instance, the dendritic arbor determines the presence or absence of presynaptic partners. This event is independent of presynaptic activity. It is also a local event that appears to affect primarily neurites receiving presynaptic sites, which act as a local stop-growing signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g010">Figure 10</xref>A). The second step depends on the activity of the synapse. In normal conditions, presynaptic sites are able to inhibit growth, both in synaptic neurites as well as neighbouring nonsynaptic sister neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g010">Figure 10</xref>A). Interestingly, the dendritic arbor does not measure the efficacy of synapses (since there is no significant change in arbor size in <italic>Ace</italic> mutants as compared to wild type; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g005">Figure 5</xref>D), but simply determines whether a synapse is active or not. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of there being a compensatory response to reduced efficacy. This phase of activity-dependent inhibition of dendritic growth is mediated by postsynaptic activation of PKA.</p>

        <title>Presynaptic Activity Modulates Dendritic Arbor Growth</title>
        <p>The morphology of dendrites is likely to be an important determinant of the connectivity state of a nervous system. It is not by chance that even in complex nervous systems, one of the most distinctive feature of different classes of neurons is probably the morphology of their dendritic arbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b039">39</xref>]. Indeed, the anatomical discrimination of different classes of neurons, based on their dendritic morphology, has often anticipated and predicted molecular, electrophysiological, and computational differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b046">46</xref>].</p>
        <p>Therefore, an appreciation of the logic governing the assembly of a nervous system must include an understanding of how dendritic morphology is acquired. Although many of the distinctive features that differentiate the dendritic morphologies of different classes of neurons are likely to be cell-autonomously and genetically determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b047">47</xref>], the effect of partner-derived cues, as we show here, can have a substantial impact in modulating these features. We initiated our investigation by analysing the effect of presynaptic transmission in shaping the morphology of the postsynaptic dendritic arbor. Previous studies on this issue have not reached a clear agreement on the role of activity in regulating dendritic growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b003">3</xref>]. Even though in some instances it has been reported that activity has no effect on regulating arbor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b048">48</xref>], in the majority of studies, activity emerges clearly as an essential modulator of dendritic remodelling. The main issue has been whether the incoming presynaptic input acts as a trophic factor that promotes arbor growth or whether it delivers a stop-growing signal. Unfortunately, with a few notable exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b006">6</xref>], many of these studies were carried out in different animals, in different neural populations, at different developmental stages, and by using different experimental approaches (genetic manipulation or pharmacological treatments), thus making it difficult to find a common theme in the results. As noted elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b003">3</xref>], one major source of variation that could explain the differences in the results of previous studies is likely to be the developmental stage at which manipulations were applied. For instance, a single class of tectal neurons in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles appears to respond in opposite ways to presynaptic input at different developmental stages. In immature neurons, presynaptic input acts as a growth-promoting signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b005">5</xref>], whereas in mature neurons, it acts as a stop-growing or stabilization signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b006">6</xref>]. In this study, we find no evidence for a growth-promoting effect of synaptic activity. Instead, we show that synaptic input inhibits dendritic growth starting from the earliest stages at which neurotransmission occurs (16–18 h AEL). Altering activity before the onset of evoked synaptic transmission causes no dendritic phenotype (14–16 h AEL). It appears that developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic motor neurons behave like mature tectal neurons in <italic>Xenopus</italic>.</p>
        <p>As very elegantly shown by Wu and Cline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b006">6</xref>], the difference in the effect obtained at different stages in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectal neurons nicely correlates with a change in their molecular characteristics. At later stages, when synaptic input acts as a stop-growing signal, the tectal neurons in <italic>Xenopus</italic> have acquired the ability to respond to local calcium increases via the activation of a calcium-dependent protein kinase CamKII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b006">6</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, aCC appears be sensitive to the activation state of a different protein kinase, PKA (which is also regulated, albeit indirectly, by intracellular calcium levels) throughout the interval of development that we have studied.</p>

        <title>Local Effects of Synaptic Input and Presynaptic Sites on Neurite Extension</title>
        <p>A great deal of attention has been given to global changes in postsynaptic activity and how these changes might regulate global dendritic growth. However, although this is an extremely interesting question, it is difficult to imagine how global variations in the state of activation of the whole dendritic arbor or the soma might contribute to fine-tuning the morphology of dendritic arbors. Far more compelling would be a system that was able to calculate and respond to local changes in activity levels. It is well known that calcium levels can be altered locally at the synaptic site following synaptic input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b051">51</xref>]. It is also known that changes in dendritic levels of calcium can induce dramatic changes in dendritic morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b051">51</xref>]. Nevertheless, there have been few investigations of how dendritic morphology might be altered locally by synaptic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b052">52</xref>].</p>
        <p>Because the system we use allows us to study a single identified postsynaptic neuron whose presynaptic input can be altered, we have been able to begin to address the issue of local versus global changes of dendritic morphology induced by synaptic activity. Analyzing the branching pattern of the dendritic arbor with respect to the position of its synaptic inputs highlights some interesting and unexpected features. By simply looking in wild-type animals, it is clear that neurites bearing presynaptic sites branch less than nonsynaptic neurites of the same arbor. Through experimental manipulation, we showed that this local inhibition of the growth and branching of synaptic neurites appears to be mediated by contact between pre- and postsynaptic partners and does not require evoked transmission. The lack of this contact-dependent inhibition of dendritic growth is already apparent when the terminals normally presynaptic to aCC are mistargeted before they can form functional synapses at 16 h AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060260-g010">Figure 10</xref>D). Moreover, this effect cannot be attributed to an interference with transmission, since <italic>Cha</italic> mutants of the same stage (16 h AEL) do not show this dendritic overgrowth phenotype. Loss of neurotransmitter release, on the other hand, can also induce an overgrowth of the postsynaptic dendritic arbor, though only after synapses would have been active for 2 h in normal conditions (i.e., 18 h AEL). We find that this neurotransmitter-dependent overgrowth is due to increased extension of nonsynaptic segments that are immediately adjacent to neurites receiving presynaptic sites. Thus, neurotransmitter release at the synaptic sites acts on the nonsynaptic sister neurites to inhibit their extension.</p>
        <p>We conclude that the geometry of the dendritic tree is regulated by two partner-dependent mechanisms. First, contact with presynaptic terminals locally inhibits dendritic growth and branching in an activity-independent fashion. A second inhibitory effect requires evoked presynaptic neurotransmitter release. It extends from these sites to the immediate proximity, affecting nonsynaptic sister branches. This second “neighbourhood effect” could be mediated by local increases in dendritic calcium levels.</p>

        <title>PKA Is a Mediator of Presynaptic Neurotransmitter Release</title>
        <p>Neurotransmission-dependent variations in intracellular calcium levels are an attractive mechanism that might implement activity-dependent local rearrangement of the dendritic arbor geometry. We therefore investigated the role of the protein kinase PKA in dendritic remodelling, as its activity is regulated directly or indirectly by calcium levels. PKA is activated by increases in the intracellular levels of cAMP. It has been shown that levels of cAMP are finely regulated by intracellular levels of calcium, which in turn respond to levels of presynaptic neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b053">53</xref>].</p>
        <p>PKA signalling in postsynaptic cells has been shown to mediate homeostatic responses. For instance, at the neuromuscular junction, postsynaptic PKA signalling modulates quantal size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b037">37</xref>], while centrally, it mediates homeostatic change in the electrical excitability of aCC neurons following alterations to presynaptic input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b031">31</xref>]. In this study, we show that PKA activity is also a potent modulator of dendritic morphology. We show that PKA signalling is probably downstream of presynaptic transmission mediating the inhibition of dendritic growth. Overexpression of a constitutively active form of PKA (<italic>PKAact</italic>) is able to rescue the dendritic overgrowth phenotype that ensues in the absence of presynaptic transmission in <italic>Cha</italic> mutants. However, overexpression of <italic>PKAact</italic> in aCC in control animals has no measurable effect on dendritic development, suggesting that PKA signalling operates to saturation under normal levels of synaptic input. Although neurotransmission is clearly one signal that regulates dendritic development through downstream PKA signalling, it is not necessarily the only one.</p>

      <sec id="s3d">
        <title>Structural Homeostasis</title>
        <p>The term <italic>homeostasis</italic> has classically been used to refer to compensatory variations in the electrical properties of neurons that tend to counterbalance changes in their synaptic input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b059">59</xref>]. We would like to propose here that neurons might combine the homeostatic regulation of electrical properties with compensatory structural adjustments of their dendritic geometry. We argue that variations in the morphology of aCC dendritic arbors represent such compensatory adjustment of dendritic growth and branching.</p>
        <p>Our experimental observations indicate that eliminating synaptic input induces a compensatory dendritic overgrowth in the postsynaptic neuron, whereas an increase in the density of active synapses induces the opposite effect. Interestingly, increasing the overall level of neurotransmitter released at presynaptic terminals without altering the density of presynaptic sites on the arbor does not induce compensatory adjustments of the postsynaptic arborisation. This suggests that the compensatory changes in dendritic arbor morphology that we observe act to compensate for variations in the density of active synaptic release sites rather than variations in the global state of dendritic or neuronal depolarization. This is in agreement with our observations that changes in dendritic morphology in response to changes in presynaptic input or synaptic density appear to be implemented locally rather than across the entire arbor. This structural homeostasis, therefore, seems to work on a local scale, allowing particular regions of the dendritic arbor to compensate for variation in their inputs while leaving other regions of the arbor substantially unchanged. This could be an effective mechanism for neurons that use distinct regions of their dendritic arbor to independently compute different inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b062">62</xref>].</p>
        <p>It will be interesting to understand whether electrical homeostasis and what we propose to be a structural homeostasis operate in concert to shape the postsynaptic response, or whether one or the other is preferentially deployed depending on the circumstances. At the moment, we are unable to answer this question, and more experiments are required.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, one can begin to envisage how PKA signalling in the context of electrical homeostasis might be integrated with the structural homeostasis that we have shown in this study. As shown by Richard Baines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060260-b031">31</xref>], postsynaptic overexpression of a constitutively active form of PKA induces a change in the electrical properties of aCC, resulting in a decrease in excitability. Overexpression of a PKA inhibitor, on the other hand, does not modulate the excitability of aCC. In this study, we describe a perfect mirror image of this situation, namely that the expression of a PKA inhibitor induces a dendritic overgrowth phenotype, while expression of a constitutively active form of PKA does not. Bringing these two lines of observations together suggests the following model: following a decrease in presynaptic input (and PKA signalling), the postsynaptic neuron expands its receptive field so as to increase the number of presynaptic sites that it contacts. In these circumstances, an increase in postsynaptic excitability would not be required. On the other hand, following an increase in presynaptic input, the postsynaptic neuron decreases its excitability (via increased PKA signalling) without the need to reduce its receptive field.</p>
        <p>We favour the view that electrical and structural homeostatic mechanisms might indeed be integrated by neurons. This would enable the cells to implement compensatory changes that resulted in adjustments to their electrical characteristics and dendritic geometry, so as to ensure that in an inherently variable environment an adequate pattern and level of connectivity and excitability is achieved.</p>
