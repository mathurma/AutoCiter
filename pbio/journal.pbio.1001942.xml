<p>Stress-responsive error-prone DNA polymerase genes transferred along with key symbiotic genes ease the evolution of a soil bacterium into a legume endosymbiont by accelerating adaptation of the recipient bacterial genome to its new plant host.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important mode of adaptation and diversification of prokaryotes and eukaryotes and a major event underlying the emergence of bacterial pathogens and mutualists. Yet it remains unclear how complex phenotypic traits such as the ability to fix nitrogen with legumes have successfully spread over large phylogenetic distances. Here we show, using experimental evolution coupled with whole genome sequencing, that co-transfer of <italic>imuABC</italic> error-prone DNA polymerase genes with key symbiotic genes accelerates the evolution of a soil bacterium into a legume symbiont. Following introduction of the symbiotic plasmid of <italic>Cupriavidus taiwanensis</italic>, the <italic>Mimosa</italic> symbiont, into pathogenic <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> we challenged transconjugants to become <italic>Mimosa</italic> symbionts through serial plant-bacteria co-cultures. We demonstrate that a mutagenesis <italic>imuABC</italic> cassette encoded on the <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> symbiotic plasmid triggered a transient hypermutability stage in <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> transconjugants that occurred before the cells entered the plant. The generated burst in genetic diversity accelerated symbiotic adaptation of the recipient genome under plant selection pressure, presumably by improving the exploration of the fitness landscape. Finally, we show that plasmid <italic>imuABC</italic> cassettes are over-represented in rhizobial lineages harboring symbiotic plasmids. Our findings shed light on a mechanism that may have facilitated the dissemination of symbiotic competency among α- and β-proteobacteria <italic>in natura</italic> and provide evidence for the positive role of environment-induced mutagenesis in the acquisition of a complex lifestyle trait. We speculate that co-transfer of complex phenotypic traits with mutagenesis determinants might frequently enhance the ecological success of HGT.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Horizontal gene transfer has an extraordinary impact on microbe evolution and diversification, by allowing exploration of new niches such as higher organisms. This is the case for rhizobia, a group of phylogenetically diverse bacteria that form a nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationship with most leguminous plants. While these arose through horizontal transfer of symbiotic plasmids, this in itself is usually unproductive, and full expression of the acquired traits needs subsequent remodeling of the genome to ensure the ecological success of the transfer. Here we uncover a mechanism that accelerates the evolution of a soil bacterium into a legume symbiont. We show that key symbiotic genes are co-transferred with genes encoding stress-responsive error-prone DNA polymerases that transiently elevate the mutation rate in the recipient genome. This burst in genetic diversity accelerates the symbiotic evolution process under selection pressure from the host plant. A more widespread involvement of plasmid mutagenesis cassettes in rhizobium evolution is supported by their overrepresentation in rhizobia-containing lineages. Our findings provide evidence for the role of environment-induced mutagenesis in the acquisition of a complex lifestyle trait and predict that co-transfer of complex phenotypic traits with mutagenesis determinants might help successful horizontal gene transfer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) drives bacterial ecological diversification by providing genomes with new genes and functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Lerat1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Gogarten1">[4]</xref>. Key changes in lifestyle can result from the acquisition by HGT of genes facilitating symbiosis, either mutualistic or parasitic, with eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Ochman2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Nakamura1">[6]</xref>. For example, the high virulence of <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> results directly from the acquisition of virulence factors in mobile genetic elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Buchrieser1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Waldor1">[8]</xref>. Mobile elements also confer traits that are involved in the establishment of mutualistic associations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Moran1">[9]</xref>. Many mobile genetic elements have narrow-host ranges and this favors horizontal transfer between closely related bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Thomas1">[10]</xref>. Transfer is also more likely to be successful when it concerns simple traits and takes place between closely related bacteria because this increases the probability of gene expression and integration in the host genetic background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Lercher1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Pal1">[12]</xref>. Nevertheless, genetic transfer of complex traits between very distantly related taxa has an important role in bacterial evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Cordero1">[13]</xref>. Transfer of complex traits is expected to lead to bursts of adaptation in the newly acquired traits. For example, acquisition of type 3 secretion systems by plant-associated pathogenic bacteria was followed by the replacement of the needle by pilus-like structures more adequate to interact with the plant cell wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Abby1">[14]</xref>. Yet the environmental and genetic factors that determine the evolutionary success of HGT remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Soil bacteria termed rhizobia are remarkable examples of bacteria that arose through HGT. Rhizobia are phylogenetically dispersed bacteria currently distributed in at least 13 saprophyte- and pathogen-containing genera of α- and β-proteobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-MassonBoivin1">[15]</xref>, which have evolved the environmentally essential function of fixing atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with legumes. Rhizobial mutualistic symbiosis with legumes is a complex process involving three main steps: nodule organogenesis, intracellular infection, and nitrogen fixation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-MassonBoivin1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Oldroyd1">[16]</xref>. This endosymbiosis is controlled by a large number of genes in both partners including a set of essential nodulation and nitrogen fixation bacterial genes clustered in mobile genetic elements such as symbiotic plasmids or genomic islands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Oldroyd1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Gibson1">[17]</xref>. Horizontal transfer of essential symbiotic genes has been key in the conversion of soil bacteria into mutualistic symbionts of legumes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Sullivan1">[18]</xref>. Although compared phylogenies of rhizobia and nodulation genes predict that symbiotic genes have been transferred over large phylogenetic distances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Moulin1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Aoki1">[21]</xref>, transfer alone in lab conditions is usually unproductive between evolutionary distant taxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Hirsch1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Marchetti1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>To get an insight into the evolutionary mechanisms that facilitated rhizobium diversification, we experimentally replayed the evolution of rhizobia. We introduced the symbiotic conjugative plasmid pRalta (0.5 Mb) of the <italic>Mimosa</italic> symbiont <italic>Cupriavidus taiwanensis</italic> into the plant pathogen <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> GMI1000 and used <italic>Mimosa</italic> to trap symbiotic variants of this still pathogenic and non nodulating ancestor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Marchetti1">[24]</xref>. Spontaneous nodulating variants of the chimeric <italic>Ralstonia</italic> GMI1000pRalta were then submitted to serial and parallel <italic>ex planta-in planta</italic> (<italic>Mimosa</italic>) passages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This alternation recapitulated the shifts between free-living and symbiotic lives that have shaped the natural evolution of rhizobia. Evolution was surprisingly fast since the first two major symbiotic steps, nodulation and intracellular infection, were not only activated but also dramatically improved over 17 cycles (∼400 generations) in all lineages (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g001">Figure 1A–1D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Marchetti1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Marchetti2">[26]</xref>. A first level of nodulation and infection capacity was reached via inactivation of regulatory or structural genes of the virulence pathway of the recipient genome, revealing that acquisition of symbiotic proficiency in phylogenetically distant bacterial lineages requires further recipient genome remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Marchetti1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Guan1">[25]</xref>.</p>

<title>Chimeric <italic>Ralstonia</italic> Underwent Environment-Induced Hypermutagenesis during Their Experimental Evolution into Legume Symbionts</title>
<p>Whole genome re-sequencing of the nine final clones of the evolution experiment revealed between 41 to 128 point mutations scattered in each genome and absent from the chimeric GMI1000pRalta ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This large number of mutations prompted us to test the hypothesis that mutators had arisen during our experiment. Yet, no mutation was detected in the DNA repair system of adapted clones. Furthermore fluctuation tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Sarkar1">[27]</xref>, which allow measuring the mutation rate of growing bacteria, confirmed that neither the chimeric ancestor GMI1000pRalta nor the three first nodulating clones CBM212, CBM349, and CBM356 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) were constitutive hypermutators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These results suggest that transient hypermutagenesis generated genetic diversity during the evolution experiment.</p>
<p>In each cycle plants in tubes were inoculated with bacteria, which diffused in the carbon-free and nitrogen-free plant culture Jensen medium before entering the root and multiplying within the newly induced nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). To determine whether genetic diversification occurred outside or inside the plant, we replayed a single evolution cycle several times independently and re-sequenced pools of 19 or 20 clones randomly isolated from the culture medium or from nodules 21 days after inoculation (single evolution cycle and re-sequencing [SEC&amp;R] assay). Three to ten different point mutations were found in pools isolated from nodules following inoculation by the nodulating ancestor CBM349 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s007">Table S1</xref>). Using the number of observed synonymous mutations, the genome sequencing coverage and the density of synonymous sites, we estimated the <italic>in planta</italic> synonymous point-mutation rate to 0.6–2×10<sup>−11</sup> per bp per generation, slightly lower than estimations from long-term <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> evolution experiments (4–14×10<sup>−11</sup> per bp per generation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Wielgoss1">[28]</xref>. By contrast, the non-nodulating ancestor GMI1000pRalta accumulated in the same period of time on average five and 20 times more mutations when incubated in the medium alone or in the medium with <italic>Mimosa</italic> seedlings, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s007">Table S1</xref>). In bacterial populations, both strong selective pressures and hypermutability can trigger fast fixation of mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Barrick1">[29]</xref>. We found no evidence for widespread positive selection in detected mutations and very few convergent mutations either in our SEC&amp;R assay or in the final evolved clones. Instead, many synonymous mutations and an excess of these over non-synonymous mutations indicated an imprint of purifying selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s008">Table S2</xref>). This finding suggests that most detected mutations are not adaptive and have achieved fixation by hitchhiking with adaptive ones. Altogether these results showed that bacteria were subjected to hypermutagenesis, presumably stress-induced, <italic>ex planta</italic> but probably not in nodules. Further work is needed to identify the inducing environmental factors. We speculate that nutrient starvation, a condition frequently encountered in the soil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Koch1">[30]</xref>, could be involved since it was endured by bacteria in both media. Bacteria showed very few divisions within 21 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s002">Figure S2C–S2E</xref>) and rapidly entered stationary then mortality phases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). The production by <italic>Mimosa</italic> plants of reactive oxygen species or other toxic compounds could account for the increased genetic diversity observed in the presence of the plant.</p>

<title>Transferred ImuABC Error-Prone DNA Polymerases Trigger Environment-Induced Hypermutability</title>
<p>Few (5–7) mutations were found in pools of the <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> wild-type strain GMI1000 incubated in the medium with or without the plant, revealing the key role of pRalta in hypermutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s007">Table S1</xref>). The pRalta plasmid harbors a locus of three genes encoding a protein of unknown function (ImuA2), a Y-family DNA polymerase (ImuB2), and a C-family error-prone polymerase (ImuC2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-SanchezAlberola1">[31]</xref>. This cassette, either complete or without the <italic>imuA</italic> gene, is widespread in bacteria and has been shown to mediate stress-induced mutagenesis as part of the SOS response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Boshoff1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Ippoliti1">[36]</xref>.

<p>To investigate whether the <italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> cassette was responsible for hypermutability in GMI1000pRalta in our experimental conditions, we monitored the spontaneous appearance of nalidixic acid (NalR) resistant clones during incubation of the (non-growing) bacteria in Jensen medium. We checked that NalR mutants did not exhibit a growth advantage in Jensen medium by performing competition experiments between the chimeric strain GMI1000pRalta and spontaneous NalR derivatives. Competition experiments showed no increase in NalR mutant frequency because of selection (competitive index NalR/WT 0.99±0.32, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.5, one-sample t-test), indicating that this assay faithfully measured mutability. In line with whole-genome re-sequencing results, NalR mutant frequency in the medium was ∼15 times higher for GMI1000pRalta than for GMI1000 as soon as from three days of incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Both deletion and insertion <italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> mutants of GMI1000pRalta exhibited a NalR mutant frequency comparable to that of GMI1000 seven days after incubation with (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s004">Figure S4B</xref>) or without (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) the plant. The mutator phenotype was restored by complementing GMI1000 or GMI1000pRaltaΔ<italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> with the wild-type cassette under the control of its promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). A SEC&amp;R assay on GMI1000pRaltaΔ<italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> confirmed that the <italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> cassette mediates hypermutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Hence hypermutagenesis observed in the Jensen plant medium was strictly dependent upon the pRalta <italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> products.</p>
<p>We tested whether the cassette leads to hypermutagensis in <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> the primary pRalta host. Under the same experimental conditions we found no evidence of pRalta-dependent hypermutagenesis in <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> harboring the pRalta plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s007">Table S1</xref>). Hypermutagenesis generates a large load of deleterious mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-EyreWalker1">[37]</xref> that may be compensated by adaptive mutations in poorly adapted, but not in well-adapted, clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Wielgoss2">[38]</xref>. <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> may thus have evolved strategies to silence plasmid <italic>imuABC</italic>-based mutagenesis.

This increase in fitness could reflect an improvement of the pre-symbiotic and symbiotic performances such as root colonization/attachment, root entry, nodule formation, and <italic>in planta</italic> multiplication and persistence.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>How complex phenotypic traits can be successfully transferred to evolutionary distant taxa is a poorly documented question despite its ecological and evolutionary importance. Whereas physical and genetic barriers restricting HGT have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Thomas1">[10]</xref>, the many examples of successful HGT over large phylogenetic distances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Cordero1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Andam2">[39]</xref> suggested the existence of environmental, genetic, or selective conditions favoring long-range HGT. Comparative genomics and experimental data have previously established the role of HGT in rhizobium evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Sullivan1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Galibert1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Amadou1">[41]</xref>. They also pointed out that activation and/or optimization of the symbiotic potential might rely on a combination of molecular events, involving integration of incoming symbiotic functions into pre-existing regulatory circuitries and recruitment, modulation or inactivation of local functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-MassonBoivin1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Marchetti1">[24]</xref>, allowing the newly acquired functions to adjust to both the recipient cell and the new plant environment. Each plant indeed represents a complex ecosystem with specific requirements, e.g., in terms of immunity and metabolism, to which the bacterium must adapt.</p>
<p>Here, we describe a mechanism that may have facilitated post-HGT adaptation of emerging rhizobia to their new host <italic>in natura</italic> and better accounts for the great extant diversity of rhizobia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001942-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This may have facilitated the evolution of specific interactions with a wide range of legume species all over the Earth. Upon experimentally replaying rhizobium evolution, we provide conclusive evidence that the co-transfer of <italic>imuABC</italic> error-prone DNA polymerase genes with key symbiotic genes accelerated the overall evolution of a soil bacterium into a legume symbiont under plant selection pressure by transiently increasing genetic diversity and thus likely accelerating the exploration of the fitness landscapes. Evolution of microorganisms in response to changing environments relies on the natural selection of genetic variants harboring beneficial phenotypic traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Blount1">[42]</xref>. Yet, standing genetic variation may not provide sufficiently adaptive variants when environmental changes are radical. It has previously been proposed that environment-induced increase in the rate of generation of genetic diversity could accelerate adaptive processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Bjedov1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Galhardo2">[45]</xref>. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying environment-induced mutagenesis are well known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Galhardo2">[45]</xref>, its ultimate biological significance has been debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Tenaillon1">[46]</xref>. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the role of environment-induced mutagenesis in the acquisition of a complex lifestyle trait.</p>
<p>HGT plays a ubiquitous role in the diversification of prokaryotes and exploration of new ecological niches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Lerat1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Treangen1">[2]</xref>.

<p>So far, experimental evolution, combined in recent years with whole genome sequencing, has been predominantly used to study genetic adaptation to simple and well controlled conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Barrick1">[29]</xref>.

GMI1000pRalta <italic>hrpG</italic> was chosen as founder since inactivation of this single regulatory gene allows nodulation in the first nodulating clones CBM212 and CBM349 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Marchetti1">[24]</xref>. The hypermutable and non-hypermutable phenotypes of the <italic>imuA2B2C2</italic><sup>+</sup> and Δ<italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> ancestors were checked using the NalR assay after incubation 7 days in Jensen medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s005">Figure S5A</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>imuA2B2C2</italic><sup>+</sup> and Δ<italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> strains were evolved using either serial <italic>ex planta-in planta</italic> or <italic>ex planta</italic> cycles. 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria of ancestral strains (RCM861, RCM863, RCM865, and RCM1035) grown overnight in rich BG medium were inoculated to four or five Gibson tubes filled with quarter-strength Jensen medium containing two <italic>M. pudica</italic> plantlets. For <italic>ex planta</italic>-<italic>in planta</italic> cycles, all nodules were collected from each tube separately 21 days after inoculation, surface sterilized, and crushed. Nodule bacterial populations recovered from each tube were grown 24 hours at 28°C in BG medium and 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria were used to inoculate a new tube containing two <italic>M. pudica</italic> plantlets in Jensen medium for the next cycle. On average, 18±6 nodules were collected per tube at each cycle. For <italic>ex planta</italic> cycles, the Jensen liquid medium of each plant tube was separately collected 7 days after inoculation and centrifuged 15 min at 5,000 rpm. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of BG medium and grown 24 hours at 28°C. 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria from each culture were used to inoculate a new tube of plants for the next cycle. One tube per lineage was inoculated in each cycle. In each cycle samples of populations were stored at −80°C for further analysis. Non contamination between <italic>imuA2B2C2</italic><sup>+</sup> and Δ<italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> populations was checked by PCR.</p>
<p>For fitness comparisons, different pairs of <italic>imuA2B2C2</italic><sup>+</sup>/Δ<italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> final populations were spread on plates from −80°C, resuspended in water and co-inoculated to <italic>M. pudica</italic> at a 1∶1 ratio (10<sup>6</sup>/10<sup>6</sup> bacteria per tube of plants). Relative <italic>in planta</italic> fitness was evaluated by counting bacteria recovered from all nodules of ten plantlets 21 days after inoculation as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Guan1">[25]</xref>. Relative <italic>ex planta</italic> fitness was evaluated by counting alive bacteria in Jensen medium 7 days after plant inoculation.

<p>For survival measurements, single colonies of GMI1000pRaltaΔ<italic>imuA2B2C2</italic> (RCM567) and spectinomycin-derivatives of GMI1000pRalta (RCM1069) were grown overnight in rich BG medium and 10<sup>7</sup> bacteria were inoculated to Gibson tubes filled with quarter-strength Jensen medium containing two <italic>M. pudica</italic> plantlets.

<title>Sampling, Library, and DNA Preparation</title>
<p>In SEC&amp;R experiments, <italic>ex planta</italic> and nodule populations were isolated as follows: nodules were collected, surface-sterilized as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Guan1">[25]</xref>, and ground separately in 1 ml of sterile water. The Jensen liquid medium was stirred to resuspend deposited matter, centrifuged, and the resulting pellet suspended in 1 ml of sterile water. Bacteria were plated on BG supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic and 19 to 20 clones were randomly chosen. Genomic DNA from each clone was prepared from a 1 ml overnight culture, using the Wizard Genomic DNA kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA concentrations were quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay kit (Invitrogen). DNA pools were constituted by mixing equimolar amounts of 19 or 20 genomic DNAs.</p>

<title>Genome Re-sequencing</title>
<p>Individual clones and pools of clones were re-sequenced using the Illumina/Solexa technology, either the GA2X or HiSeq technology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s007">Table S1</xref>). Sequence data production was performed by the C.E.A/IG/Genoscope (clones A16, B16, C16, G16, H16, I16, M16, N16, S16, and pools N1–3, J1, JM1–2), DNA Vision (pool JM6), or the PlaGe platform (other pools of clones and RCM252–RCM271 clones). Average sequence coverage of pools and clones from pools is indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s007">Table S1</xref>.</p>
<p>High throughput sequencing (HTS) data were analyzed using the PALOMA bioinformatic pipeline implemented in the Microscope platform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Vallenet1">[53]</xref>. The current pipeline is a “Master” shell script that launches the various modules of the analysis (i.e., a collection of C homemade software) and controls for all tasks having been completed without errors. In a first step, the HTS data were preprocessed to assess its quality. This step includes options such as read trimming, merging, or splitting paired-end reads. In a second step, reads were mapped onto the reference replicons (RefSeq accession number NC_003295.fna and NC_003296.fna for the <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> str. GMI1000 chromosome and megaplasmid, respectively, RefSeq accession number NC_010528.fna, NC_010530.fna, and NC_010529.fna for the <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> str.

Only unique matches having an alignment score equal to at least half of their length were retained as seeds for full Smith-Waterman realignment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Smith1">[55]</xref> with a both sides five nucleotides extended region of the reference genome. All computed alignments were then screened for discrepancies between read and reference sequences and <italic>in fine</italic>, a score based on coverage, allele frequency, quality of bases, and strand bias was computed for each detected event to assess its relevance. The complete collections of events generated for all the clones from this study are available on the Microscope platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope/expdata/evoProject.php" xlink:type="simple">https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope/expdata/evoProject.php</ext-link>).</p>
<p>To filter sequencing errors or undetected events in ancestors, the following criteria were applied: minimum reads on a position was 10 and strand ratio was 0.25. For clones, SNPs/indels having a score (high quality reads on the position/total reads on the position) &lt;0.4 and an allele ratio (mutated reads on the position/total reads on the position) &lt;0.61 were removed as well as SNPs/indels present in &gt;30% of all clones. For pools of clones, SNPs/indels having a score &lt;0.1 were removed as well as SNPs/indels present in &gt;20% of pools. Point mutations already present in appropriate founder strains were not considered. Finally, mutations in genes Rsp0540, Rsp0641, Rsp0642, Rsp1180, Rsp1620, and Rsc0104 that harbor low complexity regions were removed. For pools of clones derived from <italic>C. taiwanensis</italic> LMG19424, which was not sequenced using the Illumina technology, mutations with an allele ratio &gt;0.5 were considered as ancestral and removed. Filtered pool mutations are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s010">Table S4</xref>.</p>

<title>Mutation Analysis</title>
<p>For the validation of selected SNPs/indels, a ∼400 bp fragment containing the mutation was amplified by PCR either on individual clones or on pools of five or ten clones and subsequently sequenced by standard Sanger procedure. 97% of the 129 mutations tested in clones CBM124GenR, CBM212, CBM349, CBM356, A16, C16, G16, H16, M16, and N16 were validated by Sanger sequencing. Validations of mutations in pools or in clones RCM252–272 are indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s007">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001942.s010">S4</xref>.</p>
<p>To calculate the <italic>in planta</italic> mutation rate, we used pools of CBM349 clones isolated from nodules. Considering that a single bacterium enters and multiplies within a nodule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Gage1">[56]</xref> to ∼10<sup>6</sup> bacteria/nodule, we kept point-mutations having an allele ratio &lt;0.9, i.e., likely having been acquired after root entry. From these mutations acquired in ∼110 generations (∼20 generations <italic>in planta</italic> and ∼90 generations for clone purification on plates), we calculated an estimated synonymous point-mutation rate (synonymous mutations/synonymous positions/110) and the CI was computed according to a binomial distribution using the R “stats” package and the <italic>binom.test</italic> function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-R1">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>To evaluate the evolutionary processes acting on newly arising mutations, we counted the number of synonymous, non-synonymous, and intergenic mutations in the sequenced regions. We used synonymous mutations of 38 GMI1000pRalta clones to build the mutation spectrum of the genome as they are expected to be the least affected by selection. For example, having n synonymous positions with G in the reference genome and x substitutions G→A detected in evolved genomes, the frequency of G→A changes is given by x/n. This assumes no multiple mutations in the same site. This assumption is consistent with the low density of mutations (1/13,130 bp) and the lack of identical mutations in different lineages. We simulated genome evolution using this mutation spectrum to obtain the expected number of synonymous, non-synonymous, and intergenic mutations. We did 1,000 such random experiments, which allowed drawing the distribution of the expected number of each mutation and thus placing intervals of confidence around the average values observed in the simulation. The dN/dS and dI/dS simulated values were then compared to the values observed in the experiments. The simulations were done separately for the chromosomes and for the pRalta plasmid because they have different GC compositions (respectively, ∼67% and 60%). Since replicons were not re-sequenced to completion, the analysis of each experiment was done independently to properly account for the fraction of the replicon covered by sequencing in that experiment.</p>

<title>Fluctuation Tests</title>
<p>For each strain, an overnight culture in rich medium (BG) grown from a single colony was used to inoculate fresh BG medium that was subsequently divided into 23 individual cultures of ∼10<sup>4</sup> bacteria/ml. The cultures were then grown to saturation (2 days at 28°C, on a rotary shaker) and an aliquot from each culture was plated on BG agar plates supplemented or not with nalidixic acid. Mutation rates were calculated using the Ma-Sandri-Sarkar maximum likelihood (MSS-ML) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Sarkar1">[27]</xref>, as implemented by the Falcor web tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001942-Hall1">[58]</xref>.</p>
