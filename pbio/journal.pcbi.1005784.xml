<abstract>
<p>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate intercellular communication at synapses through the opening of an ion pore in response to the binding of a neurotransmitter. Despite the increasing availability of high-resolution structures of pLGICs, a detailed understanding of the functional isomerization from closed to open (gating) and back is currently missing. Here, we provide the first atomistic description of the transition from open to closed (un-gating) in the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) from <italic>Caenorhabditis Elegans</italic>. Starting with the active-state structure solved in complex with the neurotransmitter <monospace>L</monospace>-glutamate and the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) ivermectin, we analyze the spontaneous relaxation of the channel upon removal of ivermectin by explicit solvent/membrane Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The <italic>μ</italic>s-long trajectories support the conclusion that ion-channel deactivation is mediated by two distinct quaternary transitions, i.e. a global receptor twisting followed by the radial expansion (or blooming) of the extracellular domain. At variance with previous models, we show that pore closing is exclusively regulated by the global twisting, which controls the position of the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop relative to the M2-M3 loop at the EC/TM domain interface. Additional simulations with <monospace>L</monospace>-glutamate restrained to the crystallographic binding mode and ivermectin removed indicate that the same twisting isomerization is regulated by agonist binding at the orthosteric site. These results provide a structural model for gating in pLGICs and suggest a plausible mechanism for the pharmacological action of PAMs in this neurotransmitter receptor family. The simulated un-gating converges to the X-ray structure of GluCl resting state both globally and locally, demonstrating the predictive character of state-of-art MD simulations.</p>

<p>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) control membrane conductance in living systems from bacteria to humans. Here, we report on <italic>μ</italic>s-long, atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations of the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) with an explicit treatment of the solvent and the membrane environment. The calculated trajectories provide a complete and time-resolved visualization of ion-channel deactivation in pLGICs. Strikingly, two independent simulations started with an open channel stabilized by agonist binding (i.e. both <monospace>L</monospace>-glutamate and ivermectin) converge to the X-ray structure of GluCl in the absence of ligands upon removal of the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. These simulations visualize the gating isomerization in pLGICs with unprecedented space and time resolution and provide a plausible mechanism for the pharmacological action of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). Our analysis demonstrates in the clearest fashion the predictive power of state-of-art computer simulations and opens to the rational design of drugs targeting pLGICs’ dysfunction including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, depression, or nicotine addiction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) play a central role in the intercellular communication in the brain and are involved in fundamental processes such as learning, attention, and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref001">1</xref>]. They are membrane-bound oligomeric proteins that convert a chemical signal, typically the local increase in the concentration of neurotransmitter, into an ion flux through the post-synaptic membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref002">2</xref>]. At rest, the ion channel is closed and binding of the neurotransmitter to the extracellular (EC) domain elicits a fast isomerization, which results into the opening of a transmembrane (TM) pore and a corresponding flux of cations (or anions) that diffuse at rates approaching tens of millions of ions per second. This process is commonly referred to as “gating” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Prominent members of the pLGIC family in humans include excitatory receptors like the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which are associated with a cationic channel, and inhibitory receptors like the GABA<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> receptor, which are linked with an anionic channel. Signal transduction by pLGICs is allosterically regulated by ligand binding at sites that are topographically distinct from the neurotransmitter-binding or orthosteric site. The design of small molecules able to activate (agonists), inhibit (antagonists), or modulate (positive or negative allosteric modulators) the function of pLGICs is critical for the development of pharmacological strategies against a range of neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, and depression. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref004">4</xref>]</p>
<p>Despite the fact that pLGICs and related dysfunction have attracted significant pharmacological interest, the molecular mechanism of signal transduction remains to be elucidated. X-ray crystallography of prokaryotic homologues identified in <italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic> (GLIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref005">5</xref>] and <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic> (ELIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref006">6</xref>] provided the first high-resolution descriptions of the open and closed states of the channel. X-ray structures of the eukaryotic glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which was solved in complex with the endogenous neurotransmitter <monospace>L</monospace>-glutamate (<monospace>L</monospace>-Glu) and the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin (IVM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref007">7</xref>], and later with phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref008">8</xref>], have provided detailed information on the interaction with a variety of modulatory ligands; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g001">Fig 1</xref>. And, high-resolution structures of GLIC at pH7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref009">9</xref>] and GluCl apo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref008">8</xref>], which both captured a pLGIC in the absence of agonist, demonstrated that ion gating is mediated by a large conformational change of the receptor, which involves both global twisting as originally proposed based on modeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref010">10</xref>] and the radial expansion or “blooming” of the EC domain. Finally, the most recent structural determinations of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref011">11</xref>], the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref012">12</xref>], the Gly receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref014">14</xref>], and the <italic>α</italic><sub>4</sub><italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> nicotinic receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref015">15</xref>] started to illuminate the details of the signal transduction mechanism: (i) visualizing a state that is most consistent with desensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref011">11</xref>]; (ii) providing an atomistic description of the regulatory intracellular (IC) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref012">12</xref>]; and shedding light onto pLGICs activation/deactivation by agonist versus antagonist binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref014">14</xref>].</p>

<p>The significant amount of structural information available in pLGICs provides opportunities to explore gating by all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref016">16</xref>]. By analyzing the spontaneous relaxation of the open-channel structure triggered by the removal of agonist, MD simulations of GLIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref017">17</xref>] and GluCl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>] consistently pointed to the existence of an indirect coupling between twisting and blooming, suggesting a sequence of events linking (allosterically) neurotransmitter unbinding to pore closing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>]. Similarly, starting with the X-ray structure of GluCl with IVM and no <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref019">19</xref>] or the mouse 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R in the absence of nanobodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref020">20</xref>], the transition to a “water-conducting” channel was captured by introducing the neurotransmitter (<monospace>L</monospace>-Glu and serotonin, respectively) at the orthosteric site and relaxing the complex by <italic>μ</italic>s-long MD. Although in both cases the physiological significance of the starting structures remains unclear, i.e. it does not correspond to the resting state visualized by GLIC at pH7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref009">9</xref>] or GluCl apo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref008">8</xref>], these studies evidenced a striking correlation between orthosteric agonist binding and pore opening. In addition, the analysis of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R suggested that rotameric transitions of the pore-lining residues at positions 9′ and 13′, which significantly enlarge the ion-pore diameter with minimal variation of the protein backbone, is key to stabilize an ion-conducting state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we report on the first atomistic description of the functional isomerization from active to rest (un-gating) in a pLGICs. Starting with the open-channel structure of GluCl in complex with <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu and the positive allosteric modulator IVM, we analyze its structural relaxation upon removal of the IVM by <italic>μ</italic>s-long MD simulations in the native lipid-membrane environment. The calculated trajectories illuminate the spontaneous isomerization to a closed-channel form that is strikingly similar to the X-ray structure of GluCl apo, thus bridging two physiological states of the channel at atomic resolution. Analysis of two independent realizations of un-gating unveils a novel mechanism of pore closing and illustrates how agonist unbinding from the orthosteric site and/or the allosteric transmembrane site regulates the transition to a non-conductive state. These results provide fundamental insights onto the allosteric mechanism and regulation of pLGICs, offering a plausible interpretation of the pharmacological action of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The conformational dynamics of GluCl at physiologically relevant conditions, i.e. with the pLGIC embedded in a native lipid membrane and exposed to a physiological concentration of sodium and chloride ions, was investigated by all-atom MD starting with three distinct configurations of the channel corresponding to the X-ray structures of the active state with and without the positive allosteric modulator IVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref007">7</xref>], and GluCl apo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref008">8</xref>], which is thought to represent the resting state; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s001">S1 Table</xref>. Within this set, two independent 2.5 <italic>μ</italic>s simulations of the active state with IVM removed were used to explore the allosteric mechanism of pore closing; they are referred to as “w/o IVM” run A and run B throughout the Text. The simulations of the active state with IVM and <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu bound (470 ns) and the resting state (180 ns) with no ligand bound are referred to as “with IVM” and “apo”, respectively. Finally, the simulation of GluCl active with IVM removed and <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu restrained to the crystallographic binding mode (290 ns) is referred to “<monospace>L</monospace>-Glu*”. In the <italic>Results</italic> section, the description of the spontaneous isomerization from open to closed is presented first. Its mechanistic interpretation follows.

<p>The structural evolution of GluCl active with IVM removed was analyzed by monitoring the C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub>-RMSD from the resting-state structure (GluCl apo) along the simulated trajectory, which provides a natural progress variable to explore ion-channel deactivation.

In sharp contrast, the conformation of the EC domain differs substantially in the two runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s007">S2 Fig</xref>) mostly as a result of an additional quaternary reorganization in run A, as we shall see.</p>

<p>The relaxation of the active state with IVM removed was further analyzed by monitoring the receptor twisting angle and the size of the ion pore at the constriction point (position 9′), which are both compared with values measured in the active- (with IVM) and the resting-state (apo) simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g002">Fig 2</xref> (middle panel). The results show that the removal of IVM corresponds to a global twisting transition in both MD runs, with the twisting angle increasing from 12.2° (red dashed line) characteristic of the active state, to 23° (green dashed line) consistent with the resting state. The degree of pore opening, which was analyzed using a geometric measure based on the Cartesian coordinates of the C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub> atoms at position 9′ (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Methods</xref>), indicates that upon removal of IVM the C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub>-cross section shrinks from 1.4 to 1.15 nm<sup>2</sup> in less than 1 <italic>μ</italic>s approaching values that are consistent with the X-ray structure of GluCl apo and corresponding MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

<p>Taken together, these results indicate that in the absence of IVM the active state of GluCl is conformationally strained and relaxes to a globally twisted, closed-channel form that closely resembles the X-ray structure of GluCl apo in the TM domain, but differs considerably in the EC domain. Importantly, they also indicate that the quaternary reorganization captured by MD is independent of the initial simulation conditions, although its spontaneous relaxation may be sampled on substantially different time spans, i.e. 400 ns in run A and 800 ns in run B; confront the light-blue versus dark-blue traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g002">Fig 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Pore closing</title>
<p>To obtain further insight onto the closing isomerization, the radius of the transmembrane pore was monitored during the open to closed simulated transition. For this purpose, a series of snapshots of the protein taken every 0.2 ps were processed by the program HOLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref021">21</xref>]. The resulting profiles averaged over 2-ps windows are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The time-resolved analysis indicates that at the end of the relaxation the constriction point is located at the position 9′, fully consistent with the X-ray structure of GluCl apo. Also, it shows that although 50% of closing occurs within the first 2 ns of simulation, where the pore radius at 9′ drops from 3.4 Å (X-ray active) to 1.9 Å (MD with IVM bound), the rest of the transition takes several hundreds of ns. Strikingly, the superimposition of the pore-lining helices M2 on the X-ray structure of GluCl apo shows that in the absence of IVM the TM domain has relaxed to the resting state in less than 1 <italic>μ</italic>s; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Moreover, since the pore radius at position −2′ remains open, i.e. it stabilizes at 1.8 Å versus 1.5 Å in the X-ray structure of the GABA<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> receptor in complex with benzamidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref011">11</xref>] and 1.0 Å in GlyR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref022">22</xref>], the pore radius at the desensitization gate (at position -2′) remains open, we conclude that the closed-channel structure sampled by MD at the end of the relaxation with IVM removed corresponds to the resting rather than the desensitized state.</p>

<p>To explore channel permeability in the various conformational states of GluCl, the time evolution of the water/ion distribution around the pore and the water/ion permeation or flux through the pore were analyzed; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Methods</xref>. These observables provide an orthogonal and non-structural definition of channel closing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref023">23</xref>]. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g004">Fig 4</xref> (bottom) show that in the presence of IVM the ion-channel is water permeable with an average flux of 1.9 water per nanosecond. In sharp contrast, upon removal of IVM the number of pore-wetting waters close to the constriction point goes to zero in 400 ns (run A) or 800 ns (run B), with the flux stabilizing at 0.01 water/ns at the end of the relaxation. Perhaps surprisingly, the results show that chloride ions never cross the constriction point even when IVM is bound, although they visit the transmembrane pore region with an average count of 0.5 ion/ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The lack of an ionic concentration gradient and/or the absence of a transmembrane potential in the simulations might explain this surprising observation. Upon pore shutting (400 ns run A, or 800 ns run B), the ion count drops to 0.1 ion/ns consistent with the simulation of GluCl apo. Therefore, the structural relaxation of GluCl upon removal of IVM produces a significant shrinking of the transmembrane pore, mostly as a consequence of the inward displacement of the bulky and hydrophobic residue Leu 254 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), which eventually results in partial pore dewetting. Analysis of the water distribution inside the pore indicates that the dehydrated stretch upon closing is 4.8 and 4.6 Å long for run A and B respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s022">S17 Fig</xref>). In addition, the striking correlation between the position of the dehydrated stretch and the water-occluded region evidenced by HOLE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s022">S17 Fig</xref>) suggests that pore-closing in these simulations is more consistent with physical constriction than hydrophobic gating.</p>

<p>Taken together, the simulation results indicate that at physiologically relevant conditions GluCl with IVM bound is a water-permeable channel featuring a transmembrane pore that is narrower than the one observed in the crystals. The removal of IVM triggers a rapid (sub-microsecond) isomerization of the TM domain that shuts the ion pore at position 9′, consistent with the crystallographic result in the absence of ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We conclude that both <italic>μ</italic>s simulations of GluCl active with IVM removed have captured the full closing transition, thus providing a time-resolved description of ion-channel deactivation or un-gating in pLGICs with atomic resolution.</p>

<title>The allosteric mechanism of pore closing</title>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>The orthosteric site</title>
<p>By monitoring the position of the five <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu at the orthosteric site, we found that <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu unbinds spontaneously during the relaxation of GluCl with IVM removed; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g002">Fig 2</xref> (bottom). Intriguingly, the results indicate that the release of the fourth (out of five) <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu from the orthosteric site is time-correlated with receptor’s twisting and pore closing in both MD runs; i.e. at 400 ns in run A and 800 ns in run B. These observations suggest that global twisting is regulated by agonist binding at the orthosteric site, i.e. complete twisting does not occur as long as two <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu are bound. Also, they indicate that in the absence of IVM <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu alone is not sufficient to stabilize the active state of GluCl in free MD.</p>

<title>The extracellular domain</title>
<p>The quaternary reorganization of the EC domain was investigated by monitoring the orientation of the <italic>β</italic>-sandwiches, whose radial and tangential tilting were analyzed over time; see Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>] for the definition of the corresponding polar and azimuthal tilting angles. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g005">Fig 5</xref> show that in the active state (red) the EC domain is significantly more contracted (Δ<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> of −4.5°) and straight (Δ<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> of −3.4°) than the one in the resting state (green). Also, they show that the removal of IVM (dark and light blue) results into a tangential tilting of the <italic>β</italic>-sandwiches (Δ<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> of 5° for run A and 6° for run B), which appears to be coupled to the radial expansion of the EC domain in run A (Δ<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> of 2.4°) but not in run B (Δ<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> of 0.2°); confront the dark-blue and light-blue clouds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Because pore closing occurs in both runs with IVM removed (see above), these results indicate that tangential rather than radial tilting of the EC subunits is a molecular requirement for closing. Also, since tangential tilting is strongly correlated with receptor twisting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s013">S8 Fig</xref>), this analysis suggests that the twisting isomerization controls channel closing.</p>

<p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g005">Fig 5</xref> highlight the occurrence of a second isomerization of the ion channel, which was captured by run A but not run B. This additional conformational change corresponds to the radial expansion or <italic>blooming</italic> of the EC domain, which results from a global reorientation of extracellular subunits in the radial direction; the average polar tilting angle increases from 7.6° to 10° in run A. Strikingly, the significant overlap between the green (GluCl apo) and dark blue (GluCl w/o IVM) clouds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g005">Fig 5</xref> indicates that the blooming is required to reach the physiological resting state. Also, the large-amplitude fluctuations sampled by the EC subunits at the end of the MD relaxation show that the EC domain is significantly more flexible in the (bloomed) resting state than the (unbloomed) active state, consistent with previous observations on GLIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref009">9</xref>]. Visual inspection of the simulated trajectory reveals that the enhanced conformational variability in the EC domain upon blooming originates from a remarkable loss of coupling between the subunits, which become free to reorient almost independently (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s023">S1 Video</xref>). The corresponding loss of pentameric symmetry explains the larger structural deviation of the EC domain observed in both run A and the room-temperature simulation of GluCl apo relative to the X-ray structure of the resting state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s007">S2 Fig</xref>). Strikingly, these results show that the MD relaxation of GluCl with IVM removed in run A bridges the gap from active to resting through a complex conformational change that involves the sequential activation of two quaternary isomerizations, i.e. global twisting followed by blooming of the EC domain.</p>

<title>The EC/TM domains interface</title>
<p>The rearrangement of the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop and the M2-M3 loop at the EC/TM domains interface was analyzed during the pore-closing transition. Earlier simulations of GluCl suggested that a horizontal displacement of the M2-M3 loop in the direction of the ion pore is crucial for gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>]. To substantiate this conclusion, the position of the totally conserved proline on the M2-M3 loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref024">24</xref>] (P268 in GluCl) was monitored by projecting its center of mass on a plane perpendicular to the principal axis of the receptor upon superimposition of the TM domain. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g006">Fig 6</xref> show that with IVM bound (red) these interfacial prolines adopt an <italic>out</italic> position, which is distinct and non-overlapping with the <italic>in</italic> position characteristic of the resting state (green).

Since the translocation of this loop involves the passage of the bulky proline 268 past the tip of the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>], they also indicate that the position of the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop at the EC/TM interface is crucial to regulate pore closing.</p>

The results indicate that despite significant shrinking of the pore the separation between these two transmembrane helices is stable over time with an average value of 12.2 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s010">S5 Fig</xref>). Also, the corresponding distances in the X-ray structures of the locally-closed (LC) state of GLIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref025">25</xref>] (14.2 Å using <monospace>4NPP</monospace>) or GLIC pH7 (14.04 Å using <monospace>4NPQ</monospace>) are clearly non overlapping with the fluctuations sampled by MD of GluCl with IVM removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s010">S5 Fig</xref>). We conclude that pore shutting in GluCl is the result of a highly coordinated movement of the M2 and M3 helices with no need for uncoupling. These results along with the X-ray structure of GluCl apo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref008">8</xref>] challenge the significance of the closed-channel structures of GLIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref025">25</xref>] and suggest either a unique pore-closing mechanism in this prokaryotic family, or an alternative functional annotation for these structures.</p>

The results indicate that Δ<italic>Z</italic> increases from 5 Å characteristic of the active state, to 7 Å consistent with the simulation of GluCl apo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Also, they show that the vertical displacement of the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop is strongly correlated with the degree of twisting and anticorrelated with the size of the ion pore; i.e. a distance increase of 2 Å along the vertical direction corresponds to pore-shrinking that is consistent with the closed-channel state (e.g. GluCl apo). Interestingly, visual inspection of the EC/TM interfacial region before and after pore closing unveils that the tangential reorientation of the EC subunits during the twisting transition produces a striking upward movement of the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop, which facilitates the inward displacement of the P268 residue at the EC/TM interface; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g007">Fig 7</xref>. Taken together, these results indicate that the local rearrangement required for closing is a vertical displacement of the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop at the EC/TM interface, whose position is controlled by the global twisting of the receptor. Since global twisting may be regulated by agonist binding at the orthosteric (<monospace>L</monospace>-Glu) and/or the allosteric transmembrane (IVM) sites (see above), this analysis indicates that <italic>quaternary</italic> twisting alone provides an allosteric coupling for gating. Also, it suggests that the totally conserved proline on the M2-M3 loop (P268) would act as a sensor for agonist binding thorough its interaction with the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop.</p>

<title>Modulation by orthosteric versus allosteric ligand-binding events</title>
<p>The MD relaxation of GluCl promoted by the removal of IVM showed that ion-channel deactivation is mediated by two sequential isomerizations. By projecting the 2.5<italic>μ</italic>s relaxation (run A) on the twisting and blooming (polar tilting) reaction coordinates an interesting scenario emerges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The results show that when IVM and <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu are both bound (red), the receptor is stable in a globally untwisted or <italic>straight</italic> configuration with a contracted EC domain; the twisting and blooming angles fluctuate around average values of 15.3° and 7.6°, respectively. On the other hand, when no agonist is bound (green), the receptor adopts a globally twisted configuration with a radially expanded EC domain; corresponding twisting and blooming angles are 21.3° and 12.1°, respectively. Interestingly, when IVM is removed (blue), the receptor does not reach the resting state immediately. Rather, it evolves to an intermediate configuration that is significantly more twisted (<italic>τ</italic> ≈ 18°) but still preserves a contracted EC domain (<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> ≈ 8°). The kinetic stability of this marginally stable state is not negligible (i.e. 400 ns) and is time-correlated with the presence of <monospace>L</monospace>-glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g002">Fig 2</xref>, bottom), whose binding to the orthosteric site hinders the full twisting isomerization (see above).</p>

<p>To explore the significance of this kinetic intermediate sampled by MD on closing, an additional simulation of GluCl active with IVM removed was carried out by introducing harmonic restraints on the <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu/receptor interactions to stabilize neurotransmitter binding; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Methods</xref>. The <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu restrained simulation (<monospace>L</monospace>-Glu*) shows that orthosteric agonist binding alone stabilizes a unique quaternary organization of the pentamer, which is more twisted (<italic>τ</italic> of 16.7°) than the one stabilized by IVM binding (<italic>τ</italic> of 15.3°) and closely resembles the kinetic intermediate captured by un-restrained MD on closing; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005784.g008">Fig 8</xref>. To collect additional information, the configuration of the orthosteric site, the allosteric site and the ion pore in the <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu* simulation were compared with those observed in the resting-state and active-state simulations. To this aim, the separation between the C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub> atoms of Ser150 <monospace>(+)</monospace> from Arg56 <monospace>(-)</monospace> in the EC domain and G281 <monospace>(+)</monospace> from L218 <monospace>(-)</monospace> in the TM domain were monitored over time; these residues sit at the subunits interface and form strong interactions with either <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu or IVM in the X-ray structure of the active state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref001">1</xref>]. The results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s002">S2 Table</xref>) show that in the <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu* simulation the orthosteric pocket is active-like and is significantly more contracted than that in the resting state or at the end of the relaxation of GluCl with IVM removed. By contrast, the allosteric site in the TM domain is more resting-like and its cavity shrinks by 1.2 Å relative to active. Finally, analysis of the transmembrane pore by HOLE shows that the radius at the constriction point is 1.81 Å in the <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu* simulation, which closely matches the value measured in the active state with IVM bound (1.86 Å). Based on these observations, we conclude that the conformation of GluCl sampled by <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu* or in the early stages of the MD relaxation with IVM removed is a quaternary distinct open-channel form featuring a globally more twisted architecture and a closed allosteric site, but that still preserves the exact same open-pore configuration, i.e. it is functionally equivalent to the IVM bound state.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are transmembrane protein assemblies that mediate interneuron communication by opening an ion pore in response to increased levels of neurotransmitter at synaptic terminals. Despite the recent availability of high-resolution structures from prokaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref025">25</xref>], invertebrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref008">8</xref>] and vertebrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref013">13</xref>] eukaryotes including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref014">14</xref>], a detailed understanding of gating, i.e. the conformational transition leading to an open pore in response to agonist binding, is still missing. Only recently, a two-step asymmetric mechanism has started to emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we report on the functional isomerization of the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) from the active state stabilized by agonist binding at both the orthosteric (<monospace>L</monospace>-glutamate) and the allosteric transmembrane (ivermectin) sites to the resting state by microsecond, explicit solvent/membrane Molecular Dynamics (MD). In the spirit of a previous study by us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>], we have analyzed the spontaneous relaxation of the channel upon removal of ivermectin (IVM) and infer on the pore-closing mechanism. Importantly and unlike in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>], the present simulations capture the full conformational transition to the physiological resting state at an atomic level of detail. Consistent with previous models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref026">26</xref>] as well as X-ray crystallography of the end states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref008">8</xref>], the removal of IVM results in a closed-channel structure that is globally <italic>twisted</italic> and presents an expanded or <italic>bloomed</italic> configuration of the extracellular (EC) domain. Strikingly, the totally conserved prolines on the M2-M3 loop (P268), which are “out” in the active state, have all moved “in” at the end of the MD relaxation, and the transmembrane pore shuts at the position 9′ (L254), consistent with the X-ray structure of GluCl apo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref008">8</xref>]. These results show that MD simulations started from the high-resolution structure of an open GluCl stabilized by ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref007">7</xref>] were able to produce a closed-channel state that is both globally and locally consistent with the crystallographic result in the absence of ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref008">8</xref>]. Hence, they suggest that state-of-art Molecular Dynamics may be used in some cases as a predictive tool. In addition, they provide the details of the closing isomerization, which are not directly accessible by experiments, shedding new light onto the gating/un-gating mechanism in pLGICs. The most important findings are summarized below.</p>
<p>First, the simulation results indicate that in the absence of IVM the active state of GluCl is conformationally strained (or <italic>tensed</italic>) and relaxes to a globally twisted, closed-pore form that closely resembles the structure of GluCl apo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref008">8</xref>]. Consistent with previous hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref025">25</xref>], they provide evidence that the closed-pore configuration is reached through an inward displacement of the M2-M3 loop at the EC/TM interface, which involves the passage of the bulky proline 268 past the tip of the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop. Thus, they support the conclusion that opening/closing of the channel is regulated by receptor twisting <italic>indirectly</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>] and that gating/un-gating essentially corresponds to rearranging loops in the crowded environment of the EC/TM interface. However and in disagreement with previous conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>], we demonstrate that the position of the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop relative to the M2-M3 loop can be entirely controlled by the twisting isomerization, which appears to be the only molecular requirement for closing. In light of this, the present simulations are consistent with a mechanism for closing in which agonist unbinding is the initiating event, a global twisting isomerization follows, which shifts the <italic>β</italic>1-<italic>β</italic>2 loop away from the EC/TM interface, and the horizontal translocation of the M2-M3 loop coupled to an inward untilting of the pore-lining helices M2 completes the transition by shutting the pore at the position 9′. Since the same global twisting transition appears to be regulated by <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu or IVM binding at topographically distinct sites, this analysis demonstrates that quaternary twisting alone provides an allosteric coupling for pore opening/closing, as originally proposed based on a model of <italic>α</italic>7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Second, our MD relaxations of GluCl with IVM removed reveal the existence of a previously unreported metastable state on closing. This “new” intermediate structurally corresponds to an open-channel form that is globally more twisted than GluCl with IVM bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref007">7</xref>] and features a closed allosteric pocket in the TM domain, but that still preserves the exact same open-pore configuration. As its kinetic stability is controlled by <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu unbinding, we conclude that neurotransmitter binding in the absence of allosteric modulators would stabilize a quaternary distinct open-channel form, consistent with recent reports on the Gly receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref013">13</xref>]. Importantly, our analysis makes it clear that agonist binding at the orthosteric (<monospace>L</monospace>-Glu) or the allosteric transmembrane (IVM) sites modulate the same twisting isomerization with IVM binding promoting the transition to a <italic>super-untwisted</italic> state, which is expected to enhance the energetic barrier for closing even further. In this view, the distinct quaternary structure captured by MD in the early stages of the relaxation with IVM removed would be consistent with an active state elicited by neurotransmitter binding alone, i.e. in the absence of modulators. Since the coupling between quaternary twisting and pore-closing is indirect (see above), this interpretation offers a molecular understanding of the pharmacological action of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), which would increase the open-pore probability with no effect on the ion flux by modulating the twisting isomerization.</p>
<p>Last, our <italic>μ</italic>s-long simulations of GluCl indicate that ion-channel deactivation or un-gating is composed of two distinct quaternary transitions, i.e. a global receptor <italic>twisting</italic> and the radial expansion or <italic>blooming</italic> of the EC domain, which are activated in this order to reach the physiological resting state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s024">S2 Video</xref>). However, they also suggest that receptor blooming is not strictly required for closing, which naturally questions the functional significance of the second isomerization. Our simulation analysis provides evidence that upon receptor twisting from active, the radial expansion of the EC domain that results in uncoupled EC subunits, is a stochastic event occurring on the <italic>μ</italic>s timescale. Because this transition involves solvent exposure of large contact areas that are buried in the contracted form, the <italic>μ</italic>s barrier for blooming probed by MD, e.g. in run B must be associated with breaking of extensive interactions at the subunit interfaces. On the other hand, the enhanced conformational variability observed in the bloomed EC domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s023">S1 Video</xref>) is likely to introduce a sizeable entropy stabilization, which must prevent the fast reverse transition to the contracted form as evidenced by the second part of the relaxation with IVM removed in run A and the room-temperature simulation of GluCl apo. Interestingly, the significant barriers for blooming/unblooming in a closed-pore receptor would be consistent with the existence of a pre-active intermediate state on gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref029">29</xref>]. Since the thermodynamic stability of this intermediate is supposed to be modulated by ligand binding at the orthosteric site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref027">27</xref>], the existence of a blooming isomerization with no (direct) consequence on pore opening/closing might be interpreted as a molecular mechanism for agonist selection. If so, agonism in pLGICs would be related to the ability of a given ligand to stabilize the globally twisted, EC-contracted, and pore-closed receptor, which was captured by MD in one of the two runs with IVM removed (run B), versus the resting receptor. Although these conclusions remain speculative at this stage, the simulation results emphasize that pore-closing and un-gating, i.e. the transition to the physiological resting state, are not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>The mechanistic scenario emerging from the simulations of GluCl prompts the comparison with previous models of gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref031">31</xref>], which highlights similarities but also differences. Although existing models generally agree on that gating is mediated by a global isomerization involving both twisting and blooming, they do not provide a precise description of the mechanistic role of these movements, nor of their modulation by ligand binding events. Our present analysis illustrates how both twisting and blooming, and not only twisting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref019">19</xref>], fundamentally contribute to the functional isomerization to the physiological resting state, showing that un-gating is mediated by the sequential activation of twisting and blooming in this precise order, rather than the opposite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref020">20</xref>]. Moreover, our interpretation offers a unifying mechanistic picture, in which the functional consequences of the more local changes at key sites (i.e. the orthosteric site, the pore lumen, the EC/TM interface, etc.) are subjected to the quaternary re-organization of the channel, which provide allosteric control through ligand-binding events at the subunit interfaces. In this framework, our analysis of GluCl suggests that pore closing is rate limited by the global twisting of the receptor rather than rotameric switching at the hydrophobic girdle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref020">20</xref>], which we have shown is irrelevant to water permeation in the open-channel form of GluCl stabilized by IVM binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s019">S14 Fig</xref>). Similarly, it highlights that the structural rearrangements promoted by the removal of IVM, which have been described as specific to IVM binding and not related to gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref026">26</xref>], are part of a more complex quaternary mechanism for gating/un-gating, which is more than the mere opening/closing of an ion pore. Remarkably and in agreement with our interpretation, the mechanistic role of the loops at the EC/TM interface for gating/un-gating in pLGICs has been recently recognized by the string method optimization of the gating pathway(s) in GLIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref031">31</xref>]. However, unlike in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref031">31</xref>], no evidence of causality between <italic>β</italic>-sheet expansion and pore closing was found in our simulated un-gating of GluCl (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s020">S15 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have reported on the spontaneous and complete pore-closing isomerization of the eukaryotic, pentameric ligand-gated ion channel GluCl as visualized by two independent 2.5 <italic>μ</italic>s-long explicit solvent/membrane MD simulations. The availability of a time-resolved, atomistic description of the conformational transition between two physiological states corresponding to ion-channel deactivation provides new insights on the molecular mechanism and allosteric regulation of gating. These results considerably enrich our understanding of pLGICs function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref003">3</xref>] and offer new opportunities to explore ligand modulation in this important family of neurotransmitter receptors.</p>

A cutoff of 12 Å was used for the electrostatic interactions with a switch at 10 Å. The electrostatics were computed every two steps and the time step used was 2 fs. All covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref046">46</xref>]. The simulation cell was allowed to fluctuate anisotropically while keeping a constant ratio between the x and y dimensions, which are parallel to the membrane plane. The molecular system was equilibrated for 2 ns (NPT ensemble, 1 bar, 300 K), while the positional restraints on the heavy atoms of the protein were gradually turned off.</p>

<title>Structural and dynamic observables</title>
<p>Five observables were used to characterize the functional state of the pLGIC: the global twisting of the receptor, the tilting of the β-sandwiches in the EC domain, the configuration of the ion pore, its ion and water permeability, and the configuration of the orthosteric neurotransmitter site and the allosteric transmembrane site. All observables have been implemented in the program Wordom (version 0.23-rc1 available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/p/wordom/codehg" xlink:type="simple">https://sourceforge.net/p/wordom/codehg</ext-link>) to allow for efficient analysis of long MD trajectories.</p>
<p>The <bold>global twisting</bold> (<italic>τ</italic>) was evaluated per subunit and defined as the angle spanned by the projections of the geometrical centers of the EC and the TM portions of each subunit on the pseudo-symmetry axis of the receptor. Geometrically, this angle measures the torsion of the EC domain relative the TM domain of the receptor around the pore axis. For the analysis, receptor twisting per snapshot was evaluated by averaging over the twist angle of its five subunits.</p>
<p>The <bold>extracellular tilting</bold> was also evaluated per subunit and decomposed into polar (<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>) and azimuthal (<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>) components. These two angles were measured in the reference frame of each EC subunit with the Z-axis perpendicular to the plane of the membrane and the X-axis pointing outwards along the radial direction. By naming <inline-formula id="pcbi.1005784.e001"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1005784.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005784.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi> <mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> the vector defining the principal axis of the EC subunit, the polar (radial) tilt was measured as the angle between the Z-axis and the projection of <inline-formula id="pcbi.1005784.e002"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1005784.e002g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005784.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi> <mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> on the XZ plane, whereas the azimuthal (tangential) tilt as the angle between the Z-axis and the projection of <inline-formula id="pcbi.1005784.e003"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1005784.e003g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005784.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M3"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi> <mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> on the XZ plane. Similar to the twisting angle, the polar and azimuthal tilt used for the analysis correspond to averages over the five subunits per snapshot.</p>
<p>The <bold>opening</bold> of the transmembrane pore was probed by measuring its radius at the constriction point (residue 9′, Leu 254) by HOLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref021">21</xref>] or the C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub> cross section at position 9′ (<italic>σ</italic>) using a simple geometric definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref010">10</xref>]; the latter is referred to as the “ion-pore size” throughout the text. Pore dehydration and ion permeation were probed by counting the number of water molecules or ions within a cutoff distance of 2 and 5 Å, respectively, from the constriction point. The latter provides an orthogonal and not structure-based measure of pore opening. This analysis was done using the toolbox of VMD 1.9. Simultaneously, water and ion <bold>permeability</bold> were analyzed by measuring the corresponding fluxes across the lipid membrane. To this aim, a transition event was defined as the translocation of a given particle (a water molecule or an ion) from one compartment of the simulation box to the other across the membrane. Water transitions were counted by monitoring the position of the oxygen atom over time. No distinction was made between upward or downward transitions, the total flux being the sum of the two. To avoid miscounting that result from particle diffusion through the periodic boundary along the Z direction, a layer of 5 Å was added at the top and the bottom of the simulation box. The same setup was used to monitor the ion flux.</p>
<p>The configuration of the ligand-binding sites (i.e. the orthosteric and the allosteric transmembrane sites) were analyzed by monitoring one or more characteristic <bold>distances</bold> between residues selected based on their interaction with <monospace>L</monospace>-glutamate and ivermectin in the X-ray structure of the active state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref007">7</xref>]. For the orthosteric site, the distance between the C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub> atoms of Ser 150 <monospace>(+)</monospace> and Arg 56 <monospace>(-)</monospace> was used. For the allosteric site, following the work in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref026">26</xref>] the distance between the C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub> atoms of Gly 281 <monospace>(+)</monospace> and Leu 218 <monospace>(-)</monospace> was monitored. <monospace>(+)</monospace> and <monospace>(-)</monospace> refer to the principal and the complementary subunit, respectively.</p>
<p>In the <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu* simulations, the position of <monospace>L</monospace>-Glu was controlled by restraining the distance between its side-chain carboxylic oxygens and the basic nitrogens of Arg56 <monospace>(-)</monospace> and its aminic nitrogen with the geometrical center of the aromatic ring of residues Tyr 200 and Tyr 151 to the crystallographic binding mode (PDB <monospace>3RIF</monospace>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005784.s009">S4 Fig</xref>). To this aim, harmonic restraints with a force constant of 10 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> were introduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005784.ref047">47</xref>].</p>

<p>The exponential fits are shown in dotted lines. Due to the way the acf was computed only half of the simulations are shown. One clearly sees that it takes a significantly longer time for the EC domain to converge that for the TM domain. Also, this data show that the systems reach an equilibrium at about 100 ns for IVM bound and about 40 ns for the TM GluCl with IVM bound. Finally it is interesting to mention that the EC domain of GluCl apo seems to not be yet at equilibrium, this can be explained by the absence of ligand at the level of the orthosteric site making the sampling of all possible configurations more difficult.</p>
