        <p>The ubiquitin ligases CUL-3 and SLMB collaborate to regulate the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian clock by controlling TIMELESS oscillations.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Eukaryotic circadian clocks rely on transcriptional feedback loops. In Drosophila, the PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) proteins accumulate during the night, inhibit the activity of the CLOCK (CLK)/CYCLE (CYC) transcriptional complex, and are degraded in the early morning. The control of PER and TIM oscillations largely depends on post-translational mechanisms. They involve both light-dependent and light-independent pathways that rely on the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of the clock proteins. SLMB, which is part of a CULLIN-1-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is required for the circadian degradation of phosphorylated PER. We show here that CULLIN-3 (CUL-3) is required for the circadian control of PER and TIM oscillations. Expression of either <italic>Cul-3</italic> RNAi or dominant negative forms of CUL-3 in the clock neurons alters locomotor behavior and dampens PER and TIM oscillations in light-dark cycles. In constant conditions, CUL-3 deregulation induces behavioral arrhythmicity and rapidly abolishes TIM cycling, with slower effects on PER. CUL-3 affects TIM accumulation more strongly in the absence of PER and forms protein complexes with hypo-phosphorylated TIM. In contrast, SLMB affects TIM more strongly in the presence of PER and preferentially associates with phosphorylated TIM. CUL-3 and SLMB show additive effects on TIM and PER, suggesting different roles for the two ubiquitination complexes on PER and TIM cycling. This work thus shows that CUL-3 is a new component of the Drosophila clock, which plays an important role in the control of TIM oscillations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Circadian clocks adjust the physiology and behavior of organisms to the day/night cycle and rely on molecular feedback loops that generate daily oscillations of transcription. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fruit fly, the PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) proteins coordinate the clock–they accumulate during the night, form a complex, and repress their own gene expression in the early morning. The temporal control of this oscillation involves the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of the PER and TIM proteins. The SUPERNUMERARY LIMBS (SLMB) ubiquitin ligase is known to play a key role in controlling the degradation of phosphorylated PER and TIM. In this study we investigated the role of another ubiquitin ligase, CULLIN-3 (CUL-3). We found that inhibition of CUL-3 activity results in the abolition of rest/activity rhythms in flies and flattens the PER and TIM oscillations. CUL-3 physically interacts and forms a complex with a lowphosphorylated version of TIM in the absence of PER, thereby allowing its accumulation during the night. In contrast, when PER is present SLMB preferentially interacts with phosphorylated TIM, favoring its degradation. The results suggest that CUL-3 and SLMB share the work to control the oscillations of the PER and TIM proteins during the day/night cycle.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Circadian clocks are present in most living organisms and control a variety of physiological and behavioral functions. Eukaryotic clocks stem from a transcriptional negative feedback loop where activators induce the expression of repressors, which then inhibit the activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-BellPedersen1">[1]</xref>. The accumulation of the repressor proteins is delayed by post-translational mechanisms, allowing us to define active and inactive phases of transcription, hence an oscillation. In Drosophila, the two basic helix-loop-helix PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH PAS) proteins CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) activate the transcription of their targets in the evening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Allada1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Hardin1">[3]</xref>. The target genes <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>) and <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>) encode two proteins that associate in a complex, progressively accumulate, and become phosphorylated to repress CLK/CYC-dependent transcription in the late night. The delayed accumulation, nuclear entry, and transcriptional activity of PER and TIM involve their phosphorylation by several kinases such as DOUBLE TIME (DBT) CK1ε <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Kloss1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Muskus1">[10]</xref> and NEMO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Chiu1">[11]</xref> that target PER. The CK2 casein kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Akten1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Meissner1">[14]</xref> and SHAGGY (SGG) GSK3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Martinek1">[15]</xref> rather target TIM. The phosphorylation of PER and TIM are also regulated by the phosphatases PP2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Sathyanarayanan1">[16]</xref> and PP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Fang1">[17]</xref>, respectively. Nuclear phosphorylated PER induces CLK phosphorylation and removal from the chromatin, then PER degradation in the morning allows CLK-CYC-dependent transcription to resume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Kim2">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Menet1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The pace of the oscillation depends largely on the speed of PER/TIM accumulation during the early night and degradation in the late night. The stability of phosphorylated PER and TIM is controlled by the SUPERNUMERARY LIMBS (SLMB) E3 ubiquitin ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Grima1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Ko1">[23]</xref>. For PER, the phosphorylation of a few serine residues around S47 by DBT cooperatively increases SLMB binding to PER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Chiu2">[24]</xref> and is negatively regulated by NEMO-controlled phosphorylation in the PER<sup>S</sup> region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Chiu1">[11]</xref> to finely tune PER stability. Both S47 phosphorylation and direct SLMB-binding occur at the end of the night, suggesting that SLMB controls nuclear PER at the end of the cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Chiu2">[24]</xref>. DBT has been proposed to also induce cytoplasmic PER degradation in the absence of TIM and thus control the delayed accumulation of PER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Kloss1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Kloss2">[6]</xref>. This model predicts that the control of cytoplasmic PER stability depends on TIM accumulation. CK2 has been suggested to destabilize TIM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Meissner1">[14]</xref>, whereas PP1 appears to favor TIM stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Fang1">[17]</xref>, but whether they affect SLMB function is unknown.</p>
      <p>In addition to SLMB that controls the circadian oscillations of TIM, the JETLAG (JET) E3 ligase targets TIM and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) for the light-induced proteasome-dependent protein degradation that participates to the resetting of the clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Koh1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Peschel2">[27]</xref>. The JET-dependent degradation, but not the SLMB-dependent one, appears to be regulated by the COP9 signalosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Knowles1">[28]</xref>. SLMB and JET are parts of CULLIN-1-based SCF complexes that belong to the RING family of E3 ubiquitin ligases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Nakayama1">[29]</xref>. SLMB plays a major role in CUBITUS INTERRUPTUS (CI) proteolysis, which generates the repressor form of the CI transcription factor in the absence of HEDGEHOG (HH) signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Jiang1">[30]</xref>. In addition to SLMB, other components of the HH pathway such as CK1, CK2, and SGG are shared with the circadian oscillator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Hooper1">[31]</xref>. Another ubiquitin complex, based on CULLIN-3, has been shown to participate in the proteolytic regulation of CI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Ou1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Zhang1">[35]</xref>. Since SLMB alone unlikely regulates all aspects of the circadian control of PER and TIM stability, we asked whether CULLIN-3 may participate in the control of PER and/or TIM oscillations. We show that CUL-3 downregulation induces strong defects of rest-activity rhythms, which mainly result from the loss of TIM cycling. Indeed, CUL-3 forms protein complexes with hypo-phosphorylated TIM, which are favored in the absence of PER, suggesting that CUL-3 participates in the control of the night accumulation of TIM. In contrast, SLMB is present in complexes that contain more phosphorylated TIM and are favored by the presence of PER, suggesting a rather later role in the TIM cycle.</p>

        <title>Deregulation of CUL-3 in the Clock Neurons Induces Behavioral Arrhythmicity</title>
        <p>Since <italic>Cul-3</italic> mutants are homozygous lethal, we first used targeted expression of <italic>Cul-3</italic> RNAi to test the possible role of CUL-3 in the control of behavioral rhythms. About 150 neurons express PER and TIM in the brain, and various studies have assigned specific behavioral contributions to defined neuronal subsets, depending on the environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Dubruille1">[36]</xref>. In particular, PER cycling in the lateral neurons (LNs) that express the Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF) generates morning activity in light-dark (LD) cycles and free running rhythms in constant darkness (DD), whereas PER cycling in the PDF-negative LNs generates LD evening activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Grima2">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Stoleru1">[38]</xref>. Expressing <italic>Cul-3</italic> RNAi in all clock cells under <italic>tim-gal4</italic> control induced 100% lethality, but a limited number of adult flies could be obtained with the <italic>Clk-gal4</italic> driver, whose expression is less broad than <italic>tim-gal4</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Kaneko1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Gummadova1">[40]</xref>, and no lethality was observed with the more restricted <italic>cry-gal4</italic> and <italic>Pdf-gal4</italic> drivers. In LD cycles, flies expressing <italic>Cul-3</italic> RNAi under <italic>Pdf-gal4</italic> or <italic>Clk-gal4</italic> control displayed no or reduced morning anticipatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s012">Table S1</xref>). The two genotypes also showed reduced lights-ON startle response. After transfer to DD, RNAi genotypes either showed weak rhythms or became arrhythmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001367-t001">Table 1</xref>). We also used the <italic>gal1118</italic> driver, which is mostly expressed in the PDF cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Blanchardon1">[41]</xref>. Reduced morning anticipation in LD and strongly altered rhythms in DD were observed when <italic>Cul-3</italic> RNAi expression was driven by <italic>gal1118</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s001">Figure S1</xref>). No disappearance of the lights-ON startle response was observed, supporting a genetic background effect in the previous genotypes. Importantly, the effect of <italic>Cul-3</italic> RNAi on <italic>Cul-3</italic> mRNA levels was tested by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s002">Figure S2</xref>). <italic>Cul-3RNAi</italic> induced a 2-fold decrease of <italic>Cul-3</italic> mRNAs in head extracts when driven by <italic>Clk-gal4</italic> or 5-fold in larvae when using the ubiquitous <italic>da-gal4</italic> (<italic>daughterless</italic>), supporting decreased CUL-3 activity in the RNAi flies. For RNAi genotypes, two copies of both the <italic>gal4</italic> and <italic>UAS</italic> transgenes were required for generating arrhythmic behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s001">S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001367-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Two inactive forms of CUL-3 were then expressed in the clock neurons. Both forms lack the site for the addition of Nedd8, a CULLIN modification that is required for ubiquitin transfer from E2 to the substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Merlet1">[42]</xref>. CUL-3<sup>K717R</sup> bears a mutation in the neddylation site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Zhu1">[43]</xref>, whereas CUL-3<sup>ΔC</sup> lacks the conserved C-terminal domain that includes this site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Mistry1">[44]</xref>. Expression of one or the other inactive protein under the control of a <italic>Pdf-gal4</italic>, <italic>cry-gal4</italic>, or <italic>Clk-gal4</italic> driver did not significantly affect behavior (unpublished data), suggesting that they were less efficient than RNAi for decreasing CUL-3 activity in the clock neurons. Driving their expression with <italic>tim-gal4</italic> did not induce lethality, also supporting weaker effect compared to <italic>Cul-3</italic> RNAi. We thus used <italic>gal1118</italic> and <italic>tim-gal4</italic> to test the effect of CUL3<sup>K717R</sup> on behavioral rhythms. LD morning anticipation was reduced and DD free running rhythms were lost or altered in flies expressing either one of two different CUL3<sup>K717R</sup>-encoding constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001367-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s001">S1</xref>), indicating that the modified CUL-3 protein was acting as a dominant negative form. Rhythms were restored when GAL4 activity was inhibited by a <italic>cry-gal80</italic> transgene, confirming that CUL-3 was required in clock cells for controlling behavior (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001367-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The latter genotype suggested that supernumerary CUL-3 molecules might interfere with the function of the protein, as reported for SLMB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Grima1">[22]</xref>. Targeted expression of RNAi or mutant protein as well as overexpression of the wild type protein thus revealed that CUL-3 activity was required in the clock neurons for strong morning anticipation in LD and rhythmic behavior in DD. Although <italic>tim-gal4</italic> and <italic>Clk-gal4</italic> are expressed in all clock neurons, evening anticipation could still be observed in flies with altered CUL-3 activity.</p>
        <p>Since <italic>Cul-3</italic> mutants affect the axonal growth of the mushroom body neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Zhu1">[43]</xref>, we tested the possibility that developmental effects of CUL3 deregulation would be responsible for the behavioral defects. We took advantage of the fact that GAL4-driven expression is temperature-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Duffy1">[45]</xref> and compared the behavior of RNAi flies grown at 25°C and tested at either 25°C or 20°C. Adult flies tested at 20°C showed significantly weaker defects than those tested at 25°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001367-t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the adult stage was determinant for CUL-3 function in activity rhythms. We also checked the morphology of the PDF cells expressing <italic>Cul-3</italic> RNAi or inactive CUL-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Anti-PDF labeling did not show any detectable morphological defects of the PDF-positive ventral lateral neurons in flies expressing <italic>Cul-3</italic> RNAi. Slightly more defasciculated projections and reduced arborization in the medulla were observed for flies expressing CUL-3<sup>ΔC</sup> but not in the other genotypes. One or two additional PDF-positive cells were sometimes seen in flies expressing either CUL-3<sup>ΔC</sup> or CUL-3<sup>K717R</sup> (unpublished data). Altogether, the data indicated that the behavioral phenotype induced by CUL-3 downregulation was, at least for a large part, not a consequence of a developmental defect.</p>

        <title>CUL-3 Controls PER and TIM Oscillations in the Clock Neurons</title>
        <p>To understand the molecular bases of the behavioral alterations displayed by the flies with deregulated CUL-3, PER and TIM oscillations were analyzed in their PDF-expressing small ventral lateral neurons (s-LNvs). In LD conditions, <italic>w ; Pdf-gal4; UAS-Cul-3RNAi</italic> (hereafter <italic>Pdf&gt;RNAi</italic>) flies showed dampened PER and TIM oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The two proteins failed to reach wild-type peak levels during the night, indicating that their nighttime accumulation was affected by <italic>Cul-3</italic> downregulation. Interestingly, PER and TIM appeared slightly more evenly distributed between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in the RNAi flies (see ZT24 in particular). Similarly dampened oscillations of the two proteins were also observed in the second day after transfer in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), providing a molecular basis for the behavioral arrhythmicity of these flies. Arrhythmic <italic>w ; tim-gal4 ; UAS-gfp-Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> (<italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic>) flies also showed altered PER and TIM oscillations, with a complete loss of TIM cycling on the third day of DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Although these flies should express inactive CUL-3 in all clock cells, they still displayed evening activity in LD conditions (see above). We thus suspected that PER and TIM oscillations might not be affected in their “evening” CRY-expressing dorsal lateral neurons (LNds). Indeed, a 30%–40% decrease of TIM immunoreactivity was observed at peak time (ZT16-20) in the s-LNvs of <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies, whereas mutants and controls showed similar TIM labeling in the CRY-positive LNds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

        <title>CUL-3 Acts on PER and TIM Post-Transcriptionally</title>
        <p>PER and TIM oscillations were analyzed in head extracts of <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies. In LD conditions, mutant flies still showed robust PER (unpublished data) and TIM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s007">Figure S7</xref>) cycling. Since a strong dampening of PER and TIM oscillations was observed in the PDF cells under the same conditions, it suggested CUL-3 might have a less crucial role in the eye, which is the major source of clock proteins in the head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Zeng1">[46]</xref>, at least in LD cycles. Alternatively, the lower expression of the <italic>tim-gal4</italic> driver in the eye (unpublished data) might not produce sufficiently high levels of CUL-3<sup>K717R</sup> protein to affect LD oscillations, which are strongly driven by light. We then looked at protein oscillations in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s008">Figure S8</xref>). At DD1, only subtle defects could be observed on PER and TIM cycling, with slightly more phosphorylated proteins at night in the mutant. At DD2, TIM cycling was strongly altered in the mutant with similar levels of phosphorylated TIM at all time points and weak cycling of unphosphorylated TIM, which stayed at relatively low levels. A very similar phenotype was observed in flies with two copies of <italic>tim-gal4</italic> driving a single copy of <italic>UAS-flag-Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s009">Figure S9</xref>) or a single copy of both <italic>UAS-gfp-Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> and <italic>UAS-Cul-3<sup>ΔC</sup></italic> (unpublished data). Phosphatase treatment abolished the slow migrating TIM forms of <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s010">Figure S10</xref>), demonstrating that they were indeed phosphorylated TIM. The constitutive presence of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of TIM supported a post-translational effect of CUL-3. Similarly altered TIM cycling was observed in flies with overexpressing wild type CUL-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001367.s011">Figure S11</xref>), suggesting that excess of wild type protein might interfere with the formation of functional complexes with the proper stoichiometry. Since <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3RNAi</italic> were lethal, we analyzed TIM in head extracts of <italic>Clk&gt;Cul-3RNAi</italic> flies, although it is less efficient than <italic>tim-gal4</italic> to affect molecular oscillations in head extracts when used to drive RNAi targeted against various clock genes (unpublished data). At DD2, TIM cycling was strongly reduced, but the accumulation of phosphorylated TIM was less prominent than in flies expressing CUL-3<sup>K717R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The data indicated that deregulating CUL-3 strongly reduces TIM cycling, with mostly hypo-phosphorylated TIM in <italic>Clk&gt;Cul-3RNAi</italic> flies and similar amounts of phosphorylated TIM and hypo-phosphorylated TIM in <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>In both <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> and <italic>Clk&gt;Cul-3RNAi</italic> flies, PER cycling was still observed at day 2, but it was dampened. More phosphorylated and less unphosphorylated protein was observed at the beginning of the night (CT36), with a stronger phenotype in the <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Since PER oscillations were less rapidly affected than TIM oscillations, it suggested that CUL-3 might control TIM more directly than PER.</p>
        <p>We then asked how CUL-3 deregulation affected <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> mRNA levels. mRNA were quantified in head extracts of <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> and control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g004">Figure 4</xref>). For both <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic>, mRNA levels still cycled at day 2 (left panels) in the mutant, but peak levels were about 25% lower. At day 3 (right panels), <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> mRNA oscillations were more severely dampened, with peak levels lowered by about 40%. Decreased mRNA thus likely contributed to the lower levels of unphosphorylated PER and TIM at the beginning of the night (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Since <italic>tim</italic> mRNA levels still showed oscillations at DD2 while phosphorylated TIM was already flat, it was unlikely that the protein defect was a consequence of altered mRNA cycling. PER protein and <italic>per</italic> mRNA showed dampened oscillations at DD2 in the flies expressing CUL-3<sup>K717R</sup>. However, the mRNA increase began to slow down at CT30 when more phosphorylated PER was observed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that higher phosphorylated PER levels were responsible for lower mRNA accumulation and subsequent lower PER and TIM synthesis. The data thus supported CUL3 acting at the protein level to control PER and TIM oscillations.</p>

        <p>To understand how CUL-3 controls PER and TIM proteins, we analyzed PER in <italic>tim<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies and TIM in <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

In contrast, <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies showed accumulation of phosphorylated TIM, thus indicating that CUL-3 does not require PER to induce destabilization of phosphorylated TIM. This result thus supports TIM as being phosphorylated and degraded in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies, in the presence of CUL-3. Interestingly, <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies had a higher phosphorylated/unphosphorylated TIM ratio than <italic>per<sup>+</sup> tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies (see CT 12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g006">6A</xref>), suggesting that the presence of PER partly inhibits CUL-3 action on TIM. It has been reported that hypo-phosphorylated TIM is mostly cytoplasmic in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Myers1">[49]</xref>. Since CUL-3 downregulation affected TIM in the absence of PER, CUL-3 could act in the cytoplasmic compartment. Indeed, TIM immunolabeling was mainly cytoplasmic in both <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> and <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies, although some faint nuclear labeling was observed in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This supported the hypothesis that CUL-3 is able to control the accumulation of phosphorylated TIM in the cytoplasm.</p>
        <p>We then asked whether a <italic>tim</italic> deletion affecting TIM phosphorylation and stability would affect CUL-3-dependent stabilization. <italic>tim<sup>0</sup> tim<sup>Δ260–292</sup></italic> flies carry a <italic>tim</italic> transgene with a 32 aa deletion in a conserved N-terminal region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Ousley1">[50]</xref>.

No effect of CUL-3 downregulation could be observed in <italic>tim<sup>0</sup> tim<sup>Δ260–292</sup></italic> flies, indicating that the TIM<sup>Δ260–292</sup> protein is insensitive to CUL-3 control as opposed to the unphosphorylated TIM that accumulates in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

        <title>CUL-3 and SLMB Stabilize Phosphorylated TIM through Different Pathways</title>
        <p>In DD, both PER and TIM are stabilized in <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> mutants, which do not have detectable SLMB protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Grima1">[22]</xref>. We thus asked whether decreasing CUL-3 activity in <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> mutants would show additional effects on TIM stability. In the presence of both PER and TIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> and <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies showed a progressive increase of phosphorylated TIM in DD, leading to an equivalent amount of hypo-phosphorylated and phosphorylated protein at day 2 (CT 33 and 39). However, <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> mutants showed a slightly higher TIM molecular weight than <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies. In the double mutants, a progressive loss of unphosphorylated TIM was observed, leading to a large excess of phosphorylated protein at day 2, migrating similarly to the high molecular weight TIM of <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> mutants. Moderately phosphorylated PER accumulated in the <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies, whereas hyper-phosphorylated protein was observed in both <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> and double mutants, with even higher forms progressively accumulating in the double mutants. To confirm this interaction, PER was analyzed in LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), where SLMB has limited effects on PER cycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Grima1">[22]</xref>. At ZT3, only a small increase of PER levels was observed in <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> and <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies, confirming that the downregulation of the two ubiquitin ligases was for a large part compensated by light, although PER was a bit more phosphorylated in the double mutant. At night, moderately phosphorylated PER accumulated in <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies, higher forms of phosphorylated PER were observed in <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic>, and very highly phosphorylated protein accumulated in the double mutant. Our data thus indicated that SLMB and CUL-3 had additive or synergistic effects on PER and TIM phosphorylation. Furthermore, <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> mutants appeared to stabilize higher forms of both PER and TIM compared to <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies.</p>
        <p>To better understand the respective roles of SLMB and CUL-3, we compared the effects of the two mutants on PER and TIM in <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> and <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> backgrounds, respectively. Whereas <italic>tim<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies showed a mild increase of PER phosphorylation, <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Grima1">[22]</xref>) and double mutants accumulated large amounts of similar highly phosphorylated PER when associated with a <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The absence of TIM thus enhanced the effect of <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> mutants on PER, revealing that SLMB-dependent PER degradation is decreased by TIM. Since no difference was observed between <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> and the double mutant in a <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> background, it indicated that CUL-3 requires TIM to show synergistic effects with SLMB on the PER protein. In the absence of PER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> mutants accumulated less phosphorylated TIM than in a <italic>per<sup>+</sup></italic> background, revealing that SLMB-dependent TIM degradation is increased by PER. Since similarly high levels of phosphorylated TIM accumulated in both <italic>per<sup>0</sup> tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> and <italic>per<sup>0</sup> slmb<sup>m</sup> tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> mutants, it indicated that SLMB requires PER to show additive or synergistic effects with CUL-3 on the TIM protein.</p>

        <p>Since TIM appears to be the main target of CUL-3, we asked whether the two proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated from head extracts of flies expressing a FLAG-tagged version of CUL-3. A BTB-domain protein is likely to provide the substrate-binding component of the CUL-3 complex and indirect interactions would be predicted. We generated <italic>tim&gt;flag-Cul-3</italic> flies in a heterozygous <italic>Cul-3</italic> mutant background to reduce competition between endogenous and tagged CUL-3 proteins for immunoprecipitation assays. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitated extracts from such flies showed a faint TIM band that corresponded to hypo-phosphorylated TIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, left). Since CUL-3 effect on TIM was higher in the absence of PER, a <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> background would be expected to favor TIM-CUL-3 interactions. Indeed, a stronger hypo-phosphorylated TIM band was detected in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies, with TIM amount being further increased in heterozygous <italic>Cul-3<sup>gft2</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, right). The results thus indicated that CUL-3 and hypo-phosphorylated TIM associate in complexes that are more abundant in the absence of PER. We then compared the properties of TIM/CUL-3 complexes and TIM/SLMB complexes. Immunoprecipitation of tagged SLMB was done in <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> flies where tagged SLMB was expressed under <italic>tim-gal4</italic> control to reduce competition between FLAG-SLMB and the endogenous protein. SLMB co-immunoprecipitated more phosphorylated TIM than hypo-phosphorylated TIM in <italic>per<sup>+</sup></italic> flies, but also co-immunoprecipitated hypo-phosphorylated TIM in a <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, left). However, the amount of TIM/SLMB complexes did not increase in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies, where much higher levels of TIM are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, right). In contrast to TIM/CUL-3 complexes, TIM/SLMB complexes thus mostly involve phosphorylated TIM. These complexes are favored in the presence of PER, suggesting that they involve PER-bound TIM.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The control of PER and TIM oscillations in the Drosophila clock relies for a large part on post-translational modifications of the two proteins. PER stability depends on the SLMB-containing SCF ubiquitin ligase complex and requires PER phosphorylation by DBT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Chiu1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Grima1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Chiu2">[24]</xref>. Although TIM stops cycling in <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Grima1">[22]</xref>, the circadian control of TIM stability is poorly understood. We have shown here that in addition to SLMB, CUL-3-based ubiquitin ligase complexes play a major role in the control of PER and TIM cycling, with TIM appearing to be the major target of CUL-3 effects. The results indicate that SLMB and CUL-3 differently control the stability of phosphorylated TIM and support opposite effects of PER on the two TIM degradation pathways.</p>
      <p>In both LD and DD conditions, <italic>Pdf&gt;Cul-3RNAi</italic> and <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies show a nice correlation between dampened PER/TIM oscillations in the PDF neurons and the loss or reduction of morning activity in LD as well as free running rhythms in DD. Since light strongly induces TIM degradation, it likely counteracts the effect of CUL-3 downregulation on TIM cycling and makes difficult the analysis of CUL3 function in LD. The apparently normal TIM oscillations observed in the LNds in LD correlates with the presence of evening activity but contrasts with the dampened oscillations of the sLNvs. It suggests that light-induced TIM degradation is more efficient in the LNds than in the sLNvs, as recently reported in an early night short light pulse paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Tang1">[51]</xref>, although we cannot exclude that CUL-3 function is more important in the PDF cells. Head extracts of <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies in LD also show robust PER and TIM oscillations, but the lower expression of <italic>tim-gal</italic> in the eye likely explains the weaker effects in head extracts compared to PDF cells.</p>
      <p>In DD, PER and TIM oscillations are both affected in flies with downregulated CUL-3. However, the dampening of TIM oscillations occurs faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In addition, limited effects of CUL-3 donwregulation were observed on PER, especially in <italic>tim<sup>0</sup></italic> flies, whereas a strong effect was observed on TIM and it was increased in a <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> background. Finally, TIM-CUL-3 complexes could be isolated and were more abundant in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> extracts. These results support TIM as the main target of CUL-3 circadian function, with a major part of the effects on PER being a consequence of TIM modifications. The presence of phosphorylated TIM at all time points in flies expressing dominant negative CUL-3 suggests a post-translational effect of CUL-3 on TIM. <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies also show <italic>tim</italic> mRNA changes, but the kinetics of CUL-3 effects on <italic>tim</italic> mRNA levels and TIM protein suggests that the protein is first affected. The strong effect of CUL-3 downregulation on TIM protein in the absence of PER also makes unlikely the possibility that CUL-3 acts on the circadian control of CLK-CYC-dependent transcription. Finally, a decrease of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> mRNA peak levels is the expected consequence of more phosphorylated PER at the end of the day.</p>
      <p>Since phosphorylated TIM accumulates in <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies, CUL-3 downregulation could either enhance TIM phosphorylation or stabilize phosphorylated TIM. The putative ubiquitin ligase function of CUL-3 rather favors a direct role in the control of TIM levels in the mutants. This would be in agreement with the presence of TIM and CUL-3 in protein complexes, but only the identification of the substrate-recognition protein of the complex will allow us to test for direct interactions. The present data do not exclude that CUL-3 destabilizes an associated TIM kinase. Since no changes in SGG or CK2β levels were observed in <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies (unpublished data), more subtle modifications would have to be involved or a yet uncharacterized TIM kinase would have to be destabilized by CUL-3. We thus believe that the simplest interpretation is a direct control of TIM by CUL-3. In this hypothesis, CUL-3 could either control the stability of phosphorylated TIM or control the stability of hypo-phosphorylated TIM, which would then be stabilized and subsequently phosphorylated more extensively. For example, accumulation of phosphorylated PER has been reported in long period <italic>dbt</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Price1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Suri1">[52]</xref>, where defective phosphorylation of the SLMB-binding site induces the subsequent accumulation of normally unstable phosphorylated forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Chiu2">[24]</xref>. Why does phosphorylated TIM not accumulate in <italic>Clk&gt;Cul-3RNAi</italic> flies? Since they only show a 2-fold decrease of <italic>Cul-3</italic> mRNA in head extracts, they are likely to display a weak phenotype compared to <italic>tim&gt;Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies. The absence of phosphorylated TIM in the RNAi flies would thus support CUL-3 acting on several forms of TIM, with phosphorylated TIM being more sensitive to degradation than hypo-phosphorylated TIM.</p>
      <p>Even if TIM phosphorylation facilitates CUL-3-controlled degradation, our experiments suggest that CUL-3 preferentially targets TIM proteins that are less phosphorylated than those targeted by SLMB. First, the Co-IP experiments in <italic>per<sup>+</sup></italic> flies indicate that CUL-3 preferentially binds to hypo-phosphorylated TIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), whereas SLMB preferentially interacts with phosphorylated TIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). In addition, TIM-CUL-3 complexes are more abundant in <italic>per<sup>0</sup></italic> flies, where TIM is hypo-phosphorylated and cytoplasmic, whereas TIM-SLMB complexes are similarly abundant. Second, the absence of PER enhances the effects of CUL-3 on TIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g005">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g006">6D</xref>), suggesting that CUL-3 preferentially targets unbound TIM protein, which is mostly present in the evening when TIM is less phosphorylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Zeng2">[48]</xref>. In contrast, the absence of PER reduced the accumulation of phosphorylated TIM in <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that SLMB preferentially targets PER-bound TIM protein. Most importantly, higher forms of phosphorylated TIM accumulate in <italic>slmb<sup>m</sup></italic> and double mutants compared to <italic>Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001367-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This suggests that highly phosphorylated TIM is still degraded when CUL-3 is downregulated, while it is not degraded in the absence of SLMB. The results thus favor a model where CUL-3 plays a major role in the control of free less phosphorylated TIM, whereas SLMB appears more important to control PER-bound highly phosphorylated TIM. The accumulation of PER also depends on both TIM-dependent and TIM-independent effects. Both CUL-3 and SLMB play a role in PER degradation in the absence of TIM, but TIM increases CUL-3-controlled degradation, whereas it decreases SLMB-controlled degradation.</p>
      <p>CUL-3 complexes recognize substrates through a BTB-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Pintard1">[53]</xref>, and the ROADKILL (RDX) protein has been shown to target the CI transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Kent1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Zhang1">[35]</xref>. Expression of several <italic>rdx</italic> RNAi constructs in the clock cells did not show any behavioral phenotype (unpublished data), suggesting that TIM is targeted by another member of the large BTB-domain protein family. A recent study has revealed that the BTB domain protein encoded by the <italic>insomniac</italic> gene is involved in the control of sleep by specifically affecting sleep bout duration, but <italic>insomniac</italic> does not appear to have a circadian function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Stavropoulos1">[54]</xref>. The importance of serine-rich regions as putative degrons has been revealed for the degradation of CI by the CUL-3/RDX complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Zhang2">[55]</xref>. Several serine-rich regions are present in TIM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Meissner1">[14]</xref> and might thus contain target sites for CUL-3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. The fast migration of TIM<sup>Δ260–292</sup> in both <italic>Cul-3<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Cul-3<sup>K717R</sup></italic> flies suggests that no phosphorylation can occur on this form of TIM or that phosphorylated TIM<sup>Δ260–292</sup> cannot accumulate even with downregulated CUL-3. The absence of putative phosphorylation sites in TIM<sup>Δ260–292</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Meissner1">[14]</xref> may suggest that such sites are required to generate CUL-3-sensitive TIM proteins. At the end of the cycle, TIM is degraded before PER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Rothenfluh1">[56]</xref>, suggesting that TIM degradation may occur within the nuclear PER/TIM complex. Our results rather support SLMB as the major player of this late night nuclear degradation, as it is for PER. SLMB acts on PER through an atypical SLMB-binding site whose progressive phosphorylation during the night increases its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Chiu2">[24]</xref>. No canonical SLMB recognition site was observed in TIM, but the loose conservation of such motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Chiu2">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Smelkinson1">[57]</xref> leaves room for the occurrence of non-canonical sites in the TIM protein. A detailed analysis of TIM phosphorylation sites will be required to understand how the phosphorylation of the protein determines its destabilization by CUL-1 and CUL-3 complexes.</p>
      <p>Although both CUL-1 and CUL-3 complexes might control TIM indirectly, the possibility that they share the work to control TIM ubiquitination is interesting. For example, CUL-1/SLMB controls the proteolysis of highly phosphorylated CI, whereas CUL-3/RDX appears to control the degradation of a less phosphorylated form of the protein (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Zhang1">[35]</xref>). The preference of CUL-3 for complexing with hypo-phosphorylated TIM and the one of SLMB for targeting more phosphorylated forms suggests that similar mechanisms may apply to TIM. In the mammalian clock, CRY has a function similar to TIM by acting within PER/CRY complexes to repress CLK/BMAL1-dependent transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Takahashi1">[58]</xref>. It has been shown that the SLMB ortholog βTrCP controls PER1/2 stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Shirogane1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Reischl1">[61]</xref>, whereas another F-box ubiquitin ligase, FBXL3, controls CRY stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Siepka1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001367-Busino1">[64]</xref>. It will be interesting to see whether the two ubiquitin ligases also show preferences for different phosphorylation levels of the clock components.</p>
