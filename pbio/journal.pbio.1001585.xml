<title/>
<p>Evolutionarily conserved, nonvisual opsins appear to endow specific interneurons and motorneurons of the vertebrate brain with light sensitivity, suggesting that environmental light may be able to modulate information processing.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The functional principle of the vertebrate brain is often paralleled to a computer: information collected by dedicated devices is processed and integrated by interneuron circuits and leads to output. However, inter- and motorneurons present in today's vertebrate brains are thought to derive from neurons that combined sensory, integration, and motor function. Consistently, sensory inter­motorneurons have been found in the simple nerve nets of cnidarians, animals at the base of the evolutionary lineage. We show that light-sensory motorneurons and light-sensory interneurons are also present in the brains of vertebrates, challenging the paradigm that information processing and output circuitry in the central brain is shielded from direct environmental influences. We investigated two groups of nonvisual photopigments, VAL- and TMT-Opsins, in zebrafish and medaka fish; two teleost species from distinct habitats separated by over 300 million years of evolution. TMT-Opsin subclasses are specifically expressed not only in hypothalamic and thalamic deep brain photoreceptors, but also in interneurons and motorneurons with no known photoreceptive function, such as the typeXIV interneurons of the fish optic tectum. We further show that TMT-Opsins and Encephalopsin render neuronal cells light-sensitive. TMT-Opsins preferentially respond to blue light relative to rhodopsin, with subclass-specific response kinetics. We discovered that <italic>tmt-opsins</italic> co-express with <italic>val-opsins</italic>, known green light receptors, in distinct inter- and motorneurons. Finally, we show by electrophysiological recordings on isolated adult tectal slices that interneurons in the position of typeXIV neurons respond to light. Our work supports “sensory-inter-motorneurons” as ancient units for brain evolution. It also reveals that vertebrate inter- and motorneurons are endowed with an evolutionarily ancient, complex light-sensory ability that could be used to detect changes in ambient light spectra, possibly providing the endogenous equivalent to an optogenetic machinery.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The brains of vertebrates consist mainly of interneurons—neurons processing information coming from other neurons. Light information is believed to enter the brain through dedicated photoreceptor cells that are distinct from these processing cells, and motorneurons then relay the information to the musculature. Here we analyze two slowly evolving groups of vertebrate photopigment proteins, TMT-opsins and VAL-opsins, and find that both opsins are expressed in interneurons and motorneurons in medaka fish and zebrafish. Although these species diverged from a common ancestor over 300 million years ago and live in different habitats, the opsin localization is highly similar, suggesting a fundamental shared role for these proteins. Cultured cells expressing TMT-opsins respond to light, and electrophysiological recordings on adult brain slices identify a distinct set of light-sensitive interneurons. Based on our work, we argue that endogenous TMT- and VAL-opsin expression confers light-sensitivity on interneurons and motorneurons, and we propose two hypotheses. First, that modern vertebrate sensory neurons, interneurons, and motorneurons may derive from a common cell type that combined sensory, information processing and motor output functions. Second, that environmental light may modulate information transmission and processing in a distinct set of vertebrate interneurons and motorneurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Light impacts directly and indirectly on major processes of animal life, ranging from the entrainment of biological clocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Cermakian1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Doyle1">2</xref> to the visual guidance of behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Kandel1">[3]</xref>. It is commonly believed that such photosensory information enters into the vertebrate brain via dedicated sensory organs, is processed by interneurons, and can subsequently impact on motorneuron output.</p>
<p>However, nervous system evolution is thought to have started from few neuron types that combined sensory, integrative, and neurosecretory or motor output function within the same cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Vigh1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Jekely2">[7]</xref>, similar to the “sensory-inter-motorneurons” of extant cnidarians, basally branching metazoans with a simple nerve net <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Westfall1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Westfall2">[9]</xref>. This hypothesis predicts that the division between input, processing, and output is not a necessary requirement of higher brain centers, but a result of secondary evolution. Support for this notion stems from the occurrence of distinct cells that directly combine sensory functions (photo- or chemoreception) and neurosecretion. Such cells exist in both invertebrate and vertebrate brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-TessmarRaible1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Vigh2">[10]</xref>. In vertebrates, photosensory-neurosecretory cells have been found in the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, and as interspersed cells in the lining of the brain ventricles in contact with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-contacting neurons) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-TessmarRaible1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Vigh2">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Neurosecretion, however, is only used by a subset of brain neurons, and constitutes a slower mode of cellular communication. Currently, no evidence exists that vertebrate interneurons and motorneurons, constituting the majority of neuron types in the vertebrate brain, also possess comparable sensory modalities, even though environmental light penetrates deep into the brains of vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Foster1">[11]</xref>, including mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Brunt1">[12]</xref>. If “sensory-inter-motorneurons” were indeed present at the base of animal brain evolution, sensory-motorneurons and sensory-interneurons could still persist in the vertebrate central nervous system.</p>
<p>To address this hypothesis, we focused our attention on opsins, light-sensitive proteins that are present in animals ranging from cnidarians to humans. In recent years, a number of Opsins including Pinopsin, VAL-opsin, and Neuropsin (Opn5) have been detected in vertebrate brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Davies1">[13]</xref>. These opsins have been shown to function as photopigments, and to be expressed in neurosecretory brain regions implicated in circadian or seasonal control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Okano1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Yamashita1">[17]</xref>. A melanopsin expressed in the zebrafish larval preoptic area/hypothalamus has recently been suggested to mediate photokinesis, a light-seeking behavior triggered by loss of illumination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Fernandes1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast to the aforementioned opsins, TMT-Opsin has been suggested to be broadly, potentially ubiquitously, expressed and to represent a light receptor mediating the entrainment of the peripheral circadian clock in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Cavallari1">[19]</xref>. This presumptive function of TMT-Opsin and its specific confinement to teleosts is reflected in the name <italic>teleost multiple tissue opsin</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Moutsaki1">[20]</xref>. Whole mount in situ hybridizations on zebrafish larvae, however, localized <italic>tmt-opsin</italic> mRNA specifically to neurosecretory cells in the preoptic area/hypothalamus, challenging the hypothesis that TMT-Opsin would function as a peripheral light receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-TessmarRaible1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>We started our study by an investigation of TMT-Opsin, using the vertebrate model organisms zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) and medaka fish (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization experiments on adult brain sections reveal that <italic>tmtopsins</italic> are expressed not only in photoreceptive cells of the pineal, interneurons in the eye, and presumptive CSF-contacting neurosecretory cells. They are also expressed in brain nuclei neither connected to light sensation nor neurosecretion, such as the dorsal tegmental nucleus, the nucleus semicircular torus, the facial nerve nucleus, the periventricular layer of the tectum, and the granular layer of the olfactory bulb. In addition to the evolutionary conservation in expression over at least 300 million years, anti-TMTopsin1b staining reveals protein expression in neurons in these brain nuclei, suggesting that these opsins exhibit functions important for the animals. The neuronal nature of several <italic>tmt-opsin</italic>+ cells is confirmed by the co-expression of <italic>cholineacetyltransferase</italic> (<italic>chat</italic>), identifying them as interneurons and motorneurons. Anti-ChAT staining identifies typeXIV interneurons of Meek and Schellart in the teleost optic tectum among the <italic>tmt-opsin+</italic> cells. Expression of TMT-Opsins does not only render neuronal cells light sensitive in tissue culture, but we also show that interneurons at the position of typeXIV interneurons in isolated tectal slices of adult brains show electrophysiological responses to light.</p>
<p>Finally, we find that a subpopulation of <italic>tmt-opsin</italic>+ cells, including motorneurons of the facial nerve nucleus, co-express other <italic>tmt-</italic> and/or <italic>val-opsins</italic>, thereby endowing these supposedly non-sensory neurons with an unexpectedly complex ability to respond to light. The co-expression of ancient, functional inner brain opsins in specific inter- and motorneurons of the vertebrate brain lends strong support to the hypothesis that the diversity of vertebrate neurons evolved by multiplication and subfunctionalization of an ancient set of sensory-inter-motorneurons.</p>

<title>TMT-Opsins and Encephalopsins Are Ancestral-Type Opsins Deeply Conserved across Vertebrates</title>
<p>Two teleost TMT-Opsins (<italic>tmtopsa</italic>, <italic>tmtopsb</italic>) are currently reported in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Fernandes1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Moutsaki1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Shiraki1">[21]</xref>. Predicted protein sequence analysis of various vertebrate genomes revealed that vertebrates possess three distinct, conserved TMT-Opsin groups. In accordance with zebrafish nomenclature conventions, we termed these three groups TMT-Opsin 1, 2, and 3 and classified the already known TMT-Opsins into group 1, consequentially renaming them to <italic>tmtops1a</italic> and <italic>tmtops1b</italic>. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TMT-Opsins and Encephalopsins are sister groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We jointly refer to both as the Encephalopsin-TMT-Opsin (ETO) family.</p>

<p>Closer sequence comparisons revealed that TMT-Opsins possess a conserved c-terminal domain typical for ciliary (c-)opsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Arendt1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g001">Figure 1B–D</xref>), but share counterion residue with protostomian c-opsins and rhabdomeric (r-)opsins/melanopsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). These features, together with their short branch lengths and overall strong sequence similarity with protostomian opsins, evidence that TMT-Opsins constitute an ancestral group of vertebrate c-opsins. In contrast, Encephalopsins differ in their counterion residue from TMT- and other opsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, they are characterized by a different c-terminal fingerprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) and possess an additional c-terminal domain, specifically conserved in Encephalopsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g001">Figure 1G</xref>), indicating that Encephalopsins might use different intracellular signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Genome and transcriptome analyses uncovered that the whole ETO family was already present at the base of vertebrates, as members of all four groups appear in teleosts, amphibians, and reptiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). TMT-Opsin 2 orthologs are even more widely conserved: We identified a full-length TMT-Opsin 2 ortholog in the Opossum (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>) genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and partial sequences in the Platypus (<italic>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</italic>) and Wallaby (<italic>Macropus eugenii</italic>) genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s015">Table S1</xref>). The fragmental nature of TMT-Opsins in platypus and wallaby likely reflects incomplete genome sequence assemblies, rather than mutated, partial TMT-Opsins. A screen of seven eutherian genomes revealed no TMT-Opsin orthologs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), suggesting that only Encephalopsins, but no other ETO members, are maintained in this mammalian subclass. This result is reminiscent of the loss of other opsin families in placental mammals, possibly linked to the lifestyle of their nocturnal ancestors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Davies1">[13]</xref>.</p>

<title>All ETO Groups Are Functional Photopigments Mediating Neuronal Photoreception</title>
<p>We next assessed if the encoded TMT-Opsins, as well as their sister group Encephalopsin, can indeed mediate photoreceptive functions.</p>
<p>All TMT-Opsin family members possess amino acid residues crucial for light detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). We addressed their functional light sensitivity, relative absorption maximum, and response kinetics using a novel cell culture assay. Neuronal (Neuro-2A) and non-neuronal (HEK293) cells were transfected with representative <italic>tmt-opsins</italic>, and the cellular responses to light were recorded with an impedance-based real-time cell analyzer (RTCA). In this methodology cells grow on gold electrodes in a tissue culture plate, and a small alternating electrical current is repeatedly passed through the plate. The resistance to this current (impedance) depends on the surface area covered by the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Yu1">[23]</xref> and possibly their channel conductance. The impedance values were converted into a dimensionless parameter, the cell index (CI). CI changes have been used in various tissue culture assays to monitor G-protein signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Scandroglio1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Watts1">[27]</xref>. We reasoned that this assay could also be used to monitor light-dependent activation of opsins, given that opsins belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and that recent findings suggest that opsins lead to morphological changes of the photoreceptor membrane upon illumination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Hardie1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>We first established that our positive control, human rhodopsin responded reliably in this assay upon light exposure of the transfected cells (red trace, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The CI increased upon light exposure, reaching its maximum within 4 min and declining to baseline within a few minutes after cessation of light. Upon illumination with a subsequent pulse of light, the cells reproducibly exhibited a similar light response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Although rhodopsin shows millisecond response in native photoreceptors, heterologous expression in mammalian cells typically produces a slower response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Zemelman1">[29]</xref>, likely reflecting differences in photopigment density and associated proteins. The cells transfected with the GPCR human Oxytocin receptor or untransfected cells did not show any response to light (black and grey traces, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This established that the cell impedance assay can be used to detect light-dependent activation of opsins.</p>

<p>TMT-opsins localized to the cell membrane in transfected cells (Figures S2 and S9A,B). Like the cells transfected with rhodopsin, these cells showed a clear change of CI values during light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Individual TMT-Opsins exhibited characteristic responses distinguished by peak response and deactivation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2B–D</xref>). Opsins use <italic>cis</italic>-retinal bound to a Lysine residue (equivalent of K296 of bovine rhodopsin) as the light-sensitive chromophore and mutation of this residue abolishes light responses in rhodopsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Longstaff1">[30]</xref>. Mutation of the orthologous Lysine residue to Alanine abolished the light response of all tested TMT-opsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2B–D,F</xref>). This establishes that TMT-Opsins of all classes are functional photopigments likely forming a Schiff's base adduct with a <italic>cis</italic>-retinal.</p>
<p>Significant differences in response kinetics can be seen between the different TMT-Opsin representatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). TMT-Opsins of group 2 showed a faster signal decay rate compared to opsins of group 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Impedance response profiles have previously even been used to discriminate between different downstream pathways of GPCRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Hamel1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Stallaert1">[26]</xref>. As orthologous opsins from both fish species respond similarly in our assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s003">Figure S3</xref>), these differences indicate functional diversity among the TMT-Opsin groups in their signaling properties. In summary, our results reveal that all tested TMT-Opsins are functional photopigments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2F</xref>) and that response properties differ among groups. Consistent with our findings, zebrafish TMT-Opsin 1a has recently been shown to activate the enhancer of a zebrafish <italic>period</italic> gene in tissue culture in a light-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Cavallari1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>We next tested the relative spectral sensitivity of TMT-Opsins. We adjusted the light intensity using a set of band-pass and neutral density filters in order to activate human rhodopsin equally strong with a blue and a green filter, thus calibrating the setup to the rhodopsin absorption maximum of 497 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Boynton1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s004">Figure S4A</xref>–B). To minimize well-to-well variations, we compared CI changes to color light with a preceding white light stimulus (results of quantification given as relative response (%AUC), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). All tested TMT-Opsins (medaka TMT-Opsin 1b, 2, and 3a) responded stronger to blue light (λ<sub>max</sub> 450 nm), compared to green (λ<sub>max</sub> 528 nm) or red (λ<sub>max</sub> 605 nm) light, than human rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s004">S4C–E</xref>). Also the absolute photon number values of the tested wavelengths were highly similar (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). None of the TMT-Opsins responded to near infrared light (950 nm, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
<p>We also tested the light sensitivity of Encephalopsin. The murine Encephalopsin ortholog has been shown to be specifically expressed in brain interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Blackshaw1">[32]</xref>. However, no evidence for a photoreceptor function of any Encephalopsin exists so far. With our assay we obtained clear light-dependent responses for medaka Encephalopsin in both Neuro-2A and HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2H,I</xref>). Even though the response maximum was lower than for TMT-Opsins, the response kinetics exhibited the typical trend seen for opsin activation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Again, mutation of Lysine 296 to Alanine abolished the light-dependent response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g002">Figure 2H,I</xref>), thus providing first evidence that Encephalopsins can function as light receptors.</p>

<title>TMT-Opsins Show Specific Expression in Larval and Adult Medaka Fish Brain</title>
<p>In order to characterize the spatial distribution of the members of the ETO groups, we performed a systematic set of <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) analyses. Medaka possesses two <italic>tmt-opsins</italic> from group 1 and 3, as well as one <italic>tmt-opsin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s015">Table S1</xref>). First, we examined expression patterns in medaka feeding larvae (stage 41/42), which revealed that all <italic>tmt-opsins</italic> are specifically expressed. We subsequently chose one member from each group for an in-depth characterization.</p>
<p>All three analyzed <italic>tmt-opsin</italic> representatives exhibited highly specific expression domains in discrete brain nuclei, the eye and the pineal, but no detectable expression outside the nervous system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s007">Figure S7A</xref>–D). The expression in the brain was not restricted to the diencephalon, the brain region typically associated with deep brain photoreceptors, but also included additional domains in the fore-, mid-, and the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). In order to investigate if this specific expression is maintained in adulthood or rather represents a transient larval feature, we performed ISH on serial sections of the adult medaka brain. We find that the expression in the adult brain is as specific as in larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s007">S7E–G</xref>).</p>

<p>Systematic analysis of <italic>tmt-opsin</italic>+ cell clusters revealed four types of expression sites in the anterior nervous system. Two of these fit with current knowledge about photosensory brain cells:</p>
<p>On the one hand, we found <italic>tmt-opsins</italic> to be present in cells directly associated with light sensory organs: <italic>tmtops1b</italic> and <italic>tmtops2</italic> are expressed in amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s007">Figure S7B</xref>,C). Moreover, <italic>tmtops2</italic> is present in the iris and the annular ligament of the eye (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s007">Figure S7C</xref>), as well as in the pineal organ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s007">Figure S7D</xref>,E).</p>
<p>On the other hand, several sites of <italic>tmt-opsin</italic> expression are also compatible with the notion that <italic>tmt-opsins</italic> are produced by inner brain sensory-neurosecretory cells. Previous analyses provided evidence for the existence of (at least in part CSF-contacting) photoreceptors in the vertebrate hypothalamus/preoptic area, as well as in the thalamus (summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Vigh2">[10]</xref>). Photoreceptors in these brain regions have been suggested to mediate photoperiodic reproductive physiology, as well as skin color regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Vigh2">[10]</xref>.

<title>TMT-Opsins Are Expressed in Inter- and Motorneurons on mRNA and Protein Level</title>
<p>Whereas the aforementioned expression sites concern domains and cell types previously associated with light sensation, we also identified two additional, unexpected categories of opsin-expressing cells that have so far not been associated with light-dependent functions.</p>
<p>First, we identified <italic>tmt-opsins</italic> in specific interneuron nuclei: We detected <italic>tmtops1b</italic> in the inner cellular layer of the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>) and <italic>tmtops3a</italic> in the second layer of the semicircular torus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>).

<p>Next, <italic>tmt-opsins</italic> also label at least one motorneuron nucleus: <italic>tmtops2 and 1b</italic> positive cells are present in the nucleus of the facial nerve located in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g003">Figures 3G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g004">4C</xref>).

Sense controls did not show any staining in the brain nuclei mentioned above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Using an antibody raised against TMT-Opsin 1b, we confirmed that opsin protein is present in cells of the identified inter- and motorneuron nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g004">Figure 4</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s009">Figure S9</xref> for controls, including pre-immune serum and peptide-neutralized antibody controls).</p>
<p>We next examined the neuronal identity of these opsins-expressing cells. Especially in the hindbrain, TMTopsin1b localizes to the beginning of projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), strongly suggesting that TMTopsin1b+ cells are neuronal. Furthermore, we used <italic>chat1</italic> and <italic>chat2</italic>, both orthologs of the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme, as markers specifically demarcating several interneuron populations in the teleost fore- and midbrain, as well as motorneurons in the facial nerve nucleus in the hindbrain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Mueller1">[35]</xref>.

<title>A Subset of Tectal Interneurons at the Position of <italic>TMT-opsin+</italic> Neurons Is Light Sensitive</title>
<p>Given that TMT-Opsins can render neuronal cells light-sensitive in tissue culture, their specific expression in inter- and motorneurons suggested that there might be intrinsically light-sensitive interneurons present in the medaka fish. To test this hypothesis, we turned to the optic tectum, as our expression analyses indicated that this structure harbors <italic>tmtopsin</italic>-positive cells in a relatively defined morphological region (see above). Antibody staining against ChAT confirmed the interneuronal nature of the <italic>tmtopsin1b</italic> and <italic>tmtopsin2-</italic>expressing cells, as clear neurite projections were visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The morphology of teleost tectal interneurons is unipolar, a morphology otherwise typical for insect neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Arrenberg1">[36]</xref>.

<p>Next, we established patch-clamp whole-cell recordings from the adult tectum. To exclude any possible input from known photoreceptors in the retina or the pineal, we recorded from tectal slices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s011">Figure S11</xref>). In the absence of any morphological feature indicative of light-sensitive neurons, we randomly recorded from neurons, expecting only a small fraction of the recorded units would show photosensitivity. We first recorded neurons (at the soma) under darkness. Their response was quantified by calculating the membrane potential change relative to the reference point just before the cells would be illuminated in the light response test experiment (time = 0). In darkness, changes in membrane potential remained well below 10 mV and showed no significant difference between the analyzed time points (two representative example traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, whole dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, <italic>N</italic> = 14). Next, we tested light-sensitivity by administering a 1 min light pulse after 2 min of recording under darkness. The majority of neurons (<italic>N</italic> = 22) showed no change in membrane potential in response to light beyond what had been observed for the dark control (two representative example traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, whole dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), thus excluding the possibility that illumination causes any systemic bias in our measurements. However, we identified six neurons whose membrane potential remained stable during darkness, but changed strongly upon illumination (two representative example traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g006">Figure 6G</xref>, whole dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Their membrane potential during darkness was comparable to the average membrane potential of the light-insensitive neurons (average, −30.91 mV (+/−2.3 mV); green triangle neuron, −30.12 mV; green circle neuron, −45.59 mV), but increased strongly upon illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). This led to a significant difference in the membrane potential before and during illumination for the recorded set of light exposed interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). These data strongly suggest that a small fraction of tectal interneurons responds to light, consistent with the observed expression of TMT-Opsins.</p>
<p>Our finding of light-responsive interneurons is consistent with previous observations. A study on the optical control of zebrafish behavior by optogenetics reported that 14% of the recorded neurons in wild-type larval brain responded endogenously to illumination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Arrenberg1">[36]</xref>. Whereas these fish lacked functional eyes, the pineal organ was still present. Although the recorded neurons were located outside of the known projection area of pineal neurons, the possibility remained that the recorded light response could have been conveyed indirectly by the pineal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Arrenberg1">[36]</xref>. In the case of the tectal slices, this possibility can be fully ruled out. Even if the recorded response were a circuit response, the only neuron types present in the tectal slice are interneurons.</p>

<p>In summary, our expression data provide strong evidence that several specific neuronal clusters in the inner vertebrate brain, including inter- and motorneurons, express a combination of multiple <italic>opsin</italic> genes. Given the different spectral preferences of co-expressed TMT- and VAL-Opsins, this co-expression suggests that such cells are endowed with a remarkably complex ability to respond to light.</p>

<title>TMT- and VAL-Opsin Brain Expression Domains Are Conserved Across Teleosts</title>
<p>In order to investigate if the specific expression is a general, species-independent feature of <italic>tmt-opsins</italic> and <italic>val-opsins</italic>, we extended our analysis to their orthologs in zebrafish. Medaka and zebrafish diverged about 300 million years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Kasahara1">[37]</xref>, a similar evolutionary distance as between mammals and birds (≈310 million years, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Kumar1">[38]</xref>). In addition to their evolutionary divergence, both teleost species originate from different habitats and display different life styles. Japanese medaka fish encounter strong seasonal (winter/summer) differences and exhibit photoperiod-dependent reproduction cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Awaji1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Koger1">[40]</xref>, whereas subtropical zebrafish use temperature and food availability rather than photoperiod to discriminate between monsoon versus nonmonsoon seasons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Spence1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Condon1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>Zebrafish possesses two paralogs of each TMT-Opsin group and one Encephalopsin. Consequently, two zebrafish TMT-Opsin 2 orthologs, TMT-Opsin 2a and TMT-Opsin 2b, exist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s015">Table S1</xref>). Like medaka <italic>tmtops2</italic>, <italic>Dre tmtops2a</italic> is expressed in the amacrine layer and the annular ligament of the eye (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s012">Figure S12A</xref>,B), the pineal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s012">Figure S12B</xref>,C), as well as in the facial nerve nucleus of the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s012">Figure S12D</xref>). Several zebrafish <italic>tmt-opsins</italic> are expressed in the dorsal tegmental nucleus of the midbrain, as is the case in medaka (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s012">Figure S12E</xref>–G, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g003">Figure 3E,F</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g004">4A</xref>). Similarly, zebrafish <italic>tmtops1b</italic> was detected in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s012">Figure S12H</xref>) (nucleus of the facial nerve) and thalamus (central posterior thalamic nucleus) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001585.s012">Figure S12I</xref>), just like its counterpart in medaka.</p>
<p>In addition to <italic>tmtopsins</italic>, zebrafish possess two <italic>val-opsin</italic> paralogs (A and B) expressed in several domains in the larval zebrafish brain and eye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Kojima2">[43]</xref>, as well as in the central posterior thalamic nucleus of the adult zebrafish brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Kojima1">[33]</xref>. Performing comparative expression analyses between <italic>tmt-</italic> and <italic>val-opsins</italic>, we find that also in zebrafish the majority of <italic>tmt-opsin</italic> expressing cells expressed <italic>val-opsins</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g007">Figure 7G–L</xref>) in a conserved patterned compared to medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001585-g007">Figure 7A–F</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, our data argue that the co-expression of <italic>tmt-</italic> and <italic>val-opsins</italic> and the majority of expression sites are conserved across about 300 million years of evolution. This suggests that both opsin families have a critical function in the expressing cells, and that the conservation of <italic>tmt-</italic> and <italic>val-opsins</italic> expression domains might well extend to other vertebrates.</p>

<title>Intrinsically Photosensitive Motor- and Interneurons (IPMIN)?</title>
<p>Over the past 10 years, expression of an increasing number of opsins (typically with ancestral sequence features) has been detected in vertebrate brains. Whereas the prevailing paradigm is that such inner brain opsins are involved in seasonal regulation, some of the investigated species such as zebrafish display little or no overt photoperiodicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Spence1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Condon1">[42]</xref>. This is compatible with the idea that inner brain opsins also serve other, more fundamental functions in the vertebrate brain.</p>
<p>Our study provides strong evidence that in addition to neurosecretory cells, specific subsets of inter- and motorneurons are light-sensitive. As we show, not only the sequence of TMT-Opsins, but also their expression sites are highly conserved across evolution, arguing that these genes are involved in critical functions of the vertebrate brain. The fact that each of the tested inner brain opsins is able to render cultured neuronal cells photoreceptive, and that response kinetics differ between subgroups, suggests that light can influence distinct cellular properties of inner brain opsin-expressing neurons. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that some neurons at the position of <italic>tmt-opsin</italic> expressing cells in the adult fish tectum directly respond to light by changes in membrane potential. This puts forward the possibility that information processing in some vertebrate inter- (and motor-)neurons can be influenced directly by environmental light. This hypothesis is further backed by our finding that TMT-Opsins differ from VAL-Opsins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Kojima1">[33]</xref> in spectral preference (blue versus green light, respectively), allowing these neurons to perceive light of wider spectral range. To our knowledge, co-expression of opsins with different kinetics and spectral sensitivity has so far only been observed for neurons in the retina and pineal/parietal eye. In these organs, co-expression is suggested to mediate color vision (eye photoreceptors, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Osorio1">[44]</xref>), adaptation to background irradiation (eye horizontal cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Jenkins1">[45]</xref>), and to improve dusk/dawn detection (parietal eye) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Solessio1">[46]</xref>. Based on these examples, the co-expression of inner brain opsins in inter- or motorneurons might represent a fast possibility to adapt behavior to unpredictable environmental light changes. Given the specificity of <italic>opsin</italic>-expressing neurons, light-dependent responses are likely to be fast and highly cell-specific, in similarity to the concept of “optogenetic” switches, but in contrast to typical hormonal responses influencing tissues within the entire body.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Sensory-Interneurons and Sensory-Motorneurons: “Living Fossil Neurons” of the Vertebrate Brain?</title>
<p>Our data not only support the notion that inner brain opsins have conserved functions in vertebrate brains, but are also compatible with the hypothesis that higher order brain centers initially evolved from multifunctional “sensory-inter-motorneurons,” as they can be found in extant cnidarians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Westfall1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Westfall2">[9]</xref>. Multifunctional neurons might therefore not just represent “add-ons” to existing brain circuits, but even relate to their ancient functions. This is compatible with the observation that both TMT-Opsins (this study) and VAL-Opsins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Soni1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Sato1">[48]</xref> display most ancient-type sequence features when compared with other opsins, and that the superfamily of c-opsins can already be distinguished in cnidarians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Plachetzki1">[49]</xref>. This view also has implications for the interpretation of the few known light-dependent modulatory functions, such as the direct influence of light on the electrophysiological response of retinal interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Jenkins1">[45]</xref>. This effect—mediated by VAL-Opsins and/or melanopsins—was suggested to be a functional specialty of the retina to integrate overall irradiance in the process of light perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Jenkins1">[45]</xref>. In addition, it has been thought to reflect the evolutionary relationships of retinal interneurons to ciliary-type versus rhabdomeric-type photoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001585-Arendt2">[50]</xref>. Our data suggest that both the light sensory ability of interneurons, as well as their evolutionary relationship to ciliary photoreceptors might also hold true for interneurons of the inner brain and are no specialty of the eye.</p>

Opsin coding sequences were codon optimized for mammalian usage (Entelechon and Geneart), cloned into pcDNA3.1 with and without 1D4 antigen tag. Point mutations were introduced using QuikChange Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Strategene). Receptor activation by light was assayed employing an impedance-based Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) System (Roche Applied Science). HEK and N2A cells (passage 6–8) were seeded on a 96-well E-plate (Roche) at a cell density of 35,000 and 10,000 cells/well, respectively. Eighteen to 24 h later, cells were transfected using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio) at a DNA–transfection reagent ratio of 1∶3 according to the manual. Cells were supplied with 50 µM 11-cis-retinal (a generous gift from Rosalie Crouch and the National Eye Institute, USA) to assure proper receptor reconstitution.

<p>Group 2 TMT-Opsins exhibit different response kinetics than group 1 and 3 TMT-Opsins. Results were obtained using opsin-transfected N2A cells and measuring changes in cell impedance upon light stimulation with a real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system. Cell impedance was displayed as CI values. CI values were normalized to CI values just prior to light onset and were baseline-corrected by substracting CI traces obtained from cells transfected with the light insensitive human Oxytocin receptor. Data are presented as mean (<italic>N</italic> = 4). (A) Comparison of medaka (Ola) and zebrafish (Dre) group 2 TMT-opsins. We compared three different experiments (E1, E2, and E3), each with four separate light pulses (L1–L4). Responses to each light pulse were plotted into the same graph for all three experiments. Note the similarity of the response shape between different homologues/paralogues of zebrafish and medaka fish. (B) Comparison of medaka TMT-Opsin 2 to group 1 and 3 TMT-Opsins of medaka (Ola TMT-1B and 3A) and zebrafish (Dre TMT-1B). The same three experiments as in (A) were compared. Again, responses to each light pulse were plotted into the same graph for all three experiments. Note the obvious difference in response kinetics between TMT-Opsin 2 and other TMT-Opsins: TMT-Opsin 2 response curves drastically drop after the light was turned off, while other TMT-Opsin responses slowly decreased.</p>

<p>Irradiance curves for differently filtered light and experiment setup for assessment of the absorption maxima. A light-emitting diode (LED) source was used to produce white light (400 nm&lt;λ&lt;800 nm). (A) Spectral profile of color filters used to color light: blue (λ<sub>peak</sub> = 450 nm), green (λ<sub>peak</sub> = 528 nm), and red (λ<sub>max. peak</sub> = 605 nm). (B) Magnification of dashed box of spectral profile in (A). The light intensity was adjusted with neutral density filters in order to reach a similar activation strength of human rhodopsin to both the blue and the green filter, thus calibrating the setup to the human rhodopsin absorption maximum of 497 nm (dashed line). Note that the absolute intensities are also within a similar range (blue, 3.6×10<sup>14</sup>; green, 1.9×10<sup>14</sup>; red, 7.4×10<sup>14</sup>). (C) Example traces of one example wavelength sensitivity experiment. Wavelength sensitivity assay was performed using the RTCA DP station, which allowed for measurement of three individual and separated cell culture plates at the same time. A black box with windows facilitated the illumination of the three plates with differently filtered light (E). Comparison of receptor activation to different light colors required standardization of cell responses to white light. Therefore, cells were first exposed to a 10 min white light pulse (D). Sixty minutes later, the same cells were being exposed to light of different colors (E). Note the stronger response of cells, which were later exposed to green light in this particular example. By assessing cell responses to white light first and then comparing it to the response to color light, we could minimize variances between plates within one experiment. Dashed CI traces show cell responses to white light, and solid traces show responses to filtered light.</p>

<p>TMT-Opsins and Encephalopsin do not respond to near infrared (NIR) light. Results were obtained using opsin-transfected HEK293 (HEK) cells and measuring changes in cell impedance upon light stimulation with a real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system.
