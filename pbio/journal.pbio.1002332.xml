<abstract>
<p>Plants produce large amounts of secondary metabolites in their shoots and roots and store them in specialized secretory structures. Although secondary metabolites and their secretory structures are commonly assumed to have a defensive function, evidence that they benefit plant fitness under herbivore attack is scarce, especially below ground. Here, we tested whether latex secondary metabolites produced by the common dandelion (<italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic> agg.) decrease the performance of its major native insect root herbivore, the larvae of the common cockchafer (<italic>Melolontha melolontha</italic>), and benefit plant vegetative and reproductive fitness under <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> attack. Across 17 <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> genotypes screened by gas and liquid chromatography, latex concentrations of the sesquiterpene lactone taraxinic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G) were negatively associated with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> larval growth. Adding purified TA-G to artificial diet at ecologically relevant concentrations reduced larval feeding. Silencing the germacrene A synthase ToGAS1, an enzyme that was identified to catalyze the first committed step of TA-G biosynthesis, resulted in a 90% reduction of TA-G levels and a pronounced increase in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> feeding. Transgenic, TA-G-deficient lines were preferred by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> and suffered three times more root biomass reduction than control lines. In a common garden experiment involving over 2,000 <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> individuals belonging to 17 different genotypes, high TA-G concentrations were associated with the maintenance of high vegetative and reproductive fitness under <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> attack. Taken together, our study demonstrates that a latex secondary metabolite benefits plants under herbivore attack, a result that provides a mechanistic framework for root herbivore driven natural selection and evolution of plant defenses below ground.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Plant roots produce diverse and abundant blends of bioactive metabolites. One potential function of these compounds is to protect roots against the devastating effects of below ground herbivore attack. However, examples demonstrating such a protective function in native plant-herbivore systems are lacking. Here, we investigated the interaction between the dandelion (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic>) and its native root feeding enemy, larvae of the common cockchafer beetle (<italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic>). Dandelion is known to release secondary metabolite-rich latex from wounded roots, thus we specifically focused on the potential defensive role of these metabolites. By combining natural variation, genetic manipulation and in vitro assays, we demonstrate that taraxinic acid glucoside, a highly concentrated chemical, deters cockchafer larvae and thereby protects the roots. Dandelion plants with high levels of taraxinic acid benefited from this protection in terms of both vegetative and reproductive fitness. Our study demonstrates that a latex metabolite benefits plant fitness under root herbivore attack, a result which provides a mechanistic framework for root herbivore driven natural selection and the evolution of root defenses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants produce over 200,000 different metabolites that are not directly needed for their growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref001">1</xref>]. Many of these so-called secondary metabolites have a negative impact on insect herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref006">6</xref>], leading to the hypothesis that they evolved as defenses against the latter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref007">7</xref>]. Indeed, recent studies demonstrated that leaf secondary metabolites reduce herbivore damage and thereby counteract the negative impact of herbivores on plant growth, that herbivore abundance covaries with secondary metabolites across different environments, that the exclusion of herbivores leads to rapid changes in genotype frequencies and associated metabolites, and that genes encoding for defensive metabolites can be under differential selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref012">12</xref>]. Together, these studies provide strong evidence for the hypothesis that above ground herbivores drive the evolution of leaf secondary metabolites.</p>
<p>In contrast to the leaves, less is known about the role of secondary metabolites in root–herbivore interactions. Roots are often attacked by below ground herbivores, and root herbivore infestation can strongly reduce plant growth and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref015">15</xref>]. Furthermore, roots produce diverse and abundant blends of secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref017">17</xref>], many of which can affect root herbivore behavior and reduce their performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref018">18</xref>]. Furthermore, root secondary metabolites can determine host species ranges in below ground feeding insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref019">19</xref>]. However, if root secondary metabolites enable plants to maintain growth (i.e., vegetative fitness) and reproduction (i.e., reproductive fitness) under root herbivore attack remains unclear. Common milkweed (<italic>Asclepias syriaca</italic>) families with high and low root cardenolides, for instance, did not differ in their above-ground biomass accumulation when attacked by <italic>Tetraopes</italic> <italic>tetraophthalmus</italic> below-ground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref020">20</xref>]. Maize lines with high root benzoxazinoid concentrations on the other hand suffered less root damage by <italic>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</italic> and had higher yields than lines with low benzoxazinoid concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref021">21</xref>]. However, follow-up experiments conducted under more controlled conditions failed to confirm this pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref022">22</xref>]. The lack of knowledge regarding fitness benefits of root secondary metabolites makes it difficult to understand their role in the evolution of plant–herbivore interactions.</p>
<p>In both leaves and roots, secondary metabolites often accumulate in specialized structures including laticifers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref024">24</xref>], which are among the most common secretory structures of flowering plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref027">27</xref>]. Laticifers are elongated individual or interconnected cells whose cytoplasm is called latex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref029">29</xref>]. Laticifers are often under pressure and release large quantities of latex upon wounding, which can deter or even kill insect herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref030">30</xref>]. Surprisingly, however, direct evidence that laticifers are defensive, i.e., that they are positively associated plant vegetative or reproductive fitness in the presence but not in the absence of herbivory, is virtually absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref032">32</xref>]. A study by Agrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref031">31</xref>] showed that latex exudation is under positive selection in common milkweed under ambient insect pressure. However, whether this pattern is herbivore dependent remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>One of Europe’s most prevalent native latex-producing plants is the common dandelion (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> agg.) (Flora Helvetica, 5th edition). <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> is a species complex consisting of sexual, outcrossing diploids that are native to central and southern Europe and a multitude of apomictic, clonal triploids that are spreading across the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref035">35</xref>]. Similar to many other perennials in temperate ecosystems, the plant relies on its roots for resprouting and flowering in spring. As a perennial plant, both vegetative and reproductive performance contribute to the fitness of the plant. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> produces latex in all major organs, with the highest amounts exuding from wounded tap roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref036">36</xref>]. The latex is dominated by three classes of secondary metabolites: phenolic inositol esters (PIEs), triterpene acetates (TritAcs) and the sesquiterpene lactone taraxinic acid β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (TA-G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref036">36</xref>]. Each compound class accounts for 5%–7% of latex fresh mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref036">36</xref>]. Sesquiterpene lactones and TritAcs can have deterrent and toxic effects against a wide range of organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref040">40</xref>]. In its native range, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> is frequently attacked by the larva of the common cockchafer (also called May bug), <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> is among Europe’s largest and most prevalent native root-feeding insects and periodically causes devastating damage to crops and pastures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref043">43</xref>]. Although the larvae are highly polyphagous, they preferentially feed on <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we explored the putative defensive function of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> latex secondary metabolites against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> larvae. First, we investigated which latex secondary metabolites are likely to be involved in root herbivore defense using a correlative approach. Second, we decreased the production of the major candidate compound TA-G by identifying the gene encoding the first committed biosynthetic step and silencing it by RNA interference (RNAi), which allowed testing the effect of TA-G deficiency on plant and insect performance. Third, we purified TA-G to investigate its impact on <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> in vitro. Fourth, we performed a common garden experiment with different <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> genotypes to determine whether TA-G reduces the negative impact of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> on plant vegetative and reproductive performance in the field. Through the above approaches, we demonstrate that TA-G protects the roots and thereby benefits plant fitness in the presence of root herbivores.</p>

<title>The Concentration of the Constitutively Produced Sesquiterpene Lactone TA-G in the Latex Is Negatively Correlated with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> Performance</title>
<p>Three classes of secondary metabolites dominate the latex of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic>: PIEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left panel), the sesquiterpene lactone TA-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left panel), and TritAcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, right panel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref036">36</xref>]. We measured the concentrations of the major latex secondary metabolites in 40 triploid <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> genotypes collected across central and northern Europe and selected 17 genotypes that displayed maximal variation in latex traits, but minimal variation in growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s033">S1 Text</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s026">S1 Table</xref>) to correlate latex secondary metabolites with herbivore performance. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> larval mass gain was negatively correlated with the concentration of TA-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, left panel, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.40, linear model), with TA-G accounting for 26% of the observed variance. By contrast, larval mass gain was not correlated to the total concentrations of PIEs or TritAcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, middle and right panel, <italic>p</italic> = 0.58 for PIEs; <italic>p</italic> = 0.53 for TritAcs, <italic>n</italic> = 17, linear models). Also, the concentration of TA-G was not correlated to the amount of latex that was released from wounded roots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Surprisingly, latex mass was positively correlated to larval mass gain when analyzed together with TA-G concentration using multiple linear regression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s027">S2 Table</xref>, <italic>p</italic>(TA-G) = 0.003, <italic>p</italic>(latex mass) = 0.03, linear model). The total amount of TA-G (latex mass * TA-G concentration), on the other hand, was not correlated to larval mass gain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s028">S3 Table</xref>). Across the different genotypes, TA-G was constitutively produced and not induced by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> attack. On the contrary, we observed a trend for a reduction of TA-G concentration in the latex of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic>-attacked roots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s003">S2 Fig</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.08 <italic>t</italic>-test,).

<p>To test if TA-G predominantly accumulates in laticifers and to what extent this accumulation is responsible for the overall TA-G concentration in the roots, we measured TA-G concentrations in latex-drained and latex-containing main roots, as well as latex-free root cortex cells. Draining latex from the roots decreased TA-G concentration by a factor of four (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s005">S4 Fig</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 4x10<sup>-6</sup>, one-way ANOVA).

Across the 17 different genotypes, TA-G concentrations in the latex and in the entire main roots were strongly positively correlated, with TA-G concentrations being about 100-fold higher in latex than in main roots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s006">S5 Fig</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004, linear model).

<title>Genetic Manipulation Shows That TA-G Deters <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> and Reduces Loss of Root Biomass to Herbivory</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of TA-G on <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> preference and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> performance, we identified and silenced a gene that encodes for a germacrene A synthase, the enzyme that mediates the first committed step of TA-G biosynthesis, by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To identify germacrene A candidate genes in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic>, we sequenced a transcriptome of the main root and the latex and constructed a reference transcriptome with the pooled reads. Putative germacrene A synthases were identified based on amino acid sequence similarity with two known germacrene A synthases from chicory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref046">46</xref>]. Through this approach, we obtained full-length sequences of two putative germacrene A synthase genes, <italic>ToGAS1</italic> and <italic>ToGAS2</italic>, which share 71% identity at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic comparison with other Asteraceae terpene synthases revealed that ToGAS1 belongs to the larger of two germacrene A synthase clusters, while ToGAS2 belonged to the smaller cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Heterologous expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> showed that both recombinant proteins produced (+)-germacrene A when incubated with the substrate farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). To further characterize the two genes, we analyzed their expression in the outer root cortex, latex, and the entire main root. As <italic>ToGAS1</italic> was more strongly expressed than <italic>ToGAS2</italic> in both latex and entire main roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), we targeted <italic>ToGAS1</italic> through RNAi by expressing a 191 base pair fragment of this gene under the control of the constitutive <italic>35S</italic> promoter. A reduction of TA-G by over 90% compared to wild type was observed in three independently transformed lines: −1, −12b, and −16 (“TA-G-deficient lines”). No reduction in TA-G concentration was found in two other lines, −9 and −15, compared to wild type (all designated as “control lines”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). The amount of exuded latex did not differ between TA-G-deficient and control lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s008">S7 Fig</xref>). <italic>ToGAS1</italic> was suppressed by more than 90% in the TA-G deficient lines compared to control lines, whereas <italic>ToGAS2</italic> expression was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s009">S8 Fig</xref>).

<title>TA-G Reduces the Negative Impact of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> Herbivory on Plant Vegetative and Reproductive Fitness under Field Conditions</title>
<p>To investigate whether TA-G benefits vegetative and reproductive fitness under <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> attack in the field, we grew 2,040 <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> individuals of the experimental population (consisting of the 17 genotypes as described above) in a common garden. We established 20 circular plots, each of them containing 6 individuals of each genotype, and infested half of the plots with 72 <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> larvae (23 larvae per m<sup>2</sup>) each (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s019">S18 Fig</xref>), a density similar to the damage threshold in pastures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref047">47</xref>]. In the first year during which most plants did not flower, we measured the length of the longest leaf (“maximal leaf length”)—a reliable predictor for leaf and root mass under greenhouse conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s020">S19 Fig</xref>)—and correlated this parameter with latex secondary metabolite concentrations. To standardize growth rates, we expressed the size increase of the longest leaf of the herbivore-infested plants relative to the size increase of the longest leaf of control plants of the same genotype (“relative leaf growth”). Shortly after infestation of the plants in June, no reduction in leaf growth was observed in the infested plants, and relative leaf growth was not correlated with the concentration of the three latex secondary metabolite classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <italic>p</italic>(June) = 0.38, Pearson’s product–moment correlation). In the course of the growing season, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> infestation reduced overall plant growth, and a positive correlation between relative leaf growth and TA-G concentration emerged, suggesting that TA-G reduced the negative impact of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> on plant performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <italic>p</italic>(September) = 0.01, Pearson’s product–moment correlation).

No correlation between relative leaf growth and the total concentrations of PIEs, TritAcs, latex mass, or the total amount of TA-G (latex mass * TA-G concentration) was observed throughout the entire growing season (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s022">S21 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s030">S5 Table</xref>). Similarly, latex mass did not significantly account for relative leaf length when analyzed in a multiple regression together with TA-G concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s031">S6 Table</xref>). Leaf length of the herbivore-infested plants was proportional to leaf length of noninfested plants, indicating that plant size did not affect the degree of damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s023">S22 Fig</xref>). To assess whether TA-G also benefits plant reproductive fitness, we correlated the number of flowers to latex secondary metabolite concentration in the following year. At the beginning of the flowering season, TA-G was positively correlated with the relative number of flowers (number of flowers of the herbivore-infested plants expressed relative to noninfested plants of each genotype) in the genotypes that flowered at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, left panel). Genotypes that flowered did not differ in their TA-G concentration from genotypes that did not flower at this time point (<italic>p</italic> = 1, Wilcoxon rank sum test). No correlation between the relative number of flowers and the total concentrations of PIEs and TritAcs were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002332.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, middle and right panel). The positive correlation between the relative number of flowers, and TA-G disappeared at the end of the flowering period (<italic>p</italic> = 0.33, Pearson’s product–moment correlation), likely because almost all <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> larvae had stopped feeding by this time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s032">S7 Table</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that the sesquiterpene lactone TA-G, a major secondary metabolite of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic>, protects the plant against its major native root herbivore <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic>. TA-G deters <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> larvae from feeding and thereby directly protects the roots, resulting in a reduction of the negative impact of the root feeder on vegetative and reproductive fitness. The observed pattern indicates that root herbivores may exert positive selection pressure on latex secondary metabolites and may thereby drive their evolution.</p>
<p>Our experiments involving natural variation, chemical manipulation, and genetic modification provide parallel lines of evidence for a negative effect of TA-G on <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> larvae. First, across different <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> genotypes, TA-G concentration was negatively correlated with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> growth. Surprisingly, latex mass was positively associated with larval mass gain. Other unidentified plant traits that benefit the larvae and covary with latex exudation may account for this pattern. Second, purified TA-G reduced food consumption in vitro. Third, TA-G suppression through <italic>ToGAS1</italic>-silencing increased the attractiveness and consumption of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> roots and decreased the deterrent effect of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> latex towards <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic>. Interestingly, silencing <italic>ToGAS1</italic> not only affected sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis, but also plant growth and the accumulation of PIEs. Germacrene A synthases convert FDP into germacrene A. The substrate FDP is a common precursor for sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, and phytosterols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref049">49</xref>], and the farnesyl residue can bind to growth-regulating proteins of the <italic>ras</italic> family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref050">50</xref>]. It is therefore possible that <italic>ToGAS1</italic> silencing affects other branches of the metabolism of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> by changing FDP pool sizes. These observations illustrate the limitations of transgenic approaches as a stand-alone method and highlight the power of combining genetic manipulation, natural variation, and chemical complementation to elucidate the role of plant secondary metabolites in plant–herbivore interactions.</p>
<p>Many studies demonstrate that plant secondary metabolites are toxic to root and leaf herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref006">6</xref>]. Surprisingly, however, the benefits for the plant often remain unclear, especially for root herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref052">52</xref>]. Plant secondary metabolites may reduce food quality for herbivores and may thereby trigger compensatory feeding, leading to higher plant damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref053">53</xref>]. In addition, herbivore-imposed loss of biomass can lead to an overcompensation of plant growth and sexual reproduction, which may mask the fitness benefits of resistance factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref056">56</xref>]. Secondary metabolites can also reduce plant performance in the field by attracting specialized herbivores that use the chemicals as oviposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref057">57</xref>] and foraging cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref059">59</xref>]. All these factors may constrain the fitness benefits of bioactive secondary metabolites. Finally, the heterogeneity of natural environments, including varying herbivore communities and abiotic factors, can render the detection of fitness benefits difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref012">12</xref>]. We manipulated the abundance of a major root herbivore within artificial populations consisting of plant genotypes that differ substantially in their capacity to produce plant secondary metabolites. This approach allowed us to demonstrate herbivore-dependent vegetative and reproductive fitness benefits under field conditions. Similar experimental designs could be used in combination with transgenic or genetic mapping populations to quantify the contribution of individual herbivore species and herbivore communities to secondary metabolite-dependent fitness benefits in heterogeneous environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>So far, clear evidence for the fitness advantage of particular metabolites under insect attack has remained particularly scarce for below-ground plant–herbivore interactions. Vaughan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref060">60</xref>] showed that silencing the production of a semivolatile diterpene increased root damage of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> by the opportunistic fungus gnat <italic>Bradysia</italic> spp. However, it remains unknown to what extent this effect translates into improved plant performance in nature. The lack of knowledge regarding the benefits of secondary metabolites under root herbivory limits our understanding for the evolution of root metabolites. <italic>Eschscholzia californica</italic> (Fabaceae) mainland populations that are exposed to pocket gopher herbivory had 2.5 times higher root alkaloid concentrations than island populations that are free from this herbivore pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref061">61</xref>], suggesting that pocket gophers may exert positive selection on this metabolite. We show here that high TA-G concentration benefits plant vegetative and reproductive performance in the presence of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic>’s major native root herbivore, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic>, thus providing an evolutionary framework for root herbivore-driven natural selection. TA-G-deficient <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> lost more root mass than control lines upon feeding by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic>. In a common garden experiment, TA-G concentration was positively correlated with leaf growth and flower production across natural <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> genotypes.</p>
<p>While our data provides evidence that TA-G benefits the plants under <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> attack, we did not obtain strong evidence for costs of TA-G production. Although TA-G concentration tended to be negatively correlated to plant growth across the 17 genotypes in the common garden experiment in the absence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic>, the correlation was not significant, possibly due to the relatively low number of genotypes that were used for the experiment. Experiments that evaluate putative fitness costs of TA-G production in different environments may provide further insights into the varying fitness effects of TA-G.</p>
<p>Laticifers are commonly assumed to be defensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref030">30</xref>]. Toxic metabolites or proteins in the latex can reduce herbivore performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref028">28</xref>], while the stickiness of latex can trap entire insects or glue their mouthparts together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref062">62</xref>]. Despite the overwhelming evidence that latex reduces herbivore performance, experimental validation that latex benefits plant fitness under herbivore attack remains scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref032">32</xref>]. We show that a toxic metabolite in the latex benefits the plant in the presence but not in the absence of an herbivore and thereby provide an experimental validation of the assumption that microevolutionary processes govern intraspecific variation in plant defense traits. These microevolutionary processes are consistent with the observed macroevolutionary patterns in which latex represents a key innovation that has spurred the evolution of the angiosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref025">25</xref>]. Taken together, our results furnish an ecological and evolutionary explanation for the high concentrations of root and latex secondary metabolites and highlight the potential of soil-dwelling insects to shape the chemical defenses of their host plants.</p>

Twenty genotypes were selected based on maximal difference of latex chemistry with minimal variation in plant growth rate using cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s026">S1 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s033">S1 Text</xref>). Among these 20 genotypes, three genotypes completely lacked TA-G but were later found to contain other unidentified sesquiterpene lactone glycosides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s025">S24 Fig</xref>). These genotypes were subsequently excluded from analysis. The remaining 17 genotypes were used to correlate larval growth with latex secondary metabolite concentrations. For each genotype, 12 plants were infested at an age of 7 wk with one preweighed <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> larva, while 12 plants were left herbivore-free. Eleven days after infestation, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> larvae were recovered and larval mass difference was determined. To measure the concentration of latex secondary metabolites, main roots were cut 1 cm below the tiller and exuding latex collected into Eppendorf tubes and glass vials, immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until extraction.</p>
<p>For extraction, 1 ml methanol was added to the plastic tubes, and 1 ml hexane containing 0.1 mg*ml<sup>−1</sup> cholesteryl acetate as internal standard was added to the glass vials. Both types of vessels were vortexed for 5 min, centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at −80°C until analysis. Methanol samples were measured on a high pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC 1100 series equipment, Agilent Technologies), coupled to a photodiode array detector (G1315A DAD, Agilent Technologies) and an Esquire 6000 ESI-Ion Trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). For quantification, peak areas were integrated at 245 nm for TA-G and at 275 nm for PIEs, and quantified using external standard curves. Hexane samples were analyzed on an Agilent series 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Individual TritAcs were quantified based on the internal standard. Methodological details for the analytical procedure have previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Correlations between TA-G, total PIE, total TritAc concentrations and total amount of TA-G (TA-G concentration * latex mass) and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> mass gain, as well as between TA-G concentration and latex fresh mass, were analyzed using linear models on the mean values of each of the 17 genotypes using the metabolite concentration and latex mass of the noninfested plants, as these measurements were not confounded by differential larval feeding activities.

<title>Correlations between TA-G Concentrations in the Latex and Main Roots</title>
<p>To investigate to which extent latex contributes to TA-G measured in the main roots, we measured the correlation between TA-G concentration in the latex and main roots, as well as the difference in TA-G concentration between main roots, latex-drained main roots, and largely latex-free outer main root cortex. To analyze the correlation of TA-G concentration in the latex and main roots, we grew 12 plants of each of the above-mentioned 17 genotypes. Main roots of 9 wk-old plants were cut 1 cm below the tiller and the exuding latex was collected. Main roots were separated from side roots and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Latex was extracted using 1 ml methanol containing 10 μg*ml<sup>−1</sup> loganin as an internal standard and analyzed on HPLC-DAD as described above. Peak area was integrated at 245 nm for TA-G and normalized to loganin as an internal standard. Main roots were ground to a fine powder, and 100 mg tissue was extracted with 1 ml methanol containing 10 μg*ml<sup>−1</sup> loganin, vortexed, centrifuged, and the supernatant transferred to HPLC vials. Main root samples were analyzed the same way as the latex samples, except that the mobile phases consisted of 0.1% acetic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) using following gradient: 0 min: 5% B, 18 min: 43% B, followed by column reconditioning. Peak area was integrated at 245 nm for TA-G and normalized to loganin as internal standard. The correlation between TA-G concentration in the latex and main roots was analyzed with a linear model.</p>
<p>To investigate the TA-G concentration of main roots, latex-drained main roots and laticifer-free main root cortex, we grew 16 plants from genotype <italic>A34</italic> for 12 wk. To harvest drained and nondrained roots, the main roots of 8 plants were cut 2 cm below the tiller into two 1 mm slices. From one slice, the latex was collected using filter paper (Whatman 40) before freezing it in liquid nitrogen (“drained”). The other slice was flash-frozen without collecting latex (“nondrained”). To harvest the laticifer-free cortex tissue, the outer cortex zones of the main roots of 8 plants were dissected with a razor blade and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were ground to a fine powder, weighed, extracted, and analyzed for TA-G concentrations as described above. Differences in the TA-G concentration between root samples were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA. Pairwise comparisons were performed with a Tukey posthoc test.</p>

Main root latex was collected into Eppendorf tubes, which were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 1 ml methanol containing 10 μg*ml<sup>−1</sup> loganin and 100 μg*ml<sup>−1</sup> salicin as internal standards for TA-G and PIEs, respectively, were added to the Eppendorf tubes. Samples were extracted and analyzed as described above. Differences in the latex fresh mass, as well as in the concentration of TA-G and total PIEs between TA-G-deficient and control lines, were analyzed with one-way ANOVAs.

Root systems were exposed, washed, and main and side roots frozen in liquid nitrogen. Root tissue was ground under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder. For extraction, 1 ml 0.1 M TRIS-HCl, pH = 7.0 was added to 100 mg ground tissue, vortexed and centrifuged at room temperature at 17,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was stored at −20°C until analysis.</p>
<p>Soluble protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay and quantified using a standard curve of albumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref077">77</xref>]. Differences in soluble protein concentrations between TA-G-deficient and control lines, as well as between root tissues, were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs. To determine free amino acid concentrations, 10 μl of the diluted samples were mixed with 90 μl <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N labelled amino acid mix (20 μg amino acids*ml<sup>−1</sup>) (Isotec, Miamisburg, USA) and 100 μl borate buffer (0.9 M, pH = 10.0). To derivatize amino acids, 22 μl 30 mM fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl chloride was added and samples were vortexed. After 5 min, 800 μl hexane was added to stop the reaction; the samples were vortexed and placed at room temperature until phases had separated. The lower, aqueous phase was analyzed on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system coupled to an API 5000 tandem mass spectrometer according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002332.ref078">78</xref>]. To determine soluble sugar concentrations, main root samples were diluted 1:10 and side root samples 1:5 in 0.1 M TRIS-HCl, pH = 7.0. Samples were analyzed on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Germany) coupled to an API 3200 tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Germany) equipped with a turbospray ion source operating in negative ionization mode. Injection volume was 1 μl. Metabolite separation was accomplished by an apHera NH<sub>2</sub>, 15 cm x 4.6 mm x 3 μm. The mobile phase consisted of water (A) and acetonitrile (B) utilizing a flow of 1 ml*min<sup>−1</sup> with the following gradient: 0 min: 20% A, 0.5 min: 20% A, 13 min: 45% B, followed by column reconditioning. The column temperature was maintained at 20°C. The ion spray voltage was maintained at −4.5 keV. The turbo gas temperature was set at 600°C. Nebulizing gas was set at 50 psi, curtain gas at 20 psi, heating gas at 60 psi and collision gas at 5 psi. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to monitor analyte parent ion → product ion: m/z 178.9 →89 (collision energy (CE) −10 V; declustering potential (DP) −25 V), for glucose; m/z 178.9 →89 (CE −12V; DP −25V) for fructose; m/z 341.03 →58.96 (CE -52V; DP -45V) for sucrose; Both Q1 and Q3 quadrupoles were maintained at unit resolution. Analyst 1.5 software (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for data acquisition and processing. All compounds were identified based on comparison of retention times and mass spectra to those of commercial standards. Glucose, fructose, and sucrose concentrations were quantified using external standard curves obtained from commercial standards. Differences in the sugar concentrations between TA-G-deficient and control lines, as well as between root tissues, were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs.</p>

<title>Common Garden Experiment</title>
<p>In order to examine the effects of latex secondary metabolites on plant resistance in the field, we cultivated 2,400 <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> from the above-mentioned 20 genotypes in a common garden with and without <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> infestation over one year at a field site in Jena, Germany (50°54'34.8"N; 11°34'00.1"E). Seeds were surface sterilized, germinated on moist filter paper in petri dishes in spring 2013, and the emerging seedlings were transferred onto peat balls after 10 d. One month after germination, seedlings were conditioned outside for one week before planting them into the field site. At the field site, the top 50 cm soil layer was removed and a metal mesh installed on the ground to confine vertical <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> movement. Experimental units (“plots”) were set up using 20 circular plastic tubes (50 cm depth, 2 m diameter) that were placed on the top of the mesh and filled up with the original soil. One wheelbarrow of peat was mixed with the top 20 cm of soil to facilitate plant growth. In each plot, 6 replicates of all 20 genotypes were placed randomly in a quadratic grid with 10 cm distance between plants. To buffer edge effects, these experimental plants were surrounded with an additional row of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> plants, which were excluded from data analysis. Plants were watered as necessary during the first two months after planting and plots weeded monthly. Three weeks after planting, the length of the longest leaf (“maximal leaf length”) was measured for each plant. Subsequently, 72 late L2 or early L3 <italic>M</italic>. <italic>melolontha</italic> larvae were homogenously distributed in half of the plots (“herbivory”), while the remaining plots were not manipulated (“control”). As a nondestructive measurement of plant performance, we measured maximal leaf length—a reliable predictor for above and below ground biomass under greenhouse conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002332.s020">S19 Fig</xref>)—of each plant every month until the end of the growing season.</p>
<p>For statistical analysis, the length of the longest leaf at the beginning of the experiment was subtracted from the maximal leaf length measured each month to reduce the impact of initial differences in plant size (“leaf growth”). To normalize between genotypes, leaf growth of herbivore-treated plants was expressed relative to control plants of the same genotype (“relative leaf growth”).
