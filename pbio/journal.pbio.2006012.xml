<abstract>
<p>Oviparous animals across many taxa have evolved diverse strategies that deter egg predation, providing valuable tests of how natural selection mitigates direct fitness loss. Communal egg laying in nonsocial species minimizes egg predation. However, in cannibalistic species, this very behavior facilitates egg predation by conspecifics (cannibalism). Similarly, toxins and aposematic signaling that deter egg predators are often inefficient against resistant conspecifics. Egg cannibalism can be adaptive, wherein cannibals may benefit through reduced competition and added nutrition, but since it reduces Darwinian fitness, the evolution of anticannibalistic strategies is rife. However, such strategies are likely to be nontoxic because deploying toxins against related individuals would reduce inclusive fitness. Here, we report how <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> use specific hydrocarbons to chemically mask their eggs from cannibal larvae. Using an integrative approach combining behavioral, sensory, and mass spectrometry methods, we demonstrate that maternally provisioned pheromone 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD) in the eggshell’s wax layer deters egg cannibalism. Furthermore, we show that 7,11-HD is nontoxic, can mask underlying substrates (for example, yeast) when coated upon them, and its detection requires pickpocket 23 (<italic>ppk23</italic>) gene function. Finally, using light and electron microscopy, we demonstrate how maternal pheromones leak-proof the egg, consequently concealing it from conspecific larvae. Our data suggest that semiochemicals possibly subserve in deceptive functions across taxa, especially when predators rely on chemical cues to forage, and stimulate further research on deceptive strategies mediated through nonvisual sensory modules. This study thus highlights how integrative approaches can illuminate our understanding on the adaptive significance of deceptive defenses and the mechanisms through which they operate.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Egg-laying species that lack parental care often protect their eggs from predators by laying them in communal groups or by fortifying them with toxins. However, these strategies may backfire when the predators are from the same species (cannibals) since a) there are plenty of available eggs in these sites, b) the cannibals may be resistant to the toxins, and c) poisoning cannibals who may be related would reduce inclusive fitness. Under these circumstances, natural selection should favor anticannibalistic strategies that are likely to be nontoxic. Here, we investigate how fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), which oviposit communally, protect their eggs from cannibalism by their own larvae. We show that maternal hydrocarbons incorporated into the egg’s wax layer to make them waterproof interestingly also serve as a mask that conceals their identity from cannibal larvae. In particular, we identify one female sex pheromone that deters cannibalism by forming a layer around the egg to conceal it. We further demonstrate that this pheromone is nontoxic and can mask underlying substrates such as yeast when used as a coating. While deceptive strategies (such as camouflage) deployed to avoid predation are extensively studied from a visual perspective, our findings suggest that deceptive strategies operating through other nonvisual sensory systems might be equally common across taxa.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Across most animal taxa, eggs are highly vulnerable to predators because they are immobile, highly nutritious, and defenseless. However, since egg production is costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref001">1</xref>], losing them to predation greatly reduces Darwinian fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref002">2</xref>]. Animals have thus evolved several parent-modulated strategies: camouflage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref004">4</xref>], communal egg laying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref006">6</xref>], egg clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref007">7</xref>], parental care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref002">2</xref>], chemical defenses (toxins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref009">9</xref>], and aposematic signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref010">10</xref>] to mitigate this loss of fitness. On the other hand, eggs are not just vulnerable to interspecific predators but are equally at risk of predation from older conspecifics (cannibals), including parents and siblings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref013">13</xref>]. Egg cannibalism is commonly dismissed as an aberrant behavior, resulting from unnatural breeding conditions. However, mounting evidence has demonstrated its adaptive value in several species, wherein the cannibals increase their fitness through both reduced competition and the supplemented nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref014">14</xref>]. In support of this argument, egg cannibalism is common even among noncarnivorous species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref015">15</xref>] and has also been shown to have important ecological consequences on population dynamics and stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref016">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, egg cannibalism reduces direct fitness to parents and can additionally reduce inclusive fitness if the eggs consumed are genetically related to the cannibals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref011">11</xref>]. Interestingly, most of the aforementioned parent-modulated strategies evolved in response to interspecific egg predators are often ineffective against conspecifics: while cannibals are generally resistant to conspecific toxins and aposematic signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref017">17</xref>], other strategies like producing surplus eggs and communal egg laying might even facilitate egg cannibalism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref019">19</xref>]. Additionally, since deploying toxic defenses against conspecifics would further reduce inclusive fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref020">20</xref>], natural selection should favor the evolution of anticannibalistic strategies that are likely to be nontoxic.</p>
<p>Anticannibalistic strategies that deter egg cannibalism have evolved independently in species across taxa, and convincingly, none of them seem to be toxic. These strategies include laying of nondeveloping eggs (trophic eggs) within clutches by mothers to reduce cannibalism among offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref021">21</xref>], laying of eggs with protective coatings around the egg’s shell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref022">22</xref>], laying eggs on specialized structures (like stalks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref023">23</xref>], nest guarding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref024">24</xref>], and synchronized egg hatching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref025">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are several other communally egg-laying species, including insects, that avoid cannibalizing eggs despite lacking the above strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref015">15</xref>]. This prompted us to speculate about the existence of alternative strategies that could modulate this behavior in nature. The understanding of such strategies is crucial, especially to the fields of conservation, epidemiology, and pest management.</p>
<p>We recently reported predatory cannibalism among <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> larvae, wherein younger larval instars pack-hunt and consume older conspecific larvae under laboratory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref026">26</xref>]. Surprisingly, despite their predaceous nature, we never observed larvae attacking conspecific eggs, even upon starvation. In nature, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> oviposit communally at sites already occupied by conspecific and heterospecific larvae to facilitate social feeding among larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref028">28</xref>]. Although these oviposition sites (decaying fruits) are nutritionally rich, they at times risk desiccation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref027">27</xref>] and immense larval competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref029">29</xref>], both of which could coerce larvae to seek other food sources such as older conspecifics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref026">26</xref>] and cadavers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref030">30</xref>]. Interestingly, despite availability of several conspecific eggs in their vicinity, larvae never cannibalize them, either for food or for other benefits like reduced competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref015">15</xref>] and reduced risk of predation by younger larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref026">26</xref>]. This observation thus raises important questions on why and how egg cannibalism is averted in this system.</p>
<p>Given that parental care in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> is mostly limited to oviposition site selection and egg provisioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref032">32</xref>], we hypothesized that parental provisioning in some form protects <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> eggs from conspecific larvae. Virgin <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> females can lay nonviable unfertilized eggs, equivalent to trophic eggs laid by other species. However, given that mated <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> seldom lay such unfertilized eggs, their production more likely represents a “risk–return strategy” (i.e., the cost of producing such unfertile eggs is less than what is risked by aborting them) rather than a strategy that mitigates cannibalism. In several insect species, the eggshell, its pigmentation and patterning, and specific extrachorionic modifications upon it are all known to deter predation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref008">8</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> eggs are enveloped within a maternally provisioned eggshell during oogenesis that is composed of three distinct layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1D</xref>): chorion, wax layer, and vitelline membrane, which serve to deter pathogens, prevent dehydration, and facilitate respiration, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref008">8</xref>]. However, the extent to which these eggshell layers play a role in deterring cannibals is not known.</p>

<title>Wax layer prevents egg cannibalism by larvae</title>
<p>To understand the extent to which <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> females provision nutrients within their eggs, we assayed larval survival upon hatching in the absence of any food. The first-instar larvae survived for up to five days posthatching in the absence of food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), showing that the nutrients provisioned within an egg are surplus for embryonic development, and they can hence support larval survival well beyond hatching. Feeding two injured conspecific eggs to just-hatched larvae increased their survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), confirming the previous finding that eggs are nutritious and are thus worth cannibalizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>When egg consumption by second-instar larvae (food deprived for 2 h) was assayed, larvae surprisingly did not cannibalize intact viable eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). However, if the eggs presented to the larvae were injured (by pricking), the eggs were immediately consumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), supporting the results from a recent study that used nonviable eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref030">30</xref>]. The same larval response was observed when the eggs provided were from an unrelated <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> strain (panel D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the eggs are toxic to the larvae, we assayed larval development and survival on standard fly medium laced with crushed eggs. Compared to the control larvae raised on the standard diet, larvae supplemented with crushed eggs developed faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and survived equally well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), confirming that the eggs are nontoxic and nutritious.</p>
<p>Given that injured eggs were readily cannibalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), we next tested whether breached eggshells facilitate cannibalism. We sequentially removed the two outer eggshell layers, the chorion membrane and the wax layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), by treating the eggs with sodium hypochlorite and hexane, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref035">35</xref>], and then presented these chemically treated eggs to food-deprived larvae. Indeed, removal of the thin wax layer (4–5 nm, hexane treated) but not the thick chorion layer (840–1,250 nm, dechorinated) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref036">36</xref>] made 60% of eggs vulnerable to cannibals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). This refutes a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref030">30</xref>] that <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> larvae cannibalize dechorinated eggs, which we believe is due to the experimental procedure. The dechorinated eggs they use were killed prior to their assays by dyeing with tartrazine NaCl and storing them at 4°C. These treatments could have unintentionally damaged the eggs’ wax layer. In contrast, the consecutive treatment of eggs with sodium hypochlorite and hexane in our experiments had little or no effect on egg hatchability (panel A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), egg’s time to hatching (panel B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), and egg-to-adult viability (panel C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The experiments above thus suggest that in addition to the primary role of the wax layer in preventing desiccation of the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref037">37</xref>], it might also serve to protect eggs from cannibal larvae.</p>

<title>Wax-layer composition and parental role in its formation</title>
<p>Next, to understand the mechanism underlying the wax layer’s anticannibalistic function, we extracted this layer from fertilized eggs and analyzed its biochemical composition using gas chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-resolution atmospheric pressure photoionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (APPI FT-ICR MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref038">38</xref>]. We used these advanced mass analyzers with high accuracy (sub-parts–million mass accuracy) and resolving power, mainly to mine for low-molecular–weight compounds (for example, toxins). However, in addition, we aimed to establish methods that could unambiguously assign elemental formulas to metabolites for better characterization, especially in life sciences (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and Methods</xref>).

<p>The pheromone profile we detected in the wax layer was similar to the pheromones already known to be deposited by adult flies (both sexes) on egg-laying sites to facilitate aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref041">41</xref>]. Furthermore, these pheromones are also known to be present in the reproductive tract of mated females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref042">42</xref>]. Thus, to exclude the possibility of potential cross-contamination of our samples by adult flies, we analyzed the hexane washes of the outer chorion layer and that of dechorinated eggs and compared their hydrocarbon profiles. Most of the pheromones detected on the outer chorion (layer exposed to environment and female reproductive tract) were also found after dechorination (in the wax layer) (panel A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The male pheromone cVA produced by the male’s ejaculatory bulb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref043">43</xref>] was an exception; it was abundant only on the chorion but greatly reduced upon dechorination, suggesting that eggs acquire cVA postchoriogenesis either from the environment or from male ejaculate within the female reproductive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref042">42</xref>] (panel A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). To further ascertain that these pheromones are indeed present in the wax layer, we analyzed three successive hexane washes of the dechorinated eggs and detected these pheromones at progressively decreasing concentrations across the washes, possibly reflecting the compact nature of the wax layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref037">37</xref>] (panel B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the presence of such pheromones within the eggshell having other physiological functions has been previously reported in insects and nematodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>For over three decades, the wax layer has been considered to be synthesized by the follicle cells that surround the oocytes, exclusively based on electron microscopy observation of lipid endosomes within the follicle cells during oogenesis and their eventual deposition onto the vitelline membrane of the egg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref047">47</xref>]. Most of the hydrocarbons we detect in the wax layer are so far only known to be synthesized in the <italic>oe</italic>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref039">39</xref>]; for example, the biosynthesis of dienes like 7,11-HD and 7,11-ND (female-specific pheromones) requires the enzymatic action of a specific desaturase <italic>desatF</italic> (<italic>Fad2</italic>) in the <italic>oe</italic>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref048">48</xref>]. However, transcriptional data (microarray and RNA-sequencing [RNA-seq] data from FlyAtlas and FlyBase, respectively) show that this gene is not expressed in the ovary. Thus, further empirical investigations are necessary to clarify the role of follicle cells in the synthesis of the wax layer.</p>
<p>The presence of hydrocarbons specific to both sexes in the wax layer motivated us to track the parental origin of these pheromones using mutant flies with ablated <italic>oe</italic>s (<italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref039">39</xref>]. Males and females with or without ablated <italic>oe</italic>s were crossed, and the wax-layer composition of their eggs was analyzed. The label-free, semiquantitatively established hydrocarbon profile of eggs appears to be directed by the cuticular hydrocarbon composition of the parental cross [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref039">39</xref>] they were laid by; eggs of <italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup> parents had fewer hydrocarbons than those of <italic>oe</italic><sup>+</sup> parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s009">S2 Table</xref>, and panel B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The eggs parented by <italic>oe</italic><sup>+</sup> males and <italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup> females had reduced female-specific hydrocarbons—for example, 7,11-HD and 7,11-ND—compared to male-specific hydrocarbons—for example, 7-T. Its reciprocal cross had reduced male-specific hydrocarbon (7-T) compared to the female-specific hydrocarbons. However, the reason as to why cVA, the male pheromone of non-<italic>oe</italic> origin, was also reduced in the eggs laid by this cross is unclear. The presence of hydrocarbons corresponding to <italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup> parents at low concentrations in our samples could possibly be due to residual hydrocarbons produced prior to or during <italic>oe</italic> ablation. Thus, it seems that both parents contribute towards provisioning the pheromonal content of the wax layer. This suggests that wax-layer synthesis is likely to involve transportation of maternal and paternal hydrocarbons from the <italic>oe</italic>s and deposited seminal fluid, respectively, to the ovary during oogenesis. Nevertheless, the existence of such transport mechanisms involving lipophorin molecules has been speculated in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref031">31</xref>] and other insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref045">45</xref>].</p>

<title>Maternal sex pheromone 7,11-HD deters egg cannibalism</title>
<p>The deterrent effect of hydrocarbons present on the egg surface towards cannibals has been previously speculated about in the coccinellid <italic>Adalia bipunctata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref049">49</xref>]. However, our system allowed us to ascertain the deterrent role of sex-specific hydrocarbons in egg cannibalism. For this, we first assayed the vulnerability of eggs laid by the above four crosses to cannibal larvae. Conspicuously, larvae only cannibalized eggs with <italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup> motherhood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The eggs from the three <italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant crosses had similar egg-to-adult viability (slightly less than eggs from the <italic>oe</italic><sup>+</sup> control), thus excluding nonviability of eggs with <italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup> motherhood (panel E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We next independently verified this deterrent role of hydrocarbons by assaying the vulnerability of hexane-washed eggs perfumed with four commercially synthesized hydrocarbons found most abundantly on the egg (7-T, cVA, 7,11-HD, and 7,11-ND; panel A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) to cannibal larvae. Since the actual concentration of the pheromones in the wax layer could not be determined (because of the differential solubility of the wax layer in hexane), the synthetic pheromones were applied and tested at several (serially diluted) concentrations. Interestingly, larvae only refrained from cannibalizing eggs that were perfumed with the female pheromone 7,11-HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), even when present at very low concentrations. However, the other female pheromone 7,11-ND we used, despite being structurally very similar to 7,11-HD (with just two additional carbon atoms), failed to deter cannibalism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Given that a) the eggs of male <italic>oe</italic><sup>+</sup> and female <italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup> with 7,11-HD levels slightly lower than <italic>oe</italic><sup>+</sup> controls become vulnerable to cannibalism and b) eggs perfumed with various concentrations of 7,11-HD remain protected, these results strongly suggest that the deterrent function of 7,11-HD is dose independent. These findings suggest that 7,11-HD, rather than the overall wax layer, deters egg cannibalism; nevertheless, the synergistic effect of other hydrocarbons and chemicals we detect within the wax layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s002">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s008">S1 Table</xref>) cannot be ruled out.</p>

However, whether and how larvae respond to 7,11-HD remains elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref055">55</xref>]. Anticipating that the role of <italic>ppk23</italic> in 7,11-HD detection may be conserved in larvae, we tested whether egg cannibalism is promoted when <italic>ppk23</italic> is mutated. For this, egg cannibalism by <italic>ppk23</italic> mutant larvae was assayed when eggs were either dechorinated or hexane washed. Indeed, <italic>ppk23</italic> mutant larvae cannibalized eggs from both treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). In a subsequent assay, <italic>ppk23</italic> mutant larvae also cannibalized hexane-washed eggs that were perfumed with 7,11-HD (panel A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), thus suggesting that the function of <italic>ppk23</italic> required for hydrocarbon detection is conserved across the developmental stages and, interestingly, modulates different behaviors in larvae and adults. Given that larvae might concurrently sense the wax layer as an aversive cue through other sensory pathways (olfactory or gustatory), we further assayed whether larvae that are mutant for gustatory receptor (<italic>Gr33a</italic>), odorant coreceptor (<italic>Orco</italic>), and ionotropic receptor (<italic>Ir25a</italic>) cannibalized dechorinated eggs. All tested mutants and their respective control (wild-type) larvae abstained from cannibalizing dechorinated eggs but cannibalized eggs treated with hexane (panels B–D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). All in all, these results suggest that the deterrent effect of the wax layer was not mediated by the function of the classical set of chemosensory systems (<italic>Gr</italic>, <italic>Or</italic>, and <italic>Ir</italic>) but is limited to the <italic>ppk</italic>-dependent sensory system. However, since our understanding of how larvae detect their gustatory and pheromonal environment at present is rather limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref056">56</xref>], further work is necessary to identify the <italic>ppk23</italic>-dependent neuronal circuits that respond to 7,11-HD to regulate egg cannibalism.</p>

<title>Maternal pheromones prevent leakage of egg contents</title>
<p>Earlier studies have reported the water proofing nature of an egg’s wax layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref037">37</xref>] that can be compromised using organic solvents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref057">57</xref>] to facilitate eggshell permeability (especially during histological preparations). We therefore next morphologically examined the surface of wax-layer–deprived eggs to understand why they become vulnerable to cannibal larvae and found that they extrude egg contents through their vitelline membranes. Fine fluid droplets appeared on the surface of hexane-treated eggs after about 20–25 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, such droplets were not present on dechorinated or intact eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>). Cryo-scanning electron microscopy of the egg surface confirmed the droplets to be egg contents permeating through the vitelline membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g003">Fig 3C</xref>; panels A–D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, in most eggs, these droplets stabilize (i.e., they do not completely drain the egg) and persist as such for several hours. This suggests that eggs might have repair mechanisms or that the extruded material could be blocking the permeating sites.</p>
<p>To further ascertain the extent to which maternal and paternal pheromones in the wax layer contribute towards leak-proofing an egg, we examined dechorinated eggs of the four <italic>oe</italic> mutant crosses (described earlier) for leakage under both light and electron microscopy. We found that only eggs with <italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant motherhood that had reduced female pheromones were leaky, suggesting the involvement of maternal pheromones present in the wax layer in preventing egg leakage (panel A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s006">S6 Fig</xref>; panels E–H in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). However, when hexane-washed eggs perfumed with 7-T, cVA, 7,11-HD, and 7,11-ND were examined for leakage using a similar setup, we found that all eggs leaked irrespective of the added pheromone (panel B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). We nevertheless observed some differences among the eggs perfumed by the four hydrocarbons in a) the extent to which they leaked and b) the persistence of the leak. However, we were unable to quantify these differences empirically, and thus, despite demonstrating a strong link between maternally provisioned hydrocarbons and egg leakage, this assay could not independently tag 7,11-HD to the leak-proofing mechanism. This could also be possibly attributed to the arbitrary concentration of 7,11-HD we use or because perfuming fails to completely remodel the wax-layer structure artificially in the absence of other synergetic pheromones.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Leaked egg content provides gustatory cues</title>
<p>The above finding that altering the wax-layer composition through either chemical treatment or genetic manipulation leads to extrusion of egg contents through the vitelline membrane led us to test whether this leaking egg content makes eggs vulnerable to cannibals. We first assayed larval movement in the presence of intact and injured eggs in agar-lined Petri plates to quantify changes in foraging patterns. However, unlike cannibalistic aggregation occurring around injured larva that we have previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref026">26</xref>], groups of injured eggs did not elicit larval aggregation, and the injured eggs were only cannibalized when they were accidentally encountered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). However, 30% of the generally invulnerable dechorinated eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) succumbed to cannibals when smeared with egg content leaking from injured eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). These results imply that larval recognition and cannibalism of conspecific eggs relies on specific gustatory cues emanating from leaking egg content. Nevertheless, this does not rule out the possibility that leaky or injured eggs might additionally release other stress/injury responsive signals that act as cues, facilitating larval detection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>7,11-HD layer can mask sensory cues</title>
<p>Since several experiments above suggested that the protective role of 7,11-HD is dose independent (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g001">1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g002">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g003">3F</xref>), we speculated that the wax layer in general and 7,11-HD in particular form a physical layer that masks or conceals the egg’s nutrient content. To validate our hypothesis, we tested whether drops of yeast that are attractive to larvae lose their ability to do so when coated externally with a layer of 7,11-HD. We thus assayed larval detection and feeding of such 7,11-HD–coated yeast droplets that were dyed to score larval feeding. Larval feeding on yeast coated with 7,11-HD was much lower than in the control treatment in which the yeast was coated with the solvent hexane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Interestingly, when the 7,11-HD layer on the yeast was damaged with a needle (analogous to injuring an egg), larval feeding was no longer reduced despite the presence of 7,11-HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). <italic>ppk23</italic> mutant larvae, in contrast, showed no reduction of larval feeding on yeast droplets coated with 7,11-HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). These results suggest that 7,11-HD forms a physical layer that prevents emanation of cues from substances (yeast or egg) it envelops. However, damage to this layer compromises this effect, even though the same quantity of 7,11-HD remains on the surface.</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>Chemical deception might deter egg cannibalism</title>
<p>Our study shows that under laboratory conditions, the wax layer in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> eggshell a) protects eggs from cannibal larvae, b) prevents egg contents from leaking out through the vitelline membrane, and c) contains pheromones provisioned by both parents. Together with the already-reported result that ovipositing females mark egg-laying sites with a bouquet of pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref051">51</xref>], our finding suggests a nonvisual deception mechanism, whereby larvae misclassify conspecific eggs as an inedible object. This deception seems to be mediated by the hydrocarbon-laden wax layer that conceals the embryo and consequently silences the cues that reveal its identity. However, when damaged or leaky, changes in tactile and gustatory cues might facilitate larval detection of these eggs.</p>
<p>We speculate below on several possible mechanisms through which such a nonvisual deceptive egg defense could possibly operate: first, through “chemical insignificance” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref058">58</xref>], whereby cannibals may not detect or recognize an egg owing to a lack of a detectable chemical profile; second, through “chemical masquerade” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref059">59</xref>] whereby, despite detection, the cannibals might misclassify eggs as objects they normally ignore, possibly empty eggshells. Third, since <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> mark oviposition sites with a similar bouquet of hydrocarbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref051">51</xref>], the eggs might blend with the chemical profile of the environment, additionally preventing detection through “background matching” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref060">60</xref>]. However, since eggs remained protected on the pheromone-free agar surfaces we used during our assays, background matching may be less crucial. Nonetheless, as female aggregation at these oviposition sites increases over time, the cumulative on-site pheromone concentrations might increase to extents that could provide enhanced background matching for eggs that are laid later. Thus, communal egg-laying behavior in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> may facilitate chemical camouflage through impregnation of maternal pheromones onto the egg, a trait that is likely to be favored by natural selection. Interestingly, since oviposition sites are generally shared among several sibling <italic>Drosophila</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref027">27</xref>], such chemical protection of eggs may have extended effects on intraspecific predation and calls for further investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Another potential and inclusive possibility is that the wax layer merely serves as a protective layer to the egg with a primary role in preventing desiccation and, as a byproduct, acts as a preventive barrier against cannibals, pathogens, and toxin permeability. This view is also supported by the parsimonious nature of arthropod pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref033">33</xref>], which allows us to safely speculate that the pheromones in the wax layer of fly eggs could subserve other functions in diverse contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref041">41</xref>]. For example, the pheromones in the wax layer could serve as conspecific cues for adult aggregation, modulate the number of eggs laid at a given site, act as a dispersal cue, and possibly mediate kin recognition. More broadly, our results empirically demonstrate the multiple independent context-dependent functions of a specific pleiotropic pheromone within a single species.</p>
<p>In conclusion, deception as an antipredatory strategy has been predominantly studied in the visual sense but is certainly widespread in other sensory modalities, too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref061">61</xref>]. The few studies describing chemical deception show chemical matching but generally do not study the sensory or the mechanism underlying such deception (for example, masquerade, background matching) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref062">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref063">63</xref>]. Our work here possibly demonstrates chemical deception being mediated by pheromones, which might additionally match an environment created by the ovipositing females. This also mechanistically differs from “chemical mimicry,” for example, in which social parasites mimic host individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref064">64</xref>]. While studies on animal deception have rarely used model systems, our study demonstrates that doing so opens the way for research on the sensory, neural, genetic, and mechanistic basis of deception at an unprecedented resolution.</p>

<p>To assay whether 7,11-HD effectively masks gustatory and olfactory cues emanating from yeast, we tested whether larvae detect yeast drops that are coated with 7,11-HD. Droplets of yeast paste mixed with indigo carmine dye (0.04 mg/1 g yeast; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was placed on small plastic discs (3 mm) and allowed to dry for 3 h, then three successive layers of 0.5 μM 7,11-HD diluted in hexane were dripped over the yeast and allowed to dry over 10-min intervals. As a control, yeast drops were coated with hexane alone. To further demonstrate that the damaged 7,11-HD layer is inefficient at masking the yeast, we included another treatment in which yeast drops perfumed with 7,11-HD as described above had their surfaces scratched with a fine needle. Individual yeast discs were then placed centrally on a Petri plate (60 mm) lined with agarose (2.5%). Eight replicate plates per treatment were thus set up. Groups of 10 second-instar larvae (Canton S and <italic>ppk23</italic> mutant; starved for 30 min) were then placed onto the Petri plate. After 30 min, the larvae were visually inspected for feeding (presence of dye in their guts) and scored.</p>

<p>Most experiments were analyzed using ANOVA in JMP v.10. The proportional data from the following assays were arcsine-square–root transformed and analyzed appropriately using either an ANOVA or a Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test for unequal variance: egg vulnerability, egg toxicity, yeast perfuming, and larval attraction to injured eggs. The data from the egg perfuming assay were analyzed by logistic regression with overdispersion, wherein the four pheromones were included with interaction (PROC GLIMMIX) and pheromone concentration was log transformed and treated as a continuous variable. To simplify the analysis, the three replicates per pheromone concentration were pooled. Statistical analysis of data from mass spectroscopy is described in detail within the respective section below.</p>

<p>70 mg of fertilized eggs (approximately 6,000) were dechorinated, rinsed in water and transferred into a 1-mL glass vial (Sigma Aldrich). 500 μL of n-Hexane (Sigma Aldrich) was added to these eggs and agitated gently on a vortex for 5 min; the solvent was then transferred to fresh vials using glass Pasteur pipettes and assigned codes “blinded” prior to analyzing them.</p>

<title>GC-MS</title>
<p>A gas chromatograph (Trace 1300 GC, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) hyphenated with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ 8000 Evo, Thermo Scientific) was used for the study. Hydrocarbons were separated on a capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D. with 0.25 mm film thickness, Zebron ZB-5ms, Phenomenex) using the following temperature program: initial temperature 50°C held for 3 min, ramped to 150°C at 5°C/min, ramped to 300°C at 15°C/min, and held for 2 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 mL/min. Injections of 2 μL of eggs’ extracts were made in a splitless mode. The injection port and transfer line temperature were kept at 250°C, and the ion source temperature set at 200°C. Ionization was done by electron impact (EI, 70 eV), and acquisition performed in Full Scan mode in the mass range 50–550 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> (scan time 0.2 s). Each of the standard solutions of pheromones at 0.1 mg/mL in hexane were injected and imported in the NIST databases of EI mass spectra. Identification of hydrocarbons was done using XCalibur (Thermo Scientific) and NIST 14 library. The total ion current (TIC) MS was integrated, and the percent of peak area (compared to the total peak area) calculated for each of the four pheromones (cVA, 7-T, 7,11-HD, and 7,11-ND) identified.</p>

<title>APPI FT-ICR MS</title>
<p>The high-resolution mass spectrometry studies were carried out using a hybrid linear ion trap Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (LTQ FT-ICR MS, Thermo Scientific) equipped with a 10 T superconducting magnet (Oxford Nanoscience, Oxon, UK). The mass spectrometer was equipped with the narrow aperture detection electrodes (2X NADEL) ICR cell (Spectroswiss, Lausanne, Switzerland) containing four detection and four excitation electrodes based on a design of an open-ended cylindrical ICR cell, as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref067">67</xref>]. The instrument was operated via standard built-in data station and instrument control software (Xcalibur, Thermo Scientific).</p>
<p>Positive ions were generated using atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) ion source, injected into the linear ion trap for accumulation, and further transferred into the 2X NADEL ICR cell through a set of multipole ion guides. APPI source temperature was 300°C, and inlet capillary temperature was 200°C. Ion population inside the linear ion trap was controlled via the automatic gain control (AGC) function (Thermo Scientific). The ions confined inside the 2X NADEL ICR cell via gated trapping were further excited using a dipolar broadband frequency-sweep excitation. Quadrupolar ion detection was used to acquire analyte ion signals in the cyclotron frequency regime, providing high mass accuracy measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref038">38</xref>]. Ion signal detection period was 768 ms, corresponding to the resolving power of 140,000 at 400 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>. Experimental time domain signals (transients) were recorded using the *.dat file format via advanced user interface capabilities (Thermo Scientific). 100 single transients were summed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and identify low abundant peaks. The final transient was zero-filled twice, apodized with the Hann window, and Fourier transformed into a frequency spectrum. The peaks were picked using three-point parabolic interpolation. Signal processing and data visualization were performed using Peak-by-Peak data analysis framework (Spectroswiss) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref068">68</xref>].</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>All the high-resolution mass spectra were acquired in the mass range of 280–500 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> with the AGC value of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup>. The mass spectra were externally calibrated with the calibration mixture containing caffeine, MRFA, and ultramark (Buchs, Switzerland). Further, mass spectra were internally recalibrated using monoisotopic peaks of the three reference compounds (cVA, 7,11-HD, and 7,11-ND; Cayman Chemical) and a standard two-parametric calibration equation.</p>
<p>First, the mass spectrum of hexane extract of wax layer of intact eggs of wild-type flies was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The full list of compounds identified in this mass spectrum is shown in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s008">S1 Table</xref>. In general, several ion types of each identified compound were detected: M<sup>+</sup>˙, [M+H]<sup>+</sup>, [M+H-H<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [M+H-2H<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [M+H-H<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>+</sup><sub>,</sub> and [M+H-2H<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>+</sup>. The same ion types and corresponding ionization mechanisms using an APPI source have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref069">69</xref>]. The mass spectra of some ions of interest are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s002">S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s004">S4 Fig</xref>. Only the monoisotopic peak (<sup>12</sup>C) of the main ion (the highest abundance) of an identified compound is indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s008">S1 Table</xref>. Additionally, several target compounds were commercially synthesized (Cayman Chemical), diluted in the hexane with the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, and MS analyzed under identical experimental conditions (AGC = 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>). The corresponding mass spectra, displaying four major (the highest abundance) ions of commercially synthesized cVA, 7-T, 7,11-HD, and 7,11-ND, demonstrate the same spectral composition (ion types) of the compounds as in the mass spectrum of hexane extract of the wax layer of intact eggs of wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, hydrocarbon profile of the wax layer was investigated on eggs laid by four parental crosses generated from males and females, with (<italic>oe</italic><sup>+</sup>) or without (<italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup>) <italic>oe</italic>s. The intensities of cVA, 7-T, 7,11-HD, and 7,11-ND were calculated from mass spectra of hexane extracts of wax layer of eggs laid by transgenic mutant fly crosses with/without ablated <italic>oe</italic>s (<italic>oe</italic><sup>−</sup>): C1, <italic>♂oe</italic><sup>+</sup> × <italic>♀oe</italic><sup>+</sup>; C2, <italic>♂o</italic>e<sup>−</sup> × <italic>♀oe</italic><sup>−</sup>; C3, <italic>♂oe</italic><sup>−</sup> × <italic>♀oe</italic><sup>+</sup><sub>;</sub> and C4, <italic>♂oe</italic><sup>+</sup> × <italic>♀oe</italic><sup>−</sup>. Three mass spectra of each hexane extract (C1–C4) were acquired in separate runs, 12 mass spectra in total. The intensity of each target compound is the summation of the SNRs of the monoisotopic peaks of the four most abundant ions, averaged through the three corresponding mass spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006012.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s009">S2 Table</xref>). SNR was calculated as follows: SNR = I<sub>peak</sub>/(5 ∙ δ<sub>noise</sub>), where I<sub>peak</sub> is the absolute spectral intensity of an analyte peak and δ<sub>noise</sub> is the SD of noise. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006012.s004">S4 Fig</xref> demonstrates the expanded views of single mass spectra of hexane extracts C1–C4 plotted on the same figure. To correct drift in MS response (number of charges’ variation between measurements), all the mass spectra were normalized by employing the total SNR. The total SNR of a mass spectrum was calculated as sum of intensities of all peaks higher than 5 ∙ δ<sub>noise</sub>. In general, the total SNR variation between measurements was less than ±10%.</p>

The eggs were mounted on aluminum stubs using a mixture of Tissue-Tek (Sakura Finetek Europe, Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands) and colloidal graphite (Agar Scientific, Stansted, Essex, UK), frozen in nitrogen slush at −210°C and then transferred to the preparation chamber of the Quorum system. The sample was freeze-dried at −80°C for 10 min and then sputter coated with platinum at 10 mA for 25 s. After transfer on the cryostage at −140°C in the scanning electron microscope, imaging was performed at 5 keV using an Everhart-Thornley electron detector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006012.ref070">70</xref>].
