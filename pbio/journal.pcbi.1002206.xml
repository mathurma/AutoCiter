        <p>Interleukin (IL)-21 is an attractive antitumor agent with potent immunomodulatory functions. Yet thus far, the cytokine has yielded only partial responses in solid cancer patients, and conditions for beneficial IL-21 immunotherapy remain elusive. The current work aims to identify clinically-relevant IL-21 regimens with enhanced efficacy, based on mathematical modeling of long-term antitumor responses. For this purpose, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data were acquired from a preclinical study applying systemic IL-21 therapy in murine solid cancers. We developed an integrated disease/PK/PD model for the IL-21 anticancer response, and calibrated it using selected “training” data. The accuracy of the model was verified retrospectively under diverse IL-21 treatment settings, by comparing its predictions to independent “validation” data in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma-challenged mice (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.90). Simulations of the verified model surfaced important therapeutic insights: (1) Fractionating the standard daily regimen (50 µg/dose) into a twice daily schedule (25 µg/dose) is advantageous, yielding a significantly lower tumor mass (45% decrease); (2) A low-dose (12 µg/day) regimen exerts a response similar to that obtained under the 50 µg/day treatment, suggestive of an equally efficacious dose with potentially reduced toxicity. Subsequent experiments in melanoma-bearing mice corroborated both of these predictions with high precision (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.89), thus validating the model also prospectively <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, the confirmed PK/PD model rationalizes IL-21 therapy, and pinpoints improved clinically-feasible treatment schedules. Our analysis demonstrates the value of employing mathematical modeling and <italic>in silico</italic>-guided design of solid tumor immunotherapy in the clinic.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Among the many potential drugs explored within the scope of cancer immunotherapy are selected cytokines which possess promising immune-boosting properties. Yet, the natural involvement of these proteins in multiple, often contradicting biological processes can complicate their use in the clinic. The cytokine interleukin (IL)-21 is no exception: while its strength as an anticancer agent has been established in several animal studies, response rates in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma patients remain low. To help guide the design of effective IL-21 therapy, we have developed a mathematical model that bridges between the complex biology of IL-21 and its optimal clinical use. Our model integrates data from preclinical studies under diverse IL-21 treatment settings, and was validated by extensive experiments in tumor-bearing mice. Model simulations predicted that beneficial, clinically practical IL-21 therapy should be composed of low-dose schedules, and/or schedules in which several partial doses are administered rather than a single complete dose. These findings were subsequently confirmed in mice with melanoma. Thus, future testing of these strategies in solid cancer patients can be a promising starting point for improving IL-21 therapy. Our model can thus provide a computational platform for rationalizing IL-21 regimens and streamlining its clinical development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cancer is a multi-faceted disease, involving complex interactions between neoplastic cells and the surrounding microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Finn1">[1]</xref>. The prospect of immunotherapy, i.e. stimulating endogenous immune responses by various molecular and cellular factors, is emerging as a promising approach against this disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Finn1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Kirkwood1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Ribas1">[3]</xref>. One of the latest candidates for solid cancer immunotherapy is Interleukin (IL)-21, a γc-signaling protein of the IL-2 cytokine family with versatile immune-modulating properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Davis1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-diCarlo1">[5]</xref>, . IL-21 has demonstrated substantial antitumor responses in several independent preclinical studies, in which mice inoculated with diverse transplantable syngeneic tumor lines were treated with the drug via cytokine-gene transfection, plasmid delivery, or injection of the recombinant protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Skak1">[9]</xref>. In Phase I and IIa clinical trials, IL-21 was well tolerated and triggered moderate antitumor activity in some renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and metastatic melanoma (MM) patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Curti1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Davis2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Davis3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Thompson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Schmidt1">[14]</xref>. More recently, clinical trials of IL-21 in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafinib for the treatment of RCC, and Rituximab for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, have also been investigated with encouraging results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Hashmi1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Yet, the intricate biology of IL-21 may set hurdles for its clinical development. Produced mainly by activated CD4+ T cells, IL-21 induces anticancer immunity predominantly by stimulation of natural killer cells (NKs) and/or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Davis1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-diCarlo1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Leonard1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Leonard2">[7]</xref>. The cytokine regulates various cellular and humoral pathways of immunity, and exerts conflicting stimulatory and inhibitory effects on several cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Skak1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Ansen1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-KimSchulze1">[17]</xref>. Recent evidence for anti-angiogenic effects of IL-21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Castermans1">[18]</xref> further complicates its dynamical influence on the tumor microenvironment. Considering this biological complexity, traditional “trial-and-error” methodologies for clinical IL-21 therapy design are likely inefficient, and ought to be replaced by new guided approaches to maximize drug efficacy.</p>
      <p>Rational and systematic planning of anticancer therapy may be directed by mathematical modeling and computer-aided analysis, which provides a better understanding of the involved dynamics. Over the past 25 years, mathematical modeling strategies have been applied in oncology-focused studies investigating tumor progression, angiogenesis and interactions with the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Agur1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Arakelyan1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-dePillis1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Hart1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Kirschner1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Forys1">[24]</xref>. Models for cytotoxic, cytostatic and cytokine-based direct and supportive cancer drugs have been introduced, with some being subsequently validated in preclinical and clinical settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Kirschner1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cojocaru1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Abbott1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Acharya1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Agur2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Agur3">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Agur4">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-dePillis2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Gorelik1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Nani1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Skomorovski1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Vainstein1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Panetta1">[36]</xref>. These strategies have highlighted the importance of adequate selection of therapeutic regimens to achieve desired outcomes, by carrying out in-depth analysis of optimal times, dosages, and durations of treatment. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling of anticancer agents can be particularly useful for clinical design of treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Gieschke1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-vanKesteren1">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have previously developed a mathematical model for the local dynamic effects of IL-21 on solid cancers. The model focused on interactions of IL-21 with NKs/CTLs, effector cytotoxicity against target cells, and immune memory, providing initial understanding of the optimal conditions for IL-21 gene therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio2">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we have designed a new comprehensive PK/PD/disease model to predict clinically relevant scenarios of IL-21 treatment following intravenous (IV) subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal (IP) administration in different cancer indications. The model forecasts long-term effects of the drug by integrating newly described PK/PD processes together with a disease model, based on our initial <italic>in situ</italic> model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio2">[40]</xref>. This new combined model was retrospectively and prospectively validated by <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in IL-21-treated mice bearing melanoma (B16) or renal cell carcinoma (RenCa). Model predictions provide substantial insights concerning adequate planning of systemic IL-21 therapy in solid cancers.</p>

        <title>Experimental data</title>
        <p>Data were collected from a published preclinical study in which mice bearing B16 and RenCa tumors were treated with IL-21 by various strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Sondergaard2">[41]</xref>. Briefly, tumors were induced at day 0, and a daily (B16) or 3×/week (RenCa) IL-21 regimen (50 µg/dose) was applied SC or IP either at an “early” stage (day 3 in B16; day 7 in RenCa), or at a “late” stage (day 8 in B16; day 12 in RenCa) of tumor development. The tumor was measured several times until experiment termination. Data were available from additional unpublished dose-titration experiments in RenCa: IL-21 was given SC, 1× or 3×/week, and groups of mice (n = 6) were assigned a dose between 1-50 µg. The complete database was <italic>a priori</italic> divided into “training datasets” for model parameter estimation, and “validation datasets” for model verification.</p>
        <p>In new prospective experiments designed to test model-suggested regimens, 7-8-week-old wild type C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Europe A/S, Denmark) were inoculated SC in the right flank with 1×10<sup>5</sup> B16F0 melanoma cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CRL-6322) on day 0. Recombinant murine IL-21 (Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) or PBS was injected SC from day 3, when tumors were visible.

Under SC/IP administration, IL-21 is introduced at site (A) and is transported through 3 compartments to the plasma (P). Under IV administration, the drug is injected directly into the plasma. The drug is degraded via 3 additional compartments. IL-21 concentrations in the target tissue (T) are correlated with the plasma levels by parameter <italic>s</italic>. In the target site, IL-21 inhibits NK survival and promotes CTL expansion, while enhancing CPs of both cells and facilitating their tumor cell targeting.

          <title>PK model</title>
          <p>To describe IL-21 PK following standard administration routes, we used experimental profiles of IL-21 serum concentrations in mice after SC, IP, or IV application of a single 50 µg dose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Sondergaard2">[41]</xref>. Since the PK events induced under IL-21 treatment are not fully defined, a non-traditional PK modeling strategy, involving generalized assumptions and a “multiple-modeling” approach, was employed. According to this approach several alternative PK models, differing in number of compartments and connectivity, were developed and tested, leading to the selection of the best performing one. The constructed models were all semi-physiological, incorporating standard PK processes (i.e. drug transport, absorption, and excretion). Each alternative structure was designed to support all three administration routes (SC, IP, and IV), and thus generalized to consider processes mutual or exclusive to the different administration routes. In addition, for every considered model structure and administration route, we calibrated not a single parameter set, but rather ten alternative sets that were tested for satisfying the PK model and fitting the data (for the detailed calibration process, see <italic>Parameter estimation</italic>). This approach, akin to similar multi-modeling strategies exercised in past comparable models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Anderson1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Burhnham1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Karlsson1">[44]</xref>, is thought to enhance the validity of the model: the predicted outcomes would not depend on one parameter set, and therefore would be more robust, and less sensitive to fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Anderson1">[42]</xref>.</p>
          <p>The multiple-modeling approach identified a minimal, eight-compartment model, which effectively recreated the experimental IL-21 PK profiles under all three administration routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002206.s004">Text S1</xref>, section A, for detailed equations and structure of the selected model). In the modeled IV injections, the drug is introduced directly to the plasma, from which it can be transported to three secondary tissues (e.g., the liver, kidneys and bile), reabsorbed to the plasma, degraded, or transferred into the target tissue. This four compartment IV model was chosen by analyzing the number of linearity regions in the data reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Sondergaard2">[41]</xref> (see details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002206.s004">Text S1</xref>, section A). In SC and IP injections, the model contains continuous drug flow from the administration site, via up to three compartments, into the plasma site. The absorption structure was designed to allow: (1) participation of multiple peripheral compartments in IL-21 transition and decay; (2) non-sequential transition between compartments, i.e. multi-directional flow of the drug between tissues. This flexibility was motivated by our assumption that, similarly to other recombinant cytokines with complex PK profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Piscitelli1">[45]</xref>, IL-21 can potentially be taken up, cleared or processed, by several tissues and cells expressing its receptor. Indeed, the murine biodistribution profile in SC/IP administrations demonstrated observable multiplex transport of IL-21 into several peripheral tissues, where its concentrations were higher than plasma levels during several time points (personal communication, Dr. P. Thygesen, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark). Of note, similar multi-compartmental active transport was also described in prior models of IL-21-induced hematological effects in primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Overgaard1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Overgaard2">[47]</xref>, in support of this structure.</p>
          <p>Non-linear Michaelis-Menten kinetics were initially assumed for all transition and degradation processes in the model. Such dynamics have been previously suggested as more suitable for cytokine models, since they are expected to be better at capturing complex drug disposition patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Piscitelli1">[45]</xref>. We also reasoned that non-linearity would allow higher flexibility of the model and account for saturation-containing effects. Conversely, an a-priori linear assumption may cause bias towards underestimation or overestimation of some PK processes. Of note, non-linear dynamics also display clear advantages over simpler linear models in describing certain oncotherapies, and afford substantially improved goodness-of-fit to PK data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Karlsson1">[44]</xref>. Thus, in our model, the transition rate of IL-21 from any compartment <italic>i</italic> to any compartment <italic>j</italic> is given by the non-linear term <italic>J<sub>i,j</sub>:</italic><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002206.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
          <p>The latter is a rate-limiting function of the amounts <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>x<sub>j</sub>,</italic> where parameter <italic>w</italic> is a constant that always regulates the reaction rate and <italic>α</italic> determines the saturation level. The degradation rate of the drug from any compartment <italic>i</italic> in the model is described by term <italic>D<sub>i</sub></italic>, a similar non-linear function of the amount <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> (where <italic>d</italic> regulates the reaction rate and <italic>β</italic> determines the saturation level):<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002206.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p>
          <p>Selected drug transition and degradation events in the resulting eight ODEs model did in fact necessitate non-linear dynamics, as implied by values of the saturation PK parameters <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002206.s004">Text S1</xref>, Table S1): While the IP route may have been satisfied by a linear transport description (as evident by small and negligible <italic>α</italic> values), SC administration required a combination of linear and non-linear transport events (as <italic>α</italic> values were significant). Likewise, nonlinearity surfaced in some degradation processes under all administration routes (as shown by large values for <italic>β</italic>).</p>
          <p>Finally, in the absence of sufficient experimental data on the rate of IL-21 transfer from plasma to the tissue, we assumed a direct correlation between tissue concentration and plasma concentrations. Thus, to relate IL-21 concentrations in the plasma (<italic>x<sub>0</sub></italic>) to those in the target tissue (<italic>x<sub>T</sub></italic>), the two compartments were correlated by a parameter, <italic>s</italic>. Drug levels at the tumor site are therefore a fraction of systemic levels at any given moment: <disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002206.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p>

The key <italic>in situ</italic> processes affected by the drug were described by our previous six ODEs model, which had successfully recreated the antitumor effects in mice subject to IL-21-gene therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio2">[40]</xref>. The model comprised the IL-21-modulated dynamics of the immune effector cells NKs and CTLs, the intracellular cytotoxic proteins by which these effectors lyse the tumor cells, IL-21-induced memory ensuring a long-term CTL response, and the tumor growth (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002206.s004">Text S1</xref>, section B).</p>
          <p>For the current PD/disease structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), NK, CTL, cytotoxic protein, and memory factor populations were described as in the prior tissue model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio2">[40]</xref>. However, some entities were altered herein: (1) IL-21 dynamics in the tissue were modified from the previous system, and set to be correlated with plasma IL-21 levels, effectively binding PK to PD (see above). (2) The new PD model assumes a CTL-dominance (rather than the prior equal effector balance) in the IL-21-mediated response (see <italic>Parameter estimation</italic>). This is based on the notion that CTLs are likely more influential than NKs in the scenario of systemic IL-21 treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Sondergaard2">[41]</xref>. (3) To describe the baseline growth of both B16 and RenCa, the disease model here assumes a logistic function. (4) Parameter values of all prior components were adapted as needed, in order to comply with the systemic therapy settings, and with the new RenCa tumor analyzed herein (see <italic>Parameter estimation</italic>).</p>

          <title>PK parameters</title>
          <p>For calibration of the diverse PK models considered in the multiple-modeling process, serum IL-21 concentrations following a single SC, IP, or IV injection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Sondergaard2">[41]</xref> were used as training datasets. Before calibration, the plasma volume was set at 2 ml and the injected dose at 50 µg. Each potential PK model was fit in a process that yielded ten possible parameter sets. The model was then simulated with these ten sets under diverse treatment settings: A model was deemed reliable when its multiple predictions (generated under all sets) were unified, under all therapeutic scenarios that were simulated. Thus, the final PK model selected for further simulation (see above, as also schemed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002206.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, and discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002206.s004">Text S1</xref>, section A) fulfilled this criterion. For each of the three administration routes accounted for in this PK model, one representative parameter set (of the ten sets) is displayed (see Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002206.s004">Text S1</xref>), and the respective fits are shown as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002206.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>).

        <title>Retrospective model validation by experiments in IL-21-treated mice with RenCa tumors</title>
        <p>Next we assessed the model's generality by investigating whether it can predict IL-21 therapy outcomes in other solid cancer indications, such as RenCa. Tumor growth and selected immune system parameters were set for RenCa, using training data in untreated mice and previously calibrated parameter values for moderately-immunogenic cancers (see <italic><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and methods</xref></italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio1">[39]</xref>). Other parameter values were set exactly as in the B16 case. Simulations of the experimentally-applied IL-21 treatment of 50 µg at 3×/week, given for 3 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Sondergaard2">[41]</xref>, showed model predictions to be strongly akin to the observed dynamics under late (day 12) therapy administered SC, as well as in early (day 7) and late IP regimens (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.90; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Under the early SC regimen, predicted responses were slightly weaker than observed, yet still remained within the measurement's standard deviation (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.73; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, upper panel).</p>
        <p>To further validate the model for RenCa, we simulated it to predict the effects another experiment that applied lower IL-21 doses (between 1–20 µg, SC 3×/week for 3 weeks). Predictions were in agreement with the validation set readouts in most doses (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.94; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), collectively demonstrating a moderate dose-dependent decrease in IL-21-mediated tumor eradication. The 10 µg (3×/week) simulation experiment gave a good, but slightly lower, model-data correlation (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.83; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The model also successfully retrieved a retrospective experiment testing a 30 µg (1×/week) IL-21 treatment schedule (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.90; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Improved model-based IL-21 regimens and their prospective validation in B16-challenged mice</title>
        <p>Having validated the model, we used it to gain insights into better IL-21 therapy in the B16 setting. In particular, we searched for regimens that would be superior to the standard daily SC 50 µg treatment applied previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Sondergaard2">[41]</xref>. First, we tested whether the treatment initiation time is a critical factor in determining IL-21 effects, by simulating different onsets of the standard daily regimen. The model predicted that earlier therapy initiation results in stronger anticancer responses, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The simulated tumor mass at the end of therapy (day 20) was lowest under the earliest regimen, which began one day after B16 challenge: This final tumor load was roughly 15% lower than that obtained in the standard treatment initiated at day 3. In contrast to this early regimen, the tumor load resulting from a delayed regimen, initiated at day 10, was doubled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Further delayed regimens (with onsets as high as day 17) were even less favorable (data not shown). These results collectively emphasize the importance of early-onset therapies. Notably, however, not even the earliest treatment onset was able to fully eradicate the tumor.</p>

        <p>Simulations were performed also to see whether the anticancer response could be improved by fractionating the IL-21 regimen into a more intensive high-dosing protocol, as suggested for other drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Skomorovski1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Agur5">[49]</xref>. To design alternative schedules, the daily IL-21 regimen (16 SC injections, 50 µg each, given from day 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Sondergaard2">[41]</xref>) was taken as a reference point: the same total dose (800 µg) was distributed differently across the treatment window, using various doses and inter-dosing intervals, creating a collection of regimens to be tested. Intriguingly, the model predicted that a more intensive schedule, applying two 25 µg doses per day at a 12-hour inter-dosing interval, would lead to a 45% lower tumor mass than that obtained under the standard daily 50 µg regimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Fractionation into even smaller doses given every few hours produced slightly lower tumor sizes, yet these responses were not significantly better than the 25 µg regimen outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In fact, not even the most fractionated schedule could arrive at full eradication of the tumor. At the other end, less fractionated regimens comprising large IL-21 doses given every few days had significantly weaker efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to verify our prediction that the fractionated 25 µg/12 hour regimen would be superior to the standard 50 µg/24 hour schedule, the two were experimentally applied in B16-challenged mice. Even though both schedules effectively attenuated tumor progression as compared to control PBS-treated mice (*p&lt;.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), the 25 µg/12 hour regimen was considerably more successful than the standard 50 µg daily regimen (**p&lt;.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g004">Fig 4C</xref>), as mathematically predicted. The observed tumor dynamics under the 25 µg regimen had an excellent fit with the prior model predictions (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.90; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), providing strong and quantitative prospective validation of the model's precision.</p>
        <p>We considered that the fractionated regimen may not be clinically practical, since it could involve increased costs of therapy, and, at least in IV delivery, would possibly require hospitalizing patients. Therefore, the search for better treatment was limited to simple, widely-acceptable daily administration schedules. Regimens of one IL-21 dose per day (e.g. 16 SC injections given between days 3–20 following B16 inoculation) were simulated under different dose intensities: A dose-dependent increase in the response, reflected by lowered tumor masses, was predicted for very low (&lt;5 µg) or very high (&gt;50 µg) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Yet interestingly, similar outcomes were predicted for the 5–50 µg dose range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). This might be explained by the conflicting roles of IL-21, enhancing CTL activation while drastically reducing NK numbers at the same time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio1">[39]</xref>; It is likely that in this dosing range, IL-21-increased CTL responses fail to promote further tumor shrinkage due to the IL-21-inhibition of NK availability.</p>

        <p>A prospective experiment in B16-induced mice examined whether a low dosing regimen in the plateau range (i.e. 12 µg/day) could indeed be as effective as the standard 50 µg/day treatment. Beginning on day 3 following tumor challenge, the two doses were applied SC, and the tumor mass was measured until day 17. Both the 12 µg and 50 µg doses induced sufficient antitumor responses in the mice (*p&lt;.05 and **p&lt;.001 compared with PBS-treated mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002206-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Immune-targeted therapy is increasingly apparent in the battle against cancer. Several reagents are in development within this scope, some already approved for use in certain indications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Finn1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Skak1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cheever1">[50]</xref>. In this study, we have devised and validated a clinically-relevant mathematical model integrating the PK/PD effects on immune and disease interactions of IL-21, one of the recent immunotherapeutic drugs under focus in solid cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Skak1">[9]</xref>. Following its verification, our model was used for suggesting beneficial IL-21 treatment policies.</p>
      <p>Previous attempts to model cytokine-based immune modulation of solid malignancies have been mainly theoretical, helping to elucidate certain characteristics of the tumor-immune system cross-talk and providing important insights into treatment success (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Kirschner1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-dePillis2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Nani1">[33]</xref>). Our former model focused on the heart of the IL-21 response, retrieving the effects of cytokine gene therapy to a good extent. Yet, its predictions could not be extrapolated to the clinical realm. The current work is thus among the first biomathematical studies accounting for practical treatment aspects of cytokine immunotherapy in general, and IL-21 treatment in particular. Our current model deals with realistic PK and PD effects on disease progression, clinically-feasible scheduling, patient compliance, etc. Moreover, in contrast to the customary stand-alone PK/PD modeling approach, we have integrated IL-21 PK/PD with specific effects on the involved biological processes, to give a mechanistic, yet minimal, model. Particularly, our PD/disease model accounts for real entities of the IL-21 biological processes (effector cells, etc.), which enabled us to use measurable data and make testable quantitative predictions. At the same time, we kept our model concise thanks to condensation of other overly complex biological entities (cytotoxic proteins, etc.) which are less cardinal and often not measured experimentally. Overall, our approach provides a robust model that can forecast the long-term anticancer effects of a specific immunotherapeutic cytokine, via a clinically-oriented prism.</p>
      <p>Our integrated PK/PD model was constructed by an advanced “multiple-modeling” approach, which we found most suitable for the IL-21 scenario. The selection of a favorable model out of many analyzed structures and complexities, and the use of non-linear kinetics, enabled us to explore significantly more functional possibilities, and allowed for flexibility in the design. Moreover, rather than forming a model per scenario, we were able to create a generalized model by describing processes that are mutual to different therapeutic settings (administration routes, etc.) and tumor types. This enhanced the robustness of the model, since it structure was subject to testing under diverse conditions. Indeed, the model encompasses IL-21-induced outcomes in a wide range of treatment conditions, under different times and administration routes. Despite its simplicity, the model accurately predicted IL-21-relayed effects in B16- and RenCa-challenged mice, both prospectively and retrospectively. Moreover, the model demonstrated robust behavior, and predictions were largely insensitive to modulation of key parameters. With this combined generality and accuracy, the model can potentially accommodate other clinical settings and solid cancers where similar immune processes apply and where IL-21 has been useful (i.e. adenocarcinoma, glioma, neuroblastoma) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Leonard2">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Sondergaard1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A systematic design of clinically applicable IL-21 immunotherapy strategies has long been called for. Considering the modest responses of MM and RCC patients to IL-21 therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Curti1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Davis2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Davis3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Thompson1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Schmidt1">[14]</xref>, it is worthwhile to examine whether the drug can be more powerful under different treatment approaches. Previous trial regimens of IL-21 were determined based on the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for high-dose IL-2 therapy in MM patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Thompson1">[13]</xref>, as the two cytokines share homology and certain effector-inducing functions. Yet, recent findings demonstrate that IL-2 and IL-21 do not entirely align in their actions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-KimSchulze1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Hinrichs1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Marzec1">[52]</xref>, inferring that the optimal administration strategies (administration routes, dose intensities, inter-dosing intervals, etc.) likely vary between the two agents. Local IL-21 delivery or expression have been proposed, by us and others, to be potentially effective and safe approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-KimSchulze1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cappuccio1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Sondergaard3">[53]</xref>, yet such therapeutic methods are not yet available for clinical use. Our systemic model analysis therefore represents a new effort to identify improved, clinically-appropriate IL-21 therapies, using the preclinical tumor models B16 and RenCa as case studies.</p>
      <p>Simulations of differently dosed IL-21 schedules gave rise to central new insights. According to the model, comparable antitumor responses are induced by daily IL-21 doses within the 5–50 µg range. This was prospectively confirmed in B16-challenged mice, in which a substantially lower IL-21 dose (roughly 12 µg/day) was as effective as the standard 50 µg/day treatment. An insensitive range of IL-21 doses with similar efficacy is not unreasonable, considering that the drug respectively inhibits or induces NKs and CTLs, two cells which complement one another in the process of cancer targeting. This model-aided identification of smaller doses with similar therapeutic efficacy could have immense clinical value, possibly reducing putative IL-21-associated toxicities. Adverse events have indeed been reported in IL-21-treated patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Curti1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Davis2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Davis3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Thompson1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Schmidt1">[14]</xref>. IL-2 and interferon-α, other cytokine drugs, are associated with severe hematological and neuropsychiatric side effects complicating their use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Kirkwood1">[2]</xref>. Recent PK/PD models of toxic IL-21 effects on body temperature and red blood cell regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Overgaard1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Overgaard2">[47]</xref> present a possible framework in which our improved regimens can be confirmed for clinical safety.</p>
      <p>Another interesting concept surfacing from our simulations addresses IL-21 fractionation. The model predicted improved antitumor responses by simple partitioning of the experimental regimen (a single 50 µg dose/day) into an equally intense regimen of 25 µg doses given twice daily. This was prospectively validated by experiments in which the fractionation-treated mice ended therapy with ca. half of the tumor load observed after the standard treatment. Model-predicted halving of a daily dose was sufficient to significantly enhance IL-21 efficacy, and further division of the doses was not imperative. Indeed, fractionation of cancer therapeutics was recommended in the past by mathematical modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Agur3">[29]</xref>, and its beneficial effects have been validated preclinically for a chemotherapy supportive drug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Skomorovski1">[34]</xref>. This strategy has mostly been applied in the context of radiation therapy and chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Rosenthal1">[54]</xref>, yet our results, which clearly indicate the benefit of fractionated IL-21 dosing, propose its relevance also to immune-modulating drugs. Notwithstanding, fractionation may be impractical, reducing patient compliance and requiring hospitalization in certain cases. Moreover, embarking on new clinical studies to test fractionation therapy is a large and expensive task, and further adjustment of the mathematical model to humans is needed before engaging in such endeavors. Our findings also raise the question whether IL-21 ought to be administered by available “slow and continuous release” drug delivery methods, which can be viewed as regimens of maximal partitioning. Past cytokine-gene therapy experiments in mice showed complete eradication of IL-21-secreting tumors in which the drug was released in low continuous levels directly in the target tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Leonard2">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Skak1">[9]</xref>, supporting the possible advantage of fractionated regimens. Future implementation of such routes of drug delivery within our model can allow to specifically analyze the benefit of such strategies for IL-21 therapy.</p>
      <p>Our present results set the stage for constructing a humanized IL-21 model, to serve as a tool for streamlining development of the drug, and in the future, hopefully, also for personalizing cytokine immunotherapy. The model, up-scaled to the clinical arena, can entertain diverse cancer indications, patient-specific characteristics, and different modes of therapy. Newly-discovered IL-21 properties of relevance to the anticancer response, such as modulation of T regulatory cell functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-KimSchulze1">[17]</xref> and anti-angiogenic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Castermans1">[18]</xref>, may be introduced in the evolving IL-21 model. Finally, considering the growing interest in combination therapies for solid cancers, and the promising preclinical and clinical responses observed when applying IL-21 with monoclonal antibodies or signaling inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Skak1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002206-Cheever1">[50]</xref>, a future model will also study IL-21 therapy in combination with additional therapeutic reagents.</p>
