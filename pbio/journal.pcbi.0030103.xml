The cell division requires doubling of the genome (DNA) during the synthesis phase (S phase) and halving of that genome during mitosis (M phase). The period between M and S is called G1; that between S and M is G2. Microarray technologies have been used to identify cell cycle genes in several organisms (human, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b002">2</xref>]. Datasets are generated using different synchronization conditions and time measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b003">3</xref>]. Among them, centrifugal elutriation produces a homogeneous population of small cells early in their cell cycle, while temperature-sensitive mutants show arrest in specific cell cycle stages at a restrictive temperature. The mRNA is extracted at a number of time points following synchronization. After measuring the expression level for all genes, those expressed in a periodic manner are identified using several different methods, such as Fourier analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b005">5</xref>]. The result is the assignment of a cell cycle phase to each gene that has been detected as periodically regulated.</p><p>The cell cycle of the fission yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pombe</named-content> lasts approximately 3 h. Its structure is the same as in all other eukaryotes. However, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pombe</named-content> is the only yeast that divides by fission, a symmetrical process in which the old cell grows until it divides, with the formation of a central mitotic spindle, into two equal new cells. As a consequence, it is characterized by a very long G2 phase of overall increase of the cell mass that covers 70% of the cell cycle. The M phase is marked by chromosome condensation and segregation to opposite ends of the cell. Then the cell goes rapidly through the G1 phase with the synthesis and accumulation of active proteins required for DNA replication. Therefore, by the time cytokinesis occurs, the S phase is completed and an entire complement of chromosomal DNA is synthesized.</p><p>Recently, three independent studies have made available gene expression data on the cell cycle of fission yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b008">8</xref>]. They measured gene expression as a function of time in both wild-type elutriation and cdc25 block-and-release experiments, and they identified different datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030103-t001">Table 1</xref>). A total number of almost 1,400 genes are found to oscillate in the three studies. About 10% of these genes are identified as periodically regulated in all the three studies and less than 30% in at least two of them. The definition of cell cycle–regulated genes is far from being rigorous. The identity and the numbers of genes in the periodic datasets strongly depend on the approach and on how conservative one wants to be. Instead of looking at the single gene, we define a periodic cell cycle network and study its cluster structure to find universal properties that are stable despite differences in the datasets. Both Rustici et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b006">6</xref>] and Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b007">7</xref>] identified four clusters of periodic genes, corresponding roughly to the four main phases of the cell cycle, while Oliva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b008">8</xref>] proposed eight different clusters. Nevertheless, the distribution of the phases only reveals two clear expression waves. We consider the periodic cell cycle network corresponding to the intersection of the three datasets, and we study the clustering and its stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b010">10</xref>]. At first, two main components appear. The first one groups all genes in the M, G1, and S phases, and the second corresponds to the entire G2 phase. They fit the pattern shown in the distribution of the phases. Further search for hierarchical substructures of these two clusters shows that the M and G1 phases form a robustly connected single component, while the G2 phase can be divided into two clusters, and the S phase forms a separated component of its own. The stability measure indicates that a structure made of four clusters represents the more reliable pattern of the distribution of the periodic genes on the cell cycle. These clusters are separated by bottleneck structures corresponding to cell cycle checkpoints. We will discuss a set of genes located on these bottlenecks.</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0030103-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030103.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of Wild-Type Elutriation and cdc25 Block-and-Release Experiments and Number of Genes Identified as Periodically Regulated in the Three Studies and in Their Intersection</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030103.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col3" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col4" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col5" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Experiments/Gene</td><td><hr/>Oliva et al. &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b008">8</xref>&rsqb;</td><td><hr/>Peng et al. &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b007">7</xref>&rsqb;</td><td><hr/>Rustici et al. &lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b006">6</xref>&rsqb;</td><td><hr/>Intersection</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wild-type elutriation experiments</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>cdc25 block-and-release experiments</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of periodic genes</td><td>750</td><td>747</td><td>407</td><td>156</td></tr><tr><td>M</td><td>202</td><td>200</td><td>73</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>G1</td><td>86</td><td>140</td><td>70</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>S</td><td>67</td><td>80</td><td>44</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>G2</td><td>336</td><td>367</td><td>133</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>Not assigned</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>40</td><td>43</td><td>8</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>The number of genes assigned to each phase of the cell cycle is specified in the table.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot> --></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Datasets and Quality Assessment</title><p>Genome-wide microarray expression data as well as a list of periodically regulated genes from each study are available online, along with phase and amplitude values assigned to each gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b012">12</xref>]. We considered data obtained from elutriation experiments in the three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>We analyzed the distribution of the phases and amplitudes in each periodic set. We then considered the distribution of phase differences as a more reliable comparative parameter among the three studies. After having studied the histograms, we made use of kernel density plots to remove insignificant bumps and reveal real peaks. Histograms strongly depend on the choice of the bin grid and on the starting point. Kernel density estimators are smoother than histograms and converge faster to the true density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b015">15</xref>]. The choice of a proper bandwidth is still an important issue, and it should represent a compromise between smoothing enough and not smoothing too much to smear real peaks away. We computed the histograms averaging over a large number of shifts of starting points and considering very small bins with data-dependent bandwidth. Changes in the bandwidth do not affect our qualitative analysis.</p><p>The three periodic datasets show differences in size. Searching for an explanation for this discrepancy, we computed the cyclic Fourier component obtained by the time series of each gene in the genome. We then compared it with the one obtained from randomly reshuffled expression data to generate a <italic>p</italic>-value for the periodicity of the corresponding gene. This indicator represents the probability that the observed oscillation occurs by chance. The smallest <italic>p</italic>-values correspond to the most cyclic genes. The amplitude of the oscillation also contributes to the <italic>p</italic>-value in such a way that genes with greater amplitude have a smaller <italic>p</italic>-value. We studied the normalized distribution <italic>P</italic>(<italic>p</italic>) of the <italic>p</italic>-values for the three studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Clustering and Entropy Measure</title><p>We defined a network represented by a complete graph (each node is connected to all other nodes in the graph) where each node corresponds to a gene whose expression was identified as periodically regulated during the cell cycle in the corresponding study.

We studied the degree distribution and clustering coefficient of the resulting network. As we are dealing with a complete, weighted graph, we considered appropriate definitions of the <italic>weighted degree</italic> (strength) and of the <italic>weighted clustering coefficient</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b016">16</xref>]. We also considered the binary network obtained by fixing a threshold <italic>t</italic> and keeping only links with <italic>ω<sub>ij</sub> ≤ t</italic>. We studied the degree distribution and the correlation between the degree and the phase for each gene.
				</p><p>We applied the Markov clustering algorithm (MCL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b018">18</xref>] to study the cluster structure of the periodic cell cycle network. Unlike most clustering algorithms, the MCL does not require the number of expected clusters to be specified beforehand (this condition can be very limiting and time-consuming when there is no specific a priori information regarding the network structure), and it can easily identify possible hierarchies of substructures. Note that the MCL has been used in approaching several bioinformatics classification problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b022">22</xref>]. The basic idea underlying the algorithm is that dense clusters correspond to regions with a larger number of paths. A random walk has a higher probability to stay inside the cluster than to leave it soon. The crucial point lies in deliberately boosting this effect by an iterative alternation of expansion and inflation steps. The algorithm iterates three steps. Given a network with <italic>n</italic> vertexes, it takes the corresponding <italic>n</italic> × <italic>n</italic> adjacency matrix <italic>A</italic> and normalizes each column to obtain a stochastic matrix <italic>M</italic>. It takes the <italic>k</italic><sup>th</sup> power <italic>M<sup>k</sup></italic> of this matrix (expansion) and then the <italic>r</italic><sup>th</sup> power <italic>m<sub>ij</sub><sup>r</sup></italic> of every element (inflation).</p><p>In the case of a weighted graph, such as the periodic cell cycle network, the probability of the random walk is proportional to the weight of the link. In our analysis, the expansion parameter <italic>k</italic> is always taken equal to 2, while the granularity of the clustering is controlled by tuning the inflation parameter <italic>r</italic>. In addition to the parameter <italic>r</italic>, we also introduced a control parameter <italic>β</italic>. This parameter allows us to speed up the process. In a first analysis with <italic>β</italic> = 1, the algorithm needed high values of <italic>r</italic> to identify the first two clusters and then went on very slowly. This behavior can be explained by the fact that our periodic cell cycle network is a complete graph. In what follows we will always consider <italic>β</italic> = 10.</p><p>To study the robustness of the results given by the MCL, we considered the stability of the clustering as related to the identification of unstable nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b023">23</xref>]. A node is unstable if it typically lies at the borders of different clusters, so that the algorithm has some difficulty in assigning it to either of its basins of attraction. To measure the stability of the clustering patterns, we added random noise on the weights of all links in the network and studied the clustering after many realizations. Let <italic>P<sub>ij</sub></italic> denote the probability that the link between node <italic>i</italic> and node <italic>j</italic> connects two nodes inside the same cluster (<italic>P</italic> is equal to 1 for a link that is always kept and 0 for a link that is always cut by the algorithm). By fixing a threshold <italic>θ</italic> (typically <italic>θ</italic> = 0.8) and eliminating all the links with <italic>P<sub>ij</sub></italic> ≤ <italic>θ</italic>, we obtain a certain number (greater than or equal to the number of original clusters) of disconnected components. Nodes belonging to small components that cannot be identified with any of the original clusters can be defined as unstable. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030103-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows a very simple network with a cluster structure made of three components. Through different random noise realizations, the green node is alternatively assigned to either of its basins of attraction. The resulting probabilities <italic>P<sub>ij</sub></italic> of the two links that connect the node to the rest of the network are ≤ 0.8. The node is thus identified as a single component that does not correspond to any cluster, and it is defined as unstable. In the case of the periodic cell cycle network, the weights on the links are modified as <italic>ω<sub>ij</sub></italic> (1 + Δ<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic>) where Δ<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic> are Gaussian deviates with 0 mean and standard deviation 0.5. Results do not change if we increase the noise strength.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030103-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030103.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Simple Graph Made of Three Components</title><p>The MCL is able to identify the three clusters.

The amplitude distribution is very similar across the studies and well fitted by a bell-shaped distribution. It does not give further information on data. The phase distribution is more interesting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030103-g002">Figure 2</xref>, left). The overall behavior is universal, with two main peaks separated by low-expression regions. The first one corresponds to the transition from phase S to phase G2 and the second from phase G2 to phase M. We also introduced the phase distribution of the set of ~800 genes identified as periodic in the budding yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b024">24</xref>] for comparison. It shows a single expression wave corresponding to the S and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Discrepancies can be observed in the position and extension of the two peaks across the three studies on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pombe</named-content>. Differences in the synchronization technology and phase assignment method are probably at the origin of these deviations. We thus consider the phase difference Δ<italic>ϕ</italic> as a more reliable parameter for comparison. The corresponding distributions are much more similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030103-g002">Figure 2</xref>, right). The common minimum corresponds to the low expression regions between the two peaks in the phase distributions. Slight deviations in the head of the distribution are a consequence of normalization over datasets of different size. Differences in the tail depend on a lack of uniformity in the abundance of genes across the four phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030103-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030103-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030103.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Phase Distributions (Left) and Phase Difference Distributions (Right) for Periodic Genes from the Three Independent Studies on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. pombe</named-content> and from the Study on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> by Spellman et al.

The correct number of periodic genes is still unknown, and whether it is better to focus on a small number or to consider all the results as equally meaningful is an open question. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030103-g003">Figure 3</xref> we show the normalized distributions of <italic>p</italic>-values relative to the cyclic spectral component for all genes from the different studies (time series with two or more consecutive missing data points have been ignored). They depend on time series properties, such as the number of points and intervals that differ from one study to the other. Nevertheless, in all of the three studies, they show inverse power-law behavior. This result tells us that if we consider exclusively the information contained in the time series, there is no characteristic threshold that can be used to separate periodic from nonperiodic genes. In the experiments, the choice of the proper periodic dataset strongly depends on the false discovery rate and on the visual doublecheck of the time series. Some degree of arbitrariness remains in the choice of the cut, and it is co-responsible for the discrepancies between the three studies. The fact that Peng et al.

Comparing the three ranked lists, it is possible to observe that the agreement between the three datasets is much stronger between top-ranked genes, which means genes that are found to be more strongly regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b008">8</xref>]. It is therefore interesting to study the minimal list given by the intersection of the three datasets.

The Mantel test returns a value <italic>c<sub>AB</sub></italic> ≈ 0.8, showing a good correlation between the distance matrices of the three experiments. To assess the statistical significance of this result, we compared it with the NH.

The actual value is thus significant against the NH.</p><p>The distribution of the number of genes on the four phases of the cell cycle is now different (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030103-t001">Table 1</xref>). Less then one-third of the shared genes belong to the G2 phase, with most genes belonging to the M–G1–S cluster, and, more precisely, half of them to the G1 phase. We found that even if a gene is periodic in more than one group, the corresponding phase values can be different. The best agreement between the phase values is for genes in the M–G1–S cluster. Less than 20% of the genes show an agreement of the three phase values within the error, while ~60% of the genes show good agreement at least between two values.</p><p>The clustering structure of the intersection shows the same two main clusters as in the separated networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030103-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Further analysis of the hierarchical substructure reveals that genes in the M and G1 phases are strongly connected and cannot be separated, while the S phase forms an independent component. Moreover, the G2 phase shows at least two separated subclusters. The resulting four clusters are separated by bottleneck structures. Two of them correspond to the phase transitions already observed in the networks of the entire datasets. The third one is less evident, and it corresponds to the transition between the G1 and S phases. This clustering pattern is very robust. No more than two or three nodes can be identified as unstable, and they are located on the G1–S bottleneck.

The power-law distribution of the <italic>p</italic>-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030103-g003">Figure 3</xref>) in the three datasets shows that a large number of genes are above the 1% and 5% confidence levels. There is no apparent change in the exponent of the power law in these regions. This implies that the information contained in the time series is not enough to establish a clear division between strictly periodic and nonperiodic genes. It is now known that the cell cycle is central to a large number of subnetworks dedicated to other cell activities. Disruptions in pathways leading to DNA repair, signaling, membrane lipid and protein formation, and protein degradation may affect the survival potentialities of the daughter cells. This argument suggests that a large number of genes may be loosely involved in the cell cycle even if they are not main players of it. The numbers and identity of genes in the periodic sets thus strongly depend on false discovery rate and interpretation of the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b025">25</xref>]. At first, a statistical method such as Fourier analysis is applied in a rather blind way. Then, cell cycle profiles are filtered for minimal amplitude and doublechecked by eye. The visual inspection of the gene expression profiles has its advantages, but obviously a different reproducibility from that of a statistical analysis. Different methods may extract different types of information and may be difficult to compare. The network defined in Clustering and Entropy Measure provides a representation of the entire periodic cell cycle with no need to focus on the single genes or phase values. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030103-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows that, despite the differences in the datasets, some properties of the general structure of the network are universal across the three studies.</p><p>Although G2 is the longest phase in the cell cycle, it is not the most densely populated. It spreads over ~70% of the cell cycle, but in all studies, it contains no more than a half of the identified periodic genes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030103-t001">Table 1</xref>). This is not unexpected. In <italic>S. pombe,</italic> cell division occurs at the end of S phase, implying that the G2 phase represents a long period of mass increment. Most genes are expressed during the entire process and thus do not have a defined expression phase. Some genes, which are probably involved in more specific tasks, are periodically regulated. We studied the amplitude of each gene at the expression peak as a function of the corresponding phase, and we observed that genes are more strongly regulated during the M, G1, and S phases than in the G2 phase. The study of the intersection of the three datasets shows that genes and phase agreement is not so good on the G2 phase. This suggests that G2-phase genes are more likely to be false positives and probably represent an overestimation of the number of genes that are truly periodic. Moreover, in Rustici et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b006">6</xref>] (dataset with 407 periodic genes) G2-phase periodic genes represent a little more than one-third of the entire pool, while in the other experiments (both showing a much bigger pool of ~750 periodic genes), the G2-phase genes correspond to about half the dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030103-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The distributions of the phase differences in the three datasets are very similar, and they clearly identify two waves of periodic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030103-g002">Figure 2</xref>). They are peaked in the M–G1–S phases and the G2 phase, respectively, and they are separated by short, quiet periods in which very few periodic genes are expressed. Nevertheless, both Rustici et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b006">6</xref>] and Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b007">7</xref>] identified four clusters of periodic genes, roughly corresponding to the four main phases of the cell cycle, while Oliva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b008">8</xref>] proposed eight different clusters. This clustering is not consistent with the distribution of periodic genes on the cell cycle. To study the topological clustering of the cell cycle, we applied the MCL to the periodic cell cycle network. In all studies, the first hierarchical level of the clustering shows two main clusters, one corresponding to the M–G1–S phases and the other to the G2 phase, separated by bottleneck structures with very few genes. This pattern reflects the behavior of the phase distribution. The study of the lower hierarchical levels reveals that genes in the M and G1 phase form a strongly connected cluster that cannot be further divided by the algorithm. On the other hand, genes in the S phase are grouped in an independent component, and the G2 phase can be partitioned into at least two clusters. This pattern is universal across the different studies, suggesting that the topology of the network contains information on the biological processes involved in the cell cycle.</p><p>The stability of the clustering shows the robustness of the structure against the presence of false positives and false negatives in the datasets. The entropy landscape does not change much across the experiments. It always reaches saturation when the network splits into six or seven clusters. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030103-g005">Figure 5</xref>, we see that Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b007">7</xref>] and Rustici et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b006">6</xref>] show a common stable minimum of the entropy at <italic>r</italic> ≈ 2. In both studies, this minimum corresponds to a separation into five clusters. A similar result holds for Oliva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b008">8</xref>] with a slightly different value of the clustering parameter (r ≈ 2.2). In the network of the intersection, the entropy landscape shows a minimum that corresponds to a separation into four or five clusters. We thus suggest that a basic structure made up of four clusters (with eventually a fifth one in the G2 phase) could be the most reliable picture of the clustering pattern. Genes in the M and G1 phases form the first component, genes in the S phase form the second component, and then genes in the G2 phase form the last two components.</p><p>For the sake of comparison, we also applied a different clustering algorithm to the periodic cell cycle network. In recent years, several methods have been proposed to reveal the community structure of very heterogeneous networks. Among them, only a few can successfully handle a complete and weighted graph. One possible choice is an algorithm based on modularity (<italic>M</italic>) optimization (a measure of the difference between the number of links inside a given module and the expected value for a randomized graph of the same size and degree distribution) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b026">26</xref>]. We considered a recent method based on simulated annealing to obtain clustering by direct maximization of <italic>M</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b027">27</xref>]. The results are very similar to the more reliable picture obtained by the MCL (as described in the previous paragraph). The application to the periodic cell cycle network in Rustici et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b006">6</xref>] and Oliva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b008">8</xref>] returns a structure made of four clusters: one corresponding to the M phase and part of the G1 phase, one corresponding to the end of the G1 phase and the S phase, and two modules inside the G2 phase. In the case of Peng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b007">7</xref>], a fifth cluster corresponding to the G2–M phase is identified. The bottleneck structures identified by the MCL are well respected. The main difference seems to be the partitioning of genes in the G1 phase between the two clusters corresponding, respectively, to the M phase and the S phase. To explain this behavior, we refer to a recent work on resolution limits in community detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b028">28</xref>]. The authors give evidence that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a certain scale, depending on the total number of links in the network and on the number of connections between the clusters. More precisely, even a module whose size is on the order of the size of the entire network may not be resolved if it has a number of external links on the order of the number of connections inside the module itself. In the exploratory data analysis we showed that only the two main communities of the periodic cell cycle network are revealed by the phase distribution. However, the MCL is able to identify a cluster substructure. Our discussion of the results points out that the module corresponding to the S phase is the last one isolated by the algorithm, and that the bottleneck between the G1 and S phases is the less evident and more unstable one. The number of links connecting this module to the M–G1 cluster is on the order of the number of internal links. According to these arguments, the modularity algorithm would rather split the big M–G1–S cluster into two symmetric subclusters than separate the smaller S phase from the larger M–G1 component.</p><p>The analysis of the stability of the clustering in the network of the intersection reveals its robustness. There are no unstable nodes on the two main bottlenecks, the G2–M and the S–G2, and only one or two unstable nodes on the border between the G1 and S phases and between the two clusters in the G2 phase. These results confirm the significance of these structures and their role in the biology of the cell cycle. The bottlenecks are strongly correlated to cell cycle checkpoints. These are cellular pathways, induced by DNA damage, that block cell cycle progression or slow the rate at which the phase proceeds. According to the cell cycle stages, there are at least three DNA damage checkpoints: G1–S (G1) checkpoint, intra–S phase checkpoint, and G2–M checkpoint. We thus investigated those genes that are located at the borders between different clusters that correspond to cell cycle checkpoints. We ranked the nodes according to their strength, starting from the one with the smallest value, and we kept those that are on top of the ranking in at least two datasets. These nodes represent genes that are located on the bottlenecks corresponding to cell cycle checkpoints. This means that they are periodically expressed during the transition from one phase to the next. A list of these genes and their functions is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030103-t002">Table 2</xref>. Most of them have important functions, and we propose them as potential new cell cycle regulators involved in the control of the transition from one phase to the next [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030103-b029">29</xref>].</p><p>The approach described in this paper is an example of comparative analysis and can be applied to other, similar complementary datasets. Moreover, the periodic cell cycle network can be built from any gene expression dataset. The study of the clustering and the stability measure reveal the more reliable community structure of this network. The identification of nodes lying at the borders of different clusters can contribute to the isolation of genes potentially involved in cell cycle regulation. As a future development, we will consider applying this method to gene expression data on the human cell.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>CCC and PDLR would like to thank the Swiss National Research Foundation (200021–107957/1) for financial support.
