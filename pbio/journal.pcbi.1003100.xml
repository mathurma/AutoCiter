<p>Identification of responsive genes to an extra-cellular cue enables characterization of pathophysiologically crucial biological processes. Deep sequencing technologies provide a powerful means to identify responsive genes, which creates a need for computational methods able to analyze dynamic and multi-level deep sequencing data. To answer this need we introduce here a data-driven algorithm, SPINLONG, which is designed to search for genes that match the user-defined hypotheses or models. SPINLONG is applicable to various experimental setups measuring several molecular markers in parallel. To demonstrate the SPINLONG approach, we analyzed ChIP-seq data reporting PolII, estrogen receptor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), H3K4me3 and H2A.Z occupancy at five time points in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line after estradiol stimulus. We obtained 777 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> early responsive genes and compared the biological functions of the genes having <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding within 20 kb of the transcription start site (TSS) to genes without such binding site. Our results show that the non-genomic action of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> via the MAPK pathway, instead of direct <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding, may be responsible for early cell responses to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> activation. Our results also indicate that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responsive genes triggered by the genomic pathway are transcribed faster than those without <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding sites.

<p>Cellular processes in mammalian cells are tightly regulated to ensure that the cells function properly as a part of an organism. Dysregulation of some of these processes, such as apoptosis, cell proliferation and growth, can lead to cancer. One of the most important regulation mechanisms for cellular processes is via activation of membrane receptors by extra-cellular stimulus. Such cues trigger signal cascades that lead to altered expression of a number of genes in the cell nucleus; a key challenge in biomedicine is to identify which genes respond to a specific stimulus. These so called response genes can be investigated on a whole-genome scale with genomic sequencing, which is a technology that can quantify protein binding to DNA or gene activation. Analysis of such whole-genome data, however, is challenging due to billions of data points measured in the experiments. Here we introduce a novel computational method, SPINLONG, which is a widely applicable novel computational method that integrates multiple levels of deep sequencing data to produce experimentally testable hypotheses. We applied SPINLONG to breast cancer data and found early responsive genes for estrogen receptor and analyzed their regulation. These analyses resulted in a gene whose high activity is associated with decreased breast cancer patient survival.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The identification of genes whose expression patterns are altered due to a stimulus is essential as it provides a basis to understand which signaling and metabolic pathways are influenced as a consequence of a stimulus. The majority of approaches to identify stimulus-regulated changes in gene expression rely on the relative abundance of mRNA molecules, either measured with microarrays or with RNA-seq, as an indirect indication of transcriptional initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Ochsner1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-RossInnes1">[3]</xref>. A major issue with using full length mRNA molecules as an indication of a transcriptional response is that the time needed to transcribe full length mRNA molecules depends strongly on the length of the genes: Whereas the transcription of short genes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) can be completed within less than 10 minutes, longer genes may take over an hour to be transcribed. Consequently, secondary responses, which may occur before the longest genes are fully transcribed, make identification of primary responsive genes challenging.</p>
<p>Transcription is a dynamic process that is regulated by transcription factors and is reflected in local histone modifications. A reliable indication of an actively transcribed gene is the presence of RNA polymerase II (PolII) protein complex in the body of the gene. PolII generates the precursors of most mRNA, snRNA and miRNA molecules, and its activity is modulated by histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Selth1">[4]</xref>. Chromatin-level phenomena predict the majority of RNA level changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Tippmann1">[5]</xref>, and the changes in PolII activity after a stimulus are detectable earlier than changes in mature RNA levels. Thus, we hypothesized that considering PolII together with histone modifications could provide a reliable indication of changes in the rate of transcriptional activity at responding loci.</p>
<p>Genome-wide PolII activity can be measured with ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with massive parallel sequencing) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Nielsen1">[6]</xref> and with GRO-seq (global run-on sequencing) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Core1">[7]</xref>. The PolII machinery moves through the body of a transcribed gene, and following stimulation this motion can be seen as a ‘wave’ of increased reads along the responding genes. Conceptually, the PolII wave is a spatio-temporal pattern. Here, we introduce a data-driven computational approach, SPINLONG (Spatial Pattern Identification by Non-Linear OptimizatioN with Global constraints), that identifies spatio-temporal patterns in deep sequencing data. To accommodate for various experimental setups, SPINLONG allows users to define custom searchable patterns. For instance, such spatial patterns could be: ‘low-low’ (little PolII activity without stimulation), ‘high-low’ (increased number of reads at the beginning of a gene, but not at the end) and ‘high-high’ (fully transcribed gene characterized by a large number of reads along the gene). To our knowledge, SPINLONG is the first approach that allows identification of such spatio-temporal patterns from deep sequencing data.</p>
<p>Estrogen receptor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is over-expressed in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of breast cancers and is a major therapeutic target in breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Lupien1">[8]</xref>.

These lead to changes in expression patterns of hundreds of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responsive genes that govern cell phenotypes, such as cell growth and proliferation. The importance of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-mediated gene regulation in breast cancer was highlighted in a recent study that showed that genes with an elevated expression pattern and an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding site within 20 kb from their transcription starting sites are correlated with patient survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-RossInnes1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the utility of SPINLONG, we characterized estradiol-induced early responsive genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells with SPINLONG analysis based upon ChIP-seq data for PolII, H3K4me3 and H2A.Z occupancy at 5+2 time points following estradiol stimulation. Time points 0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 minutes were used to capture early transcriptional responses. Additionally, information from 160 and 640 minutes was used as auxiliary data points to supplement the main analysis. We used also ChIP-seq data for measuring the binding of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to DNA at 5 minutes time point to identify genes that are directly regulated by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding. After identifying the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> early responsive genes, we used 150 primary breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-TheCancerGenomeAtlas1">[9]</xref> to assess the survival effect of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> response genes.

<title>The SPINLONG method</title>
<p>SPINLONG is a computational method for ranking genomic regions, such as genes, based on how closely they match a spatio-temporal deep sequencing pattern defined by the user. The overall schematic of the SPINLONG approach is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003100-g001">Figure 1</xref> and a detailed description is in Materials and Methods. Briefly, the user first encodes a set of hypotheses, or models, as patterns for SPINLONG. These patterns divide each genomic region into one or more contiguous segments that are expected to contain a “low” or “high” number of sequencing reads. Patterns are configured using an expressive notation based on linear algebra, supporting complex experimental setups such as time series and multiple molecular markers. A deep sequencing experiment, such as ChIP-seq, is followed by preprocessing in SPINLONG. In the primary analysis step scores are assigned to each pattern for each defined genomic region utilizing Hidden Markov Models. The scores are computed by a non-linear optimization procedure which assigns lengths to each segment in the patterns and estimates numeric short read thresholds for “low” and “high” segments. The scoring method and parameters can be configured by the user. The resulting scores and accompanying metrics indicate how well the pattern observed in the data matches the anticipated pattern defined by the user. Scores can be used to classify genes as induced or repressed, whereas assigned segment lengths can be used in downstream analyses, such as estimating PolII elongation speed.</p>

User-provided information is shown with blue labels. Short reads (gray) for each sample are assigned into fixed length bins and bin counts are normalized. A user-defined pattern describes the expected spatial distribution of bin counts in the samples, formulated by dividing each sample into one or more segments (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Segment classes <italic>H</italic> and <italic>L</italic> indicate whether the segment is expected to contain a “high” (red) or “low” (blue) amount of short reads, respectively. The user defines the segment divisions and their classes, while nonlinear optimization is used to assign segment lengths (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) by maximizing score function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and taking into account linear constraints.

<title>Identifying PolII activity regions in MCF-7 after estradiol stimulus</title>
<p>An essential first step in identifying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genes with the SPINLONG pattern matching process is to accurately establish genomic regions of PolII activity that correspond to gene promoter and body. These regions correlate with transcribed units delimited by transcription start sites (TSSs) and termination sites (TTSs). While <italic>a priori</italic> coordinates of transcribed regions can be obtained from genomic databases that list annotated genomic features, these do not take context dependent factors into account. For instance, individual transcripts often have multiple TSSs, with specific TSSs utilized in response to particular signaling processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Sun1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Pal1">[11]</xref>. Consequently, we used SPINLONG to determine regions of PolII activity directly from the deep sequencing data in a data-driven fashion.</p>
<p>In addition to PolII ChIP-seq profiles, local histone modifications and substitution by the variant histone H2A.Z correlate with the location of TSSs and thus provide information that can be used in localizing the gene bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Selth1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Raisner1">[12]</xref>. We therefore used PolII in conjunction with H3K4me3 and H2A.Z ChIP-seq data to delimit estrogen responsive gene regions in MCF-7. Occupancy of PolII over an annotated transcript is used to locate both PolII activity start and termination sites (corresponding roughly to TSSs and TTSs), while the location of H3K4me3 and H2A.Z correlate with the location of start sites. Initial coordinates of transcribed loci were obtained from Ensembl v.61 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Flicek1">[13]</xref> and then extended in the 5′ and 3′ directions by 50% of the gene length, to generate a total region for analysis twice the length of the transcribed unit.</p>
<p>Regions associated with the presence of PolII are computed from the lengths of PolII body segments assigned by the SPINLONG score optimizer (see Materials and Methods). The scores ranged from 0 to 1.08, and the threshold used here (0.60) corresponds to a gene whose spatial short read coverage matches the evaluated pattern in 60% of genomic locations. The spatial pattern searched from the PolII profile is ‘low-high-low’, <italic>i.e.</italic>, a gene body with a large number of PolII reads is flanked by areas of low PolII signal. If there are overlapping transcribed genes within the area of search, the resulting spatial distribution matches poorly with this pattern and produces a low score. For such genes and others with a low score, Ensembl regions are used. This criterion, when combined with local H3K4me3 and H2A.Z profiles, identified 4,275 genes that were considered as active PolII regions.</p>
<p>Two high scoring putative estrogen responsive genes, <italic>MYEOV2</italic> and <italic>DNPEP</italic>, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003100-g002">Figure 2</xref>. <italic>MYEOV2</italic>, which has score of 1.05, has proximal promoter PolII enrichment that colocalizes with H3K4me3 and H2A.Z peaks, and the PolII signal in the body of the <italic>MYEOV2</italic> is well above that of the 5′ and 3′ flanking regions. The extent of occupancy of PolII, H3K4me3 and H2A.Z on <italic>MYEOV2</italic> makes locating the PolII activity region relatively straightforward. In contrast, <italic>DNPEP</italic> (score 0.96) has multiple known potential promoter regions and over 20 alternative transcripts. Taking into account H3K4me3 and H2A.Z occupancy, the SPINLONG optimizer selected a region that initiates 10 kb downstream from the annotated TSS.</p>

<p>Using five time-points of PolII ChIP-seq measurements (0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 minutes after stimulation), in conjunction with a non-specific antibody background sample as a subtraction control and utilizing a conservative score threshold (0.65) for an estrogen regulated gene, SPINLONG analysis characterized 699 genes as induced and 78 as repressed following estradiol stimulus.

<title>Estimating the propagation speed of PolII in E2 responder genes</title>
<p>The PolII transcription process consists of initiation, elongation and termination phases, with elongation occurring at 0.5–4 kb/min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Selth1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Hager1">[17]</xref>. There is evidence, however, that under optimal conditions, PolII speed can exceed 50 kb/min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Maiuri1">[18]</xref>. Through the time-series measurement of PolII progression in conjunction with the SPINLONG analysis, it is possible to estimate the speed of PolII on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responsive genes. The PolII cascade forms a leading (induced genes) or lagging (repressed genes) edge, whose position is obtained from SPINLONG segment lengths. Comparing the locations of these edges at each time point gives lower bound estimates for propagation speed, <italic>i.e.</italic>, a large difference in edge locations in neighboring time points indicates high speed.</p>
<p>We observed that the transcription rate of PolII correlates strongly with gene length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003100.s020">Figure S20</xref>), with long genes transcribed at higher rates. The majority of estimates were between 1 and 10 kb/min, with some estimates exceeding 10 kb/min. High speed estimates were primarily obtained for induced genes. Early responding genes showed a rapid propagation of transcription across the gene body, suggesting rapid PolII elongation probably due to an open chromatin configuration in these genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Churchman1">[19]</xref>. While rapid propagation of PolII initiated transcription is in line with recent reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Maiuri1">[18]</xref>, the presence of multiple PolII cascades hinders estimation of PolII synthesis and elongation speed directly from sequencing data. Thus, the speeds reported here should be interpreted as the speed of information propagation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we noted that genes with an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> site within 20 kb of the TSS (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) had a median transcription rate of 1,983 bp/min, which is significantly higher than the rate of 1,597 bp/min for genes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) without an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> site (permutation test, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have developed a novel data-driven computational approach to facilitate the analysis of cell processes that are characterized by spatio-temporal signals. The large degree of freedom in defining patterns allows SPINLONG to scale to a variety of experimental designs where the user is able to formulate patterns to be identified within the data. Although the need to define the patterns <italic>a priori</italic> may place some conceptual load on the user, this approach offers a methodology to fuse hypothesis- and data-driven experimental designs. Furthermore, the segmentation-based paradigm allows clear visualization of the identified patterns and input data, which facilitates interpretation of results.</p>
<p>Methodologically, SPINLONG is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification, such as to determine whether a gene is induced, repressed or neither, but also for “sequence labeling” tasks, such as dividing a gene into flanking regions of PolII activity and inactivity. In genomic data analysis, SPINLONG shares some similarities with ChIP-seq peak detection algorithms (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Zhang1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Rozowsky1">[22]</xref>), as both aim to define spatial patterns in quantified DNA data. The unique feature of SPINLONG is that it permits more complex patterns to be discovered than peaks in single samples, including temporal patterns in multi-marker time-series experiments. This flexibility is achieved through the use of simulated annealing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Suman1">[23]</xref>, which allows for complex objective functions, as well as linear algebra constraints for expressing relationships between samples and spatial segments of target regions.</p>
<p>When we applied SPINLONG to a time-series data from MCF-7 breast cancer cell line after <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> stimulus, we identified 777 early responsive genes. This set included several established <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> target genes, such as <italic>XBP1</italic>, <italic>GREB1</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic>. Recently, Hah and colleagues used GRO-seq in MCF-7 cells and listed 3,098 estradiol response protein-coding transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Hah1">[24]</xref>. For SPINLONG identified induced genes, 127 out of 699 (18%) genes were also induced in the GRO-seq dataset (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> assuming a total of 10,000 profiled genes), whereas for repressed genes 31 out of 78 (40%) were found in both analyses (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The main reason for the relatively low number of overlapping genes is that SPINLONG used more stringent criteria, which require that the spatio-temporal profiles of a gene across all time points are consistent. Additionally, there are differences in sequencing depths: Hah <italic>et al.</italic> used 6–10 million mapped reads per sample whereas we used approximately 100 million. The consequence of varying sequencing depths is illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003100.s021">Figures S21</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003100.s022">S22</xref> for the genes <italic>XBP1</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic>, which are classical <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responsive genes and belong to the top five in the SPINLONG results. <italic>CCND1</italic> belongs to the list of the 3,098 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responsive genes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Hah1">[24]</xref> and it has relatively good coverage. However, <italic>XBP1</italic> is not detected as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responsive genes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Hah1">[24]</xref> and this is clearly due to insufficient sequencing depth. In the SPINLONG analysis, <italic>XBP1</italic> is the strongest candidate for an induced gene with a score of 1.00, and its expression has been reported to be 11-fold induced in MCF-7 cells after estradiol stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Sengupta1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to recent PolII profiling-based efforts, ER responsive genes have been investigated using microarrays, RNA sequencing and low-throughput methods. These resources include ERGDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Tang1">[26]</xref>, ERTargetDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Jin1">[27]</xref> and Cicatiello <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Cicatiello1">[28]</xref>. The numbers of ER responsive genes in these studies were 1,208 (ERGDB), 1,570 (ERTargetDB) and 1,150 (Cicatiello <italic>et al.</italic>). We compared these three and SPINLONG identified ER responsive gene sets using a set overlap analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003100.s023">Figure S23</xref>). The overlap between any pairs of the four ER responsive gene sets was small and there were only 13 genes that were common to all four sets. One reason for small concordance is experimental factors. For example, the PolII-based SPINLONG analysis captures early response genes, whereas mRNA profiling at 24 hours includes secondary responses and misses transient early responses.</p>
<p>Our results show that only 40% of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> early responsive genes have <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding within 20 kb from TSS at 5 min after estradiol stimulus.

The GO enrichment analysis (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, FDR-corrected) for induced genes having an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding site produced only four enriched GO terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003100.s027">Table S2</xref>). These terms are unspecific and their significance in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mediated responses is elusive. In contrast, genes without <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding produced 71 enriched GO terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003100.s028">Table S3</xref>), including <italic>translational initiation</italic> and <italic>G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle</italic>, which are biological processes known to be regulated by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> activation.</p>
<p>Kaplan-Meier analysis with 150 primary breast cancer tumors from TCGA resulted in 19 early <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responsive genes that have survival association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003100.s026">Table S1</xref>). <italic>ATAD3B</italic> had the strongest statistically significant survival association. Its over-expression has been associated with chemoresistance in several cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Li1">[16]</xref>. Our results indicate, for the first time, that over-expression of <italic>ATAD3B</italic> is also associated with significantly lower survival of post-menopausal breast cancer patients with ER+/HER2− tumors. Interestingly, there are no <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding sites within 20 kb of the TSS for <italic>ATAD3B</italic>.

Our results indicate that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responsive genes with direct <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding have different function and median transcription speed than the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responsive genes without <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding. The GO analysis suggests that the non-genomic <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> activation is crucial in exerting the transcriptional responses due to estradiol stimulus though we cannot exclude the possibility of direct distal <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> regulation. Furthermore, our results point to the direction that the non-genomic pathway, via <italic>ATAD3B</italic>, may play a role in resistance to anti-<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> therapeutics in breast cancer. Accordingly, inhibition of the MAPK pathway leading to inactivation of myogenin or Myc could lead to down-regulation of <italic>ATAD3B</italic> and thus provide a putative therapeutic target for post-menopausal ER+/HER2− breast cancer patients. Even though more work is needed to firmly establish the role of <italic>ATAD3B</italic> in this subtype of breast cancer, our results demonstrate that SPINLONG is capable of producing experimentally testable hypotheses from large-scale deep sequencing data.</p>
<p>SPINLONG can be customized according to research hypotheses, as demonstrated here for the propagation of PolII on a gene. This, together with a computationally fast implementation that allowed to process 1.2 billion data points in 8 hours, makes SPINLONG a strong method to analyze multi-level deep sequencing data. In addition to ChIP-seq data, SPINLONG can be applied to data produced by other deep sequencing technologies, such as GRO-seq data, provided that the deep sequencing depth is sufficiently deep (greater than 100 million reads per sample) in order to identify patterns reliably. In summary, SPINLONG is a widely applicable novel computational method that integrates multiple levels of deep sequence data to produce experimentally testable hypotheses.</p>

<title>Data import and preprocessing</title>
<p>In the sequencing data import step, the genome is divided into fixed length bins of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nucleotides and short read counts in each bin are computed for each sample. Default <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is 300 nucleotides; a relatively large bin size is used to reduce spatial noise. Each sample is normalized for differences in sequencing depth by making the sum of bin counts constant across the genome. Optionally, a control sample is used to control for local variation in ChIP-seq by subtracting control bin counts from each non-control sample bin count.</p>
<p>After data import, we focus on a pre-defined genomic region <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is a chromosomal interval overlapping with a number of bins. To reduce spatial variation in bins, a median filter with a window of nine bins is applied within <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To reduce noise caused by low signal, background level of the region <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is estimated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> percentile in the bin count distribution within <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and this level is subtracted from all bins in the region. Negative counts are clamped to zero. As a result of preprocessing, we obtain an array of normalized bin counts for each sample.</p>

<title>Pattern matching</title>
<p>The core of the SPINLONG approach is pattern matching by score optimization. A pattern encodes a hypothesis, such as “transcription of a gene is initiated close to its starting site after stimulus and transcription progresses from 5′ to 3′ direction.” A score indicates how well the bin counts of the current region match the pattern. The user can define the expected spatial arrangements of bin counts in the samples, a scoring scheme and optional constrains for optimization.</p>
<p>Pattern matching is done in the context of a genomic region and the pattern is evaluated against all defined regions, such as all genes in a genome. A pattern divides the bins of each sample into <italic>segments</italic>, which are non-overlapping sub-intervals of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Each segment is annotated with a label that describes the expected bin count class of the segment. The classes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denote “low” and “high” bin counts, respectively, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (ignored) denotes that the segment does not participate in scoring. Together, segments and their classes describe the expected spatial distribution of bin counts within samples. The user can define the number and classes of segments as well as their constraints, while their lengths are assigned in the optimization step.</p>
<p>Formally, the segments of a pattern are denoted as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and their assigned lengths (in nucleotides) as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The lengths <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are assigned by a score-maximizing optimization process. Segment lengths are constrained by structural and user-defined constraints. An example of a structural constraint is the requirement that the segments in a sample must cover all the bins of the sample: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes segments belonging to the specific sample and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the length of the current region. Optional user-defined constraints are used to fine tune and guide the optimization process. These constraints include segment length boundaries <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and global constraints <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Global constraints allow defining relationships within and between samples. These allow, for instance, expressing constraints between time points and distinct ChIP targets.</p>

<title>Pattern scoring</title>
<p>The pattern scoring step evaluates each genomic region against the hypothesis and guides the optimization step. The result of the pattern scoring is the primary outcome of SPINLONG.</p>
<p>Pattern scoring uses assigned lengths (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) together with bin counts and segment classes to obtain a composite score. Patterns are scored in a two-step fashion, where individual segments are scored first and then combined into a composite score. A general scheme for segment scoring is to assign a score for each segment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using the current length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and state information (denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) maintained by the optimizer. We denote by <italic>segment scorer</italic> a data structure that is responsible for assigning scores to specific segments and maintains its dynamic state information <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>All segments belonging to the same sample are scored with the same scorer, but there may be several independent scorers for independent sets of samples. Samples for distinct markers, such as PolII and H3K4me3, use separate scorers because their data ranges are different and segment scorers assume a common range for all associated samples. Segment score for a segment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and scorer index <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>Preparation of MCF-7 cells</title>
<p>The MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line originates from a 69-year old Caucasian woman and is estrogen receptor (ER) positive, progesterone positive (PR) and HER2 negative. Here MCF-7 cells (a clonal isolate kindly provided by Prof. Edison Liu, Jackson Laboratories, Maine, USA) were grown in 15 cm plates to 80% confluency. Plates were then washed 2 times with PBS and overlaid with 20 ml of phenol-red free high glucose DMEM (Gibco) containing 2% charcoal stripped FCS (Sigma). After 24 hours of incubation, the cells were again washed with PBS and fresh media containing 2% charcoal stripped FCS was added. This process was repeated over a three day period to generate cells devoid of estradiol signaling. The time course (10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1280 min) was initiated by replacing media with prewarmed media containing 10 nM E2. In addition, an untreated sample was included in the experiment as a zero time point.</p>

<p>Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, followed by DNazol treatment (QIAGEN). 100–250 ng total RNA was subjected rRNA depletion with the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat; cat. no. RZH110424). The rRNA depleted sample was purified by ethanol precipitation. mRNA was fragmented by hydrolysis (5× fragmentation buffer: 200 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.2, 500 mM potassium acetate, and 150 mM magnesium acetate) at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for 90 sec and then purified (RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit, QIAGEN). cDNA was synthesized using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> random hexamers using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). ds-cDNA synthesis was performed in second strand buffer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and then purified (MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit, QIAGEN). ds-cDNA was prepared for Illumina sequencing according to the manufacturer's protocols (Illumina). Briefly, ds-cDNA fragments were subject to sequential end repair and adaptor ligation. ds-cDNA fragments were subsequently size selected (approx. 300 base pair [bp]). The adaptor-modified DNA fragments were amplified by limited PCR (14 cycles). Quality control and concentration measurements were made by analysis of the PCR products by electrophoresis (Experion, BioRad) and by fluorometric dye binding using a Qubit fluorometer with the Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Q32851) respectively. Cluster generation and sequencing-by-synthesis (36 bp) was performed using the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GAIIx) according to standard protocols of the manufacturer (Illumina).</p>

<title>Alignment and preprocessing of sequencing data</title>
<p>To align all reads, we used the GMS_map software (version 3.2.1) on a Genomatix Mining Station. The reference genome used was human hg19 (NCBI build 37). The software uses a seed-based approach to align reads. Mapping a read to a reference sequence involves two steps. In the first step, seeds for potential mapping positions in the target sequence are identified via a mapping library built of short unique subwords from the reference sequence. In the second step, alignments of the complete sequence read to the previously identified positions in the reference sequence are calculated. Results are ranked by their alignment score. We used the ‘deep’ seed search option allowing for point mutations during seed search. The overall alignment quality threshold was set to 92%, allowing for at most two point mutations. Uniquely and multiply matching reads meeting these thresholds were provided in BED and indexed BAM format.</p>

<title>SPINLONG patterns for identifying PolII activity regions</title>
<p>To estimate PolII activity start and end sites, we combined the time points 0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 min together into a “pseudo-sample” that contains the maximum of bin counts in these time points. This was done individually for each marker (PolII, H3K4me3 and H2A.Z). These pseudo-samples contain information from all time points but also simplify pattern formulation by including only one (pseudo-) sample for each marker, instead of five samples for individual time points.</p>
<p>All pseudo-samples were divided into three segments with classes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (low), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (high) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which correspond to the gene upstream, body and downstream, respectively. We thus obtained nine segments, denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (PolII), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (H3K4me3) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (H2A.Z), where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Based on the assumption that histone markers colocalize with PolII in promoters, histone upstream segments were synchronized with PolII using global constraints <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: that is, the leftmost segments in each sample must be identical in length for all valid solutions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Composite scoring was based on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but takes into account genes for which one or both histone markers are weakly present. The score function is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> taking only PolII into account, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> taking PolII and H3K4me3 into account, and similarly for other components.

<title>SPINLONG patterns for identifying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> responder genes</title>
<p>The assumption behind identifying genes whose activity levels are increased after a stimulus is that initially and without stimulation such a gene is transcribed with a low rate and thus there is little PolII activity across the gene. Similarly, we assume that genes whose activity is repressed after a stimulus initially show high PolII activity, which is decreased after a stimulus. For genes that are activated due to a stimulus, the PolII complex binds to the genomic regions at the transcription start site (TSS) of a responder gene. This is indicated by an increased number of reads in the 5′ end of the gene. These assumptions are used to form hypotheses used in SPINLONG.</p>
<p>Identification of estrogen responder genes is divided into identifying induced and repressed genes. For this analysis, PolII data were used at time points 0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 min; in addition, time points 160 and 640 min were used to compute a pseudo-sample (see below). The hypothesis for induced genes is that they show low signal (class <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in 0 time point and a progressively elongating high signal (class <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in later time points that represents a region of PolII binding. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> class segment at time point <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is expected to be approximately two times longer than at time point <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, since time intervals increase geometrically and PolII elongation is assumed to be constant. This is encoded as a global linear constraint in the pattern, with the relaxation that length at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be at least 1.5 longer than at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Patterns for induction are named <italic>inducedN</italic>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the time point at which the gene is fully occupied with PolII, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> class segment covers the gene. The pattern <italic>induced80</italic> captures long genes that are not completely transcribed at last time point. Repressed genes show similar behavior but with classes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e189" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> swapped; these patterns are named <italic>repressedN</italic>.</p>

Scoring is done using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e191" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Genomic regions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e192" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that are used as the search area are obtained from the predictions of PolII activity regions above, or from pre-defined Ensembl gene regions when the score in the activity prediction analysis is below 0.60. To allow the optimizer to further fine-tune the search area, these regions are extended by 25% in 5′ and 3′ directions and a pseudo-sample containing the maximum bin count of the time points 0, 10, 40, 160 and 640 min is included.</p>

<title>SPINLONG patterns for PolII propagation speed</title>
<p>Estimation of PolII propagation speed is done using the segment lengths obtained in the identification of estrogen responsive genes above.

<title>Survival analysis</title>
<p>Survival analyses were conducted with the Anduril framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Ovaska1">[32]</xref>. In all analyses, death from breast cancer was used as the event indicator. For the TCGA cohort <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-TheCancerGenomeAtlas1">[9]</xref>, patients having ER+, HER2− and either post-menopausal status or age <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were selected. In addition, 65 healthy tissue samples were used as controls. For each gene, patients were divided into groups having low, high or stable expression. This was done by computing fold changes for each tumor and comparing them to a threshold based on the distribution of the fold changes. That is, let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> expression values for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> tumors and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> controls for a specific gene. Then, a median of control samples <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e208" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was computed. Sample-specific fold changes are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e209" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and their standard deviation is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e210" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>In the Cox regression model for <italic>ATAD3B</italic> we used TNM tumor stage as a control variable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003100-Tavassoli1">[36]</xref>. TNM tumor stage is determined by the size of the tumor (T), lymph node involvement (N) and whether the cancer has metastasized (M). There are five stage categories from which 0 represents non-invasive cancer and IV means an invasive cancer that has metastasized to distant organs. For instance, a stage I tumor is an invasive cancer where the tumor is small (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003100.e213" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and which has not metastasized. Here we excluded stage 0 and combined subcategories for stage II (IIa and IIb) as well as for stage III (IIIa, IIIb and IIIc). In the Cox model, tumor stage is encoded as stage I = 1, II = 2, III = 3 and IV = 4.</p>

<p>PolII elongation speed lower bound estimates compared to gene lengths. The gene set includes induced and repressed estradiol early response genes. Genes are colored accoring to the time point by which the leading or lagging end reaches the 3′ end; 80 minute time point includes genes for which the transition remains incomplete. For gene length, transcribed region lengths are used when this estimate is available; otherwise, lengths obtained from Ensembl are used.</p>
