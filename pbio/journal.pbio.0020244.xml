			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Pharyngeal endoderm is essential for and can reprogram development of the head skeleton. Here we investigate the roles of specific endodermal structures in regulating craniofacial development. We have isolated an <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutant in zebrafish that has region-specific losses of facial cartilages derived from hyoid neural crest cells. In addition, the cranial muscles that normally attach to the affected cartilage region and their associated nerve are secondarily reduced in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> animals. Earlier in development, <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants also have specific defects in the formation of the first pouch, an outpocketing of the pharyngeal endoderm. By fate mapping, we show that the cartilage regions that are lost in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants develop from neural crest cells directly adjacent to the first pouch in wild-type animals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Integrinα5 functions in the endoderm to control pouch formation and cartilage development. Time-lapse recordings suggest that the first pouch promotes region-specific cartilage development by regulating the local compaction and survival of skeletogenic neural crest cells. Thus, our results reveal a hierarchy of tissue interactions, at the top of which is the first endodermal pouch, which locally coordinates the development of multiple tissues in a specific region of the vertebrate face. Lastly, we discuss the implications of a mosaic assembly of the facial skeleton for the evolution of ray-finned fish.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The skeletal elements that form and support the vertebrate jaw and gills are derived from a specialized population of ectomesenchyme cells, the cranial neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Platt1">Platt 1893</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Le1">Le Douarin 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Schilling1">Schilling and Kimmel 1994</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Weston1">Weston et al. 2004</xref>). In the larval zebrafish, crest cells of the first, or mandibular, arch give rise to Meckel's and palatoquadrate cartilages that constitute the lower and upper jaws, respectively. Several cartilages are derived from the second, or hyoid, arch, including the ceratohyal (CH) and hyosymplectic (HS) cartilages that support the jaw. In particular, the HS cartilage serves to connect the upper jaw to the skull by means of a hyomandibula (HM) plate and a symplectic (SY) anterior rod-like extension. In addition, the HM plate supports the overlying opercular apparatus that helps to ventilate the gills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Hughes1">Hughes and Shelton 1958</xref>). The tetrapod stapes is homologous to HM.</p>
      <p>During vertebrate development, cranial neural crest cells delaminate from near the dorsal neural primordium and migrate to ventrolateral positions where they populate a series of pharyngeal arches (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Le1">Le Douarin 1982</xref>). Once the pharyngeal arches are established, skeletal elements develop from cylinders of neural crest whose mesodermal cores undergo stereotypic divisions to form the cranial muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Edgeworth2">Edgeworth 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Schilling2">Schilling and Kimmel 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Kimmel2">Kimmel et al. 2001</xref>). The segmentally organized pharyngeal arches are separated from one another by reiterative outpocketings of the pharyngeal endoderm called pouches. Recent work in chicken has demonstrated an important role for endoderm in patterning cartilages of all the pharyngeal arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Couly1">Couly et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Ruhin1">Ruhin et al. 2003</xref>). Using grafting and ablation experiments, these researchers divided the pharyngeal endoderm into anterior-posterior (A-P) and mediolateral domains that are required for and have the ability to induce segment-specific pharyngeal cartilages. In zebrafish, experiments have demonstrated a genetic requirement for endoderm in pharyngeal cartilage development. <italic>casanova</italic> mutant embryos make no endoderm and pharyngeal cartilages fail to form, and transplantation experiments show that wild-type endoderm is sufficient to rescue cartilage development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Alexander1">Alexander et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-David1">David et al. 2002</xref>). In addition, a role for pharyngeal pouches in segmentation and survival of cranial neural crest has been shown. In zebrafish <italic>tbx1 (vgo)</italic> mutant embryos, most pouches fail to develop and posterior pharyngeal cartilages are reduced and fused together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Piotrowski1">Piotrowski and Nusslein-Volhard 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Piotrowski2">Piotrowski et al. 2003</xref>). However, though endoderm is clearly critical for pharyngeal cartilage development, it is not well understood how interactions between neural crest–derived cells and endoderm produce segment-specific patterns of cartilage.</p>
      <p>In this work, we isolate and characterize a zebrafish <italic>integrinα5</italic> loss-of-function mutant. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric receptors, composed of α and β subunits, that bind to ligands in the extracellular matrix such as fibronectin and laminin. Integrins have structural roles in adhesion that promote tissue integrity and cell migration, and signaling functions important for cell differentiation and survival (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Bokel1">Bokel and Brown 2002</xref>). Various studies in mouse and chick have shown a role for integrins and their ligands in neural crest migration. Integrins α4, α1, and αV are expressed early in neural crest development, and function-blocking antibodies against these integrins perturb crest migration in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Delannet1">Delannet et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Desban1">Desban and Duband 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Kil1">Kil et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Testaz1">Testaz and Duband 2001</xref>). The in vivo roles of specific integrins in neural crest development are less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Yang2">Yang et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Gardner1">Gardner et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Bader1">Bader et al. 1998</xref>). Mice lacking Integrinα5, which in complex with primarily β1 forms the major fibronectin receptor, die early during embryogenesis because of mesodermal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Yang1">Yang et al. 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Yang3">1999</xref>). Analysis of <italic>integrinα5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse embryos showed that Integrinα5 is required for the survival of a subset of hyoid crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Goh1">Goh et al. 1997</xref>). However, it was not known where Integrinα5 functions to control hyoid crest development.</p>
      <p>Here we report that, in zebrafish, Integrinα5 functions in the pharyngeal endoderm to control hyoid crest development. In <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos, the first pharyngeal pouch fails to develop, and the lack of a first pouch correlates with reductions in specific regions of the HS cartilage. <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants also have defects in a subset of dorsal first and second arch muscles and facial motor nerve VII, suggesting that Integrinα5 is required for region-specific development of multiple pharyngeal tissues. However, both expression and penetrance data suggest that the muscle and nerve defects are likely secondary to the cartilage and pouch defects. <italic>integrinα5</italic> is expressed in pharyngeal endoderm during pouch formation and is required in endoderm for both first pouch and hyoid cartilage development. In order to understand the remarkable specificity of the <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> cartilage phenotype, we fate mapped regions of the HS cartilage in the hyoid arch. We found that the regions of the HS cartilage that are lost in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants develop from anterior crest–derived cells immediately adjacent to the first pouch. Analysis of <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants suggests that the first endodermal pouch specifies a portion of the hyoid cartilage pattern by locally stabilizing hyoid crest. Lastly, we present a model in which new local interactions of endodermal structures with hyoid crest underlie the elaboration of the jaw support apparatus during the evolution of ray-finned fish.</p>

        <title>Isolation of a Mutation in Zebrafish <italic>integrinα5</italic></title>
        <p>In a genetic screen for zebrafish with altered pharyngeal cartilages, we isolated a single recessive mutant allele, <italic>b926,</italic> with specific defects in the hyoid cartilage pattern. Using polymorphism mapping, we placed <italic>b926</italic> on Linkage Group (LG) 23 between the markers Z5141 and Z20492, a region containing a zebrafish <italic>integrinα5</italic> homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). We performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to obtain a full-length cDNA encoding a protein product with 54% identity to mouse Integrinα5. Sequencing of <italic>integrinα5</italic> in <italic>b926</italic> revealed a T to A nucleotide substitution that segregated with the mutant phenotype. The <italic>b926</italic> mutation converts a conserved tyrosine residue to an asparagine in the third beta-propeller repeat of the extracellular domain, a region known to be important for ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g001">1</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Springer1">Springer 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Mould1">Mould et al. 2000</xref>). In addition, a morpholino designed against the exon13-intron splice site of <italic>integrinα5</italic> (<italic>integrinα5</italic>-MO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) phenocopies both the cartilage and first pouch defects of <italic>b926</italic>. We confirmed by RT-PCR that <italic>itga5</italic>-MO effectively inhibits the splicing of <italic>integrinα5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g001">1</xref>F).

            <title>Identification of a Zebrafish <italic>integrinα5</italic> Mutant</title>
            <p>(A) Based on the hyoid cartilage phenotype the <italic>b926</italic> allele was mapped to LG23. Using polymorphism mapping, we placed <italic>b926</italic> between the markers Z5141 (2/362 recombinants/meioses) and Z20494 (3/362 recombinants/meioses). Databases of the partial zebrafish genomic sequence revealed that a homolog of <italic>integrinα5</italic> mapped to this region.</p>
            <p>(B) Zebrafish Integrinα5 protein is predicted to have seven extracellular beta-propeller repeats (stippled), a transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular cytoplasmic tail. Integrinα5 forms heterodimeric complexes with Integrin β chains, primarily β1, and binds extracellular matrix ligands containing the RGD motif. Sequencing of <italic>integrinα</italic>5 in <italic>b926</italic> revealed a T to A nucleotide substitution at position 952 of the cDNA that converts a tyrosine to an asparagine at amino acid 218, a residue within the third beta-propeller repeat.</p>
            <p>(C) Alignment of the third beta-propeller repeat of the Integrinα5 proteins of zebrafish, human, mouse, <italic>Xenopus,</italic> and <italic>Fugu</italic>. Y218 is absolutely conserved among all five species and is mutated to N in <italic>b926</italic>.</p>
            <p>(D) The genomic locus of <italic>integrinα5</italic> consists of 30 exons (not drawn to scale). The <italic>integrinα</italic>5 morpholino, <italic>itga5</italic>-MO, was designed against the exon13-intron splice site (arrow).</p>
            <p>(E) The primers GC145 and GC147 were used to amplify a 497-bp fragment from wild-type cDNA. PCR amplification was then performed using cDNA from 24-hpf embryos that had been injected with 10 ng of <italic>itga5</italic>-MO at the one-cell stage, the same concentration of morpholino used for our phenotypic analysis. The resultant product was 587 bp long, and sequencing confirmed that the increased length was due to the failure to splice out the intron between exons 13 and 14. The left lane of the agarose gel contains standard size markers in basepairs.</p>
            <p>(F) A schematic of the wild-type Integrinα5 protein shows seven extracellular repeats and the transmembrane (TM) domain. Inhibition of splicing by <italic>itga5</italic>-MO would be predicted to result in a nonfunctional protein that is truncated in the seventh repeat of the extracellular domain.</p>

Meckel's (M) and palatoquadrate (PQ) cartilages are derived from the mandibular arch (1), and CH, SY, and HM cartilages and the opercle (Op) bone are derived from the hyoid arch (2). A phenotypic series (B–D) shows that the anterior half of HM (arrows) is absent and SY is progressively reduced in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> animals. Rarely, mandibular and hyoid joints are also missing in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> animals (asterisks in D).

        <p>In addition to cartilage defects, we found partially penetrant reductions of the first pharyngeal pouch, an endodermal outpocketing, in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">2</xref>J). Loss of the first pouch was apparent as early as 24 hours post fertilization (hpf), and similar first pouch reductions were seen in animals injected with <italic>itga5</italic>-MO (data not shown; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020244-t001">Table 1</xref>). Although the majority of <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos showed defects restricted to the first pouch, a few <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos had graded reductions of more posterior pouches as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>J; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020244-t001">Table 1</xref>). In order to examine whether the reduced first pouches in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos retained pouch identity, we examined expression of the pharyngeal pouch marker <italic>pea3,</italic> a downstream effector of Fgf signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Roehl1">Roehl and Nusslein-Volhard 2001</xref>). We found that the reduced first pouches of <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants still expressed <italic>pea3</italic> at 36 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>L).</p>
        <p>As both the pouch and cartilage phenotypes were incompletely penetrant in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, often with one side of an embryo showing defects and the other side not, we examined how tightly coupled the phenotypes were in individual sides. In order to visualize early pharyngeal arch structure in live animals, we made use of a <italic>fli1–</italic>green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Lawson1">Lawson and Weinstein 2002</xref>). <italic>fli1</italic>-GFP expression initiates in neural crest cells of the pharyngeal arches shortly after crest migration (ca. 18 hpf) and persists as pharyngeal cartilages and bones develop. Pouches are evident as nonexpressing regions between the GFP-labeled crest-derived cells of the arches. We sorted live <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> animals for first pouch defects at 36 hpf and then grew these animals to 4 d to analyze pharyngeal cartilages. Strikingly, we found a strong correlation between reductions of the first pouch and later hyoid cartilage defects in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants. <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> sides that lacked the first pouch early had hyoid cartilage defects 93% of the time (<italic>n =</italic> 116), whereas only 7% of <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> sides with a normal first pouch early developed hyoid cartilage defects (<italic>n =</italic> 108). The correlation was highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>
        <p>We next asked whether Integrinα5 was required for the development of cranial muscles. By 4 d of development, the mesoderm of the first pharyngeal arch has undergone stereotypic subdivisions to form, ventrally, intermandibularis anterior and intermandibularis posterior; medially, adductor mandibulae; and, dorsally, levator arcus palatini and dilatator operculi (do) cranial muscles. Second arch mesoderm gives rise to interhyal and hyohyal muscles, ventrally, and adductor hyomandibulae (ah), adductor operculi (ao), and levator operculi (lo) muscles, dorsally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Edgeworth2">Edgeworth 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Schilling2">Schilling et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>M). In a few <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, the dorsal first and second arch muscles, do and ah, were selectively reduced, whereas levator arcus palatini, ao, and lo were present but appeared closer together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>N; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020244-t001">Table 1</xref>). The muscles that were disrupted in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants correspond to those that associate most closely with the aHM cartilage (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>Q and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">2</xref>R).</p>
        <p>Lastly, we found that <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants had specific defects in the nerve that innervates second arch muscles. Facial motor neurons send a ventral-directed nerve (VII) that innervates dorsal second arch muscles ah and ao, passes through the foramen of HM, and subsequently branches to innervate ventral muscles interhyal and hyohyal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Higashijima1">Higashijima et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>O). In a small fraction of <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, facial nerve VII failed to branch and/or was hypotrophic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>P). Both nerve and muscle defects were only seen in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants that also displayed cartilage defects. Moreover, the lower penetrance of nerve and muscle defects suggests that they are secondary to endodermal and/or crest defects. In conclusion, we have found a requirement for Integrinα5 in the development of multiple pharyngeal tissues in the vicinity of the first pouch and aHM cartilage region.</p>

        <title><italic>integrinα5</italic> Is Expressed Dynamically in Pharyngeal Endoderm and Cranial Neural Crest</title>
        <p>In order to understand where Integrinα5 might be acting to control pharyngeal arch development, we examined the expression of <italic>integrinα5</italic> mRNA by in situ hybridization. The <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression domains were complex and dynamic, and we do not give an exhaustive description of domains other than the pharynx here. We observed <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression as early as the 32-cell stage, indicating a maternal <italic>integrinα5</italic> contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Maternal expression of <italic>integrinα5</italic> also has been reported in frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Whittaker1">Whittaker and DeSimone 1993</xref>). By gastrulation stage (60% epiboly), the mesendoderm broadly expressed <italic>integrinα5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). At the 1-somite (s) stage, <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression was in ectoderm adjacent to the anterior neural plate, a domain consistent with cranial neural crest and placode precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). In addition, we saw strong expression in the first somite and posterior mesoderm and weaker expression in scattered, large cells lateral and anterior to the notochord that we interpret as early endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Warga1">Warga and Nusslein-Volhard 1999</xref>). By 5-s stages, cranial neural crest and the otic placode expressed <italic>integrinα5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), and pharyngeal endoderm expression was seen ventrally along the surface of the yolk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). From 12-s to 18-s (18 hpf), pharyngeal endoderm continued to express <italic>integrinα5,</italic> and the ectodermal expression domain became more restricted to hyoid crest–derived tissue and the otic placode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">Figure 3</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">3</xref>G). Endoderm and ectoderm expression domains of <italic>integrinα5</italic> were apparent most clearly in 18 hpf cross-sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">Figure 3</xref>H–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">3</xref>J). In particular, we observed strong <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression throughout pharyngeal endoderm, including the first pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">Figure 3</xref>H). At later times, we saw dynamic <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression in both crest derivatives and pharyngeal endoderm. The six pharyngeal pouches form in an anterior to posterior wave of development. By 26 hpf, the fourth pouch, which was the most posterior pouch forming at this time (J.G.C. and C.B.K., unpublished data), expressed <italic>integrinα5,</italic> whereas <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression was no longer seen in the first pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">Figure 3</xref>K). At 38 hpf, the sixth pouch, the last to form, strongly expressed <italic>integrinα5,</italic> yet the fourth pouch was nonexpressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g003">Figure 3</xref>L). In addition, dynamic <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression was seen in patchy zones of pharyngeal crest. Finally, <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression was not affected by the <italic>b926</italic> mutation (examined at 12-s; data not shown). In conclusion, <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression in the pharyngeal endoderm is in a pattern that both spatially and temporally corresponds to regions of pouch formation, and expression of <italic>integrinα5</italic> in the crest begins during premigratory stages and later becomes refined to patches of crest derivatives within the pharyngeal arches.</p>

        <title>Integrinα5 Is Required in Endoderm but Not Crest for First Pouch and Hyoid Cartilage Development</title>
        <p>As <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression was observed in both pharyngeal endoderm and neural crest, we used transplantation experiments to determine in which tissues Integrinα5 was required for first pouch and hyoid cartilage development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Since it is difficult to transplant large amounts of endoderm from normal zebrafish embryos, we used forced expression of the activated Taram-A receptor (TAR*) to generate donor embryos consisting almost entirely of endoderm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-David1">David et al. [2002]</xref> for details). This method allows the specific and unilateral introduction of large amounts of endoderm into mutant hosts. Transplants were performed at 40% epiboly (late blastula; ca. 4 hpf), and the first pouch was scored at 38 hpf in live animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In wild-type to wild-type control transplants, 8% of recipient sides developed first pouch defects, suggesting a low level of toxicity of the TAR* construct. We then transplanted wild-type TAR* endoderm into <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup>; fli1</italic>-GFP hosts. Control mutant sides that did not receive donor endoderm had first pouch defects in 83% of cases. In contrast, first pouch defects were seen in only 17% of mutant sides that received wild-type donor endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">4</xref>D; summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>I). Thus, wild-type endoderm was able to rescue pouch formation in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants. Furthermore, this rescue was dependent on donor endoderm contributing to the first pouch.</p>

        <p>We next asked whether wild-type endoderm also was able to rescue hyoid cartilage defects in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos. In order to quantify the severity of hyoid defects in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, we devised a mutant cartilage index that ranged from zero for wild-type to four for the most severe hyoid defects (see legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In wild-type to wild-type control transplants, the mutant cartilage index was 0.46, consistent with TAR* causing a low level of defects on its own. The control nonrecipient sides of <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup>; fli1</italic>-GFP animals had an index of 2.5. In contrast, the index of mutant sides that received the TAR* endoderm transplant was rescued to 0.92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">4</xref>E; summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>J). Hence, wild-type endoderm can nonautonomously rescue hyoid cartilage development in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>We also tested whether Integrinα5 was required only in crest for first pouch and hyoid cartilage development. We modified the hindbrain transplantation technique described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Maves1">Maves et al.

In wild-type to wild-type controls, transplants resulted in donor cells constituting a large proportion of the crest cells within the pharyngeal arches and resultant cartilages. In contrast to wild-type endoderm rescue, introduction of substantial amounts of wild-type crest failed to rescue first pouch formation in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup>; fli1</italic>-GFP animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">4</xref>G; summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>I). Furthermore, transplanted wild-type crest did not improve the mutant cartilage index of <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup>; fli1</italic>-GFP animals (2.50 for recipient sides and 2.29 for nonrecipient sides) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">4</xref>H; summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>J).

        <title>Fate Map of Hyoid Cartilages</title>
        <p>Understanding the developmental basis for the specificity of the <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> cartilage phenotype requires a fate map of pharyngeal cartilages in wild-type animals. Here we focus on the origins of the SY, aHM, and pHM regions of HS, and a more complete mandibular and hyoid fate map will be published elsewhere. We used in vivo microelectroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Lyons1">Lyons et al. 2003</xref>) to label crest cells at 24 hpf and later monitor their cartilage fate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Representative examples of 24-hpf in vivo microelectroporations show cells that contributed to SY, aHM, or pHM regions at 4 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g005">Figure 5</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g005">5</xref>J). We plotted the origins of cells that contribute to each region along normalized A-P and dorsal-ventral (D-V) axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g005">Figure 5</xref>K). A comparison of mean distances along the A-P axis showed that cells that contributed to aHM and SY clustered on average 6–7 μm, or 1–2 cell diameters, from the first pouch (the anterior border of the arch). In contrast, cells contributing to pHM were on average 16 μm, or three cell diameters, away from the first pouch. A comparison of mean distances along the D-V axis showed that cells contributing to SY were more ventral than cells contributing to aHM and pHM. No statistically significant differences along the mediolateral axis were seen between cells contributing to different HS regions (data not shown; see legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We conclude that HS cartilage regions most sensitive to loss of Integrinα5 are those developing just beside the first pouch.</p>

            <p>(E-J) At 4 d, confocal micrographs (E–G) (schematized in [H–J]) show the resultant fate of labeled crest cells (red) in the hyoid cartilage regions (green). Examples shown include labeled hyoid cells that contributed exclusively to SY (B, E, and H), aHM (C, F, and I), and pHM (D, G, and J) cartilage regions.</p>

The first pouch and partial outline of the mandibular arch (1) are drawn for reference. One cell gave rise to an aHM/pHM (blue/green) mixed lineage, and another cell gave rise to pHM and unidentified cells (green/light blue). SY and aHM progenitors map to more anterior domains (i.e., closer to the first pouch) than do pHM progenitors (relative distances from anterior: SY, 0.12 ± 0.11; aHM, 0.17 ± 0.06; pHM 0.43 ± 0.05; statistically different using Tukey-Kramer HSD test). SY progenitors map to a more ventral domain than do aHM and pHM progenitors (relative distances from dorsal: SY, 0.68 ± 0.11; aHM, 0.33 ± 0.06; pHM 0.37 ± 0.05; statistically different using Tukey-Kramer HSD test). No significant differences along the mediolateral axis were seen between regions (relative distances from lateral: SY, 0.47 ± 0.12; aHM, 0.53 ± 0.07; pHM 0.43 ± 0.06).</p>

        <p>We also examined whether hyoid crest was correctly specified in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutant embryos. Hyoid crest expresses Hox class 2 genes, whereas mandibular crest is Hox nonexpressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Hunt1">Hunt et al. 1991</xref>). No defects were seen in the expression of <italic>hoxa2</italic> in the hyoid arches of <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants at 36 hpf (data not shown). In 36-hpf wild-type animals, <italic>goosecoid (gsc)</italic> expression marks dorsal and ventral domains within the hyoid arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g006">Figure 6</xref>F). In <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos, <italic>gsc</italic> domains were present, although in 12% of mutants they were variably disorganized. In the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g006">Figure 6</xref>G, the dorsal hyoid <italic>gsc</italic> domain was disorganized and fused to the ventral hyoid <italic>gsc</italic> domain. However, as the <italic>gsc</italic> defects were of significantly lower penetrance than the cartilage defects, we conclude that the majority of specific cartilage defects seen in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos are not due to altered <italic>gsc</italic> expression.</p>

        <title>A Subset of Hyoid Crest Shows Aberrant Behavior and Does Not Contribute to Cartilage in <italic>integrinα5</italic> Mutants</title>

In another focal plane, aHM was observed to form from a tightly packed mass of <italic>fli1</italic>-GFP-labeled cells located directly adjacent to the first pouch in the dorsal, anterior portion of the hyoid arch at 38 hpf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv002">Video S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g007">Figure 7</xref>G–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g007">7</xref>L). We found that crest cells that contributed to aHM remained fairly static during the period of observation, though local rearrangements that contribute to the flattening of the HM plate were not analyzed in detail here (enlarged in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g007">Figure 7</xref>G′–7L′). The pHM region formed from cells located posterior to the aHM mass at 38 hpf. In general, our time-lapse recordings of wild-type hyoid development supported and extended the conclusions generated from the 24-hpf fate map. In the hyoid arch, crest cells that will contribute to the aHM and SY regions are tightly packed masses directly adjacent to the first pouch prior to chondrogenesis.</p>

At the beginning of the recordings (A, G, and M), the mandibular (1) and hyoid (2) arches are numbered and an arrow denotes the first pouch (p1).

The outline of the HS cartilage, a composite of SY and HM regions, is shown in (F) and (L).

In <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, the first pouch is missing (white arrow in [M]), and anterior hyoid crest cells are disorganized at 38 hpf (e.g., arrowhead in [M′]). Over time, anterior hyoid crest cells migrate out of the region and do not contribute to cartilage (e.g., arrowheads in [N′–Q′]). In contrast, the pHM region and the opercle bone develop normally from more posterior hyoid crest in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> animals (R). Scale bar: 50 μm.</p>

        <p>In this work, we isolated and characterized a zebrafish mutant allele <italic>(b926)</italic> that has variably penetrant and expressive reductions of the first pouch and hyoid aHM and SY cartilage regions. By positional mapping, allele segregation, and morpholino phenocopy, we identified the genetic basis of the lesion as a missense mutation in the ligand-binding domain of Integrinα5. As similar pharyngeal phenotypes were observed in mutant and morpholino-treated animals, we conclude that <italic>b926</italic> is a loss-of-function allele of <italic>integrinα5</italic>. However, we do not know if Integrinα5 activity is completely eliminated in <italic>b926</italic>. In addition, we observed strong maternal expression of <italic>integrinα5</italic> that could mitigate the zygotic loss of <italic>integrinα5</italic> in <italic>b926.</italic> Thus, the variable penetrance and expressivity of the <italic>integrinα5</italic> phenotype could be due to partial activity of mutant Integrinα5 or the presence of maternally supplied Integrinα5. Additionally, other integrins may act redundantly with Integrinα5 in pharyngeal development. A survey of nearly finished genome sequence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/</ext-link>) has uncovered at least 15 additional Integrin α chains, for which no expression or phenotypic data are known in zebrafish. Lastly, <italic>integrinα5</italic> is expressed strongly in many tissues, such as the otic placode, for which no overt phenotypes were observed in <italic>b926</italic>. Future studies, in particular those using animals in which both maternal and zygotic <italic>integrinα5</italic> have been eliminated, may reveal new functions of Integrinα5 in zebrafish development.</p>

        <title>The First Pouch Is Required for the Development of a Subset of Hyoid Cartilage</title>
        <p>Our results point to an important role for the first pouch in the development of specific hyoid cartilage regions. We have used the incomplete penetrance of the pouch and cartilage phenotypes of <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> animals to show that early first pouch defects are strongly predictive of later hyoid cartilage defects. Furthermore, transplantation experiments show that wild-type endoderm, but not crest, rescues first pouch and hyoid cartilage development in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants. We infer that Integrinα5 functions in the pharyngeal endoderm for the formation of the first pouch, and that the first pouch, in turn, interacts with postmigratory neural crest to promote cartilage development in a region of the hyoid arch. A role for the first endodermal pouch in promoting regional hyoid cartilage development is consistent with work in chicken showing that domains of pharyngeal endoderm specify region-specific cartilage shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Couly1">Couly et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Ruhin1">Ruhin et al. 2003</xref>). Our data extend these findings, arguing that the formation of the first pouch is a critical step in allowing pharyngeal endoderm to interact with hyoid crest and promote the development of specific cartilage regions, aHM and SY. It will be interesting to see the extent to which the ability of different pharyngeal endoderm domains to induce cartilage elements of specific shapes depends on their ability to form discrete morphological structures such as the first pouch.</p>
        <p>How might the first pouch control development of specific cartilage regions within the hyoid arch? The first pouch forms at a time when hyoid crest cells are migrating to ventrolateral positions to form the hyoid arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Veitch1">Veitch et al. 1999</xref>; J.G.C. and C.B.K., unpublished data). Upon reaching the developing arch, crest cells become less motile and form tightly packed masses adjacent to the first pouch. Our wild-type fate map shows that the hyoid cartilage regions that are lost in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, aHM and SY, develop from crest cells immediately adjacent to the first pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Our time-lapse recordings of wild-type cartilage development show that crest cells that will form aHM remain a tightly packed mass as the aHM region chondrifies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">8</xref>C). In contrast, in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, dorsal anterior hyoid crest cells are aberrantly motile and do not contribute to cartilage, whereas more posterior dorsal hyoid crest cells contribute normally to pHM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">8</xref>F). In addition, we observe increased apoptosis in the dorsal, anterior domain of <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> hyoid arches from 25 to 35 hpf. Importantly, increased death of postmigratory hyoid crest cells was seen only when the first pouch was reduced. It will be interesting to examine whether the increased apoptosis observed in the dorsal anterior hyoid arches of <italic>integrinα5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Goh1">Goh et al. 1997</xref>) is a secondary consequence of a missing first pouch as well. In contrast to <italic>integrinα5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, in which an increase in cell death was seen earlier during crest migration, we found no evidence for increased death of migratory crest in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> zebrafish. However, our analysis cannot rule out that increased crest death during migratory stages may contribute to the infrequent, most severe cartilage phenotypes seen in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos. Indeed, given the strong expression of <italic>integrinα5</italic> in migratory hyoid crest, future studies that further reduce Integrinα5 activity, for example by removing its maternal component, may uncover crest-autonomous functions of zebrafish Integrinα5 in the survival and/or migration of hyoid crest cells.</p>

            <title>Model for Development and Evolution of Hyoid Cartilage</title>
            <p>(A–F) Models of hyoid development in wild-type (A–C) and <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> (D–F) animals show the structure of hyoid arches at 24 hpf (A and D) and 38 hpf (B and E) and mandibular and hyoid cartilages at 4 d (C and F).</p>
            <p>(A) At 24 hpf of wild-type development, crest that will form aHM (dark green), pHM (medium green), and SY (light green) cartilage regions occupy distinct domains within the hyoid arch. Signals (red arrows) from the first pouch (orange) stabilize adjacent aHM- and SY-producing crest.</p>
            <p>(B) At 38 hpf of wild-type development, aHM- and SY-producing crest tightly pack along the first pouch. Cranial mesoderm (red) and some mandibular crest (blue) are also shown.</p>
            <p>(C) At 4 d of wild-type development, the HS cartilage is a composite of aHM, pHM, and SY regions. Also shown are the hyoid CH (yellow) and mandibular Meckel's (light blue) and palatoquadrate (dark blue) cartilages.</p>
            <p>(D) In <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> animals, the first pouch is missing or very reduced at 24 hpf.</p>
            <p>(E) By 38 hpf, as a consequence of the lack of a first pouch, aHM and SY progenitors are disorganized and undergo gradual apoptosis. In contrast, the development of pHM progenitor cells does not require the first pouch.</p>
            <p>(F) At 4 d, aHM and SY cartilage regions are selectively reduced in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> animals.</p>
            <p>(G–I) The HS element has undergone extensive change during vertebrate evolution. In the illustrations (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-De1">De Beer [1937]</xref>), the neurocranium is grey or outlined in black and mandibular and hyoid cartilages are color-coded as described above. Based on relations to morphological landmarks and data presented here on the tripartite mosaic development of HS, an evolutionary scheme is proposed.</p>
            <p>(G) In the dogfish shark <italic>Scyliorhinus canicula,</italic> a single rod-shaped element corresponds to pro-aHM/SY regions.</p>
            <p>(H) In the basal actinopterygian <italic>Polypterus senegalus,</italic> separate aHM and SY regions are present.</p>
            <p>(I) As shown for salmon, during actinopterygian evolution a new region, pHM, develops posterior to and fuses with aHM to create a wide HM plate that articulates with the neurocranium and supports an enlarged, overlying opercular apparatus (not shown).</p>

        <p>Our data show that the first pouch is required for the stabilization and survival of crest cells that will become aHM and SY. Interactions between the first pouch and adjacent hyoid crest could involve direct adhesion and/or diffusible signaling molecules. aHM and SY cartilage regions develop from crest-derived cells immediately adjacent to the first pouch at 24 hpf, whereas the pHM region develops from crest three cell diameters away. The remarkable specificity of the <italic>integrinα5</italic> cartilage phenotype suggests that pouch-derived signals act very locally, perhaps through cell–cell contract, to promote development of aHM and SY regions. In support of this, explant studies in the newt show that physical contact between pharyngeal endoderm and neural crest cells is necessary to promote the compaction and differentiation of crest into cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Epperlein1">Epperlein and Lehmann 1975</xref>). On the other hand, a signaling role for pharyngeal endoderm in crest survival also has been shown. In zebrafish, Fgf3 produced from the pharyngeal pouches acts as a secreted survival factor for neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-David1">David et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Nissen1">Nissen et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition to promoting stabilization and survival, might endoderm also control local gene expression in hyoid crest? In a small fraction of <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos, <italic>gsc</italic> expression domains in the hyoid arches were present but disorganized. However, it is possible that the aberrant <italic>gsc</italic> expression reflects a disorganization of the hyoid arch and not ectopic gene expression. Although disorganized <italic>gsc</italic> expression may correlate with more severe <italic>integrinα5</italic> phenotypes such as hyoid cartilage fusions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), the significantly lower penetrance of <italic>gsc</italic> phenotypes compared to cartilage phenotypes implies that disorganized <italic>gsc</italic> expression is not the major cause of the specific cartilage defects. In addition, <italic>hoxA2</italic> expression was unaffected in the hyoid arches of <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos. Thus, although additional markers of hyoid crest need to be examined in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos, we have found no strong evidence for the first pouch controlling gene expression in neighboring crest. Instead, our data argue that the first pouch locally controls cartilage development by promoting the compaction and survival of immediately adjacent crest-derived cells.</p>

        <title>Integrin-Mediated Outgrowth of the First Pharyngeal Pouch</title>
        <p>We have shown that zebrafish <italic>integrinα5</italic> is expressed in pharyngeal endoderm during pouch formation and is required in the endoderm for development of the first pouch. The specificity for the first pouch of the <italic>integrinα5</italic> phenotype could be due to either redundancy with other integrins that function preferentially in posterior pouches or greater sensitivity of the first pouch to loss of integrin function. Although the most common phenotype in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants is loss of just the first pouch, we do occasionally see reductions of more posterior pouches as well, suggesting that Integrinα5 functions in the formation of most or all pouches. Moreover, as the more posterior pouches are required to segment the posterior crest mass into the five branchial arches from which the CB cartilages develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Piotrowski1">Piotrowski and Nusslein-Volhard 2000</xref>), the variable loss of these pouches likely explains the reductions and rare fusions of CB cartilages seen in some <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> animals.</p>
        <p>How might Integrinα5 control pouch formation? The elaboration of a relatively uniform tissue into an organ of more complex curvature and ramifications, termed branching morphogenesis, is a common developmental program in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The formation of an iterative series of outpocketings, or pouches, from the pharyngeal endoderm can be thought of as analogous to branching morphogenesis. Integrins have well-documented roles in cell migration that could promote the outgrowth of branches (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Bokel1">Bokel and Brown 2002</xref>). From our unpublished observations in zebrafish, we know that pouches form by the directed lateral migration of pharyngeal endodermal cells (unpublished data). In this work, we find that <italic>integrinα5</italic> is expressed transiently in pouch-forming regions of pharyngeal endoderm and is required in endoderm for pouch formation. One possibility is that Integrinα5 adhesion promotes the lateral migration of endodermal cells to form pouches. Alternatively, Integrinα5 may be required for the specification or survival of pharyngeal endoderm that forms pouches. Future time-lapse imaging studies, in which pharyngeal endoderm morphogenesis is analyzed directly in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> embryos, will help to clarify the role of Integrinα5 in pouch formation.</p>

        <title>A Hierarchy of Tissue Interactions Control Regional Development in the Pharyngeal Arches</title>
        <p>The exquisite functionality of the vertebrate jaw and pharynx requires the precise developmental coordination of their component parts. Arch-specific patterns of muscle connect with pharyngeal skeletal elements and are innervated by motor neurons of appropriate axial levels to orchestrate behaviors such as feeding and gill pumping. In <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, we see specific defects not only in the endodermal pouches and crest-derived cartilages, but also in cranial muscles and their associated motor nerves (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>R). Both a dorsal mandibular (do) and a dorsal hyoid (ah) muscle are reduced in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, and facial nerve VII, which innervates ah and other hyoid muscles, is reduced and/or fails to make a characteristic branch into two main fascicles. However, it is likely that muscle and nerve defects in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants are secondary to pouch and cartilage defects. Whereas <italic>integrinα5</italic> is expressed in endoderm and crest during pharyngeal morphogenesis, we were unable to detect <italic>integrinα5</italic> expression in cranial mesoderm or hindbrain neurons during axon outgrowth. In addition, muscle and nerve defects in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants were of significantly lower penetrance than the first pouch and hyoid cartilage defects. The low penetrance of the muscle and nerve defects might be explained by the variably expressive loss, in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, of the pouch- and/or crest-derived signals on which muscle and nerve development depend. Unfortunately, due to the low penetrance of both muscle and nerve defects in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, we were unable to directly test the tissue autonomy of these defects.</p>
        <p>Our analysis of the <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutant does not distinguish between roles for endoderm and crest in patterning cranial muscle and nerves. The mesodermal cores that give rise to do and ah, the muscles affected in <italic>integrinα5<sup>−</sup></italic> animals, lie close to and on opposite sides of the first pouch during pharyngeal arch development. The first endodermal pouch could have an early organizing role for cranial mesoderm. However, increasing evidence suggests that crest has a major role in patterning cranial mesoderm. Analysis of the <italic>chinless</italic> mutation in zebrafish has shown that <italic>chinless</italic> functions nonautonomously within the crest to promote muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Schilling3">Schilling et al. 1996</xref>). In classic experiments in chicken, grafting of mandibular crest into more posterior arches can reprogram both skeletal and muscular fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Noden1">Noden 1983</xref>), though recent work suggests this effect is mediated by an isthmus-organizing activity included in the grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Trainor1">Trainor et al. 2002</xref>). In the larval zebrafish, do and ah are found in close association with the aHM region that is lost in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants. It is possible that loss of dorsal anterior hyoid crest in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants results in reductions not only of the aHM cartilage region but also of crest-derived signals that support development of do and ah muscles. As has been proposed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Noden1">Noden 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Kontges1">Kontges and Lumsden 1996</xref>), the development of cranial muscles may depend less on their arch origin and more on the crest-derived structures, such as the aHM cartilage region and associated connective tissue, onto which they attach. Likewise, the reduction of facial nerve VII in <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants could be due to either reductions in hyoid muscles and their associated survival signals or reductions in nerve outgrowth–promoting cues normally produced by the crest and/or endoderm. In conclusion, we see evidence for a local hierarchy of interactions that control the development of a specific region of the head encompassing dorsal hyoid and mandibular elements. At the top of the hierarchy is the endoderm-derived first pouch that promotes the development of a subset of hyoid crest into cartilage; in turn, this subset of hyoid crest may control development of neighboring muscles and, directly or indirectly, their associated nerve.</p>

        <title>Mosaic Assembly of Hyoid Cartilage: Implications for Evolution</title>
        <p>The shape of the dorsal hyoid cartilage element has undergone extensive modification during actinopterygian evolution. In sharks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>G) and basal ray-finned fishes such as the bichir, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Polypterus senegalus</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>H), HM is a rod and SY is absent or not well elongated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-De1">De Beer 1937</xref>). In teleosts, highly derived ray-finned fish, the dorsal hyoid cartilage consists of a wider HM plate and a long SY extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>I). The elaboration of HM and SY regions before teleosts emerged may have served to more efficiently support the jaw and increase gill pumping. The origin of the HM plate has long been a subject of debate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Allis1">Allis (1915)</xref> proposed that the teleost HM plate consists of two regions that become fused together, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Edgeworth1">Edgeworth (1926)</xref>, based on his staging series of the bowfin <italic>Amia,</italic> a relative of teleosts, concluded that the HM plate develops from a single anterior region that undergoes posterior growth to form a plate. There is ample precedence for differential growth as a mechanism of morphological change. For example, beautiful interspecies mosaic experiments have shown that the difference in beak length between ducks and quails is due to an autonomous growth potential of mandibular crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Schneider1">Schneider and Helms 2003</xref>). However, our data support the composite two-region HM theory of Allis. We see a clear genetic dissociation between the development of aHM and pHM. Whereas aHM is absent in the majority of <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants, pHM and the connecting opercle bone are still present even in the most severe class of <italic>integrinα5</italic> mutants. In addition, our fate mapping data show that, although aHM and pHM form a seamless HM plate in the larva, their progenitor cells occupy distinct, albeit contiguous, domains within the hyoid arch at 24 hpf, a result inconsistent with the posterior growth hypothesis of Edgeworth. Thus, aHM and pHM regions develop from spatially distinct domains of crest that depend on different sources of inductive signals.</p>
        <p>Our data show that the first endodermal pouch is required for the development of aHM, yet in mutants that lack all pharyngeal endoderm, such as <italic>casanova,</italic> both aHM and pHM are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-David1">David et al. 2002</xref>). Thus, other structures of the pharyngeal endoderm besides the first pouch may be required for the development of pHM. One attractive possibility is that, whereas the first pouch induces aHM in the anterior part of the hyoid arch, the second pouch induces pHM in the posterior part of the arch. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Allis1">Allis (1915)</xref> concluded, based on relationships to morphological landmarks, that the rod-shaped HM cartilage in <italic>Polypterus</italic> represents the anterior portion of the teleost HM plate (i.e., aHM). Although more embryological studies of <italic>Polypterus</italic> need to be done, the evolution of the HM plate in ray-finned fishes such as teleosts appears to have involved a new induction event that led to a new region, pHM, being added to an older region, aHM. We propose that the de novo addition of regions to the skeletal pattern represents another mechanism, in addition to differential growth, of generating skeletal diversity during evolution.</p>

          <title>Wild-Type Development of SY Cartilage</title>
          <p>Confocal time-lapse recording shows hyoid cartilage development in a wild-type <italic>fli1</italic>-GFP animal from 38 hpf to 86 hpf. At the beginning of the video, the mandibular (1) and hyoid (2) arches are numbered and an arrow denotes the normal position of the first pouch. At the end of the video (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g007">Figure 7</xref> for representative still images), the SY cartilage is pseudocolored blue. A red arrowhead denotes a cluster of cells adjacent to the first pouch that undergo cellular rearrangements and form the long anterior SY extension in wild-type animals.</p>

          <p>Confocal time-lapse recording shows hyoid cartilage development in a wild-type <italic>fli1-</italic>GFP animal from 38 hpf to 86 hpf. This video is a different depth of the same time-lapse recording as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>. At the beginning of the video, the mandibular (1) and hyoid (2) arches are numbered and an arrow denotes the normal position of the first pouch. At the end of the video (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g007">Figure 7</xref> for representative still images), the HM cartilage is pseudocolored blue, and the ao/lo muscle quadrant and opercle bone are pseudocolored red and purple, respectively, for reference. A red arrowhead points to hyoid crest–derived cells immediately adjacent to the first pouch that give rise to the aHM cartilage region in wild-type animals.</p>
