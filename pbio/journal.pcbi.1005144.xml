<abstract>
<p>The recruitment of RNA-Pol-II to the transcription start site (TSS) is an important step in gene regulation in all organisms. Core promoter elements (CPE) are conserved sequence motifs that guide Pol-II to the TSS by interacting with specific transcription factors (TFs). However, only a minority of animal promoters contains CPEs. It is still unknown how Pol-II selects the TSS in their absence. Here we present a comparative analysis of promoters’ sequence composition and chromatin architecture in five eukaryotic model organisms, which shows the presence of common and unique DNA-encoded features used to organize chromatin. Analysis of Pol-II initiation patterns uncovers that, in the absence of certain CPEs, there is a strong correlation between the spread of initiation and the intensity of the 10 bp periodic signal in the nearest downstream nucleosome. Moreover, promoters’ primary and secondary initiation sites show a characteristic 10 bp periodicity in the absence of CPEs. We also show that DNA natural variants in the region immediately downstream the TSS are able to affect both the nucleosome-DNA affinity and Pol-II initiation pattern. These findings support the notion that, in addition to CPEs mediated selection, sequence–induced nucleosome positioning could be a common and conserved mechanism of TSS selection in animals.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Gene transcription is a complex process that starts with the recruitment and positioning of Pol-II enzyme at the transcription start site (TSS). Specific promoter sequences, known as core promoter elements (CPEs) facilitate this process. Surprisingly, only a fraction of promoters contain them. It is still unknown how Pol-II choses the start site in their absence. A recently proposed alternative mechanism implicates positioned nucleosomes in the TSS selection. Here, we provide new evidence of the existence of such mechanism with a comparative analysis of promoter’s features across the animal kingdom. We analysed the promoter’s DNA sequence composition in 5 organisms and found conserved and unique consensus sequences used to organize chromatin in the region of the first nucleosome downstream the TSS (N+1). Moreover, we found that all organisms show a strong correlation between the spread of Pol-II initiation and the strength of the DNA-encoded signal in the N+1 region. A detailed analysis of Pol-II initiation sites reveals also the presence of a 10 bp periodicity that is correlated with the intensity of the DNA signal in the N+1 region. Importantly, we report that genetic variants that alter the DNA-nucleosome affinity in that region alter Pol-II initiation spread as well.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An essential step in gene regulation is the recruitment of RNA-Pol-II (Pol-II) to the transcription start sites (TSS) at gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref003">3</xref>]. This is often facilitated by the presence of conserved sequence motifs known as core promoter elements (CPEs), which are found at a fixed or nearly fixed distance from the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref005">5</xref>]. Among them, the TATA-box, located 25–30 base-pairs (bp) upstream of the TSS, and the Initiator (Inr), located at the TSS, are the best known and most widely conserved CPEs among species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref007">7</xref>]. The TATA-box is bound by general transcription factors (TFs) that guide and anchor Pol-II to the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref008">8</xref>]. As a consequence, promoters with a TATA-box are generally characterized by a focused, almost to the single base, start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>In spite of the CPE’s demonstrated capability to select a TSS with high precision, only a minority of promoters have a CPE (in human 10% a TATA-box, 30% an Inr motif) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref011">11</xref>]. A central question in gene expression is how Pol-II selects the TSS in their absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref013">13</xref>]. It has been shown that nucleosomes in promoter regions can regulate gene expression via TF binding site occlusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref014">14</xref>] but their role in TSS selection by Pol-II remains unclear. Promoters have a remarkably conserved chromatin architecture consisting of a nucleosome free region that spans 100–150 bp upstream the TSS followed by a well-positioned nucleosome (+1 nucleosome) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref016">16</xref>]. This general conformation can be altered by diverse factors. Contrary to intuition, so called broad promoters with dispersed initiation sites have the most focused and regular nucleosome architecture whereas narrow promoters (also referred as peak promoters) have less organized nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref017">17</xref>] and an atypical chromatin architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref018">18</xref>]. In zebra fish, the chromatin architecture of the same promoter has been shown to change from one developmental stage to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref019">19</xref>] but there again, the conformation with the more structured nucleosome architecture shows a broader initiation site pattern. In mammals, promoters have traditionally been classified according to the presence or absence of CpG islands (CGI), 500–1000 bp long regions enriched in C+G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref022">22</xref>]. CGI-promoters are often TATA-box depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref023">23</xref>], have broad TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref009">9</xref>], exhibit characteristic histone marks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref024">24</xref>] and have a precisely positioned +1 nucleosome which is present even when the promoter is not transcribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref025">25</xref>]. In essence, CGI-promoters resemble the broad promoters described in other species and thus may not be considered a separate class.</p>
<p>An open question in gene regulation is whether the chromatin at promoters is organized by sequence-intrinsic features or indirectly by the transcription machinery occupying the nucleosome-free region and thereby forcing the nucleosome to bind to the nearest free space downstream the TSS. On a genome level, two types of sequence features have been reported to participate in nucleosome positioning: dinucleotide periodicity and base composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref026">26</xref>]. A theoretical model suggests that the same dinucleotide repeated at 10 bp intervals leads to intrinsic curvature that favors the wrapping of the DNA around the histone octamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref027">27</xref>]. This model theorizes that the periodic dinucleotide always occurs with the same orientation relative to the histone-octamer surface, for instance having the major groove facing outwards, and implies a rotational positioning of the nucleosome. Some authors have identified WW (W for A or T) and SS (S for C or G) dinucleotides in counter-phase as major contributors of rotational positioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref029">29</xref>], others emphasized the importance of RR (R for A or G) and YY (Y for C or T) motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref027">27</xref>]. DNA base composition can also affect nucleosome positioning. Highly AT-rich sequences, in particular poly(dA:dT) tracts, strongly disfavor nucleosome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref031">31</xref>], whereas G+C rich sequence tend to have high nucleosome occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref033">33</xref>]. Unlike dinucleotide periodicity, sequence composition can position nucleosomes in a narrow DNA region without specific preference for rotational setting, a condition termed translational positioning.</p>
<p>As said before, the role of sequence-intrinsic features in chromatin organization around promoters remains a matter of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref034">34</xref>]. Zhang and colleagues concluded that its positioning is the result of Pol-II binding to the DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref035">35</xref>]. Recent studies done in yeast have shown that chromatin remodelers play an important role in organizing chromatin both at a genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref036">36</xref>] and promoter level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref037">37</xref>] and that they act synergistically with DNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref038">38</xref>]. Others have reported the presence of nucleosome-favoring and disfavoring sequences in yeast promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref041">41</xref>], with a high correlation between <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> nucleosome organization in these regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref043">43</xref>]. Recently, a 10 bp periodic signal has been observed in cumulative WW frequency plots of promoters sequences aligned with respect to the major TSS as defined by CAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref044">44</xref>]. A similar WW periodicity can be seen in WW heat map plots published in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref019">19</xref>]. The phasing of WW periodicity with the TSS is the first indication that the rotational setting of the DNA in the +1 nucleosome is guiding the TSS selection process.</p>
<p>In this paper, we investigate the molecular mechanisms of TSS selection by jointly analyzing experimentally determined chromatin architectures, DNA-encoded nucleosome signals, Pol-II initiation site patterns and natural genetic variation in promoters stratified by the presence or absence of specific CPEs and/or the breadth of the initiation patterns. The analysis on five model organisms (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) confirms that different species have an overall similar chromatin organization with nevertheless some noteworthy species-specific differences. All five organisms have sequence-intrinsic nucleosome-positioning signals that are predictive of <italic>in-vivo</italic> nucleosome organization, but only in promoters that lack TATA-boxes. Additionally, we show that broad promoters associated with strong sequence-encoded nucleosome +1 have 10 bp periodic initiation patterns. By analyzing the effects of genetic variants on promoter initiation site patterns and dinucleotide periodicity, we provide genetic evidence that rotational nucleosome positioning is mechanistically involved in TSS selection.</p>

This was reflected in the chromatin organisation with a clear nucleosome free region (NFR) and a focused N+1. As expected, this group of promoters was also depleted of TATA-box and enriched in CpG islands. Approximately 25% of promoters showed an opposite signal, with a peak upstream the TSS and a valley downstream (promoters at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). They were characterized with a less pronounced NFR, a broader N+1, an enrichment in TATA-box and depletion in CpG islands, in agreement with earlier studies. CpG-enriched promoters were previously reported to have an open chromatin conformation and to be enriched in active histone marks. On the other end, CpG-depleted promoters were reported to have a close chromatin conformation and low levels of histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref046">46</xref>].</p>

<title>Dinucleotide periodicities have an additive effect on chromatin organisation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g001">Fig 1A</xref> shows that a large fraction of human promoters had a WW signal that, although depleted in the NFR, did not show a clear enrichment in the N+1 region. These promoters might have had other dinucleotide signals that peaked in this region allowing for a correct nucleosome positioning. To test this hypothesis, we identified promoters with periodic signal intensity (for each dinucleotide) in the proximal promoter region that could favour the average <italic>in-vivo</italic> nucleosome distribution. To do so, we compared the average 10 bp periodic signal in the NFR with that of the N+1 region and identified promoters with a higher signal downstream of the TSS (named hereafter as concordant signal). The organisms had heterogeneous number of promoters with concordant signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> promoters were characterised for having the YY and RR dinucleotides as the most common and, at the same time, the WW signal was less frequent. This could have been the consequence of the presence of CpG islands that, with their high GC content, could affect the dinucleotide frequencies and the possibility to generate a periodic signal. WW signal was more frequent in all other organisms but only in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>rerio</italic> it was the most frequent. In fact, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> showed that more then 40% of promoters had a concordant SS signal, whereas <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> promoters were enriched in YY signal but strongly depleted of SS signal. Nonetheless, in all organisms 80% of promoters had at least 1 concordant signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and 20% 3 or more. The presence of multiple concordant signals in the proximal promoter region was clearly reflected in chromatin organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) with more focused nucleosomes even outside the proximal-promoter area used in this analysis.</p>

<title>Consensus sequences for promoters’ nucleosomes are not always similar to genomic nucleosomes</title>
<p>Our analyses showed that more then one dinucleotide periodic signal was often present in the N+1 region of a promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, it was not clear how the dinucleotides were positioned compared to each other within the same sequence.

Trifonov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref047">47</xref>] concluded that the general DNA consensus sequence for genomic nucleosomes could be summarized with the following 2 motifs, SSRRNWWNYY or SSYYNWWNRR (note the relative position of the YY and RR in the two motifs), but little is known about the relative position of the 4 dinucleotides in the N+1 region. We addressed this using aggregate plots as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref044">44</xref>] where patterns of WW frequency were revealed in the N+1 region of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> promoters that were remarkably similar to the dinucleotide periodicities seen in MNase-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref028">28</xref>]. Using this observation, we evaluated and compared the periodic frequencies of DNA consensus sequences of the N+1 and genomic nucleosomes. To do so, promoters of the 5 organisms under study were aligned to the TSS and, using aggregated plots, the strength of a 10 bp periodic signal was evaluated in the N+1 region of all possible motifs of length 10 bp generated permuting the 4 dinucleotides and two N bases (240 motifs). A similar analysis was performed on genomic nucleosomes defined by high-resolution MNase data and aligned to the inferred center position. In <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) there was a very high correlation between the 10 bp frequency strengths measured in DNA sequences coming from genomic nucleosomes and signal from the DNA sequences of the N+1 region with a clear separation between motifs with high signal and all the rest. Confirming the expectations from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref047">47</xref>], motifs with strong periodicity were all characterized for having the WW dinucleotide in counter phase to the SS as well as the YY and RR and to share the same dinucleotide order: the SS dinucleotide was always followed by YY, then by WW and RR. The average intensities of this motif class around <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> promoters showed a pattern that closely resembled <italic>in-vivo</italic> nucleosome maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s006">S5 Fig</xref>) with signal depletion in correspondence of the NFR and a peak at the N+1.

<title>Dinucleotide periodicities in promoters correlate with Pol-II initiation patterns</title>
<p>The finding that promoters with a broad initiation pattern have phased dinucleotide periodicities in the N+1 region compared to focused promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref044">44</xref>] that, on the other end, are enriched in TATA-box motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref017">17</xref>] suggests that TATA-box and chromatin conformation could have different effects on transcription initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref013">13</xref>]. The TATA-box can direct Pol-II to the TSS with high precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref001">1</xref>] whereas in its absence, chromatin organization could guide the Pol-II complex but less precisely. To analyze the quantitative effect of rotational properties of DNA on Pol-II positioning, the correlation between the strength of the dinucleotide signals in the N+1 region and the spread of Pol-II initiation were studied in grater detail. To do so, promoters were first grouped according to their TATA-box state (with and without the motif) and, for the TATA-less promoters, according to their average dispersion of Pol-II initiation around the TSS (from very focused to very broad promoters) evaluated using CAGE data and summarized with a Dispersion Index (DI, it could be considered as the standard deviation around the most likely initiation site). Then, for each group, the average strength of the four dinucleotide signals in the N+1 region was evaluated. In all organisms tested there was a strong inverse correlation between promoters DI and the average dinucleotide strength (for example for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic>: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76 and p-value = 0.0002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s010">S9 Fig</xref>). Focused promoters without a TATA-box were characterized for the presence of a strong periodic signal, whereas broad promoters showed a weak periodicity. TATA-box promoters were outliers: they showed low DI values and weak periodic signals. In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> another large group of promoters (5628 promoters, 1/3 of the total) was characterized for having focused initiation and weak periodicity. All these promoters had a DPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref048">48</xref>] and an Inr element, both of which are found at conserved distance from the TSS. Moreover in all organisms, only promoters without TATA-box (or Inr-DPE) had the signal in phase with the TSS suggesting that there was a fixed distance between the TSS and the N+1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s011">S10 Fig</xref>). To test if the periodic signal in the N+1 affects also the level of activity of Pol-II, the average expression of promoters was correlated with the average dinucleotide strength in the N+1 region. In this case, no correlation between the two was found (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.18, p-value = 0.21) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s012">S11 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>CPE-less promoters show 10 bp periodic initiation patterns</title>
<p>To further elucidate the relationship between periodic DNA signals and Pol-II, we studied the primary and secondary transcription initiation patterns in promoters. In fact, rotational nucleosome positioning due to a 10 bp periodic signal does not require the occurrence of the nucleosome center at exactly the same base: it tolerates shifting by multiples of 10 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref027">27</xref>]. To validate our model that the rotational setting of the +1 nucleosome influences TSS selection by Pol-II, CAGE tags were used to analyze the distribution of transcription starts at promoters. In order to detect these secondary Pol-II initiation sites, a “micro-peak” method was applied to the data that consisted in extracting positions that corresponded to a local maximum in CAGE tag coverage within a window of 5 bp. This method emphasized the stronger initiation sites compared to a simple cut-off value and also reduced the background noise given by spurious signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s013">S12 Fig</xref>). Subsequently, the average distributions of secondary TSS around promoters grouped by their TATA and DI statuses were evaluated.</p>
<p>In <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic>, each promoter subclass showed a similar level of primary TSS activity with comparable frequencies of micro-peaks at the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Away from the primary TSS, two opposite Pol-II behaviors were detected. The first had a strong 10 bp periodic pattern in secondary initiation sites distribution around promoters and corresponded to TATA-less promoters regardless of their DI values with both focused and broad promoters showing strong secondary initiation patterns. The second had no clear periodic signal near the central peak and corresponded to TATA-box promoters. This subclass had also poor affinity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) with the absence of a phase signal downstream the TSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s011">S10 Fig</xref>). The other organisms showed similar patterns of Pol-II initiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s014">S13 Fig</xref>) with TATA-box containing promoters the only group that did not show any periodicity in secondary initiation. In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, Inr-DPE promoters had a micro-peak distribution similar to TATA-box containing promoters.</p>
<p>The 10-bp periodic distribution of secondary initiation sites could be due to local curving of the DNA at the major initiation site or one-sided protection by components of the pre-initiation complex. To rule out this possibility and to establish a direct link between TSS phasing and the +1 nucleosome signal, we selected promoters with the strongest pattern in secondary initiation sites and studied their DNA properties in the N+1 region. Results showed that promoters with a strong periodic TSS initiation pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) also showed high phasing with the +1 nucleosome periodic signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), further suggesting the presence of a direct relation between the two.</p>

<title>Natural variants that map in the N+1 region alter Pol-II initiation</title>
<p>The strong correlation observed between DNA-encoded nucleosome positioning signals near the TSS and transcription initiation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g003">Fig 3</xref>) was an indication that the DNA sequence of promoters had a crucial role in guiding Pol-II to the initiation site via a possible N+1 interaction. To gain further evidence that there was a causative link between DNA sequence and Pol-II initiation and to identify the region that had the greatest influence, we studied the effect of natural variation on promoters’ DI. To do so, we used CAGE data from the ENCODE tier 1 cell line GM12878 (a lymphoblastoid cell line) for which the genome had been sequenced by the 1000Genome consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref049">49</xref>]. Using data from this cell line, it was possible to study the effect of natural variation, such as SNPs and Indels (deletion or insertion of few bases), on Pol-II initiation expressed as variation in DI. To address this we compiled promoters’ variants for which the GM12878 was homozygous for the minor allele. In total there were 15548 SNPs mapping near promoters (2kb window around TSS) and 1849 indels. The two distributions were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s015">S14 Fig</xref>), both showed low frequencies near the TSS, but were not exactly the same. SNPs minimum was centered slightly upstream the TSS whereas indels minimum downstream, in a region that coincided with the N+1.</p>
<p>GM12878 CAGE tags were then used to evaluate DI values for all promoters. As a reference, we used CAGE data from blood-derived cells from a different origin that should not contain the same mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref044">44</xref>] and assigned them to a reference genome containing always the major allele (most likely genome). To identify the promoter region that had the greatest impact on TSS dispersion, we first selected promoters that had natural variants in the GM12878 cell line and grouped them according to the distance of the variants from the TSS (in windows of 150 bp and 10 bp shift). Then the average variation in DI between the two cell lines was evaluated for each group of promoters and plotted as a function of the distance of the window from the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). It was possible to evaluate the impact on initiation patterns made by natural variants at any given distance from the TSS. Both SNPs and indels had a measurable effect on TSS dispersion if located in the proximal promoter region. Overall, SNPs had a weaker effect on TSS dispersion, with a maximum for SNPs mapping 120 bp downstream the TSS, in the central region of the N+1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Conversely, Indels had a much stronger impact in a region that extended from the TSS until the end of the N+1 and peaked within the first half of the N+1. Interestingly, SNPs and indels mapping in the NFR did not coincide with a strong variation in DI.</p>

<title>Variants disrupting dinucleotide periodicity in the N+1 region tend to increase TSS dispersion</title>
<p>We then investigated the relationship between alterations of the nucleosomes-DNA affinity (measured as variation in dinucleotide 10 bp frequency) produced by natural variants and their effects on Pol-II initiation. To assess this, we scanned the promoter region with a sliding window of 150 bp (10 bp shift) and investigated the linear relationship between the variation in 10 bp frequency for the WW dinucleotide (produced by GM12878 natural variants that mapped in that region) and the variation in the observed DI for the corresponding promoters.

According to the conventional model the TSS position is defined by the presence of CPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref005">5</xref>]. However, the majority of eukaryotic promoters lack CPEs, including a TATA-box and an Inr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref011">11</xref>]. Jiang and Pugh proposed that TSS selection in yeast might be linked to the position of the N+1 in the absence of CPEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref012">12</xref>]. Here, through a comparative analysis of DNA-encoded nucleosome signals in animal promoters and Pol-II initiation patterns, we report that the DNA signals underlying both mechanisms are conserved across species and, through the study of DNA natural variants, we show that the level of affinity between N+1 and DNA affects TSS selection in the absence of CPEs.</p>
<p>The function of sequence-intrinsic features in chromatin organization around promoters is still a matter of discussion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref034">34</xref>]. Although studies done in yeast have shown an important role of chromatin remodeler in organizing chromatin at a genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref036">36</xref>] and promoter level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref037">37</xref>], a growing body of evidence favors the functional role of sequence-intrinsic features at promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref041">41</xref>]. Moreover, in a recent study Drillon et colleagues have shown that around 1/3 of nucleosomes in the human genome are positioned based on DNA sequence determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref050">50</xref>]. Here, through comparative analysis of promoters DNA sequence composition, we show that in 5 model organisms (<italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic>, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic>, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>rerio</italic>, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>) the position of nucleosomes at the majority of promoters is at least partly determined by DNA encoded signals, with some remarkably species-specific differences. Promoters of all organisms show a 10 bp periodic signal for the four dinucleotides tested (WW, SS, YY and RR). <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> is the only organism showing also a strong signal for YY and RR dinucleotides for a periodicity of 8 bp, that is probably the consequence of the presence of specific CT rich microsatellite sequences in human promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref051">51</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). As expected, the dinucleotide that shows the highest correlation with <italic>in-vivo</italic> nucleosome maps is WW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Regardless of this, multiple periodic signals reinforce each other in organizing chromatin around promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), suggesting an additive effect of the affinity of the four dinucleotides to histones. When we study the spatial relationships between the four dinucleotides within a promoter sequence we find the same consensus as in genomic nucleosomes (SS-YY-WW-RR) for all organisms tested with the exception of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. Interestingly, on a genome level the DNA that is wrapped around <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> nucleosomes has the same consensus sequence as all other organisms but at promoter level we find that there are two distinct group of promoters characterized for having the SS-YY-WW-RR or SS-RR-WW-YY consensus. This finding is intriguing since the difference in the two sequences is not purely semantic, but has been predicted to alter the affinities to histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref047">47</xref>]. Although SS-RR-WW-YY has been predicted to have the higher affinity to nucleosomes allowing for perfect bendability of the DNA around the histone octamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref052">52</xref>], our analysis show that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> promoters with this sequence in the N+1 region do not have any difference in chromatin conformation compared to promoters with the other consensus. The reason for this unexpected observation is unknown and need further investigation.</p>
<p>The identification of promoters by the transcription machinery is a process that is guided by the general transcription factor TFIID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref053">53</xref>], a multi-subunit protein that is not only able to interact with the TATA-box or the DPE element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref005">5</xref>] but also with chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref056">56</xref>] via the TAF3 subunit, suggesting the presence of a motif-independent TFIID recruitment at promoters that rely on the N+1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref057">57</xref>]. In agreement with this hypothesis, TATA-box mutation studies have shown a direct effect on Pol-II initiation both in term of TSS position and level of promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref058">58</xref>]. On the other end, no study, to our knowledge, has investigated the effect that nucleosome-DNA affinity in the N+1 region has on TSS selection. Correlation analysis shows that in all organisms promoters without CPEs have the predicted level of nucleosome-DNA affinity anti-correlated with TSS initiation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s010">S9 Fig</xref>). Broad promoters generally have lower DNA-encoded nucleosome affinity. Conversely, narrow promoters, often presented as a homogeneous class in the literature, vary greatly in this respect, with only the CPE-less subset (TATA-less and Inr-DPE-less in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>) showing strong affinity in the N+1 region. Moreover, the 10 bp periodicity seen in Pol-II initiation in all promoters, focused and broad, that lack CPEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s014">S13 Fig</xref>) is another indication of a direct interaction between Pol-II and the N+1 in the absence of other DNA signals. In fact, a model of Pol-II initiation that relies on the interaction with the N+1, which in turn is rotationally positioned and able to tolerate shifting by multiples of 10 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref027">27</xref>], would allow Pol-II to start transcription at 10 bp intervals. Furthermore, the study of DNA natural variants in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> have shown that the region with grater influence on TSS selection is the N+1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and that there is a negative correlation between variation in nucleosome affinity and Pol-II initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005144.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). That is, the presence of a variant in the N+1 region that decreases the nucleosome-DNA affinity results in an increase in TSS dispersion and vice-versa. These results strongly support the model of a motif-independent TFIID recruitment mediated by N+1—TAF2 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref057">57</xref>]. We can speculate that, in the absence of the TATA-box or Inr-DPE, the relative stability of the histones-DNA complex in the N+1 region could be transferred to the PIC via interaction with TFIID leading to a more or less focused transcription initiation by Pol-II. An alternative mechanism of PIC recruitment at promoters in the absence of CPE has been proposed by recent work by Afek and Lukatsky done in yeast in which they used a non-consensus based free-energy function to predict PIC affinity instead of nucleosome affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref059">59</xref>]. Interestingly, they found that the free-energy distribution around promoters (Fig 1 and Fig 2 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref059">59</xref>]) is very similar to our nucleotide periodicity profile we see in human (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005144.s006">S5A Fig</xref>) with a minimum located in the nucleosome-free region upstream of the TSS followed by spikes in free-energy in correspondence of the nucleosome occupied regions. On the other end, in all organisms studied, CPEs containing promoters are outliers compared to non-CPE promoters: they are focused but have weak nucleosome affinity and do not show any TSS periodicity. In this class of promoters the initiation site appears to be specified solely by the presence of the CPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref010">10</xref>].</p>

The resulting binary sequences were individually scanned in a sliding window of 150 bp, shifted by 10 bp at a time. A Fourier transform was applied to each window in order to extract the power spectrum. From the resulting spectrum, the value corresponding to a frequency of 0.097 (corresponding to a period of 10.3 bp) was extracted. This value was directly used as a periodicity score.</p>

<title>Identification of genomic nucleosomes</title>
<p>For paired-end samples, nucleosome positions were restricted to paired-reads that formed fragments of exactly 147 bp as previously reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref028">28</xref>]. In a similar way, to reproduce analogous results on single-end samples, reads were selected if they had another read mapped on the opposite strand 147 bp downstream. For both single- and paired-end samples, multiple fragments that mapped to the same location were considered only once. For both paired- and single-end samples, the midpoints of the fragments were used as the inferred nucleosome position.</p>

<title>Evaluation of consensus motifs scores for nucleosome +1 and genomic nucleosomes</title>
<p>Consensus motifs were generated by permuting the 4 dinucleotide (WW, SS, YY, RR) and two Ns. Sequences starting with an N were discarded resulting in a total of 240 sequences. These consensus motifs were then mapped to promoters and MNase-seq enriched regions.</p>
<p>For the analysis of nucleosome +1, the region from position -99 to 300 relative to the TSS of the corresponding genome assembly was used for mapping each consensus motif allowing a maximum of 3 mis-matches. Then, the average occurrence frequency for each motif was evaluated from base +50 to +200 relative to the TSS and a Fourier transform was applied in order to identify the intensity of the frequency of 0.097 (corresponding to a period of 10.3 bp). This value was then stored as the motifs’ score for the nucleosome +1 and the procedure was repeated for all consensus motifs. For the genomic nucleosomes a similar analysis was performed. In order to speed-up the analysis, 80.000 inferred positions were randomly selected from each sample. Subsequently, each consensus motif was mapped around the inferred nucleosome position and the average occurrence frequency was calculated from position -75 to +75 relative to it. A Fourier transform was then applied as before and the value for a period of 10.3 bp was used as the motif score in genomic nucleosomes.</p>

<title>Periodicity analysis of Pol-II initiation patterns</title>
<p>CAGE data from different samples belonging to the same species were first merged into one file. TSS profiles were then extracted for promoter regions extending from -103 to +104 relative to the dominant TSS using the ChIP-Extract tool from the ChIP-Seq web server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005144.ref068">68</xref>]. The resulting integer arrays were then converted into binary “micro-peak” arrays. Briefly, a micro-peak corresponds to a 5bp window with a minimal number of 100 tags. The position of the micro-peak is then assigned to the position with the highest number of tags within the corresponding window. Each micro-peak was then given a maximum value of 1 tag. The cumulative frequency of micro-peaks was then determined at single-base resolution within a 200bp region around the TSS.</p>
<p>To identify promoters with a strong 10 bp periodicity in micro-peaks signals, promoters were ranked according to the covariance between their micro-peaks distribution and a cosine function of period 10 bp. Promoters with weak micro-peak signal (with low covariance values) were selected for having a cumulative covariance equal to 0.</p>

MNase- or ChIP-seq tags were centered by 70 bp to account for the estimated fragment size of about 140 bp (centering parameter of the ChIP-Seq server).

Different shades of blue represent the total number of mismatches allowed in the mapping. (B) Intensity of the 10 bp frequency of the two consensuses on the N+1 region for each <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> promoters. Red and green dots highlight promoters characterized for a strong signal of the YYWWNNRRSS consensus (double the signal) compared to the RRWWNNYYSS consensus respectively. (C) Nucleosome distribution around promoters characterized for a strong signal in one consensus as defined by (B). Each dot represents the average tag count in a widow of 10 bp. Continuous lines are the local polynomial regression fit. (D) Same as (C) but with H3K4me3 and window of 1 bp.</p>

<p>For each organism promoters were grouped according to their CPE status (TATA-box and Inr-DPE presence in the expected position). CPE-less promoters were also grouped according to their DI value in groups of 2000 promotes (a similar number as the promoters with the TATA-box). Each dot represents the average value of the intensity of the WW, SS, RR and YY dinucleotide for groups with similar DI and CPE status. Solid line represents the predicted values (evaluated by a linear model) whereas dotted line the 99% confidence intervals as evaluated by the linear model.</p>
