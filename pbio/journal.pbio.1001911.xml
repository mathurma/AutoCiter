<p>A crystal structure of a member of the UbiA family of membrane-embedded prenyltransferases reveals the architecture of the active site and suggests a possible mechanism for catalysis.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Membrane-embedded prenyltransferases from the UbiA family catalyze the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent transfer of a hydrophobic polyprenyl chain onto a variety of acceptor molecules and are involved in the synthesis of molecules that mediate electron transport, including Vitamin K and Coenzyme Q. In humans, missense mutations to the protein UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing 1 (UBIAD1) are responsible for Schnyder crystalline corneal dystrophy, which is a genetic disease that causes blindness. Mechanistic understanding of this family of enzymes has been hampered by a lack of three-dimensional structures. We have solved structures of a UBIAD1 homolog from <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic>, AfUbiA, in an unliganded form and bound to Mg<sup>2+</sup> and two different isoprenyl diphosphates. Functional assays on MenA, a UbiA family member from <italic>E. coli</italic>, verified the importance of residues involved in Mg<sup>2+</sup> and substrate binding. The structural and functional studies led us to propose a mechanism for the prenyl transfer reaction. Disease-causing mutations in UBIAD1 are clustered around the active site in AfUbiA, suggesting the mechanism of catalysis is conserved between the two homologs.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The biosynthesis of Vitamin K and Coenzyme Q requires the transfer of a long, hydrophobic moiety known as an isoprenyl onto an aromatic acceptor compound. This process is catalyzed by a family of proteins known as the UbiA proteins, which are embedded in the hydrophobic environment of cell membranes. To understand how the prenyltransfer reaction is carried out, we solved the three-dimensional structure of a member of the UbiA family by X-ray crystallography. This structure reveals how magnesium ions and the prenyl substrate are bound within a sealed amphipathic chamber inside the protein and suggests how the reaction intermediate may be stabilized by the protein and protected from the solvent. Functional studies carried out on another member of the UbiA family, as well as comparison to known disease-causing mutations in the human homolog UBIAD1, demonstrate that the residues involved in this process are conserved across the UbiA family.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vitamin K is an essential cofactor required for the posttranslational modification of proteins involved in blood-clotting and normal bone metabolism. One of the major forms of vitamin K in humans, menaquinone-4, is produced by cleaving the phytyl group from dietary phylloquinone to produce menadione, which is then modified with a polyprenyl group donated from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This latter step is catalyzed by the protein UBIAD1, a member of a family of integral membrane proteins known collectively as UbiA prenyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Hirota1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Vos1">[3]</xref>. Recently, it has also been proposed that UBIAD1 is responsible for the prenylation of coenzyme Q10 in Golgi membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Mugoni1">[4]</xref>. Missense mutations to the UBIAD1 gene are the underlying cause of the genetic disorder Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD), which causes accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids in the cornea of the eye, eventually leading to blindness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Orr1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Membrane-embedded prenyltransferases belonging to the UbiA family are found in every branch of life, and are involved in the biosynthesis of a highly diverse range of molecules, including respiratory lipoquinones such as ubiquinone and menaquinone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Ashby1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Young1">[8]</xref>, prenylated hemes and chlorophylls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Oster1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Saiki1">[10]</xref>, archaeal lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Hemmi1">[11]</xref>, numerous prenylated plant flavonoids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Yazaki1">[12]</xref>, the antibiotic aurachin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Stec1">[13]</xref>, Vitamin E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Collakova1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Schledz1">[15]</xref>, and bacterial cell wall precursors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Huang1">[16]</xref>. Although the nature of the prenyl acceptor and donor vary considerably, reactions catalyzed by UbiA homologs are Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and generate pyrophosphate as a leaving group. A representative reaction, catalyzed by the eponymous <italic>E. coli</italic> protein UbiA, involves the cleavage of the C–O bond in polyprenyl diphosphates of variable length and transfer of the prenyl chain to the <italic>ortho</italic> position of the phenol 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). UbiA family members are typically predicted to contain eight or nine transmembrane helices and have two characteristic conserved motifs with the consensus sequences NDXXDXXXD and DXXXD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), often referred to as the first and second aspartate-rich motifs, respectively.</p>

<p>To understand the structural basis of UbiA function, we set out to elucidate the structure of a member of the UbiA family using X-ray crystallography. The resulting structures of an archaeal homolog reveal locations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and polyprenyl diphosphate binding sites, a possible hydrophobic substrate tunnel allowing the protein to accommodate polyprenyls of variable length, and the location of a cluster of highly conserved residues forming a potential catalytic site.</p>

<title>Fold of AfUbiA</title>
<p>After screening a large number of bacterial and archaeal UbiA proteins for suitability for crystallization, a homolog from the extremophile <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> (AfUbiA) was chosen for further study based on its stability in detergent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted protein diffracted to 3.2 Å, and the structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s011">Table S1</xref>). Despite the modest resolution, assignment of the sequence register was greatly facilitated by the high quality of the experimentally phased electron density maps, and by the locations of five selenomethionine residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s002">Figure S2B</xref>,C). The selenomethionine structure was then used as a molecular replacement search model for 2.4 and 2.5 Å datasets collected on native AfUbiA crystals, grown in lipidic cubic phase (LCP) and soaked with either geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) prior to freezing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s011">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). The final models for the two substrate-bound structures contain four AfUbiA molecules in the asymmetric unit, with one molecule of GPP or DMAPP and two Mg<sup>2+</sup> per protein chain. Comparison of the detergent and LCP crystal forms shows that none of the interaction surfaces between neighboring protomers are conserved between the different lattices, and so the protein is likely a monomer in the membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s002">Figure S2E</xref>).</p>
<p>The AfUbiA structure contains a total of nine transmembrane helices, with the N and C termini emerging on opposite sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Based on the distribution of positive and negative charges in the soluble loops, the N terminus of the protein is probably oriented towards the cytoplasm and the C terminus to the extracellular side <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-vonHeijne1">[17]</xref>. This assignment is also consistent with the experimentally determined orientation of <italic>E. coli</italic> UbiA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Daley1">[18]</xref>. The first eight helices can be grouped into two bundles of four helices each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The loops connecting the transmembrane helices are short, with the exception of the cytoplasmic loops connecting TM2 and 3 (L2–3) and TM6 and 7 (L6–7), which are both over 25 and 18 residues in length, respectively, and contain short helical regions. The two conserved aspartate-rich motifs are both positioned on the cytoplasmic side of the protein, between the C-terminal ends of TM2 and TM6 and the L2–3 and L6–7 loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, the conserved motifs as well as the large cytoplasmic loops that follow them are at equivalent positions in the two four-helix bundles. Closer examination of the two bundles reveals that they are structurally homologous and can be superposed by a twofold pseudosymmetry axis running through the center of the protein perpendicular to the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This raises the possibility that the UbiA fold may have arisen from the duplication of an ancient four-helix, dimeric protein.</p>
<p>The crystal structure of another archaeal UbiA homolog from <italic>Aeropyrum pernix</italic> (ApUbiA) was recently reported with a resolution of 3.6 Å <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Cheng1">[19]</xref>. The overall fold of AfUbiA is similar to that seen in ApUbiA, but there are differences in the location and coordination of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and substrate (detailed in the section “Differences between the AfUbiA and ApUbiA crystal structures”). Both UbiA family members resemble proteins belonging to the isoprenoid synthase superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Liang1">[20]</xref>, and in particular, those members that catalyze the synthesis of all-trans polyprenyls by repeated addition of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s001">Figure S1</xref>), the trans-IPPSs. These enzymes are also Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and contain similar aspartate-rich motifs. Although any sequence identity between the soluble and transmembrane families is negligible, comparison of AfUbiA to the trans-IPPS farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s004">Figure S4A</xref>–B) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Hosfield1">[21]</xref> reveals that the two four-helix bundles comprising helices 1–8 in AfUbiA and 2–9 in FPPS are superposable. TM9 in AfUbiA and the first helix in the trans-IPPS fold have no equivalent in the other family. Nevertheless, despite their structural similarity, examination of the distribution of charged residues on the two enzymes clearly reveals their distinct identities as soluble and transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s004">Figure S4C</xref>–D).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Architecture of the Central Cavity and Substrate-Binding Site</title>
<p>The bound isoprenyl-diphosphates and Mg<sup>2+</sup> are located in a large cavity at the interface between the four-helix bundles near the cytoplasmic side, which is partly closed off from the solvent by the L2–3 and L6–7 loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, in the unliganded structure, a 13-residue long region of the L2–3 loop is disordered, leaving this cavity widely accessible to the solvent, whereas all but four residues become resolved in the GPP-bound structure. In the DMAPP-bound structure, the entire loop is resolved and completely occludes the cavity from the solvent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s005">Figure S5A</xref>,B). This difference may be attributed to the lower resolution of the unliganded structure, however, as the substrate in the DMAPP-bound structure is occluded from the cytoplasm, a more likely possibility is that substrate binding induces conformational changes in the L2–3 loop and thus seals off the active site.</p>

<p>Near the cytoplasm, the central cavity is broad and is lined with polar and charged residues, including the aspartate-rich motifs and many of the other residues that are most conserved across the UbiA family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The cavity becomes more hydrophobic and tapers into a narrow tunnel as it extends deeper into the transmembrane region of the protein. Approximately halfway into the bilayer, the tunnel bends sharply and forms a fenestration in the side of the protein that opens into the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This tunnel could offer a possible explanation for how UbiA family members utilize prenyl donors of varying lengths, which range from DMAPP (C<sub>5</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Sasaki1">[22]</xref> to dodecaprenyl phosphate (C<sub>60</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Huang1">[16]</xref>. The latter substrate approaches 60 Å in length in a fully extended conformation; in comparison, the membrane-spanning region of AfUbiA is less than 40 Å. The hydrophobic tunnel in AfUbiA could potentially accommodate up to six prenyl units, and even longer polyprenyls could bind to the protein by extending directly into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer.</p>
<p>In the GPP-bound structure, the substrate is located in the central cavity with its diphosphate positioned between the two aspartate-rich motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Two electron densities are also visible on either side of the diphosphate that likely correspond to Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This observation is consistent with data showing that the activity of UbiA family members is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, as well as extensive mutagenesis experiments, confirming the importance of the two motifs for activity in <italic>E. coli</italic> UbiA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Brauer1">[23]</xref> and other homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Stec1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Ohara1">[24]</xref>. The two Mg<sup>2+</sup> are coordinated by N68 and D72 in the first aspartate-rich motif and D198 and D202 in the second aspartate-rich motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The conserved aspartate D76 is too far away to bind directly to Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the first motif, but could interact indirectly by stabilizing a water molecule coordinating the ion. The diphosphate group of GPP is stabilized by Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the first motif, which bridges two oxygens with coordination distances of 2.3 and 2.6 Å. In contrast to the first motif, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound to the second motif is 3.5–4.0 Å away from the diphosphate, which is significantly farther than the expected coordination distance of 2.0–2.3 Å. Additional interactions between the protein and GPP oxygens are provided by the basic residues R22 and K146. The GPP molecule is slightly kinked after the diphosphate, so that the isoprenyl tail extends along the wall of the cavity close to highly conserved residues on TM2, 4, and 5. In particular, the C–O bond cleaved in the prenyltransfer reaction is positioned near a cluster of conserved polar residues including N68, Y139, and S140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The geometry of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> and substrate binding sites in the DMAPP-bound structure is similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s005">Figure S5C</xref>,D).</p>

<p>We used two approaches to verify the interactions between the bound substrate, ions, and protein in our crystal structure. First, to confirm the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding sites, we co-crystallized the protein with Cd<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s011">Table S1</xref>). Two strong electron densities consistent with Cd<sup>2+</sup> appear coordinated by the aspartate-rich motifs, which align well to the Mg<sup>2+</sup> locations in the GPP-bound structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Second, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence of GPP binding to AfUbiA. In the presence of 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, GPP binds to AfUbiA with a K<sub>D</sub> of 3.2±0.1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). However, when 1 mM EDTA was added instead of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, no GPP binding was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Residues N68, D72, D198, and D202 from the two aspartate-rich motifs, as well as the basic residues R22 and K146, were then mutated to alanine to test their contribution to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent GPP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Mutations to all six residues had pronounced effects on binding of GPP to AfUbiA. Four of the mutations completely abolished GPP binding, whereas the effects of the D198A and D202A mutations were comparatively mild, increasing the K<sub>D</sub> by 45- and 21-fold, respectively. This is consistent with the observation that the distance between the Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound to the second aspartate-rich motif and the GPP diphosphate is outside of the typical coordination distance range.</p>

<title>Differences Between the AfUbiA and ApUbiA Crystal Structures</title>
<p>There are notable differences in the shape of the substrate-binding cavity and in the organization of the active sites of the AfUbiA and ApUbiA structures. The central cavity in ApUbiA is smaller than in AfUbiA, largely because ApUbiA lacks the long hydrophobic tunnel and second opening observed in AfUbiA. For the ApUbiA structure, it was proposed that longer prenyl chains may extend out of the protein via its single entrance to the central cavity, which is closer to the membrane interface than in AfUbiA. This mechanism of accommodating long prenyl chains is not likely for the current AfUbiA structure, because although the cytoplasmic opening exists in unliganded AfUbiA, it is completely closed in the DMAPP-bound structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). </p>
<p>In both structures, the bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the diphosphate moiety are located in the central cavity between the two conserved aspartate-rich motifs; however, interactions between the protein and ligands are different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Although two bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> were modeled in both structures, in the current AfUbiA structure, N68, D72, D198, and D202 directly coordinate the Mg<sup>2+</sup>, while in the ApUbiA structure all the corresponding residues are &gt;3.4 Å away from Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These four residues were demonstrated to be important for Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent GPP binding according to our ITC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The differences in Mg<sup>2+</sup> location and coordination between the two structures are likely attributable to the significantly lower resolution (3.6 Å) of the ApUbiA structure.</p>

<p>4HB was also modeled into the ApUbiA structure, although there is currently no direct biochemical evidence that it can act as a prenyl acceptor for ApUbiA. This proposed 4HB binding site is unlikely to hold the prenyl acceptor in the current AfUbiA structure, as its position clashes with the location of the geranyl moiety. We were also unable to detect binding of 4HB to AfUbiA by ITC.</p>

<title>Conservation with Other UbiA Family Members and Implications for the Catalytic Mechanism</title>
<p>Although two crystal structures are available now for the UbiA family of proteins, both AfUbiA and ApUbiA are from archaeal thermophiles and enzymatic activity has not been demonstrated for either of the proteins. To understand the relevance of the AfUbiA structure to other UbiA family members, we mutated a number of residues on the <italic>E. coli</italic> MenA homolog (EcMenA) that are equivalent to key active site residues in AfUbiA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). EcMenA catalyzes the transfer of a prenyl chain onto 1,4-dihydroxy 2-naphthoic acid (DHNA) to produce the menaquinone precursor demethylmenaquinone. Two independent functional assays were used to measure the effects of mutations on EcMenA: an <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic complementation assay in which growth under anaerobic conditions was measured in an <italic>menA</italic><sup>−</sup> <italic>E. coli</italic> strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Shineberg1">[25]</xref> transformed with WT or mutant EcMenA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), and an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay measuring prenyltransferase activity with purified membranes from <italic>E. coli</italic> cells overexpressing WT or mutant EcMenA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s008">Figure S8</xref>). For both assays, mutations to the equivalents of N68 and D72 in the first aspartate-rich motif and D198 and D202 in the second motif resulted in total or near-total loss of function. Mutation of the highly conserved tyrosine (Y139 in AfUbiA) near the C–O bond also resulted in loss of function.</p>

<p>Functional data for eukaryotic UbiA homologs are currently scarce, but missense mutations to 19 different residues on human UBIAD1 are known to cause SCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Orr1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-AlGhadeer1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Yellore1">[35]</xref>. Of these, three align to insertions not present on AfUbiA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, the remaining 16 mutated residues all map to the region around the putative active site at the cytoplasmic end of the cavity. The residues Y174 and T175 on human UBIAD1 are equivalent to Y139 and S140, which belong to the cluster of polar residues on TM2 and TM4 likely important for catalysis; the residues A97 and G98 (F63 and S64 on AfUbiA) pack into the interface between TM2 and TM4 near this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Residues N102, K181, D236, and D240 on UBIAD1 are homologous to N68, K146, D198, and D202, which form part of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>/diphosphate binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Residues 112, 118, 119, 121, and 122 on UBIAD1 align to residues 78, 90, 91, 93, and 94 on the highly mobile L2–3 loop of AfUbiA, which changes conformation upon substrate binding in AfUbiA. Potential functions for G177, G186, and L188 (P142, D152, and I154 on AfUbiA) are less evident, but all three residues are located in close proximity to the proposed active site.</p>
<p>Overall, the above experiments on EcMenA and the mapping of UBIAD1 mutations onto the AfUbiA structure suggest that the fold and location of substrate-binding sites are conserved across the UbiA family, and that the mechanism of the prenyltransfer reaction is conserved as well. Although this mechanism is currently unknown, possible clues may be found by comparison to the soluble trans-IPPS proteins. In addition to sharing a fold with the UbiA homologs, the two protein families also exhibit similarities in the architecture of their active sites. The structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> FPPS bound to IPP and a thio- analog of the prenyl donor, thioDMAPP, is representative of available structures of trans-IPPS ternary complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s009">Figure S9</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Hosfield1">[21]</xref>. Like AfUbiA, members of the trans-IPPS family contain two signature acidic motifs, which both contain the conserved sequence DDXXD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Ashby2">[36]</xref> and which coordinate Mg<sup>2+</sup> atoms that stabilize the diphosphate on the prenyl donor. In trans-IPPS proteins, the reaction is believed to proceed via a three-stage ionization–condensation–elimination mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Poulter1">[37]</xref>, involving a carbocation intermediate in the allylic site that is stabilized by the liberated diphosphate as well as interactions with nearby polar side chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Hosfield1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Kavanagh1">[38]</xref>. Given the structural and functional similarity between AfUbiA and the trans-IPPS proteins, it is possible that this catalytic mechanism is shared with homologs of the UbiA family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>In the GPP- and DMAPP-bound structures, C-C bond formation would occur near a triad of three polar side chains: N68 from the first aspartate-rich motif, and Y139 and S140 on TM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, the tyrosine is the single most highly conserved residue in the UbiA family, present in 97% of the more than 10,000 UbiA sequences currently in the Pfam database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Punta1">[39]</xref>. Mutation of this residue in both EcMenA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>) and EcUbiA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Cheng1">[19]</xref> results in a loss of function. The near-universal conservation of the tyrosine residue implies that this site is involved in a function that is shared among all the different branches of the UbiA family, regardless of the nature of the highly variable prenyl acceptor. We therefore propose that this site could be involved in stabilizing the carbocation intermediate on the prenyl donor after cleavage of the pyrophosphate leaving group, possibly by cation–π interactions with Y139. A similar role for active site tyrosine residues has been proposed for the structurally unrelated aromatic prenyltransferases DMATS and CloQ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Yang1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Metzger2">[42]</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have described the structure of an archaeal member of the UbiA family of membrane-embedded prenyltransferases. The substrate-bound structures reveal that the diphosphate group interacts with arginine and lysine side chains as well as Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordinated by conserved aspartate-rich motifs. Although short prenyl donors containing only one or two prenyl units were chosen for crystallization due to their higher solubility in water, the structure reveals a long, narrow cavity that opens into the membrane and could allow the protein to bind significantly longer polyprenyl chains. Due in part to its low homology with UbiA family members of known function, we were unable to identify the natural prenyl-accepting substrate of AfUbiA. Nonetheless, the EcMenA functional assays using mutations designed with the AfUbiA structure, as well as the clustering of SCD-causing mutations around conserved residues in the substrate-binding cavity of AfUbiA, suggest that the fold and key aspects of the catalytic mechanism may be conserved between these distantly related homologs and that AfUbiA is a useful structural model for understanding UbiA family prenyltransferases.</p>
<p>One curious feature of the substrate-bound structures is that the Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound to the second conserved motif is out of range for coordination of the prenyl donor, and yet the functional data for EcMenA indicate that the residues coordinating this Mg<sup>2+</sup> are critical for function. One possible explanation is that when the protein is bound to Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the isoprenyl diphosphate only, the substrate is coordinated by only one Mg<sup>2+</sup> in order to prevent reaction of the isoprenyl diphosphate with water in the absence of the prenyl acceptor, as interactions with one Mg<sup>2+</sup> may not be sufficient to induce spontaneous cleavage of the C–O bond. Binding of the prenyl acceptor would then induce a conformational change to bring the Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound to the second conserved motif within coordination distance of the diphosphate and exclude water from the cavity. Another possibility has also been proposed based on homology models of <italic>E. coli</italic> UbiA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Brauer1">[23]</xref>, that UbiA homologs stabilize the diphosphate via a single Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound to only one of the two aspartate-rich motifs and that the other motif activates the phenolic substrate by abstracting a proton. Resolution of the issue will likely require a structure of the full ternary complex.</p>
<p>In the structurally related trans-IPPS FPPS, comparisons of the ternary complex and apo-structure show that the enzyme undergoes a conformational change upon binding substrate; in particular, the loops corresponding to L2–3 and L6–7 in UbiA close over the active site to occlude it from the solvent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Hosfield1">[21]</xref>. The unliganded and substrate-bound AfUbiA structures show similar behavior, in that a region of the L2–3 loop undergoes a disordered to ordered transition upon substrate binding. The prenyl acceptor could therefore enter the cavity through an opening formed by fluctuations in the L2–3 loop, which would then be stabilized in the closed conformation. Although short polyprenyl diphosphates like GPP could also enter the substrate-binding cavity via the opening to the cytoplasm, longer polyprenyl diphosphates have poor solubility in water and likely partition into the lipid bilayer, and therefore may bind to the protein laterally from within the membrane. Because it seems implausible that the negatively charged diphosphate group enters the core of the bilayer and threads into the hydrophobic tunnel, the protein may undergo a conformational change to allow the polyprenyl substrate access to the substrate binding cavity. In the crystal structure, one wall of the substrate tunnel is formed by TM9, whose removal leaves the central cavity completely exposed to the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). A slight movement of this loosely packed helix could potentially suffice to allow substrates to enter the binding site and allow release of the product as well.</p>

The transformants were grown aerobically in Luria broth to an optical density of 1.0%±0.05%, supplemented with 20% glycerol, flash frozen, and stored at −80°C. The EcMenA genetic rescue experiments were carried out using a protocol adapted from Suvarna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001911-Suvarna1">[7]</xref>.

<title>Prenyltransferase Activity Assay</title>
<p>Purified <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes were prepared by harvesting 1 l of cells overexpressing WT and mutant EcMenA, grown to 1 OD as described for AfUbiA. The proteins were expressed as SUMO fusion proteins to increase yield. The cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM βME, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM PMSF, 25 µg/ml DnaseI). After breaking the cells by sonication, the cell lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 3,000× <italic>g</italic> and 4°C. The supernatant was then transferred to clean centrifuge tubes and centrifuged a second time for 60 min at 100,000× <italic>g</italic> and 4°C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 3 ml 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, flash frozen, and stored at −80°C. Overexpression of WT and mutant SUMO-EcMenA was verified by running 0.5 µl of the membrane suspension before and after a 30 min digestion with 1 µg SUMO protease on an SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001911.s008">Figure S8C</xref>). In addition to the WT and mutant EcMenA proteins, membrane fractions were prepared in the same manner for cells expressing SUMO-EcUbiA, which does not utilize DHNA as a prenyl acceptor, for the negative control.</p>
<p>For the enzymatic assay, 30 µl reaction mixtures were prepared with the following components: 3 µl purified membrane fractions, 2 mM DHNA, 1 mM GPP, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM βME, 5% acetonitrile (ACN), and 50 mM Tris pH 7.5. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37°C, quenched with the addition of 2% formic acid, and extracted with 10 volumes of chloroform. The chloroform was dried under air and the residue resuspended in 60 µl 65% ACN/35% 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 in dH<sub>2</sub>O. The resulting samples were then separated using reverse phase HPLC with a gradient of 65%–75% ACN for the mobile phase. Enzyme activity was quantified as the area of the product peak, normalized by the activity for the WT protein. Values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001911-g005">Figure 5D</xref> are averages for three experiments.</p>
