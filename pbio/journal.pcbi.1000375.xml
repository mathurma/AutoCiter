            <title/>
            <p>Each year, the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iscb.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.iscb.org</ext-link>) makes two major awards to recognize excellence in
                the field of bioinformatics. The ISCB Awards Committee, composed of current and past
                directors of the Society and previous award winners, has announced that the 2009
                ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award will be given to Webb Miller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000375-g001">Image 1</xref>) of The Pennsylvania State
                University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America (USA), and the
                2009 ISCB Overton Prize for outstanding achievement in early- to mid-career will be
                awarded to Trey Ideker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000375-g002">Image 2</xref>)
                of the University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA, who serves on
                the Editorial Advisory Board for <italic>PLoS Computational Biology</italic>. These
                awards represent the highest tribute and recognition of scientific excellence within
                the bioinformatics community, and they are seen as honors well beyond the boundaries
                of the discipline. Both 2009 award winners started their careers in basic computer
                science, but since moving into bioinformatics they have made important contributions
                to biological understanding as well as to algorithm design.</p>

            <title>Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award: Webb Miller</title>
            <p>Established in 2003, ISCB's Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award
                recognizes members of the computational biology community who have made major
                contributions to the field through research, education, service, or a combination of
                the three. Miller will be joining a prestigious group of previous winners: David
                Sankoff (University of Ottawa, Canada), David Lipman (US National Center for
                Biotechnology Information, USA), Janet Thornton (European Bioinformatics Institute,
                United Kingdom (UK)), Mike Waterman (University of Southern California, USA), Temple
                Smith (Boston University, USA), and David Haussler (University of California Santa
                Cruz, USA).</p>
            <p>Ten years ago, the name Webb Miller was already well-known to bioinformaticians
                worldwide for two very highly cited classic papers on the BLAST algorithms for
                searching sequence databases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000375-Altschul1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000375-Altschul2">[2]</xref>. In recognizing an author of a widely used
                algorithm with the Senior Scientist Award, ISCB is continuing a tradition: the three
                most recent winners of this Award, David Haussler, and Temple Smith and Michael
                Waterman, are associated, respectively, with Hidden Markov Models and the eponymous
                Smith–Waterman sequence alignment algorithm. Today, however,
                Miller's name is equally well-known for the alignment, comparison, and
                analysis of complete vertebrate genomes. Much of the code written in his group is
                embedded in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser, through
                which these algorithms penetrate as widely into the bioinformatics and genomics
                community as the ever-popular BLAST.</p>
            <p>Miller's initial training was, like Haussler's, in mathematics. In
                the mid-1960s, when still an undergraduate student at Whitman College in Walla
                Walla, Washington, he found a book in the library that determined the path of his
                higher education and career for the next two decades. It was on the theoretical
                limits of what is computable, and the young Miller immediately decided that he, at
                his “little college”, could undertake real, publishable research
                in this field. The resulting paper, the first of a very long list, eventually
                appeared in an obscure logic journal published in East Germany. This led him to
                graduate work at Whitman in Computer Science, to his Ph.D. in Mathematics at the
                University of Washington Seattle, and, by 1969, to an assistant professorship in
                Computer Science at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). His work at this
                time was still focused on theoretical computer science; even when he started at Penn
                State he had no experience of practical computing or writing code.</p>
            <p>In 1980, after a decade or so working on the fundamental issues behind how computers
                deal with floating-point numbers, Miller took a break from research to write three
                books, including a software engineering textbook and a handbook of software tools.
                While he was writing, he was also looking around for new challenges and applications
                of his computational knowledge. He found them through a most unexpected source.
                “My mother started sending me newspaper clippings about the beginnings of
                the Human Genome Project,” he says. “This fascinated me,
                although I knew no biology at the time. I hadn't even taken it in high
                school.” During the next few years, he worked at IBM, the University of
                California Santa Barbara, and the University of Arizona. By the time he returned to
                Penn State as a full professor of computer science in 1987, his research was
                focusing wholly on computational biology.</p>
            <p>Miller's first important collaborator in bioinformatics was Gene Myers, whom
                he met while at the University of Arizona and whom he still cites as one of the
                greatest influences on his scientific career. During the 1987–1988
                academic year, Myers came to Penn State for sabbatical, for research, and to teach
                advanced courses on DNA sequence analysis. Miller's collaboration with
                Myers and with David Lipman, director of the newly founded National Center for
                Biotechnology Information in Bethesda, Maryland, led to the development of the BLAST
                algorithm. Lipman, who received the ISCB Senior Scientist Accomplishment Award in
                2004, was already well-known for the FastA algorithm; BLAST emerged from a search
                for a similar sequence comparison algorithm that would be fast enough to make
                database searching feasible.</p>
            <p>Soon after entering bioinformatics, Miller turned his attention from general sequence
                alignment algorithms to the specific problem of aligning long DNA sequences.
                “Most bioinformaticians spent the 1990s waiting for the human genome
                sequence,” he said. “My question was: How soon would the second
                vertebrate genome come out, so I could try a genome-wide sequence
                alignment?” That second genome—of the mouse—was
                published in 2002 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000375-Mouse1">[3]</xref>. “I originally anticipated that we would
                have two vertebrate genomes by the time I reached retirement age in 2008. Instead,
                thanks to improvements in sequencing technology, we now have over forty.”
                An alignment of forty-four vertebrate genomes has recently been released on the UCSC
                Genome Browser. Haussler collaborated with Miller closely throughout the development
                of the Genome Browser, and he greatly values him as a colleague as well as for his
                vital contribution to the field of comparative genomics. “Webb has played
                an essential role in nearly every vertebrate genome sequence project. He developed
                the first program capable of accurate comparative alignment for entire
                vertebrate-sized genomes,” he says.</p>
            <p>Miller has never been particularly interested in the properties of protein-coding
                genes, preferring to study the biology of functional, non-coding regions of DNA,
                such as regulatory regions. And here he confesses to some disappointment with the
                rate of progress. “It has been easier to sequence genomes, but harder to
                understand their biology than I, coming from a computer science background, thought
                it would [be],” he says. “It seems that
                biology is even more complex than we had assumed.”</p>
            <p>He and his collaborators have now taken on a new challenge: sequencing the genomes
                and understanding the biology of rare, endangered, and even extinct species. He has
                published sequences of the nuclear genome of the woolly mammoth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000375-Miller1">[4]</xref> and the
                mitochondrial genome of the Tasmanian tiger (<italic>Thylacinus
                cynocephalus</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000375-Miller2">[5]</xref>, which became extinct in 1936. The DNA samples for
                the latter project were obtained from specimens that had been preserved for decades
                in museums. Miller says he is hoping that similar sequencing techniques will help
                preserve endangered species from extinction. One of these is the so-called Tasmanian
                devil, a ferocious marsupial that is now under threat from a mysterious, contagious
                tumor: Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD). “We are sequencing two
                specimens, one with the disease and another that seems immune, and hope to use the
                differences to guide a breeding program,” he says.</p>
            <p>Miller acknowledges that he owes much of his success to “great”
                collaborators, from Myers and Lipman in the late 1980s to Haussler and his UCSC
                colleagues Jim Kent and Tom Pringle. And it may be that great collaborators make
                each other. “Time and time again, Webb has made major contributions and
                taken little credit for himself, preferring to put younger researchers in the
                limelight, whether or not they were his students. I've never worked with a
                more generous collaborator,” says Haussler.</p>

            <title>Overton Prize: Trey Ideker</title>
            <p>The ISCB Overton Prize was established in 2001 in memory of G. Christian Overton, a
                major contributor to the field of bioinformatics and a member of the ISCB Board of
                Directors who died suddenly the previous year. The Prize is awarded for outstanding
                accomplishment to a scientist in early- to mid-career who has already made a
                significant contribution to the field of computational biology. Previous recipients
                are Christopher Burge (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA), David Baker
                (University of Washington, USA), W. James Kent (University of California Santa Cruz,
                USA), Uri Alon (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel), Ewan Birney (European
                Bioinformatics Institute, UK), Mathieu Blanchette (McGill University, Canada), Eran
                Segal (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel), and Aviv Regev (The Broad Institute
                of Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA).</p>
            <p>Trey Ideker, winner of the 2009 ISCB Overton Prize, was, like Miller, initially
                trained in computer science. His decision to move into bioinformatics for his
                graduate studies was taken for more ideological than scientific reasons.
                “I had been working for the defense industry as a college student, and
                then in my first professional job, and while it is fascinating to model the movement
                of flying objects, I didn't want to spend my career making bombs. I
                therefore started looking for alternative ways to use my computing knowledge,
                including in molecular biology,” recalls Ideker. A friend who was a
                molecular biologist in graduate school gave him the names of potential advisors, one
                of whom was Leroy Hood, co-founder of the Institute of Systems Biology (ISB) in
                Seattle, Washington. In 1996, and before the ISB was founded, Ideker moved to
                Seattle to join Hood as one of his first graduate students there. This move set the
                stage for a career that has already produced some groundbreaking work in the area of
                network biology.</p>
            <p>Ideker's graduate studies coincided with the later years of the Human Genome
                Project. “When I joined the lab, everyone there was working on sequence
                analysis,” he remembers. “I was working with a talented
                physician and postdoc, Pete Nelson, who was studying the pathways in cells that led
                to the development of prostate cancer. I started trying to model these pathways;
                this project fell on its face, as it was far too complex for a single graduate
                student, but the ideas it generated have become the basis for my whole
                career.” Working closely with Hood, he—while still a
                student—was one of the first to publish an integrated computational model
                of a metabolic network; this paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000375-Ideker1">[6]</xref>, published in 2001, has already been cited more
                than 850 times. With this very promising start, he understandably had many offers of
                positions as an independent group leader. He initially moved to the prestigious
                Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, before
                family drew him back to the West Coast. He is now settled at the University of
                California San Diego (UCSD) as an associate professor. “UCSD is a
                fantastic place to do science. I can't imagine being more productive
                anywhere else. The growth of biotechnology in the San Diego area in recent years has
                been overwhelming.”</p>
            <p>While at the Whitehead Institute and in collaboration with others looking at similar
                problems, Ideker further developed a prototype network modelling program that he had
                worked on in Hood's lab into what is now the widely used online tool
                Cytoscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000375-Shannon1">[7]</xref>. “We decided to pool our ideas and resources
                rather than reinventing the wheel,” he says. Cytoscape is now freely
                available under an open source license, and this has attracted a far larger pool of
                both users and developers than would have been attracted to a commercial enterprise.</p>
            <p>Ideker continues to be involved in the Cytoscape project, and since moving to San
                Diego his research has become focused on comparing networks between and within
                species. This work has already made important contributions beyond systems biology
                and has convinced Aviv Regev, his immediate predecessor as winner of the ISCB
                Overton Prize, of its significance. “Trey's work has epitomized
                the power of integrating innovative computational methods with cutting-edge
                genomics. His pioneering work has set a model for doing systems biology that has
                been followed by numerous groups and has impacts for understanding the evolution of
                biological systems and for treating disease.”</p>
            <p>In the 1990s, bioinformatics was dominated by DNA and protein sequences, with about
                95% of its effort going into sequence mining and comparison. Ideker
                believes that networks are at the next level of complexity from sequences and that
                similar techniques can and should be used for analyzing them. “It was
                obvious to me that we needed a searching and comparison tool that would be something
                like BLAST for networks,” he says. The PathBLAST program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000375-Kelley1">[8]</xref> does
                just that, and the ideas behind it have spawned a number of similar tools.</p>
            <p>More recently, Ideker has been turning his attention to medical applications of
                network modeling. He has compared the complete map of protein–protein
                interactions for the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>,
                generated using the yeast-two-hybrid method, against other eukaryotic networks, and
                proposed unique features of its metabolism that might be targeted in designing drugs
                against this destructive disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000375-Suthram1">[9]</xref>. He has also showed that grouping proteins into
                pathways and taking the average of the levels of each protein in a single pathway
                can add 8%–9% to the accuracy of prognostic
                predictions in breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000375-Lee1">[10]</xref>. And he is about to take his involvement in
                medical applications to a new level, as, in mid-2009, he takes up the position of
                head of genetics at a new institute within the University of California San Diego
                School of Medicine. “I will be moving from the periphery into the center
                of genomics-based medical research,” he says. “My vision is to
                integrate network analysis into medicine and develop useful clinical
                tools.”</p>
            <p>Ideker's career has already been marked by conspicuous success, and he is
                well-placed to succeed in this next challenge as well. He adds his Overton Prize to
                a list of honors that includes recognition by MIT's <italic>Technology
                    Review</italic> as one of the top ten innovators of 2006. The ISCB Awards
                Committee members couldn't agree more.</p>

            <p>These ISCB award winners will be joined by six other distinguished keynote speakers
                at the ISMB/ECCB 2009 conference in Stockholm, Sweden, in late June. The conference
                will also feature half-day special sessions on emerging topics, full-day special
                interest group meetings, highlights presentations of research published during the
                previous year with recent updates, technology demonstrations and workshops, poster
                sessions, an art-in-science exhibition, vendor exhibits, and several networking
                events. The conference organizers anticipate an attendance of more than 1,400
                scientists and are currently finalizing an agenda that is expected to offer more
                than 150 oral presentations. For the full conference program and registration
