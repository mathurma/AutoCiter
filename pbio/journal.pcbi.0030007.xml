Identifying these experimentally is very laborious, and the number of TFBMs discovered remains relatively small, especially when compared with the hundreds of transcription factor genes predicted in metazoan genomes. We have used a recently developed statistical motif discovery approach, NestedMICA, to detect candidate TFBMs from a large set of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> promoter regions. Of the 120 motifs inferred in our initial analysis, 25 were statistically significant matches to previously reported motifs, while 87 appeared to be novel. Analysis of sequence conservation and motif positioning suggested that the great majority of these discovered motifs are predictive of functional elements in the genome. Many motifs showed associations with specific patterns of gene expression in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> embryo, and we were able to obtain confident annotation of expression patterns for 25 of our motifs, including eight of the novel motifs. The motifs are available through Tiffin, a new database of DNA sequence motifs. We have discovered many new motifs that are overrepresented in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> promoter regions, and offer several independent lines of evidence that these are novel TFBMs. Our motif dictionary provides a solid foundation for further investigation of regulatory elements in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and demonstrates techniques that should be applicable in other species. We suggest that further improvements in computational motif discovery should narrow the gap between the set of known motifs and the total number of transcription factors in metazoan genomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In contrast to the genomic sequences that encode proteins, little is known about the regulatory elements that instruct the cell as to when and where a given gene should be active. Regulatory elements are thought to consist of clusters of short DNA words (motifs), each of which acts as a binding site for sequence-specific DNA binding protein. Thus, building a comprehensive dictionary of such motifs is an important step towards a broader understanding of gene regulation. Using the recently published NestedMICA method for detecting overrepresented motifs in a set of sequences, we build a dictionary of 120 motifs from regulatory sequences in the fruitfly genome, 87 of which are novel. Analysis of positional biases, conservation across species, and association with specific patterns of gene expression in fruitfly embryos suggest that the great majority of these newly discovered motifs represent functional regulatory elements. In addition to providing an initial motif dictionary for one of the most intensively studied model organisms, this work provides an analytical framework for the comprehensive discovery of regulatory motifs in complex animal genomes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>TAD is supported by the Wellcome Trust and CMB was supported by a USA Research Fellowship from the UK Royal Society.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Down TA, Bergman CM, Su J, Hubbard TJP (2007) Large-scale discovery of promoter motifs in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content>.

Computational pipelines such as that run by Ensembl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b001">1</xref>] provide automated annotation of most protein-coding genes, which for some genomes have been augmented by manual curation to improve the accuracy and completeness of gene sets: examples of this approach include the Vega database of vertebrate annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b002">2</xref>] and some popular model organism databases such as Wormbase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b003">3</xref>] and FlyBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>Annotation of other functional genomic features—notably the sequences responsible for regulating gene transcription—has lagged behind. Regulatory elements can be broadly divided into two classes: proximal or core promoter elements that occur close to the initiation site of transcription, and enhancer/silencer elements that act at distance to regulate basal levels of transcription. Both classes of regulatory elements consist of clusters of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b005">5</xref>]. This common architecture suggests that a first step towards regulatory element annotation should be to define a dictionary of motifs that reflects the full repertoire of transcription factor binding specificities. Classically, the binding specificity of transcription factors can be identified using data compiled from DNase I footprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b006">6</xref>] or in vitro binding site selection experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b007">7</xref>]; however, data of this kind is only available for a limited subset of transcription factors. For example, just over ten percent of 753 candidate transcription factors in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b008">8</xref>] have annotated binding site data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b009">9</xref>]. Moreover, in many cases only one or two sites have been annotated for a given protein, making it hard to build a reasonable model of a factor's binding specificity. Computational methods have existed for more than twenty years that can identify overrepresented motifs in a set of sequences (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b010">10</xref>]). However, the problem of inferring transcription factor specificity remains intrinsically challenging even for small, well-defined datasets of functionally characterized binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b011">11</xref>]. On a genome-wide scale, computational motif discovery methods have typically been applied to 5′ flanking regions of genes grouped by similar expression patterns, with the aim of discovering one or a few factors responsible for controlling coregulated expression. Applying computational motif finders to large sets of unrelated promoter regions from a single genome is a much more challenging task, and previous work in well-studied systems such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> has yielded only a relatively small set of core promoter motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b012">12</xref>]. If we aim to build a comprehensive motif dictionary for metazoan genomes, it is necessary to scale up the motif discovery process and identify much larger sets of motifs.</p><p>Here, we describe the application of NestedMICA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b013">13</xref>], a sensitive new computational motif finder, to a large set of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> promoter regions. Using this new method, we have so far discovered 120 distinct overrepresented motifs, including good matches to previously reported transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) as well as many novel putative motifs. An important feature of our strategy is that the dictionary of motifs is inferred purely from sequence fragments selected from a single genome on the basis of gene annotation (which itself is supported primarily by the alignment of cDNA and EST evidence to the genome sequence). No gene expression or comparative genomic data is used in the selection of motif-discovery input data or in the motif discovery process itself. The latter is particularly important since, in contrast to previous large-scale motif inference efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b017">17</xref>], it means we can assess the quality of the discovered motif set by evaluation against comparative genomic data. Such comparisons offer strong supporting evidence that many of the motifs we have discovered are biologically significant.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Inferring a Motif Dictionary</title><p>The first step in computational motif discovery is to define a good set of search regions. One strategy would be to focus on the most highly conserved non protein-coding portions of the genome, in the expectation that these would be enriched for regulatory elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b018">18</xref>]. However, we chose to avoid this approach, at least for a first round of motif discovery, since the use of comparative genomic data at this point would prevent its use as an independent source of information when we validate our discovered motif set. Instead, we took a more traditional approach of focusing on a set of presumed proximal promoter sequences. To do this, we extracted up to 200 bases of sequence flanking the 5′ ends of annotated genes on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> chromosome arm 2L, with some special treatment for very closely spaced genes as described in the Materials and Methods section. Large tracts of low-complexity sequence, such as mononucleotide and dinucleotide repeats, were masked using the dust program (R. Tatusov and D. J. Lipman, unpublished data) with default options. No other preprocessing of the sequences was performed.</p><p>In total, this procedure yielded 422 kb of putative promoter sequence from 2,424 genes. Seventy-six percent of genes have annotated UTRs, and we assume that we have obtained true 5′ flanking sequence for most of these. Many <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> 5′ UTRs are fairly short, with 66% of UTRs less than 200 bases long, so even for the 24% of genes without an annotated UTR, we expect that our set will include at least some 5′ flanking sequence in many cases. Less than 0.7% of promoter regions in this dataset contain a transposable element repeat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b019">19</xref>], so it is unlikely that motifs in transposable element sequences contribute strongly to the results presented here. These data represent more than a 2-fold increase in amount of sequence, and a 25% increase in the number of genes analyzed, relative to the primary dataset in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b012">12</xref>]. We also note that in contrast to Ohler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b012">12</xref>], who investigated motifs on the leading strand from −60 to +40 relative to the transcription start site using MEME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b020">20</xref>], we investigated the presence of TFBMs on both strands from −200 to −1.</p><p>Our motif discovery strategy was based on the NestedMICA method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b013">13</xref>]. NestedMICA is a probabilistic motif finder: it models motifs as position-weight matrices (PWMs) rather than as consensus sequences. PWMs are an established way of modeling the specificity of molecules that interact with nucleic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b021">21</xref>] and have been shown to be more powerful than simpler representations such as consensus sequences when detecting TFBSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b022">22</xref>].</p><p>NestedMICA infers multiple motifs simultaneously. This is distinct from many previous probabilistic motif finders, which have adopted a stepwise approach: finding one motif, masking its occurrences, then finding the next (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b020">20</xref>]). In this regard, NestedMICA shares affinity with methods that perform simultaneous inference of multiple motifs such as the Gibbs Recursive Sampler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b023">23</xref>] and CisModule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b024">24</xref>]; however, there are no published reports applying these methods to the genome-wide discovery of large numbers of TFBMs in metazoans. Simultaneous motif discovery is likely to maximize sensitivity (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b013">13</xref>]), and it also contributes to the good scalability of the method, since the program does not need to restart the analysis for each additional motif.</p><p>NestedMICA is also distinctive in terms of its inference strategy: while previous probabilistic motif finders have used expectation maximization or traditional Monte Carlo methods such as Gibbs Sampling to parameterize their probabilistic models, NestedMICA uses a recent and distinctive Monte Carlo strategy called Nested Sampling (J. Skilling, unpublished manuscripts at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys" xlink:type="simple">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys</ext-link>). This strategy was chosen because we have found it to be effective at finding globally good solutions to the motif-inference problem without requiring heuristics to choose good starting states (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b013">13</xref>]). Another interesting property of Nested Sampling is that it can provide reliable estimates of the evidence term of a Bayesian computation. Bayesian evidence has historically been very hard to calculate, but can be used to perform model comparison (for example, “is this set of sequence data best modeled by a 10-base or an 11-base PWM”) in a manner that correctly penalizes the extra parameters in more complex models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b025">25</xref>]. We took advantage of these evidence estimates in the refinement step of our motif discovery pipeline.</p><p>While the primary aims in developing NestedMICA were sensitivity and statistical rigor, we also worked hard to maximize performance and scalability. NestedMICA can run on large volumes of sequence data (up to several megabases), and while the run time on large datasets can still be high, this can be made manageable by running the program in a distributed mode that spreads the workload across several machines connected by a fast network. Depending on dataset size and exact configuration, NestedMICA can effectively utilize 10–20 CPUs.</p><p>Effective motif-finding strategies require an appropriate background model against which to assess motif overrepresentation. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> upstream sequences are known to have compositional biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b026">26</xref>], and it is important that the background model does a good job of capturing these biases. Many motif finders model the background sequences using a single Markov process or, equivalently, a single oligonucleotide frequency table. Where this strategy has been adopted, high-order Markov processes generally give the best results: Thijs et al. recommended a 5th-order (hexanucleotide) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b027">27</xref>]. However, such a model is complex (3,072 free parameters for a 5th-order Markov chain) and potentially hard to train: biologically meaningful regulatory motifs could be captured by such a high-order background model, preventing their detection in a subsequent motif inference step, and therefore it would be necessary to select truly nonfunctional sequences for background model training. An alternative approach is to relax the assumption that the sequence is generated by a single Markov chain. NestedMICA implements a family of background models where each base of the sequence is generated by one of several possible Markov chains. We call these mosaic models, since they treat large sequences as mosaics of compositionally distinct regions. We have previously shown that a mosaic of four order chains can better model mammalian promoter sequences than a single higher-order chain, while requiring fewer free parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b013">13</xref>]. We used a similar strategy here and randomly split the set of 5′ flanking sequences on chromosome arm 2L in half to give independent “test” and “training” sets, then used the training portion to optimize a range of background models—with between two and eight classes—using the makemosaicbg program from the NestedMICA package. The results were very similar to those shown in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b013">13</xref>], except that on these <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> sequences the optimal model consisted of six order classes. We selected this six-class model as the basis for our large-scale motif inference. As in the mammalian case, we saw classes modeling neutral, purine-rich, and pyrimidine-rich regions. We also saw <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific classes for A/T-rich, C/A-rich, and G/T-rich regions. There was no equivalent of the mammalian G/C-rich sequence class, which associated primarily with CpG islands.</p><p>For the analysis presented here, we inferred 120 motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030007-sg001">Figure S1</xref>, statistics also included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030007-st001">Table S1</xref>) from the chromosome arm 2L 5′ flanking sequences. The NestedMICA method currently requires that the motif length be specified a priori. For this initial production run, we requested 12 base motifs: long enough to represent the core length of most known <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFBMs. Motif inference, following the procedure under Materials and Methods, took approximately four weeks on eight Pentium IV processors (2.8 GHz clock speed). We have derived several other sets of motifs, from the same set of chromosome arm 2L sequences with slightly different NestedMICA parameters as well as also from other <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> chromosome arms. Using the motif comparison strategy described in the Materials and Methods section, we always see a large overlap between independently trained sets of motifs (unpublished data). Discovery and refinement of the motif dictionary is an ongoing process, and in the future we plan to scale up the procedures described here and explore strategies for merging overlapping motif sets to produce a single comprehensive set of TFBMs.</p><p>All the initially discovered PWMs were 12 bases long, but in many cases several positions towards the edge of the motif had very low information content, suggesting that the PWM was a model of an underlying motif less than 12 bases long. Therefore, we individually retrained each motif, following the refinement and trimming procedure under Materials and Methods. In 54 out of 120 cases, this led to a shorter final PWM. Finally, in six cases where we were confident that the discovered PWM correspondended to a previously reported, named motif (as discussed at length below), we chose to reverse-complement the inferred motif PWM to correspond with the previously reported orientation. None of our subsequent analyses are sensitive to motif orientation, so this manipulation should have no effect except in terms of motif display.</p><p>The motif dictionary contained many motifs with specificity towards A/T rich sequence: 54 out of 120 motifs preferred to match sequences that are more than 66% A/T. This was not due to inability of our motif inference strategy to find G/C-rich motifs: there are several motifs in the set with very strong preferences towards G/C rich sequences. It is possible that there might have been some bias in our inference procedure that leads to preferential detection of A/T rich motifs, but we doubt this explanation: noncoding <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> sequence as a whole is A/T rich (61.6% A/T on average across our set of 5′ flanking regions), so it would not be too surprising to find that many of the most common regulatory elements might also be A/T rich. Also, our background model was trained on the same set of 5′ flanking sequences and contains a class that modeled regions of sequence with a high A/T content. Thus, the overall high A/T content in 5′ flanking regions was accounted for during the motif inference process, which searched for overrepresented motifs relative to this background model.</p><p>We attempted to define an optimal score cutoff to use when scanning bulk sequence with each of our inferred PWMs. To do this, we scanned the training set of 5′ flanking sequences as described under Materials and Methods, and subdivided the matches by score. For each 1-bit score interval (bin), we assessed overrepresentation of motif matches relative to what might be expected given our mosaic background model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). We saw significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 in a binomial test) overrepresentation in high-scoring bins for 118/120 motifs, and were thus able to select a score cutoff. One limitation of this method is that its resolution is limited to the width of the bins used to subdivide the matches—in this case 1 bit. Narrower bins might help, but would reduce the power of the statistical tests used to assess overrepresentation. Applied to our motif set, this method suggested cutoffs between −1 and −8 bits relative to the maximum possible score for each motif. This wide variability implies that using a common threshold for all motifs would not be optimal, and also suggests that some DNA-binding factors might be more tolerant of variation in their binding sites than others. We use these suggested cutoffs in several of our subsequent analyses. It is worth noting that this procedure also indicates that all but two of our inferred PWMs are significantly overrepresented relative to the background model. This should not be surprising—overrepresentation was, after all, the criterion for motif inference—but it does give us additional confidence in the inferred motif set. It also suggests that the two motifs that weren't significantly overrepresented (TIFDMEM0000001 and TIFDMEM0000043) should be treated with some caution.</p><p>All our discovered PWMs are also available in release 1.2 of Tiffin, a database of sequence motifs. Tiffin can be browsed via a web interface, which also permits export of the motif PWMs in a variety of machine-readable formats: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://servlet.sanger.ac.uk/tiffin" xlink:type="simple">http://servlet.sanger.ac.uk/tiffin</ext-link>.</p><p>Tiffin assigns IDs to computationally discovered motifs in the same spirit as the IDs assigned to Ensembl gene predictions. As with Ensembl, the intention is to maintain IDs wherever possible as the motif collection grows and improves. We use Tiffin IDs throughout this paper when referring to specific motifs in our discovered set. A typical Tiffin ID is TIFDMEM0000040. This is made up of a database identifier (TIF for Tiffin), a three-letter species code (DME for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>), a one-letter object type (M for motif), and finally a numerical identifier. This syntax closely matches that used by Ensembl, and where possible Tiffin will use the same species codes.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Assessment of the Motif Dictionary</title><p>Given that little is currently known about the binding specificities of most transcription factors, it is difficult to evaluate whether discovered motifs are indeed authentic. Here, we consider four distinct lines of evidence: comparison with previously reported sequence motifs, analysis of cross-species conservation, analysis of motif position in the genome, and association between motifs and gene expression pattern. All four of these analyses offer support for a substantial fraction of our discovered motifs, suggesting that our motif-discovery approach can successfully recover motifs that are predictive of functional sequences. Alongside the comparison step, we also address issues of possible redundancy within the motif collection.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Comparison with Known Motifs</title><p>The pioneering study by Ohler et al. (2002) demonstrated the possibility of large-scale probabilistic promoter motif inference in metazoans, and generated a list of top ten motif PWMs that are overrepresented in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> core promoter regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b012">12</xref>]. We assessed whether this limited set of highly abundant motifs could be recovered by NestedMICA while simultaneously searching for a much larger set of motifs. To do this, we measured the divergence between each of the ten reported promoter motifs and each of the 120 motifs discovered by our strategy, using the divergence function described in the Materials and Methods section. We then searched the resulting divergence matrix for best reciprocal hits: pairs of motifs where each is the others' best match. This is closely analogous to the strategy used to define orthologous genes between two genomes. Finally, we assessed the statistical significance of each match by repeating the comparison using shuffled PWMs: the fraction of cases where a shuffled PWM can give an equal or better score gives an empirical <italic>p</italic>-value for the comparison. We found reciprocal best matches for eight out of ten of the Ohler et al. (2002) motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030007-g001">Figure 1</xref>), including well-established promoter sequences such as the TATA, DRE, and INR motifs. All eight of these matches were highly significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) In seven out of ten cases, visual inspection leaves little doubt that the motifs are essentially identical, while the final and most divergent case (TIFDMEM0000057 versus Motif 8) shows some differences.

From such empirical data, it is possible to derive PWMs that should be a good reflection of the binding specificity of the protein in question, at least in vitro. However, it is important to note that the motifs learned from in vitro binding of purified protein to naked DNA may not accurately represent those obtained from in vivo conditions. We expect motifs inferred directly from genomic sequences to differ slightly from in vitro sequences, and in some cases may better reflect the in vivo binding specificity of a transcription factor.</p><p>For this analysis, we used two reference collections of experimentally supported PWMs. The first is a set of PWMs we have learned from the FlyReg database of DNase I footprints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b009">9</xref>]. For each factor in the FlyReg dataset with at least five footprints, we attempted to infer a single optimal PWM using NestedMICA, as described in the Materials and Methods section.

This latter property should mitigate the effect of any potential errors made when setting score cutoffs for each of the motifs. We used this measure to compare each of the 25 known motifs in our set with the closest existing PWM from the three sets above. Inferred PWMs were scanned across the whole sequence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> chromosome arm 2L using the optimal score cutoffs we defined previously. We set score cutoffs for the corresponding existing PWMs using the same strategy, then calculated prediction overlaps for 22 pairs of PWMs (for three of the existing PWMs, we were unable to define an optimal cutoff). In 12 out of 22 cases, the predictions matched rather closely (<italic>O</italic> ≥ 0.5, and in three cases <italic>O</italic> ≥ 0.9). In eight out of 22 cases, 0.1 &lt;<italic>O</italic> ≤ 0.5. This still represents a substantial overlap, but the majority of predicted bases are different. This suggests that the inferred PWM in these cases might not be doing a good job of modeling the same binding specificity as the existing known motif, which could represent a failure of the motif inference process. Alternatively, these cases might also suggest the existence of a family of similar, but not identical, motifs—perhaps targeted by a family of related DNA-binding proteins. Finally, two out of 22 pairs show little or no overlap between sets of predicted sites.
				</p><p>These results confirm that NestedMICA can simultaneously recover many good PWMs from large genomic datasets, for both core promoter motifs and motifs for developmentally regulated transcription factors with characterized binding specificities. Nevertheless, 95 of the motifs we have discovered were not assigned to a known TFBM by this analysis. This result may not be surprising: characterization of a transcription factor's binding specificity is a complex and laborious process, and only a relatively small subset of known factors have been fully studied. Therefore, it seems reasonable to propose that many of the remaining discovered motifs will be good models for the binding specificities of as-yet-uncharacterized transcription factors.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Assessment of Redundancy in the Motif Dictionary</title><p>Our set of 120 inferred motifs contains several PWMs that are visually quite similar (for examples, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030007-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Since we are more confident of the non protein-coding sequence alignment between closely related species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b037">37</xref>], we concentrated on testing conservation between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> and two closely related species, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. simulans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. yakuba</named-content>.

We then stratified all the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> matches of a given motif by decreasing bit-score. In each bin, we calculated the fraction of sites where a prediction was present in all three species (score ≥7 bits for all motifs. This cutoff is less stringent or equal to the optimal cutoffs chosen for all but one of our inferred motifs). In many cases, we saw striking correlations between motif score and degree of conservation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030007-g005">Figure 5</xref>. While the most common pattern is for high-scoring motifs matches to be more conserved, in a few cases we saw a strong inverse correlation (e.g., TIFDMEM0000087), with the strongest matches being substantially less conserved.

A further 22 motifs showed significant underconservation, and the remaining 20 had little or no correlation between score and conservation. This does not conclusively show that they do not reflect functional binding sites, but does suggest that perhaps a relatively small fraction of the total matches to the genome are functional for these motifs.

For each motif, we recorded the number of matches in 100-base windows relative to the starts of all annotated transcripts. Many motifs showed nonuniform distributions relative to transcription start sites, but the exact distribution varied, with some motifs located very close to the TSS while others showed much broader peaks (c.f., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b026">26</xref>]).

It is possible that this mononucleotide frequency bias might explain at least some of the observed motif position bias, so positional bias is not in itself compelling evidence that a motif does in fact represent the binding specificity of a transcription factor. However, not all positionally biased motifs are A/T-rich (e.g., TIFDMEM0000026, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030007-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). It is also possible that causality runs in the opposite direction: promoters could be A/T-rich primarily because they are enriched with large numbers of A/T-rich motifs.

Functional annotation of motifs offers an extra line of evidence that they are biologically relevant, and may also prove useful in understanding the contribution that individual motifs make to regulatory elements in the genome. Previous work has attempted to associate discovered motifs with Gene Ontology terms or with microarray expression data for genes containing motif instances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b026">26</xref>].

For this analysis, it poses an additional problem: given a PWM match to bulk genomic sequence—especially in intergenic regions—it is hard to predict which of the nearby genes is the most likely regulatory target. We therefore focused once again on probable promoter regions: 200 bases upstream of each gene. We scanned 200 bases of 5′ flanking sequence for all annotated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> genes with all 120 motifs, using the score thresholds defined previously, then counted the number of times each motif was associated with each term in the ImaGO vocabulary, either directly or via the hierarchy of terms in the ImaGO ontology. For this analysis, we counted all co-occurrences, including cases where multiple matches to a given motif occur upstream of a given gene. We tested the significance of each positive association by removing the motif ID labels from all the motif match records, shuffling all the labels, then reattaching them randomly to match records. By repeating this shuffling process many times (in this case, 5,000,000 iterations) and recording the occasions when a given motif-to-expression association is equally or more abundant in the shuffled data than in the real data, we can obtain empirical <italic>p</italic>-values that describe how often each observed association would have occurred by chance.</p><p>The <italic>p</italic>-values calculated by this method are not directly useful, since we have performed repeated testing of each motif against each term in ImaGO. One way to correct for this would be to apply a Bonferroni correction by multiplying each <italic>p</italic>-value by the number of terms in ImaGO. However, such a correction would give an overly conservative picture, since many ImaGO terms are highly correlated with one another, so in practice not every test is independent. Instead, we performed another run of the association process using shuffled motif IDs rather than the real labeling giving an empirical view of the false discovery rate we would expect from this method if motifs matched randomly around the genome. For each of these two runs—real and shuffled motif labeling data—we found the lowest <italic>p</italic>-value for each motif, out of all the ImaGO terms.

Foremost is a set of associations between TIFDMEM0000040 and nine ImaGO terms that fall into two categories relating to the development of the fat body (fat body specific anlage, fat body/gonad primordium, embryonic/larval fat body, fat body, embryonic/larval adipose system, and adipose system) and development of the amnioserosa (extraembryonic structure, amnioserosa anlage <italic>in statu nascendi,</italic> amnioserosa). Since the fat body is mesodermal in origin and the amnioserosa is an extra-embryonic tissue, we interpret this result as two independent biological associations of the TIFDMEM0000040 motif with two independent sets of related ImaGO terms. As noted above, TIFDMEM0000040 is an almost perfect match to the PWM for the gene <italic>srp,</italic> which is required for the ongoing differentiation and maintenance of the fat body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b041">41</xref>] and amnioserosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b042">42</xref>]. If the TIFDMEM0000040 motif reflects <italic>srp</italic> specificity, the association of TIFDMEM0000040 with many genes is consistent with the hypotheses that <italic>srp</italic> activates a “large battery of early and late fat-body genes” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b041">41</xref>] and may function as a “selector gene” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b031">31</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>Finding regulatory elements in large genomes remains one of the hardest, and also one of the most exciting, problems in contemporary genome biology. Here we have shown that simultaneous probabilistic motif inference using NestedMICA can successfully be applied to large sets of unrelated promoter sequences in metazoan genomes. We have produced a dictionary of 120 motifs in an attempt to capture a significant fraction of the common promoter motifs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While our set still falls well short of the estimated 753 transcription factors in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b008">8</xref>], we expect that scalability improvements in the NestedMICA algorithm, and the use of larger datasets—should close that gap over time.</p><p>We offer several lines of independent evidence that support the validity of many of the 120 motifs discovered here. First, we find significant matches to eight out of ten core promoter motifs found previously in a smaller dictionary of computationally derived motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b012">12</xref>]. The two unmatched motifs were not expected to be recovered in our analysis of upstream flanking regions, since they have been shown to be preferentially located downstream of the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b012">12</xref>]. Thus, we can recover all these previously discovered upstream promoter motifs while simultaneously inferring a much larger dictionary. Some of these additional motifs in our dictionary are quantitatively and qualitatively very similar to experimentally derived binding transcription factors motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030007-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030007-g003">3</xref>), including matches to developmentally regulated transcription factors, such as <italic>srp</italic>. Together, these results demonstrate that running NestedMICA on large sets of sequences is an effective way of simultaneously recovering valid binding motifs for both basal and developmentally regulated transcription factors.</p><p>In addition to recovering known motifs, 87 of the motifs discovered in this study have no significant match—directly or indirectly—to any of the three reference motif sets used here, suggesting that NestedMICA can also discover novel motifs. We believe that a large proportion of these novel motifs are predictive models of functional sequence elements, as the majority of the motifs discovered here are either preferentially conserved (78/120, 65%, including 22/25 known and 49/87 novel motifs) or preferentially located upstream of transcription start sites (70/120, 58%, including 14/25 known and 50/87 novel motifs). In total, 106 out of 120 motifs (88%) are supported by at least one of these two analyses. Furthermore, many motifs are preferentially located near genes with similar expression patterns in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> embryos, and for 25 of these (14 of which were previously known and eight of which we believe are novel) we can make statistically significant associations to one or more ImaGO controlled vocabulary terms used to annotate the in situ gene expression atlas. A summary of the sources of evidence supporting each of our predicted motifs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030007-g009">Figure 9</xref>.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030007-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030007.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Summary of Lines of Evidence Supporting 120 Motifs Discovered in This Study</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030007.g009" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Integrating results from our study with previous analyses of promoter motifs in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b026">26</xref>] reveals that diverse computational strategies yield nearly identical sets of core promoter motifs, including classical promoter motifs such as the TATA box and INR. In addition, all three studies identify the DRE and E-box motifs, suggesting that proteins that bind these motifs play an important role in regulating a large number of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes. All three studies also consistently recover three uncharacterized motifs (TIFDMEM0000116/Motif 1/Dmv4, TIFDMEM0000091/Motif 6/Dmv5, TIFDMEM0000042/Motif 7/Dmv3) that are likely to be widely used binding sites for as-yet unknown transcription factors. Intriguingly, we find strong associations for all three of these unknown motifs (and for DRE) with ImaGO terms, including maternal expression. These associations support previous results indicating that the presence of these motifs positively correlate with female germline expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b026">26</xref>]. Moreover, we find one of these unknown motifs (TIFDMEM0000116/Motif 1/Dmv4) is strongly associated with multiple ImaGO terms, implicating a role in mesoderm and muscle development. Discovering the factors that bind these putative TFBMs may uncover new core promoter selectivity factors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The strong association of TIFDMEM0000040 with genes expressed in the fat body and amnioserosa demonstrates that we may be able to discover and annotate the function of developmentally regulated TFBMs in upstream flanking regions using NestedMICA in conjunction with the ImaGO controlled vocabulary. However, it is difficult to unambiguously interpret these associations as deriving solely from the <italic>srp</italic> gene, even though the TIFDMEM0000040 shows a best hit to the <italic>srp</italic> PWM, and <italic>srp</italic> is known to be involved in the development of both the fat body and amnioserosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b042">42</xref>]. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains five recognized GATA factors, which are likely to share similar binding specificities, as has been shown directly for two genes, <italic>srp</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b043">43</xref>] and <italic>pannier (pnr)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b044">44</xref>]. In addition, <italic>pnr</italic> has been shown to be expressed in the amnioserosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b045">45</xref>], and cells of the amnioserosa die in <italic>pnr</italic> mutant embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b046">46</xref>]. Thus, the TIFDMEM0000040–ImaGO association may in fact derive from a composite signal of both <italic>srp</italic> (in the fat body and amnioserosa) and/or <italic>pnr</italic> (in the amnioserosa). Likewise, all five GATA family members may contribute to the signal of TIFDMEM0000040 overrepresentation in promoter regions. This example highlights a general problem in any large-scale motif inference effort—resolving the many-to-one mapping of factors with related specificities to individual motifs—a problem that should be less severe in model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> that have fewer paralogues per transcription factor gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b047">47</xref>]. The discovery in our motif dictionary of a number of apparently similar PWMs that nevertheless match to substantially distinct sets of genomic sites suggests that computational methods may be able to distinguish between the exact binding specificities of related transcription factors, but this remains a topic for future research.</p><p>We acknowledge that our strategy of discovering motifs purely from 200 bp of 5′ flanking regions is a significant limitation: in particular we recognize that binding sites for proteins that interact exclusively with distal enhancer/silencer elements rather than proximal/core promoter regions are likely to be overlooked in this analysis. Underscoring this point is the fact that the majority of known motifs for developmentally regulated factors are not recovered here, suggesting that these factors do not bind preferentially to the 200 bp upstream of their target genes. Given the computational challenge presented by a whole-genome motif discovery experiment, we believe that the approach taken here is a simple and robust intermediate strategy for obtaining sequences enriched in a variety of TFBMs, and our resulting motif dictionary—including 87 novel motifs, eight of which have significant associations to embryonic expression patterns—appears broadly to support this decision.</p><p>Looking to the future, the most significant question remains that of how best to use a motif dictionary to scan the genome and to annotate functional binding sites. Simply scanning bulk DNA with PWMs tends to yield many false positive matches, even when using relatively stringent score thresholds. Searching for clusters of predicted binding sites has been shown to improve regulatory element detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b048">48</xref>], but does not itself solve the problem of annotating individual binding sites. It is well-known that comparative data generally can improve functional genomic predictions, and sequence conservation specifically has been shown to enhance TFBS annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b049">49</xref>]. At the time of writing, genome sequences are available for 12 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, so they should offer a good platform to investigate comparative approaches to TFBS annotation. Improving the specificity of TFBS annotation should reduce the false discovery rate when performing analyses such as the comparison with ImaGO terms presented here, and indeed such analyses may represent a good initial in silico test for new TFBS annotation methods.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Genome sequence and annotation.</title><p>We used versions 3 and 4 of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> genome sequence from BDGP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b050">50</xref>] and corresponding curated gene annotation from FlyBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b004">4</xref>].

We therefore performed multiple runs of NestedMICA with target motif lengths varying from four to 12 (otherwise using default options) and selected the model with the highest evidence.

In parallel, we exhaustively enumerated all words that could match the PWM with a score of −10 or greater, then calculated the likelihood of each of these words under the same background model we used in the motif discovery process. By weighting each word with its background likelihood, we can obtain an expected histogram of PWM match scores. For each score bin, we compared the observed and expected frequencies using a binomial test. We then picked a score cutoff equal to the highest score of the first bin that was not significantly overrepresented relative to the background model (significance defined as <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). In a few cases, the highest-scoring bins were not significantly overrepresented—generally because of a very small total number of matches in these bins—but slightly lower-scoring bins did show overrepresentation. In these cases, we skipped over up to two high-scoring nonoverrepresented bins and set a threshold based on the first nonoverrepresented bin following an overrepresented bin.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Construction of PWMs from DNase I footprints.</title><p>As positive controls for our analyses, we generated a set of PWMs of the binding specificity for developmentally regulated transcription factors characterized by DNase I footprinting.

To ensure that we observed a representative sampling of binding sites for each factor, we concentrated on the 52 factors with at least five reported footprints.

PWMs were built using NestedMICA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030007-b013">13</xref>], requesting a single motif from each set of sequences. Since we expect the concentration of true binding sites in the footprint sequences to be very high, choice of background model is less important than when learning motifs from bulk sequence, so we used a simple, uniform zeroth order background model.</p><p>Since we did not know the size of each factor's binding site, we used a similar procedure to that described under the Motif refinement and trimming section. For each factor, we performed several runs with motif lengths between four and 12. We then plotted the evidence for each motif length. In 30 of 52 cases, we saw a clear peak in the evidence plot, and used the corresponding weight matrix as the optimal model for that factor. For the remaining 22 cases, there was not an obvious peak, so we were not able to confidently choose a single model. This may be due to insufficient data (supported by the observation that the factors with no clear optimum had a median of 7.5 sites, compared with 18.5 for those with a sharp evidence peak), contamination of the footprint data with some false positives, or because a single PWM is not a good model of the binding specificity for that factor (perhaps because it binds in several different conformations).
