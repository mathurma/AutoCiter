        <p>The highly conserved translational control protein Dhh1 promotes mRNA decapping by regulating a late step in translation in yeast.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Translational control and messenger RNA (mRNA) decay represent important control points in the regulation of gene expression. In yeast, the major pathway for mRNA decay is initiated by deadenylation followed by decapping and 5′–3′ exonucleolytic digestion of the mRNA. Proteins that activate decapping, such as the DEAD-box RNA helicase Dhh1, have been postulated to function by limiting translation initiation, thereby promoting a ribosome-free mRNA that is targeted for decapping. In contrast to this model, we show here that Dhh1 represses translation in vivo at a step subsequent to initiation. First, we establish that Dhh1 represses translation independent of initiation factors eIF4E and eIF3b. Second, we show association of Dhh1 on an mRNA leads to the accumulation of ribosomes on the transcript. Third, we demonstrate that endogenous Dhh1 accompanies slowly translocating polyribosomes. Lastly, Dhh1 activates decapping in response to impaired ribosome elongation. Together, these findings suggest that changes in ribosome transit rate represent a key event in the decapping and turnover of mRNA.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Translation of mRNA into protein and turnover of mRNA are two points at which cells can exert regulatory control of gene expression, thereby ensuring that the protein products are present in cells and tissues at the appropriate time and place. The DDX6 family of DEAD box helicases, exemplified by the yeast protein Dhh1, is a group of well-conserved eukaryotic proteins that regulate translation and mRNA decay. As DDX6 proteins are known to be important for diverse processes such as cellular stress responses, early embryonic development, and replication of some viruses, understanding their mechanism of action could be of broad significance to many fields. Previous studies suggest that Dhh1 and other DDX6-family proteins mainly regulate translation at the initiation stage, triggering sequestration and/or decapping of the mRNA. Our work expands the potential functions of Dhh1, showing that Dhh1 is also capable of inhibiting translation at later stages when ribosomes are already loaded onto mRNAs. This extended function for Dhh1 allows a more robust translational control, as inhibition at a late stage of translation can provide immediate stoppage of protein production, as well as affording the potential for storing mRNA already primed and loaded with ribosomes for subsequent rapid re-utilization.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) is targeted for destruction in a precise and regulated fashion. In eukaryotic cells, the digestion of the 3′ polyadenosine tail (deadenylation) is the first step, followed predominantly by removal of the mRNA cap and 5′→3′ exonucleolytic digestion or, rarely, 3′→5′ degradation catalyzed by the cytoplasmic exosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Franks1">[1]</xref>. Decapping of mRNA, therefore, represents an important regulatory node in mRNA turnover and is, in most cases, both rate limiting and non-reversible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller1">[2]</xref>. In yeast, mRNA decapping is catalyzed by a single polypeptide encoded by <italic>DCP2. DCP2</italic> is conserved from yeast to humans, however it is becoming apparent that additional decapping activities exist in metazoans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Li1">[3]</xref>. The rate at which an mRNA 5′ cap is removed is highly variable, and although not completely understood, the rate of Dcp2-dependent mRNA decapping is modulated by a suite of protein factors that facilitate the binding and catalytic activity of the decapping enzyme itself. Moreover, mRNA translation is critical in determining the overall level of decapping and stability of the mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller1">[2]</xref>. mRNAs that initiate translation poorly are generally unstable and vice versa. The exact nature of the relationship between mRNA translation and decay is unclear, however it has been postulated that decapping activators may also function to promote mRNA turnover by monitoring mRNA translational status and/or promoting translation states that favor the decapping reaction. Of the many factors that influence mRNA decapping rates, the function of the DEAD-box RNA helicase Dhh1 most clearly ties mRNA decapping to protein synthesis.</p>
      <p>Dhh1 was first shown to be involved in modulating mRNA decapping in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Fischer1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller2">[5]</xref>. At the same time, it was determined that Dhh1 homologues function as translational repressors in a variety of biological contexts. For example, the <italic>Xenopus</italic> ortholog of Dhh1, Xp54, was identified as a component of translationally silenced messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Ladomery1">[6]</xref>. Moreover, the orthologous <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein, Me31b, is required for translational silencing of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA and is, therefore, a critical determinant in defining the posterior pole in the fly embryo during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Nakamura1">[7]</xref>. Subsequent studies indicated that Me31b also represents an important neurological factor through its regulation of <italic>CaMKII</italic> mRNA translation and association with the translational repressor, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Hillebrand1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Barbee1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, depletion of the human Dhh1 ortholog, RCK/p54 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Chu1">[10]</xref>, or <italic>Xenopus</italic> Xp54 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Weston1">[11]</xref> leads to general derepression of mRNA translation. Finally, the role of yeast Dhh1 in promoting mRNA decapping was suggested to result from its role as a general translational repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>. Together, these data demonstrate that Dhh1 and its homologues are a conserved family of translation regulatory proteins whose activity can lead to storage and/or destruction of translationally repressed mRNAs. Despite the widespread control on mRNA translation and turnover by Dhh1 proteins, the molecular mechanism by which it controls mRNA metabolism remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Several pieces of evidence have supported a model that Dhh1 proteins alter the association of translation initiation complexes with mRNA, thereby rendering the cap accessible to the decapping machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>. Consistent with this, a direct competition exists between the mRNA decapping and translation initiation machineries for the mRNA cap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Beelman1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Schwartz1">[14]</xref>. Specifically, mRNA decapping rate is enhanced in vivo when translation initiation is impaired either in cis or trans. Moreover, the major cytoplasmic cap binding protein, eIF4E, competes with Dcp2 for association with the 5′ cap in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Schwartz2">[15]</xref>. Thus, it has been proposed that association between translation initiation complexes and the mRNA must be antagonized before decapping can occur, a function that could be served by Dhh1. Two studies have provided evidence that <italic>Xenopus</italic> Xp54 complexes with the eIF4E inhibitor, eIF4E-T, thereby providing a possible model for how Dhh1 proteins could block eIF4E function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Minshall1">[16]</xref>,. In addition, experiments tethering Xp54 to an mRNA lead to the translational repression of capped mRNAs but not mRNAs lacking a 5′ cap or undergoing translation initiation using an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Cooke1">[18]</xref>. Lastly, recombinant Dhh1 inhibits 48S initiation complex formation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The observation that decapping activators, including Dhh1, Pat1, and Lsm1, can be found in cytoplasmic aggregates called Processing bodies (P-bodies) has also provided support for a model in which translation initiation is blocked prior to mRNA decapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Eulalio1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Parker1">[20]</xref>. P-bodies are proposed sites of mRNA decapping and degradation and encompass the full complement of decapping factors but are thought to be void of translation initiation factors and ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Parker1">[20]</xref>. In combination with the above work, this has led to a two-step model for mRNA decay in which deadenylation leads to the dissociation of mRNA from the translational apparatus and reorganization into a P-body where it is either stored or decapped and destroyed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Parker1">[20]</xref>. Importantly, the dissociation of ribosomes from the mRNA and mRNP remodeling have been hypothesized to be dependent on Dhh1 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>. Recent findings from a number of labs has, however, called into question the requirement for P-bodies in the translational repression and/or decay of mRNA, as these processes can be uncoupled from the accumulation of P-bodies in yeast and metazoans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Decker1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Sweet1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Under a common assumption that translation initiation is rate limiting for protein synthesis, repression of translation initiation prior to mRNA decapping would be predicted to result in ribosome run-off and decapping would occur predominately on ribosome-free mRNAs. In contrast, however, we have recently demonstrated that the majority of mRNA decapping occurs while mRNA maintains an association with polyribosomes, demonstrating that dissociation of mRNAs from ribosomes is not a prerequisite or general occurrence for mRNA decapping to occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Hu1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Hu2">[25]</xref>. Based on this and additional evidence, we evaluated a role for Dhh1 in mediating a translational repression event that does not promote the loss of ribosome and mRNA association.</p>
      <p>Here we show that Dhh1 functions in vivo primarily to repress mRNA translation and that its influence on decapping rate is predominantly a secondary effect. We demonstrate that Dhh1 inhibits mRNA translation in a manner independent of the translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF3b. Consistent with the observation that mRNA decapping occurs on polyribosomes, tethering Dhh1 to an mRNA results in the accumulation of ribosomes on the mRNA. Moreover, endogenous Dhh1 protein associates with slowly moving polyribosomes. These data suggest that Dhh1 mediates a slowing of ribosome movement that may be a necessary first step before mRNA decapping can occur. Consistent with this, we show that slowing ribosome elongation in <italic>cis</italic> stimulates mRNA decapping in a Dhh1-dependent manner. Together, these data support a model that decapping of mRNA occurs on polyribosomes that have been impaired in ribosome transit in part by the activity of the general translational repressor Dhh1.</p>

        <title>Dhh1 Represses Translation Independent of mRNA Decapping</title>
        <p>It has been extensively documented that Dhh1 and its orthologs are integral components of the decapping complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Simon1">[26]</xref>. Moreover, it has been observed that the homologs function as general repressors of mRNA translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Chu1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>. The precise role for Dhh1 in this process has, however, remained elusive but has been suggested to involve remodeling of translation initiation factors at a step before 48S translation initiation complex formation on the mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Minshall1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Cooke1">[18]</xref>. Due to the competition that exists for the mRNA 5′ cap between translation initiation factors and the decapping machinery, remodeling of the mRNP at the cap may be sufficient to explain the bipartite role Dhh1 appears to play in promoting both mRNA decapping and translational repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>. We wished to experimentally separate the two known functions of Dhh1 to evaluate the mechanism by which Dhh1 mediates translational repression and/or mRNA decay on an individual mRNA. Since little is understood about recruitment of Dhh1 to mRNA, we utilized a tethered-function approach to directly assay the functional consequences of Dhh1 binding to a reporter mRNA independent of its natural recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller4">[27]</xref>. This assay has successfully been used to dissect the role of numerous RNA binding proteins in a variety of biological contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller5">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Pillai1">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The bacteriophage MS2 coat protein alone (MS2) or a protein chimera of Dhh1 and MS2 (Dhh1-MS2) were expressed from plasmid vectors along with reporter mRNA harboring MS2 RNA recognition elements in its 3′ UTR. Three different reporter mRNAs were used in various assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The first, <italic>MFA2</italic>, expresses the unstable <italic>MFA2</italic> mRNA with 3′ UTR MS2 binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller5">[28]</xref>. The second and third represent <italic>MFA2</italic> and <italic>PGK1</italic> genes with their protein coding regions replaced by that of green fluorescence protein (<italic>GFP</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <italic>M/GFP</italic> and <italic>P/GFP</italic>, respectively). This combination of reporters allowed measurement of the consequence of tethering Dhh1 on both mRNA stability and translation (through protein output). We determined that Dhh1-MS2 was functionally active, as it was able to complement a strain deleted for endogenous <italic>DHH1</italic> (i.e. <italic>dhh1Δ</italic>) in assays for mRNA decapping (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>We first evaluated whether Dhh1 altered mRNA decay when tethered to the 3′ UTR of a reporter mRNA. Wild-type (WT) cells expressing either MS2 or Dhh1-MS2 were evaluated for degradation of co-expressed <italic>MFA2</italic> reporter mRNA. Importantly, reporter mRNAs are expressed from the regulatable <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, thereby permitting repression of reporter mRNA transcription and measurement of mRNA decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Beelman1">[13]</xref>. Cells were grown in the presence of galactose to induce reporter mRNA expression and, upon reaching mid-log phase, transcription was rapidly inhibited by replacing the media with glucose-containing media. Cells were harvested at indicated times and RNA isolated and analyzed by northern blot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>MFA2</italic> reporter mRNA is destabilized by Dhh1 tethered to its 3′ UTR. Specifically, the half-life of <italic>MFA2</italic> mRNA was reduced 2-fold by Dhh1-MS2 versus MS2 alone (3.4 min versus 6.3 min, respectively). Moreover, destabilization of the reporter mRNA required the MS2 binding sites, as <italic>MFA2</italic> mRNA lacking the sites decayed with a half-life of approximately 6 min, similar to endogenously expressed <italic>MFA2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Beelman1">[13]</xref>; unpublished data). These results establish that Dhh1, when associated with an mRNA through binding to its 3′ UTR, can accelerate the decay rate of the mRNA.</p>
        <p><italic>MFA2</italic> mRNA is inherently unstable and its degradation is particularly sensitive to alterations in mRNA decapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>. We therefore evaluated whether the destabilization of <italic>MFA2</italic> reporter mRNA by tethered Dhh1 was mediated through changes in mRNA decapping rate. <italic>MFA2</italic> reporter mRNA decay was measured in the presence of either MS2 or Dhh1-MS2 in cells lacking mRNA decapping activity (i.e. <italic>dcp2Δ</italic>). <italic>MFA2</italic> reporter mRNA in the presence of MS2 coat protein alone was dramatically stabilized by the absence of Dcp2, similar to previous observations for endogenously expressed <italic>MFA2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller1">[2]</xref>). In contrast to our observation in wild-type cells, Dhh1-MS2 failed to lead to destabilization of <italic>MFA2</italic> reporter mRNA in the absence of <italic>DCP2</italic>, and the decay rate was essentially identical to that observed in cells expressing MS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These results indicate that Dhh1 destabilizes mRNA through a step at or before mRNA decapping when associated by tethering.</p>
        <p>We next set out to evaluate if Dhh1 can function as a translational repressor independent of its ability to promote mRNA decapping. To facilitate measurement of protein expression, <italic>MFA2</italic> and <italic>PGK1</italic> reporter mRNAs were generated in which their ORF was replaced with that of <italic>GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <italic>M/GFP</italic> and <italic>P/GFP</italic>, respectively). Wild-type cells harboring either MS2 coat protein alone or Dhh1-MS2 and either <italic>M/GFP</italic> or <italic>P/GFP</italic> reporter genes were evaluated for GFP protein expression by Western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, Dhh1-MS2 caused a 50%–80% reduction in protein expression when tethered to reporter mRNAs as compared to MS2 alone. Considering the observation that tethered Dhh1 also promotes mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), one simple interpretation is that the reduced GFP protein level observed here is a consequence of reduced mRNA levels. To uncouple mRNA decay from a possible role for Dhh1 in repressing translation of the reporter mRNA, we repeated this analysis in the <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> strain, where tethering of Dhh1 did not alter mRNA decay rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In these cells, Dhh1-MS2 still mediated a dramatic decrease in GFP protein expression from both reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1D</xref>; GFP levels reduced 60%–70%). These data demonstrate that Dhh1 promotes repression of mRNA translation independent of promoting mRNA decapping when tethered to an mRNA, this is in agreement with recently published work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Carroll1">[56]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Dhh1 has documented genetic and physical interactions with the deadenylase complex that, as the first step in mRNA degradation, removes the poly(A) tail from the mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller2">[5]</xref>. To establish whether tethering of Dhh1 modulates translational repression by simply recruiting the deadenylase to the mRNA and thereby facilitating poly(A) tail removal, we evaluated the effect of Dhh1-MS2 on <italic>M/GFP</italic> reporter mRNA translation in cells lacking <italic>CCR4</italic> (i.e. <italic>ccr4Δ</italic>), the gene expressing the catalytic subunit of the deadenylase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller1">[2]</xref>. We observed that similar to wild-type cells, tethering of Dhh1 facilitated translational repression of <italic>M/GFP</italic> mRNA in cells lacking <italic>CCR4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001342.s005">Figure S5</xref>), demonstrating that Dhh1 does not accelerate translational repression through removal of the poly(A) tail.</p>
        <p>Finally, we established whether the function of Dhh1 in our assays requires a functional DEAD-box protein domain. Dhh1-MS2 in which key functional residues of the DEAD-box motif were mutated (DEAD to AAAD) was unable to reduce <italic>M/GFP</italic> reporter mRNA levels or GFP protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001342.s001">Figure S1</xref>), in contrast to our observations for Dhh1-MS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001342.s001">S1</xref>).

        <title>Tethered Dhh1 Represses Translation Independent of eIF4E or the eIF3 Complex</title>
        <p>Having established a robust assay to monitor the role of Dhh1 in repressing mRNA translation, we next set out to investigate the specific step of translation altered by Dhh1 function. Previous work from several labs suggested Dhh1 and its orthologs limit translation initiation prior to formation of the 48S pre-initiation complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>, possibly by antagonizing eIF4E binding to the mRNA 5′ cap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Minshall1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Minshall2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Minshall3">[32]</xref>. If Dhh1 indeed controls translation by blocking eIF4E function or 48S complex formation, loss of eIF4E or eIF3 function would be predicted to abrogate observed effects of tethered Dhh1 on <italic>GFP</italic> expression. Temperature-sensitive alleles of <italic>CDC33</italic> (<italic>cdc33-1</italic>, expressing eIF4E) or <italic>PRT1</italic> (<italic>prt1-1</italic>, expressing eIF3b) inactivate protein function and reduce mRNA translation to less that 5% of that observed in wild-type cells at the restrictive growth temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Welch1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Altmann1">[34]</xref>. Importantly, residual mRNA translation allowed by these mutant alleles is required to be able to observe changes in mRNA translation of reporter mRNA. We were unable to use GFP protein levels to monitor changes in mRNA translation, however, since the 1-h incubation at the restrictive growth temperature sufficient to inactivate eIF4E or eIF3 function is short relative to the stability of GFP protein (∼7 h) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Mateus1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, mRNA levels were used to reflect the translation status of the mRNA. This method to evaluate mRNA translation has been used previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Schwartz1">[14]</xref> and is consistent with our observation that the function of Dhh1 on mRNA is primarily at the level of translation, and that mRNA decay represents a secondary consequence of translational control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Isogenic wild-type or <italic>cdc33-1</italic> cells co-expressing the <italic>M/GFP</italic> reporter with either MS2 alone or Dhh1-MS2 were grown to log phase at the permissive temperature (24°C) and shifted to the restrictive temperature (37°C) for 1 h prior to harvesting cells and isolating RNA for Northern blot analysis. Growth of the mutant strain at the restrictive temperature resulted in a 4-fold reduction in steady state levels of both <italic>M/GFP</italic> reporter mRNA and endogenous <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA in cells also expressing MS2 coat protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 3). These data are consistent with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Schwartz1">[14]</xref> and demonstrate inactivation of eIF4E function under these growth conditions. Wild-type cells expressing Dhh1-MS2 displayed a 2-fold reduction in <italic>M/GFP</italic> mRNA levels compared to cells expressing MS2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2), consistent with the 2-fold reduction in decay rates by tethered Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Relative to MS2 alone, Dhh1-MS2 resulted in an approximate 2-fold reduction in <italic>M/GFP</italic> reporter mRNA levels in <italic>cdc33-1</italic> cells expressing temperature-inactivated eIF4E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4). These observations reveal that Dhh1 functions to robustly modulate reporter mRNA levels (through repressing mRNA translation) even in the absence of fully functional eIF4E and when translation initiation is severely abrogated, suggesting that Dhh1 does not function through modulating eIF4E activity.</p>

        <p>The <italic>Xenopus</italic> homolog of Dhh1, Xp54, fails to repress translation of a reporter mRNA initiated from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Cooke1">[18]</xref>. Considering that IRES-mediated initiation does not require the eIF3 translation initiation complex, we hypothesized that it may be the target of Dhh1 function in repressing mRNA translation. To determine if eIF3 function is required for Dhh1-mediated effects on mRNA, we utilized cells harboring a temperature-sensitive allele of the gene expressing eIF3b (i.e. <italic>prt1-1</italic>). Importantly, this mutation in eIF3b leads to a significant disruption of the entire eIF3 complex and its function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Phan1">[36]</xref>. In <italic>prt1-1</italic> cells at the non-permissive temperature, endogenous <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA levels are reduced approximately 4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 1 and 3), demonstrating reduced eIF3b function as observed by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Schwartz1">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>M/GFP</italic> reporter mRNA levels are insensitive to inactivation of eIF3b, suggesting that eIF3b is dispensable for the observed translation and mRNA turnover of this mRNA. Despite this, in eIF3b mutant cells Dhh1-MS2 was observed to still reduce <italic>M/GFP</italic> mRNA levels to approximately 20% relative to tethering MS2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This level of mRNA reduction is similar to that observed for Dhh1-MS2 in wild-type cells, indicating that Dhh1 function is unlikely through limiting the function of the eIF3 complex in promoting translation initiation.</p>
        <p>Finally, we tested whether Dhh1 could modulate mRNA levels or translation of a reporter mRNA when translation of the mRNA is restricted in <italic>cis</italic>. mRNA translation was inhibited by the inclusion of a strong RNA secondary structure (i.e. stemloop; SL) in the 5′ UTR of a <italic>PGK1</italic> reporter that has been demonstrated to limit 48S ribosome scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; <italic>SL-PGK1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Beelman1">[13]</xref>. The 5′ SL leads to reduced protein production from the <italic>PGK1</italic> reporter encoding a Pgk1-HA protein chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 3 where cells express MS2 alone). Indeed, when normalized to a loading control (i.e. ribosomal protein Rpl5), translation of <italic>SL-PGK1</italic> mRNA is less than 10% of the same reporter lacking the 5′ SL. In the presence of Dhh1-MS2, protein expression from both <italic>PGK1</italic> and <italic>SL-PGK1</italic> reporters was dramatically reduced relative to MS2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g002">Figure 2D</xref>; compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, Dhh1-MS2 also led to a substantial decrease in steady state mRNA levels for both reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). These results demonstrate that despite an impairment in translation initiation at the level of ribosome scanning, Dhh1's function in inhibiting protein expression (and subsequently mRNA abundance) is not abrogated, and is as robust as that observed for reporter mRNAs undergoing translation in wild-type cells or in the absence of impediments presented by RNA structure. Together, these data indicate that repression of mRNA translation by Dhh1 is not mediated through modulation of eIF4E or eIF3 complex function, or 48S ribosome scanning.</p>

        <p>To further investigate the step of mRNA translation inhibited by Dhh1, the association of reporter mRNAs with ribosomes was monitored.

        <p>Cell extracts were layered on sucrose gradients and polyribosome complexes were separated by velocity sedimentation. During fractionation, absorbance at 254 nm was measured and “polyribosome traces” were generated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Total RNA was isolated from gradient fractions and <italic>M/GFP</italic> reporter mRNA was detected by northern blot. The polyribosome distribution of <italic>M/GFP</italic> mRNA from <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> cells expressing MS2 alone indicated that the mRNA associates predominantly with between 1 and 5 ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In dramatic contrast, in the presence of Dhh1-MS2, the sedimentation of <italic>M/GFP</italic> mRNA shifted to a region deep within the gradient, consistent with heavy polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, Dhh1-MS2 did not lead to the accumulation of ribosome-free <italic>M/GFP</italic> mRNA detectable by sedimentation in non-ribosomal fractions 1 or 2, as would have been expected if tethered Dhh1 was inhibiting translation at initiation.</p>
        <p>The detection of <italic>M/GFP</italic> mRNA in dense regions of the gradient when Dhh1 is tethered is consistent with but not conclusive evidence that ribosomes are abundantly associated with the mRNA. To directly determine the association of <italic>M/GFP</italic> mRNA with ribosomes, ribosomes were affinity purified from cell extracts and the associated RNA measured by qRT-PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Halbeisen1">[37]</xref>. Yeast cells expressing a C-terminally tagged version of ribosomal protein Rpl16a (Rpl16a-ZZ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Halbeisen1">[37]</xref> were mutated to delete <italic>DCP2</italic> and then were used in subsequent experiments. Extracts were prepared from these cells expressing <italic>M/GFP</italic> reporter mRNA and either MS2 or Dhh1-MS2 and ribosomes immunoprecipitated using an anti-TAP antibody (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Visualization of co-purified RNA separated by agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed recovery of 18S rRNA from lysates containing tagged Rpl16a compared to an untagged control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The association of specific mRNAs within the co-purified material was measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to the level of <italic>U1</italic> snRNA, a non-translated RNA that associates relatively inefficiently with ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Halbeisen1">[37]</xref>. We observed that both endogenous and reporter mRNA can be efficiently co-purified relative to <italic>U1</italic> snRNA using this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, reporter mRNA from cells expressing Dhh1-MS2 is co-purified to a similar extent as MS2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; <italic>M/GFP</italic> mRNA; compare red and black bars). Importantly, co-purification of these mRNA targets is several hundred-fold enriched over that detected from similar experiments using lysates with untagged Rpl16a, indicating the specificity of the method (unpublished data). Our data suggest two important things. First, tethered Dhh1 does not lead to a large-scale dissociation of ribosomes from the mRNA, and second, the sedimentation of <italic>M/GFP</italic> reporter mRNA deep in polyribosome gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) must be due, in part, to its association with ribosomes. This latter observation is also inconsistent with the sedimentation of a large mRNP aggregate that lacks an association with ribosomes, such as P bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Parker1">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To more rigorously establish that the dense sedimentation of <italic>M/GFP</italic> mRNA in the presence of Dhh1-MS2 represents ribosome-associated material, ribosomes were affinity purified from cell lysates as described above, and the co-purified material then subjected to sucrose density gradient sedimentation. Gradient fractions were collected and the abundance of reporter mRNA throughout the fractions measured by qRT-PCR. The ratio of mRNA present in gradient fractions from cells expressing Dhh1-MS2 versus MS2 was determined. <italic>M/GFP</italic> reporter mRNA showed a significant overrepresentation in dense polyribosome fractions in the presence of Dhh1-MS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3F</xref>; fractions 13–16) and a coordinate underrepresentation in the remainder of the fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3F</xref>; fractions 1–12). This observation is in strong correlation to that observed for this reporter mRNA subject directly to gradient sedimentation and analyzed by Northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and quantified in 3E). The slightly reduced enrichment of reporter mRNA in dense gradient fractions in the presence of Dhh1-MS2 from cell lysates that were affinity purified reflects more efficient recovery of light polyribosomes over heavy polysomes by this approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001342.s006">Figure S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Halbeisen1">[37]</xref>). Notwithstanding, tethered Dhh1 causes the increased sedimentation of reporter mRNA in sucrose gradients and this material is clearly associated with ribosomes. Moreover, mRNA repressed in their translation by tethered Dhh1 appear to be associated with a larger number of ribosomes than during their basal metabolism and may indicate that Dhh1 functions to limit translation at some late step, perhaps at elongation, termination, or the poorly characterized ribosome recycling step.</p>

        <title>Endogenous Dhh1 Protein Associates with Slowly Moving Polyribosomes</title>
        <p>Our data utilizing tethered-function analysis to analyze Dhh1 suggests that the tethered protein represses mRNA translation at a step after initiation and that it inhibits disassociation of ribosomes from mRNA. We predicted that if endogenously expressed Dhh1 were performing the same function, Dhh1 should be found associated with polyribosomes. We and others have documented, however, that Dhh1 sediments with the soluble RNP in sucrose gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Drummond1">[38]</xref>. We reasoned that the association of Dhh1 with polyribosomes in cells with active decay machinery and minimal cues for translational repression (i.e. mid-log phase cells undergoing exponential growth) may be transient and difficult to detect biochemically. To evaluate this hypothesis, cells were treated with formaldehyde in vivo to promote crosslinking and stabilize Dhh1-polysome complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Valasek1">[39]</xref>.

        <p>For this analysis, <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells expressing a plasmid-encoded, epitope-tagged Dhh1 protein (HBHT-Dhh1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Tagwerker1">[40]</xref>) were utilized.

In contrast, after mild crosslinking, HBHT-Dhh1 is present in heavy sucrose gradient fractions, suggesting that it co-sediments with polyribosomes. Treatment of cell extracts with RNase A prior to centrifugation abrogates the co-sedimentation pattern, indicating that the association of Dhh1 with dense material on sucrose gradients is mediated by RNA contacts, consistent with its association with polyribosomes and its ability to bind RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Dutta1">[41]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Our evidence indicates that tethered Dhh1 limits translation at a step after initiation and increases the sedimentation of reporter mRNA in sucrose gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and wild-type Dhh1 is associated with polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that wild-type Dhh1 may also play a role in inhibiting ribosome elongation, termination, and/or ribosome recycling. In any case, it would be predicted that after a block in translation initiation, Dhh1-bound mRNA would retain a prolonged association with ribosomes. To measure the association of Dhh1 with polyribosomes after inhibition of translation, cells were treated with 1 M sodium chloride for 10 min prior to harvesting and polysome analysis. Exposure of cells to high salinity inhibits translation and results in ribosome run-off from mRNAs and loss of polyribosomes as measured by sucrose gradient centrifugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Melamed1">[42]</xref>. Even in the presence of low levels of formaldehyde, treatment of cells expressing HBHT-tagged Dhh1 led to a significant loss of polysomes, as anticipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Melamed1">[42]</xref>. Polysome analysis followed by Western blot demonstrated that HBHT-Dhh1 remained predominantly associated with dense sucrose gradient fractions after inhibition of translation by high salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, Dhh1 harboring a mutation in the DEAD-box that abrogates Dhh1 function in repressing translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001342.s001">Figure S1</xref>) fails to remain associated with polyribosomes under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, these data support that Dhh1 associates with polyribosomes and that it acts to restrict the dissociation of ribosomes from polyribosomes as measured by in vivo ribosome run-off analysis.</p>
        <p>To confirm that the association of HBHT-Dhh1 with dense sucrose gradient fractions represents its association with polyribosomes, ribosomes were affinity purified from cells grown in the presence or absence of salt stress. Consistent with the co-sedimentation of Dhh1 with polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), HBHT-Dhh1 co-purifies with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, after inhibition of translation with high salt, Dhh1 maintains an association with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), consistent with its co-sedimentation with polysomes by sucrose gradient centrifugation.</p>

        <title>Rare Codons in Reporter mRNA Accelerates Decay in a Dhh1-Dependent Manner</title>
        <p>The observation that Dhh1 functions to limit ribosome run-off is consistent with Dhh1 inhibiting a step in translation subsequent to initiation and perhaps through limiting translation elongation. Moreover, as a consequence of Dhh1 function, mRNA decapping rate is enhanced leading to accelerated turnover of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We hypothesized that inhibition of translation elongation by other means might also lead to a stimulation of mRNA decapping rate. To test this idea, a stretch of rare codons that restrict ribosome elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Hu2">[25]</xref> was inserted 77% into the coding region of a <italic>PGK1</italic> reporter gene (<italic>PGK1<sup>RC77%</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The rare codons greatly reduced Pgk1 protein expression to roughly 10% of wild-type <italic>PGK1</italic> reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001342.s003">Figure S3</xref>), demonstrating the inhibition of translation elongation. Importantly, <italic>PGK1</italic> reporter mRNA harboring the rare codons remains a substrate for mRNA decapping and 5′–3′ mRNA decay and is not targeted for No-go decay, as deletion of <italic>DOM34</italic> failed to significantly stabilize this reporter while deletion of factors important for 5′–3′ mRNA degradation significantly stabilized the mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Hu2">[25]</xref>. Transcriptional shut-off analysis of both <italic>PGK1</italic> and <italic>PGK1<sup>RC77%</sup></italic> in wild-type cells shows a significant destabilization of the mRNA dependent upon the rare codon stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Specifically, the decay rate of <italic>PGK1<sup>RC77%</sup></italic> mRNA is accelerated 3-fold versus <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA lacking the rare codons (half-life of 9 min versus 27 min, respectively).

        <p>If Dhh1 functions exclusively to inhibit translation elongation, the limitation of translation elongation mediated by the rare codons should bypass the need for Dhh1 in its rapid turnover of the reporter mRNA. We repeated the decay analysis for both <italic>PGK1</italic> and <italic>PGK1<sup>RC77%</sup></italic> in cells in which <italic>DHH1</italic> was deleted (i.e. <italic>dhh1</italic>Δ).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>All mRNA succumbs to degradation; therefore, decay represents a default state in mRNA metabolism. The spectrum of mRNA half-lives observed for different mRNAs and in different cell types represents the acceleration or inhibition of the default rate of decay. One major factor that significantly contributes to the overall stability of an mRNA is its translatability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Franks1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Jacobson1">[43]</xref>. Indeed, an inverse correlation has been established wherein efficiently translated mRNAs display longer half-lives while poorly translated mRNAs are generally unstable. Competition for binding at or near the mRNA 5′ 7-methyl cap between the translation initiation factor eIF4E and the catalytic peptide of the decapping complex, Dcp2, is consistent with the observed inverse correlation between translation and mRNA decay. It is therefore generally assumed that modulating translational initiation is a key event in regulating the rate of mRNA decapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Schwartz1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Schwartz2">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dhh1 and its homologues have been implicated as active stimulators of mRNA decapping through dissociation of the translation initiation complex from mRNA. Specifically, Dhh1 proteins have been proposed to block initiation by interfering with eIF4E function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Minshall1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Minshall3">[32]</xref> or with eIF3-mediated 48S ribosomal complex assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Cooke1">[18]</xref>. Our previous work appeared to support these ideas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> in combination with a second activator of mRNA decapping, <italic>PAT1</italic>, prevented broad repression of mRNA translation in response to glucose deprivation as analyzed by polysome analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>. At that time, glucose deprivation was believed to cause widespread inhibition of translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Ashe1">[44]</xref>, and thus, our findings indicated that Dhh1 was required, in part, to modulate this process. Moreover, Dhh1 over-expression mediated a loss of bulk polysomes consistent with a general block to translation initiation. Finally, in vitro analysis of translation initiation complex assembly indicated that Dhh1 inhibited 48S complex formation on mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Advances in our understanding of mRNA metabolism call for new interpretations to previous observations. Recently, Arribere et al. showed that glucose deprivation leads to rapid and widespread degradation of most cellular mRNAs, rather than a general decrease in translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Arribere1">[45]</xref>. The overall collapse in polyribosomes seen upon glucose deprivation is most likely a manifestation of this generalized decay phenomena. In our work from 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>, the <italic>RPL41a</italic> mRNA was used to illustrate that mRNAs relocated from polyribosomes to non-polyribosome fractions upon glucose deprivation and that decay was not affected. Indeed, as a ribosomal protein gene, <italic>RPL41a</italic> belongs to the small class of mRNA not degraded following cell stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Arribere1">[45]</xref> but does dissociate from polyribosomes upon stress. Further work from our lab revealed that mRNAs targeted for decapping are not devoid of ribosomes, but rather, decapping occurs co-translationally while the mRNA is still associated with ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Hu1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Hu2">[25]</xref>. These observations highlight that a fundamental change in the association of an mRNA with ribosomes does not occur before mRNA decapping as previously hypothesized, but rather that mRNA decapping is co-translational.</p>
      <p>Our findings presented here demonstrate that Dhh1 functions to repress mRNA translation, independent of any additional effect on promoting mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, Dhh1 functions at a step late in mRNA translation. Our data indicate that Dhh1 does not act through inhibiting eIF4E or eIF3 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Dramatically, when Dhh1 is tethered to a reporter, mRNA translation is repressed yet the mRNA co-sediments with denser polysomes that represent an increased association of the mRNA with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with this, endogenous Dhh1 associates with polysomes, albeit in a transient manner. Finally, we show using saline-induced inhibition of translation initiation that Dhh1-polyribosome complexes dissociate from mRNA (i.e. run off) slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that Dhh1 is a bona fide translational repressor in vivo and that its function is consistent with a role in slowing ribosome movement on mRNA.</p>
      <p>The function of Dhh1 in regulating translation post-initiation is consistent with phenomena observed in several additional biological contexts. First, two developmentally regulated mRNAs repressed on polyribosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, <italic>oskar</italic> and <italic>nanos</italic>, are inhibited for translation at some level by the Dhh1-homolog Me31b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Nakamura1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Cougot1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Clark1">[48]</xref>. Human <italic>KRAS</italic> mRNA is repressed on polyribosomes by let-7 miRNA in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Maroney1">[49]</xref>, and this repression is partially attributed to RCK/p54 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Chu1">[10]</xref>. Interestingly, ribosome run-off of let-7-targeted <italic>KRAS</italic> mRNA occurs more slowly in response to a stress-induced translation initiation block <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Maroney1">[49]</xref>, consistent with the repressed <italic>KRAS</italic> mRNP also being associated with slowly moving ribosomes. Finally, the documented purification of ribosomes with Dhh1 as well as its co-purification of translation elongation factor 1a in an RNA-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Drummond1">[38]</xref> support Dhh1 as a repressor of a late step in mRNA translation. Interestingly, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a polysome-associated neuronal RNA binding protein with interactions with Me31b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Barbee1">[9]</xref>, was also recently found to regulate translation by inducing stalling of ribosomes on target mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Darnell1">[50]</xref>.</p>
      <p>One potentially unifying theory of the data we have presented previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref> and our current findings is that Dhh1 directly affects the function of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Indeed, we and others have observed that Dhh1 binds ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Drummond1">[38]</xref>. Moreover, Dhh1 represses translation in vitro of an mRNA harboring the Cricket Paralysis Virus IRES, which requires only 40S ribosomes to initiate translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>. The context upon which Dhh1 binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit might affect which step in translation that appears to be inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Interaction between Dhh1 and free 40S subunits could influence translation at early steps and manifest as an initiation block. This mechanism might be occurring both in vitro and during Dhh1 over-expression in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref>. In the context of an actively translating mRNA, however, Dhh1 interaction with 40S subunits might impede ribosome movement on mRNA as we have observed and implies a role for Dhh1 in inhibiting translation either during elongation, termination, or ribosome recycling. Additional experiments will be needed to define precisely how Dhh1 functions mechanistically, but the two sets of data need not be mutually exclusive.</p>

          <title>A novel function of Dhh1 is to repress a late step in translation.</title>
          <p>We hypothesize that Dhh1 may function directly on 40S ribosomal subunits based on our earlier findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref> and the documented interaction of Dhh1 with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Drummond1">[38]</xref>). If Dhh1 were to function on free 40S subunits, the consequence would be repression of translation at initiation, as was seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Coller3">[12]</xref> (depicted in the left side of the figure). Based on our findings in this article, action of Dhh1 on already assembled polyribosomes in vivo would lead to repression of translation at a late, post-initiation step (depicted in the right side of the figure). Repression of ribosome movement could either be direct repression of ribosomes or possibly further consolidation of already slowed ribosomes. Repressed polyribosomal mRNA can then either be decapped or stored depending on the biological context and activity of the decapping enzyme.</p>

      <p>Our data here suggest that Dhh1 may also function as a sensor for slowed translation elongation. Reducing ribosome elongation rate by the insertion of rare codons in a coding region of a reporter mRNA renders the mRNA unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and converts the mRNA into a substrate for Dhh1-mediated mRNA decay. This observation indicates that the accelerated decay in response to slowed ribosome elongation requires Dhh1. Interestingly, <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> cells also demonstrate an increased sensitivity to three general inhibitors of translation elongation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001342.s004">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that in the absence of Dhh1, cells have a reduced ability to resolve the effects of a general inhibition of ribosome movement. The transient interaction of Dhh1 with polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g004">Figure 4</xref>) may reflect rapid sampling of polyribosome complexes by Dhh1, a common theme for biological sensors.</p>
      <p>The role of Dhh1 as both a sensor of slowed ribosome movement and a mediator of translational repression is reminiscent of the function of another ATP-dependent RNA helicase, Upf1, in the decay of nonsense-containing mRNA. Upf1 is required for the recognition of aberrant translation termination events and in response to this event, mediates both translational repression and accelerated decapping of the mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Isken1">[51]</xref>. For Dhh1-like proteins, one key regulatory event that may induce activity is removal of the mRNA 3′ poly(A) tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Minshall2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Minshall3">[32]</xref>. Deadenlyation leads to the loss of poly(A) binding protein (Pab1) association with the mRNA and dramatic changes in the translational status of the mRNA are predicted to occur at many different levels, including elongation, termination and ribosome recycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Searfoss1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001342-Cosson1">[55]</xref>. In this light, we postulate that mRNA decapping serves an important role, preventing further translation from translationally impaired transcripts.</p>

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001342-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, 20 OD<sub>260</sub> units were loaded on 15%–45% (w/w) sucrose gradients prepared on a Biocomp Gradient Master in 1× gradient buffer (50 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.0, 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 12 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT) and centrifuged at 41,000 rpm for 1 h and 13 min at 4°C in a Sw41Ti rotor. Gradients were fractionated using a Brandel Fractionation System and an Isco UA-6 ultraviolet detector. Fractions were precipitated overnight at −20°C using 2 volumes 95% ethanol. RNA/protein was pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, then pellets were resuspended in 500 µL LET (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM LiCl, 20 mM EDTA) with 1% SDS. Fractions were then extracted once with phenol/LET, once with phenol/chloroform/LET, and then were precipitated with one-tenth volume of 7.5 M CH<sub>3</sub>COONH<sub>4</sub> and 2 volumes 95% ethanol. RNA pellets were recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Pellets were washed once with 700 µL 75% ethanol, air dried, and resuspended in 1× sample buffer (200 mM MOPS pH = 7.0, 50 mM sodium acetate, 12.5 mM EDTA, 3.33% formaldehyde, 0.4 mg/mL ethidium bromide), and then samples were heated to 65°C for 10 min to denature RNA. The entire sample was then loaded on 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gels and Northern analysis carried out as above. For Western blot analysis of protein from sucrose gradients, fractions were precipitated with a final concentration of 10% TCA, pellets were washed with 80% acetone, then allowed to air dry. Pellets were resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled, and loaded on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels, then processed as in the section on Western blots.</p>
