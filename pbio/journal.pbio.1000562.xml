<p>It has not previously been possible to live image the earliest interactions between the host environment and oncogene-transformed cells as they initiate formation of cancers within an organism. Here we take advantage of the translucency of zebrafish larvae to observe the host innate immune cell response as oncogene-transformed melanoblasts and goblet cells multiply within the larval skin. Our studies indicate activation of leukocytes at very early stages in larvae carrying a transformed cell burden. Locally, we see recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages by 48 h post-fertilization, when transformed cells are still only singletons or doublets, and soon after this we see intimate associations between immune and transformed cells and frequent examples of cytoplasmic tethers linking the two cell types, as well as engulfment of transformed cells by both neutrophils and macrophages. We show that a major component of the signal drawing inflammatory cells to oncogenic HRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-transformed cells is H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is also a key damage cue responsible for recruiting neutrophils to a wound. Our short-term blocking experiments show that preventing recruitment of immune cells at these early stages results in reduced growth of transformed cell clones and suggests that immune cells may provide a source of trophic support to the transformed cells just as they do at a site of tissue repair. These parallels between the inflammatory responses to transformed cells and to wounds reinforce the suggestion by others that cancers resemble non-healing wounds.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The translucency of zebrafish larvae allows us to live image the earliest dynamic interactions between host innate immune cells and oncogene-transformed cell clones as they first establish themselves as the precursors of full-blown cancer. These early associations manifest via cytoplasmic tethers between an immune cell and a transformed cell, and occasional phagocytic engulfment. Immune cells are first attracted to transformed cells at surprisingly early stages, before transformed cells have had a chance to form clones and are thus still singletons or doublets. We show that the key attractant is hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which was also recently shown to be the essential early damage signal responsible for drawing neutrophils to wounds. Tissue transplantation experiments allow us to test which cells are responsible for generating the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> attractant, and we show that both transformed cells and their otherwise healthy neighbors contribute. Blocking H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> synthesis, either pharmacologically or by morpholino-mediated knockdown of DUOX, the enzyme responsible for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> synthesis in larval skin, very significantly reduces the numbers of neutrophils and macrophages drawn to transformed cell clones, and this results in reduced numbers of transformed cells, suggesting that innate immune cells play a trophic and/or support role in early transformed cell growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancers originate from one or a few clones of transformed cells that gain a growth advantage over neighboring normal cells, which, in turn, enables them to invade the host microenvironment and form a tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Vogelstein1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Hanahan1">[2]</xref>. Decades of research using various murine tumor models, as well as analysis of human clinical tumor samples, has revealed how activation of various oncogenes and/or loss of tumor suppressor gene function, can intrinsically confer a growth advantage on transformed cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Vogelstein1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Hanahan1">[2]</xref>. However, it is now clear that many host-derived cellular and molecular components can also influence this cellular transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Colotta1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Allavena1">[5]</xref>. In particular, there is considerable evidence that the host immune system plays a pivotal role in several conflicting aspects of cancer initiation and progression, both as a key player in immune elimination, to “find and destroy” transformed cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Raulet1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Grivennikov1">[8]</xref>, and as an active assistant that may aid expansion and metastatic spread of a tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Joyce1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Condeelis1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Nagaraj1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Inflammation is a crucial function of the innate immune system that protects host tissues against dangerous insults that are detrimental to tissue homeostasis, including wound damage and pathogen invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Medzhitov1">[11]</xref>. Acute inflammation, as triggered by wounding, is a rapid and self-limiting process: chemical mediators are induced in a tightly regulated sequence, and innate immune cells move in and out of the affected area, destroying infectious agents, and delivering growth factors and other signals that aid in repairing the damaged tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Martin1">[12]</xref>. However, when innate immunity goes awry, inflammation does not always resolve, and it is believed that chronic, “smouldering,” and often subclinical inflammation can be the root cause of many human pathologies, including cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Balkwill1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Karin1">[16]</xref>. Because of difficulties in predicting when and where transformed cells may arise in an organism, very little is currently known about the earliest events whereby host tissues respond to somatic cell transformation prior to the emergence of any sign of malignant progression. When does the host first recognize transformed cells, and how do they interact? Answering this question begs a model that allows easy live, in vivo observation of these events.</p>
<p>Recently, the zebrafish, <italic>Dano rerio</italic>, has emerged as a new model organism in studies of cancer biology, with many molecular and cellular components that operate during tumorigenesis in mammals seemingly conserved in fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-White1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Goessling1">[19]</xref>. The translucency of zebrafish larvae makes it possible for us to observe how the transformed cells interact with various cellular components of their host environment in vivo, and at high resolution. During zebrafish development, innate immune cell types emerge as early as 15 h post-fertilization (hpf) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Carradice1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Bennett1">[21]</xref>, and become competent to respond to infections and wounds from around 22 hpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Redd1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Herbomel1">[23]</xref>. However, it is believed that mature adaptive immune cells emerge significantly later, not before at least 1 wk of larval life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Traver1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-deJong1">[25]</xref>. This provides a further advantage, since it enables us to tease apart the contribution solely from innate immune cells to the earliest events of tumorigenesis, without complications from cross talk with the adaptive immune system.</p>
<p>In this study we have used oncogenic forms of Ras and Src to induce transformation of cells that reside within the larval skin. Our in vivo, live imaging movies indicate that these transformed cells activate and recruit host leukocytes from very early stages of development. We show that this initial recruitment of leukocytes to transformed cells is, at least in part, triggered by local synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This parallels the early damage signals that first draw innate immune cells towards wounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Niethammer1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Moreira1">[27]</xref>. However, instead of subsequent shutdown and resolution of the inflammatory response, as occurs following the acute wound response, the inflammatory response to transformed cells appears to amplify and progress towards that of a chronic inflammatory state as seen in chronic non-healing wounds. Inhibiting the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> prevents leukocyte recruitment towards wounds in zebrafish larvae, and we have found that it also prevents leukocyte recruitment towards transformed cells. Inhibition of leukocyte recruitment leads to a reduction in the growth of neoplastic cells, indicating an early trophic function for innate immune cells. Together, our data indicate homologies, at both the cellular and molecular levels, between the transformed-cell-induced host innate immune response and a wound inflammatory response.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>It has previously been reported that oncogenic forms of Ras induce malignant transformation of various cell types in zebrafish larvae, and lead to tumor formation in adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Santoriello1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Langenau1">[30]</xref>. A zebrafish melanoma model has previously been established in which the melanocyte-specific promoter <italic>microphthalmia-associated transcription factor a</italic> (<italic>mitfa</italic>) is used to drive oncogenic human HRas (HRas<sup>G12V</sup>, hereafter referred to as V12RAS) expression in melanocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Michailidou1">[29]</xref>. To aid easy identification and live imaging studies of transformed cells, this mitfa:V12RAS transgene construct also contains a <italic>mitfa</italic>-promoter-driven mCherry expression cassette. G<sub>0</sub>-injected animals develop ectopic melanocyte clones during the larval stages, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Michailidou1">[29]</xref> and, until the larvae become heavily pigmented, we can live image the interactions of the transformed melanocytes with the host environment. In this model, tumor nodules often form at sites where there is likely to have been local tissue damage, for example, the female pelvic fin (unpublished observation). Expression profiling studies carried out in this V12RAS-induced melanoma model reveal extensive up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes, for example, <italic>ifn1</italic>, <italic>il8</italic>, and <italic>irak3</italic>, in the tumor tissue compared with control tissue (P. Walker, M. Jones, S. He, C. Michailidou, N. Haud, et al., unpublished data), suggesting that inflammation may play a role during V12RAS-induced tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>The Presence of Transformed Cells Activates Leukocytes in Zebrafish Larvae</title>
<p>To investigate potential early interactions between transformed cells and the host immune system, we used transgenic zebrafish lines that have fluorescently labeled leukocytes. Several such zebrafish lines have now been generated and characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Renshaw1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Hall1">[33]</xref>. We first injected the mitfa:V12RAS-mitfa:mCherry construct into one-cell-stage <italic>Tg(BACmpo:eGFP)<sup>i114</sup></italic> (hereafter referred to as MPO:GFP) embryos with eGFP-tagged neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Renshaw1">[31]</xref>, and followed sporadic V12RAS expression in melanocytes and their precursors, melanoblasts. We observed a significant enrichment of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells adjacent to mCherry<sup>+</sup> transformed cells (26/28 larvae with ectopic clones) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) at 4 dpf. A similar association was not seen after injection of mitfa:mCherry control plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s003">Video S1C</xref>). Our live imaging of V12RAS<sup>+</sup>mCherry<sup>+</sup> melanocyte clones in MPO:GFP larvae revealed that MPO<sup>+</sup> cells mount an active inflammatory response towards even very few of these V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells and are able to engulf fragments of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s003">Video S1A</xref>). These data indicate that V12RAS-transformed melanocytes induce a host inflammatory response from the very earliest stages. In order to address whether such an inflammatory response is unique to RAS-induced transformation, or whether this is a more general host response to oncogene-induced cell transformations, we have used a v-Src model that has recently been used to study the interaction of transformed cells and their normal epithelial neighbors in zebrafish larval skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Kajita1">[34]</xref>. We use the same pBR-Tol2-UAS-GAP43-GFP-SC-v-Src construct to induce clones of v-Src-transformed cells that co-express GAP43-eGFP in <italic>Tg(LysC:DsRed)</italic> embryos. All the resulting embryos that have clones of v-Src over-expressing cells show active recruitment of leukocytes to these clones, both when live imaged to visualize neutrophil attraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1Ci</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s004">Video S2B</xref>), and in fixed specimens immunostained with an antibody against the pan-leukocyte marker, L-plastin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1I</xref>), which reveals all leukocytes. Again, there is no such recruitment of immune cells to fluorescent cells after injection of GAP43-eGFP control plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1Cii</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s004">Video S2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to determine whether this response extended beyond the melanocyte lineage. We continued to focus on skin as a model tissue by studying expression of V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells in another cell population that resides in the epidermis and asked whether these cells too could trigger a similar innate immune response. The zebrafish <italic>kita</italic> promoter drives gene expression in melanocytes and a subpopulation of mucus-secreting cells of zebrafish larvae from 24 hpf (<italic>kita</italic> expression pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Thisse1">[35]</xref>). In zebrafish skin, mucus-secreting cells are scattered throughout the epidermis as individuals and are analogous to goblet cells that have the potential to give rise to rare carcinoid tumors in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Pahlavan1">[36]</xref>. In the double transgenic line generated by crossing the <italic>Et</italic>(<italic>kita:GalTA4,UAS:mCherry</italic>)<italic>hzm1</italic> (hereafter referred to as kita:GalTA4) driver line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Distel1">[37]</xref> with the <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>UAS:eGFP-H-RASV12</italic>)<italic>io6</italic> reporter line (hereafter referred to as UAS:V12RASeGFP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Anelli1">[38]</xref>, larval offspring express oncogenic V12RASeGFP fusion protein in kita-expressing cells. The membrane localization of the V12RASeGFP fusion protein provided significant optical advantages for our subsequent live imaging studies.</p>
<p>Mucus-secreting cells expressing V12RAS exhibit abnormal overgrowth, as indicated by increased BrdU incorporation, in comparison to control eGFP-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1J and 1K</xref>) and gradually form multicellular clumps within the epidermis of the larvae. To examine how host leukocytes react to these transformed cells, we crossed the <italic>Tg(kita:Gal4, UAS:V12RASeGFP)</italic> double transgenic fish (hereafter referred to as the V12RAS line) with <italic>Tg(LysC:DsRed)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Hall1">[33]</xref> fish to obtain embryos in which lysozyme C positive (LysC<sup>+</sup>) leukoctyes are labeled by DsRed (red) and V12RAS-transformed cells are labeled by eGFP (green). <italic>Tg(kita:GalTA4, UAS:eGFP)</italic> fish (hereafter referred to as the eGFP line) were crossed with <italic>Tg(LysC:DsRed)</italic> fish to obtain control larvae that have eGFP-labeled, but otherwise normal, goblet cells, as well as DsRed-labeled LysC<sup>+</sup> cells. The live images of control eGFP larvae versus V12RAS<sup>+</sup> larvae at 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>) show that there are increased numbers of LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells distributed within the trunk skin of larvae with transformed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1D, 1E</xref> [dotted box], and 1L), indicating that leukocytes are activated by the presence of V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells in the epidermis.</p>
<p>To assess the responsiveness of all of the host innate immune cells, beyond just those that are LysC<sup>+</sup> (largely neutrophils), we stained larvae with an antibody against L-plastin, and, again, we observed a marked increase in recruited cells, this time including not only neutrophils but also macrophages, into the skin of the trunk region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1F, 1G, and 1M</xref>). Moreover, we found that leukocytes were often associated with V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells in these larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). A study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has reported that tumors can systemically stimulate proliferation of the host hematopoietic lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-PastorPareja1">[39]</xref>. To determine whether this is the case in our zebrafish model with the presence of V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells, we counted the number of LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells in V12RAS<sup>+</sup> larvae compared with in their V12RAS<sup>+</sup> siblings by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and found no overall increase of LysC<sup>+</sup> cells in V12RAS<sup>+</sup> larvae (data not shown). However, we did see reduced numbers of LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells in the hematopoietic tissue in V12RAS<sup>+</sup> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1Eii</xref>), where most larval LysC<sup>+</sup> cells normally reside at this developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g001">Figure 1Dii</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Hall1">[33]</xref>, suggesting that these cells are drawn to the transformed cells in the skin. Together these observations indicate that V12RAS<sup>+</sup> transformed cells induce an inflammatory environment that draws leukocytes to the skin and, moreover, that transformed cells also direct local recruitment of leukocytes towards them. To determine whether this inflammatory response is reflected by up-regulation of pro-inflammatory markers, we performed reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on larvae carrying a transformed goblet cell burden, and indeed we see increased levels of <italic>tnf</italic>α, <italic>cxcl1</italic>, <italic>il8</italic>, <italic>ifn1</italic>, and <italic>il1</italic>β in these larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Moreover, if we look by quantitative PCR (qPCR) at levels of two of these genes, <italic>il1</italic>β and <italic>cxcl1</italic>, we see their clear induction in larvae where V12RAS expression is induced by heat shock only 6 h before RNA extraction, suggesting that pro-inflammatory gene expression is a rapid response to V12RAS expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>

<title>V12RAS-Driven Leukocyte Recruitment in Larval Skin Is Analogous to That Triggered by a Wound</title>
<p>It is well established that tissue damage induces an inflammatory response and that innate immune cells are rapidly recruited to any wound site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Martin1">[12]</xref>. Live imaging studies using leukocyte reporter transgenic larval zebrafish have enabled detailed cell behavioral analysis of this in vivo recruitment of innate immune cells to wounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Mathias1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Cvejic1">[40]</xref>, as well as the subsequent resolution of these cells, which occurs over a similar time course to that seen in mammalian systems.</p>
<p>It has not been previously reported how innate immune cells behave when they first confront transformed cells growing in the host environment. Our investigations began by comparing the response of LysC<sup>+</sup> cells to V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells as they expand within normal flank epidermis, versus their response to a laser wound made in a similar region of the larval skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In unwounded eGFP control 4-dpf larvae, LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells migrate along the horizontal myoseptum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g002">Figure 2A, 2D, and 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s005">Video S3A</xref>) as though following a chemotactic guidance cue, with a highly polarized pathway (meandering index [MI] = 0.93±0.049, mean ± standard error of the mean). Laser wounds made to the trunk region in control larvae (without transformed cells) trigger an inflammatory response of similar intensity and duration to that previously reported for wounds made to the fin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Mathias1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Cvejic1">[40]</xref>. An average of 12.6±0.819 (<italic>n</italic> = 10) LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells are drawn to the wound, away from their normal patrolling route within 30 min of wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g002">Figure 2B, 2E, 2H, and 2J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s005">Video S3B</xref>). At early time points after wounding, the retention time for individual neutrophils averages about 60 min, but this decreases as the wound heals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). Subsequently, cells leave the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g003">Figure 3D–3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s006">Video S4</xref>), mirroring the previously reported retrograde migration of neutrophils from wound back to the blood vessel they initially came from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Mathias1">[32]</xref>. In equivalent stage larvae with clones of V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells growing in the epidermis, we observe many more LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells in the flank region than in control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g002">Figure 2C and 2J</xref>). LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells are distracted from their normal patrolling path and turn towards where the V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells are distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g002">Figure 2F and 2I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s005">Video S3C</xref>). Once in the V12RAS<sup>+</sup>-cell-enriched area, LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells change their direction more frequently, approximating the behavior of neutrophils at a wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g002">Figure 2K</xref>, MI = 0.55±0.072), as a consequence of moving between individual V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cell clones. They often make contact with V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells and slow down in their proximity and then migrate away again toward another V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cell clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g002">Figure 2F and 2I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s005">Video S3C</xref>); the total footprint of leukocytes almost entirely covers the locations of V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The random walk behavior exhibited by LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells within V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cell territory, and their retrograde migration to and from individual V12RAS<sup>+</sup> clones is similar to that of LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells responding to a wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g002">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s005">Video S3B</xref>). Our data indicate that transformed cell clones growing at early stages in the epidermis induce an inflammatory response and that leukocytes are recruited to the vicinity of transformed cells in a similar manner to that seen when innate immune cells sense, and are drawn towards, wounds.</p>

<title>Leukocytes Detect V12RAS<sup>+</sup> Cells from Very Early Stages</title>

<title>The Expansion of V12RAS<sup>+</sup> Clones Induces an Incremental Increase in Inflammatory Response That Fails to Resolve</title>
<p>To assess how the host inflammatory response changes as tumor expansion proceeds, we crossed V12RAS<sup>+</sup>/Fli:eGFP<sup>+</sup> fish with <italic>Tg(LysC:DsRed)</italic> and chose larvae at 4–5 dpf that had already developed more than 15 V12RAS<sup>+</sup> clones within the skin of one side of the flank, but with no more than 15 cells in any one individual clone. These clones we refer to as “early developmental” stage clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s007">Video S5B</xref>). Our time-lapse movies revealed that the most significant change in inflammatory cell behavior as transformed cell clones expand is a prolonged retention time (11.15±1.69 min) at any one clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). LysC<sup>+</sup> cells in V12RAS<sup>+</sup> clone territory at the “early developmental” stage continue to actively move between individual V12RAS<sup>+</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s007">Video S5B</xref>). The MI of these cells remains similar (MI = 0.55±0.057) to that in response to the “initial stage” V12RAS<sup>+</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g003">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we examined larvae that exhibited more than 30 V12RAS<sup>+</sup> clones, with at least one clone on the flank of each fish consisting of more than 30 V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells (defined in this study as “late developmental” stage, which generally occurred when larvae were between 6 and 8 dpf), to analyze the host response to more advanced transformed cell groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

Once recruited, leukocytes actively exhibit dynamic and intimate contacts with V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells.

When a leukocyte moves away from a V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cell, it generally leaves a “tether” linking leukocyte and V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cell; these tethers can be largely transformed-cell-derived, or occasionally have equal contributions from immune cell and transformed cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s011">Video S9</xref>).

<title>Neutrophils and Macrophages Show Distinctive Engulfment Behaviors</title>
<p>Activated innate immune cells are known to engulf both cell debris and invading pathogens at sites of tissue damage and infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Herbomel1">[23]</xref>. In our time-lapse movies we observe active phagocytosis by all of the LysC<sup>+</sup> cells and tissue residential macrophages in the presence of V12RAS<sup>+</sup> clones. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the different leukocyte lineages engulf in different ways. LysC<sup>+</sup> cells (neutrophils) appear to extend membrane protrusions and break off small fragments of V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g005">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s012">Video S10</xref>), whereas macrophages are able to deform themselves to engulf a whole cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g005">Figure 5E and 5F</xref>). The consequences of these two phagocytic modes is most clearly indicated by L-plastin staining of tissues, which reveals that cells labeled by L-plastin, but not MPO:GFP (i.e. macrophages), contain larger aggregates of engulfed RFP-tagged (V12RAS<sup>+</sup>) material resembling intact cells, while MPO<sup>+</sup> cells (neutrophils) contain only smaller fragments of engulfed V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g005">Figure 5G and 5H</xref>).

<title>V12RAS<sup>+</sup> Cells Trigger an Increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production, Which Leads to Leukocyte Recruitment</title>
<p>Our time-lapse observations suggest that early recruitment of innate immune cells towards V12RAS-transformed cells in the larval epidermis may be similar to the wound inflammatory response. We next wanted to know how V12RAS<sup>+</sup> transformed cells might attract the attention of host innate immune cells, and whether there were parallels between the two types of inflammatory triggers—wounding and the presence of transformed cells. A recent study showed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is released after wounding of zebrafish larvae and that the consequent gradient of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is required for leukocyte recruitment towards the wound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Niethammer1">[26]</xref>. We wanted to test whether V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cell growth in the epidermis might utilize the same signal to activate immune cells. We soaked larvae in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific probe acetyl-pentafluorobenzene sulphonyl fluorescein (which is converted to its fluorescent form when exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Soh1">[51]</xref> for 30 min prior to imaging. The efficiency of this reporter dye was confirmed by imaging the transiently increased levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at wound edges of control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g006">Figure 6Ai</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Niethammer1">[26]</xref>). We observed slightly increased levels of fluorescent signal throughout V12RAS<sup>+</sup> larval flank skin as compared with control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g006">Figure 6Aii and 6Aiii</xref>). But more dramatically, our time-lapse studies revealed stochastic and transient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the vicinity of V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells and their immediately neighboring normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g006">Figure 6B–6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s013">Video S11</xref>), and this transient increase of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signal generally appears to precede the recruitment of several LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells toward the V12RAS<sup>+</sup> clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g006">Figure 6B–6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s013">Video S11</xref>). These data indicate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could play a role in V12RAS<sup>+</sup>-induced leukocyte recruitment. To complement this real time approach to imaging H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> flux in the neighborhood of transformed cells, we also utilized an immuno-spin trap technique that reports a history of ROS exposure by accumulation of 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) protein adduct wherever protein-centered radicals are generated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-GomezMejiba1">[52]</xref>; incubation of larvae in medium containing DMPO for 6 h and subsequent immunostaining for DMPO indicates a “mist” of ROS modification around all V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells but none adjacent to control eGFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g006">Figure 6E and 6F</xref>).</p>

<p>To test whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is indeed required for leukocyte recruitment to transformed cells, we used a pan-NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), which has previously been shown to block H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in wounded zebrafish larvae, and thus prevent leukocyte wound recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Niethammer1">[26]</xref>.

These data suggest that SOD conversion of O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is not required for transformed cell recruitment of leukocytes.</p>
<p>In zebrafish larvae, the sole NOX that can generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> independently of SOD is DUOX, and morpholino knockdown of DUOX has been shown to prevent recruitment of neutrophils to wounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Niethammer1">[26]</xref>. We used morpholinos to knock down zebrafish DUOX by blocking pre-mRNA splicing and showed by RT-PCR that this knockdown extended at least until 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Immuno-spin trap analysis of such morphant embryos revealed a much reduced “mist” of ROS modified proteins adjacent to V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g006">Figure 6G</xref>), indicating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation had successfully been blocked. Analysis showed that leukocyte recruitment to V12RAS<sup>+</sup> clones in DUOX morphant larvae appeared similar to that in DPI-treated larvae, with a much reduced number of LysC:DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells seen migrating within the epidermis and very few of these cells passing close to V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g006">Figure 6K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000562.s014">Video S12D</xref>). For both DPI and DUOX morpholino treatments, leukocytes otherwise exhibit entirely normal motility; for example, their migration along the horizontal myoseptum is unperturbed. Together these data indicate that where V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells are growing in the host epidermis, increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is the primary signal drawing leukocytes to the locale of these transformed cells, just as is the case for recruitment of inflammatory cells to wounds. But these experiments alone do not reveal whether it is the transformed cells themselves or their immediate disturbed neighbors that generate the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signal.</p>

<title>Blocking the Host Inflammatory Response to Oncogene-Transformed Cells Leads to Reduced Transformed Cell Numbers</title>
<p>Having revealed that innate immune cells are actively recruited from very early stages to sites of oncogene-transformed cells, and that they extensively interact with them, we sought to test the outcome of these interactions by preventing contact between these cells. We have done this in three complementary ways. First, we used morpholino knockdown of pu.1, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Rhodes1">[55]</xref>, to transiently block the differentiation of myeloid lineage cells; in such larvae, myeloid cells are delayed from appearance until 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Rhodes1">[55]</xref> and our own observations). This approach directly tests the requirement of innate immune cells for growth of transformed cell clones. Second, we used a chronic exposure to the pan-NOX inhibitor DPI (36–60 hpf). And, third, we again generated DUOX morphants to specifically block the attractant signal. The latter two strategies carry the proviso that they may also influence V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation directly because of potential ROS requirements for RAS-transformed cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Weinberg1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Hole1">[57]</xref>.

To test whether this reduction in numbers of transformed cells in the absence of immune cell recruitment is a consequence of increased apoptosis or reduced proliferative index, or both, we have immunostained for the cleaved (active) form of caspase 3, which indicates almost no apoptosis in either pu.1 morphant or control transformed cells over this period (data not shown), but we do see a significant reduction in the proliferative index of transformed cells, as revealed by 6-h BrdU incorporation rate, from 76% in control V12RAS<sup>+</sup> larvae (<italic>n</italic> = 21) to 59% in pu.1 V12RAS<sup>+</sup> morphants (<italic>n</italic> = 33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000562-g008">Figure 8H</xref>), suggesting that the immune cell trophic signal operates by enhancing cell proliferation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cancer progression begins when a transformed cell overgrows within otherwise healthy normal tissue; this cell must then somehow escape host immunosurveillance and subsequently hijack the neighboring tissue architecture to parasitize the host. Finally, it may seed off metastatic offspring that will invade other sites of the body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Hanahan1">[2]</xref>. All of these steps involve intimate interactions with the host tissues, and several steps will inevitably involve interactions with, or avoidance of, the host innate immune system, which functions both as a potential “surveillance” mechanism via immune elimination but also as a source of cells that might be subverted to suppress anti-tumor immunity and aid tumor progression and spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Colotta1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Bui1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Grivennikov1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-deVisser1">[58]</xref>. In mammals there is good evidence suggesting that several subtypes of bone-marrow-derived myeloid lineages have a direct role in promoting the establishment of a microenvironment that enables, or even encourages, tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Mantovani2">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-OstrandRosenberg1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Zumsteg1">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>Multiphoton imaging studies in mouse tumor models have revealed that tumor-associated macrophages directly interact with cells of later stage tumors and can function as “pilots” to guide individual tumor cells away from the primary cancer to nearby vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Condeelis1">[9]</xref>. More recently, in a murine lung metastasis tumor model, ex vivo live imaging of intact lungs revealed that macrophages are required for efficient tumor cell extravasation at the site of metastasis exit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Qian1">[61]</xref>. However, in mouse it is much less easy to investigate the earliest host cellular response toward genetically aberrant cells as the cells first emerge in otherwise normal tissue.</p>
<p>In the current study, we have taken advantage of the translucency of zebrafish larvae to reveal the dynamics of these very early interactions (that we describe as developmental stages) between host innate immune cells and the early transformed precursors of tumors. Since the first T cells are not born until 2 wk post-fertilization in zebrafish, and mature T cells appear even later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Traver1">[24]</xref>, we are studying a time window in zebrafish larval development when the function of innate immune cells can be observed without interference from adaptive immunity, which, at later stages, will almost certainly play further roles in cancer progression.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Transformed Cells Are Rapidly Sensed by Innate Immune Cells</title>
<p>What is immediately clear from our studies is the very early onset of an innate immune response toward transformed cells, almost as soon as the oncogenic transformation has commenced in otherwise normal tissue. Two distinct transformed lineages (melanocytes and goblet cells) are seen to recruit both neutrophils and macrophages (and potentially other leukocytic lineages) at stages as early as when clones consist of only singletons or doublets. These data indicate that oncogene-transformed cells, even as individuals, can emit cues that, directly or indirectly, trigger a host innate immune cell inflammatory response.</p>
<p>Many clinical studies show that pro-inflammatory factors are elevated in the serum of cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Ancrile1">[62]</xref>. Studies in mouse models have also shown that oncogene-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines can act as a paracrine signal that might promote an inflammatory microenvironment in the surrounding tumor stroma, which in turn drives tumor growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Ancrile1">[62]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Hernandez1">[63]</xref>. We have also found in our V12RAS-driven zebrafish melanoma model that many pro-inflammatory factors are up-regulated in established tumor tissues (P. Walker, M. Jones, S. He, C. Michailidou, N. Haud, et al., unpublished data). Importantly, we also see up-regulation of pro-inflammatory factors in the early stage larvae, even before establishment of a mature tumor, suggesting that pro-inflammatory factors may play some role in regulating the initial phase of an oncogene-driven inflammatory response by paracrine mechanisms.</p>

<title>A Central Role for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a Regulator of Inflammatory Responses to Epithelial Tissue Insults</title>
<p>An immediate question that arises from our in vivo observation concerns the nature of the signal(s) that direct leukocyte recruitment. Our data suggest that the key signal regulating leukocyte activation and recruitment towards transformed cells is DUOX-mediated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, which is also the immediate damage signal that attracts neutrophils to wounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Niethammer1">[26]</xref>. Studies in mammalian airway epithelium also suggest a regulatory role for enhanced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the host innate immune response to diverse bacterial triggers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Koff1">[64]</xref>. Thus, enhanced production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> might be a universal mechanism used by the host to sense the disruption of tissue homeostasis by various insults and to activate the appropriate innate immune response. The current data indicate that in this instance, DUOX is the major contributor to the synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at sites where V12RAS-transformed cells are dividing but clearly other NOXes may also contribute and, indeed, may play more significant roles where other cell lineages or transforming oncogenes are involved.</p>
<p>Our transplantation experiments show that both oncogene-transformed cells and their disrupted neighbors contribute to the signal that attracts immune cells to these sites. It has previously been shown that oncogenic RAS-transformed cells suffer ROS stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Moiseeva1">[65]</xref>, but what is not clear is how individual malignant cells disrupt tissue homeostasis in order to trigger otherwise healthy, epithelial neighbors to do likewise. Perhaps, the upstream signal that directs DUOX activation in these cells is the same as that which triggers H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> synthesis by wound edge epithelial cells and will turn out to be a generic, rapid response to tissue disruption. In a wound scenario, any NOXes must already be expressed so that tissue damage merely triggers their activation. However, there is evidence that colon cancer cells up-regulate NOX1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Laurent1">[66]</xref>, and so it is possible that DUOX is up-regulated by transformed cells in our fish model also, although our qPCR data would suggest that this is not the case (data not shown), and recent studies indicate that DUOX is constitutively expressed in zebrafish larval mucosal epithelia, including epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Flores1">[67]</xref>. Also entirely unclear is how leukocytes might read the chemotactic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signal or some downstream consequence of it. There is no known receptor for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but potentially H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> gradients might be “read” via intracellular sensors such as phosphatases that subsequently regulate the chemotactic response. Indeed, one such phosphatase, PTEN, which is known to have a pivotal role in cell migration, is modulated by exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Lee1">[68]</xref>, and other phosphatases clearly have an impact on growth factor signaling and might alter the chemotactic response in this way also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Juarez1">[69]</xref>. Alternatively, there may be other extracellular (or intracellular) substrates that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> modifies in some way to convert them into chemotactic factors or other modulators of cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Lambeth1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-CookMills1">[70]</xref>, and the genetic tractability of zebrafish offers good opportunities to uncover such mechanisms.</p>

<title>Unpicking the Roles of Innate Immune Cells in the Early Steps of Tumor Development</title>
<p>Aside from a shared molecular mechanism that mobilizes host innate immune cells towards these “early tumors” and to wounds, our live imaging observations offer further support for, and refinement of, the well-established doctrine suggesting that “tumors are wounds that do not heal” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Balkwill1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Schafer1">[71]</xref>. While the earliest recruitment of leukocytes resembles that of an acute healing wound, as transformed clone size increases, so the time spent by leukocytes with the clone also increases until their behavior more resembles that of a chronic skin lesion where inflammation does not resolve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Mathias2">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Dodd1">[45]</xref>. This prolonged time spent in the neighborhood of transformed cells may lead—as well as to the changes in dynamic cell behavior we describe here—to phenotypic changes in leukocytes. Indeed, we see some leukocytes expressing the M2 marker, arginase1, which indicates a more trophic function for those cells at the transformed cell site. The molecular nature of such trophic signals is not revealed by our studies, but clearly such transitions may significantly influence tumor progression, and the translucent zebrafish offers potential opportunities to live image these events in situ, using appropriate reporter fish lines.</p>
<p>It has been shown in mouse models that tumor-recruited bone-marrow-derived cells are a heterogeneous population composed of many subtypes of leukocytes distinguished by their surface markers, but there is no definitive association between the presence of any individual subtypes and a particular outcome of tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Mantovani2">[47]</xref>. Definitive markers for cataloging the zebrafish larval myeloid cell subtypes are still subject to refinement. However, by combining several transgenic reporter fish lines for different myeloid lineage marker genes and cell morphology, our observations reveal four different subtypes of leukocyte that show a range of behaviors during their recruitment to, and interaction with, V12RAS<sup>+</sup> cells, and suggest that multiple leukocyte lineages can participate in the earliest inflammatory response to transformed cells. Our data reveal transformed cell material in both neutrophils and macrophages, but macrophages appear by far the more significant phagocytes of these two leukocyte lineages. The high-resolution live imaging also enables us to observe the structures that transiently form between innate immune cells and transformed cells. For example, we see tethers linking leukocytes and transformed cells, and we speculate that these may play a “holding” role, enabling leukocytes to maintain a long-term association with transformed cells. Similar tethers, termed nanotubes, have been previously reported to play important roles in immune cell-cell communication in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000562-Davis1">[72]</xref>, and the same may be true for these links between immune cells and transformed cells in vivo.</p>
<p>For the first time, to our knowledge, we have been able to observe the behaviors of various innate immune cell lineages as they interact with these developing transformed cell clones, and, using several complementary strategies, we go on to demonstrate that these interactions have significant impact, because without them, we see reduced proliferation and, as a consequence, fewer transformed cells, at least in the early stages we have examined. This demonstration of a trophic role is all the more dramatic because of our observation that when recruited to a site where transformed cells are growing, neutrophils and macrophages are able to phagocytose some of these cells, so there appear to be competing clearance and trophic roles for innate immune cells at these earliest stages of tumor initiation. However, at least, in simple terms of the numbers of surviving transformed cells, we show that the presence of innate immune cells at the lesion site is beneficial to early transformed cell growth. Our current function testing studies are acute experiments, but other approaches may enable longer term blocking of recruitment of innate immune cells, or more permanent genetic deletion of various leukocyte lineages, which will allow us to dissect precisely the contribution of each lineage to tumor initiation, clearance, and trophic support, from these early initiation stages all the way through to full-blown cancer.</p>
<p>The in vivo, live observations extend our current understanding of the earliest surveillance steps whereby innate immune cells sense the presence of small numbers of oncogene-transformed cells in otherwise normal tissue. Besides providing opportunities to live image these early interactions, our zebrafish model also enables us to study the signals that regulate leukocyte recruitment to these oncogene-transformed cell precursors of tumors, and we reveal that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is a convergent signal for initiating the host inflammatory response to both oncogene-transformed cells and to wounds, thus further extending the parallels between cancers and healing wounds.</p>

<p><bold>RT-PCR for DUOX Showing the efficiency of the DUOX splicing block morpholino.</bold> DUOX-morphant-typing primers amplify a 264-bp WT band from the cDNA of control, un-injected embryos, but embryos injected with DUOX morpholino exhibit exon escape, resulting in a 39-bp deletion of mRNA such that DUOX-morphant-typing primers amplify a smaller band from cDNA of DUOX morphant embryos. This knockdown is full at 3 dpf and retained until 5 dpf.</p>

The movie was taken at one frame every 90 s. Black pigmentation quenches much of the mCherry signal (red). The DIC channel is overlayed to show the outline of the V12RAS<sup>+</sup> clone. The yellow arrowhead in the movie indicates a small fragment of a V12RAS<sup>+</sup> melanocyte as it is engulfed by an MPO:GFP<sup>+</sup> neutrophil; later this fragment is seen as a black phagosome inside the neutrophil cell body. (B) is the same sequence as in (A) but without the DIC channel. (C) is a control larva with melanoblasts expressing mCherry alone; in this example, several MPO:GFP<sup>+</sup> cells come close to the mCherry-expressing cells but are not drawn to the clone.</p>
