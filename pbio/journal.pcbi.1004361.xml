<abstract>
<p>Proteins perform their function or interact with partners by exchanging between conformational substates on a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Structurally characterizing these exchanges is challenging, both experimentally and computationally. Large, diffusional motions are often on timescales that are difficult to access with molecular dynamics simulations, especially for large proteins and their complexes. The low frequency modes of normal mode analysis (NMA) report on molecular fluctuations associated with biological activity. However, NMA is limited to a second order expansion about a minimum of the potential energy function, which limits opportunities to observe diffusional motions. By contrast, kino-geometric conformational sampling (KGS) permits large perturbations while maintaining the exact geometry of explicit conformational constraints, such as hydrogen bonds. Here, we extend KGS and show that a conformational ensemble of the α subunit Gαs of heterotrimeric stimulatory protein Gs exhibits structural features implicated in its activation pathway. Activation of protein Gs by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is associated with GDP release and large conformational changes of its α-helical domain. Our method reveals a coupled α-helical domain opening motion while, simultaneously, Gαs helix α<sub>5</sub> samples an activated conformation. These motions are moderated in the activated state. The motion centers on a dynamic hub near the nucleotide-binding site of Gαs, and radiates to helix α<sub>4</sub>. We find that comparative NMA-based ensembles underestimate the amplitudes of the motion. Additionally, the ensembles fall short in predicting the accepted direction of the full activation pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that nullspace sampling with explicit, holonomic constraints yields ensembles that illuminate molecular mechanisms involved in GDP release and protein Gs activation, and further establish conformational coupling between key structural elements of Gαs.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Multi-cellular physiology is an emergent property, which depends critically on inter-cellular signaling pathways. Transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate a large variety of physiological events throughout the body, such as vision or cardiovascular regulation. It is thus no surprise that GPCRs are targeted by more than one third of all FDA-approved drugs. Molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters transmit messages to cells via GPCRs complexed to cytosolic heterotrimeric G proteins. G proteins, upon activation, interact with other molecules to trigger a cellular response. Despite an increasing amount of structural data, the precise conformational dynamics and activation mechanism of G proteins remain poorly understood. The size of the multi-protein complexes and the time scales at which conformational changes occur hinder adequate sampling of the conformational landscape with molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we extend and use an efficient, robotics-inspired conformational sampling procedure to probe the conformational landscape of protein G during activation. Our procedure reveals coupled, molecular mechanisms of the activation pathway, which are absent in a comparative analysis with normal modes. Our exciting results can ultimately lead to modulation of biological activity by drug design or fine-tuning of conformational heterogeneity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate a large variety of physiological events throughout the body by activating intracellular signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref001">1</xref>]. Signaling molecules, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, can induce conformational changes in GPCRs, which allow it to complex with intracellular protein partners such as heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein G. <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub> Adrenergic Receptor (<italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub>AR), a so-called class A receptor, initiates activation of stimulatory protein Gs mainly through interactions with the latter’s <italic>α</italic> subunit (G<italic>α</italic>s). Upon activation, Gs interacts with effector proteins in the cell which, ultimately, leads to a cellular response. However, a precise characterization of the activation mechanism of Gs has remained elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can structurally characterize the dynamics of biomolecules in great detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref003">3</xref>]. However, as increasingly sophisticated experimental techniques yield ever bigger molecular systems and complexes, the computational demands to ensure adequate sampling of the conformational landscape often require highly specialized hardware and algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>In parallel, time-independent or non-deterministic sampling-based algorithms together with simplified macromolecular representations have also led to tremendous insights. Conformational sampling with CONCOORD has provided seeds for subsequent MD simulations to overcome large energy barriers in the characterization of recognition dynamics of ubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref006">6</xref>]. Rapid exploration of conformational space in internal coordinates with a traditional mechanical force field via a biased Monte Carlo approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref007">7</xref>] accurately predicted agonist binding modes for GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref008">8</xref>]. Exhaustive sampling has predicted ensembles of low-energy conformers for GPCRs associated with ligand binding and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref009">9</xref>]. Rosetta-based sampling and energy analysis provided a structural basis for rhodopsin-mediated GDP release from Gi, a inhibitory protein highly related to Gs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Vibrational modes of a biomolecule are well-approximated with a so-called Elastic Network Model (ENM), in which non-bonded interactions are replaced with a harmonic pseudo-potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref011">11</xref>]. Analysis of ENMs with NMA, which relies on a Hamiltonian in which the kinetic energy is also quadratic, yields the equations of motion around a minimum of the potential energy of the system. While low-frequency modes are generally associated with biological activity, the second order approximation underlying NMA limits its ability to access conformational substates and observe larger, diffusional motions. Nonetheless, NMAs are enormously successful and have, for instance, proposed GPCR activation mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref012">12</xref>]. Combined with short MD trajectories NMA also predicted a molecular mechanism for GDP release from Gi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Kinogeometric sampling (KGS) treats a biomolecule as a branched polymer, with rotatable bonds as degrees of freedom (DoFs) and non-covalent (hydrogen) bonds as distance constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref016">16</xref>]. Hydrogen bonds define nested, closed loops that require coordinated changes of DoFs to avoid breaking the bonds. Kinogeometric sampling maps structural perturbations onto a subspace of conformation space that accounts for the reduced flexibility of these closed loops. This procedure intrinsically favors certain directions on the conformational landscape, namely those that avoid, collectively, native hydrogen bond dissociation. Additionally, representing biomolecular systems with fewer DoFs enables better exploration of conformation space and, ultimately, allows fitting sparse experimental data sets while reducing the risk of overfitting.</p>
<p>Distance constraints from hydrogen bonds can completely rigidify substructures of biomolecules. For instance, an <italic>α</italic>-helix is often rigidified owing to its backbone hydrogen bonding network. Kinogeometric and similar sampling-with-constraint techniques have relied on combinatorial constraint counting to explicitly identify rigid substructures in the molecule that result from the hydrogen bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref017">17</xref>]. Perturbing a molecular conformation with constraints generally required breaking constraints and subsequently reclosing them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref018">18</xref>], or iteratively refitting the perturbed conformation and the rigid substructures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we extend our kinogeometric computational techniques by abandoning explicit constraint counting to proteins. Our procedure efficiently samples conformational degrees of freedom in a lower-dimensional subspace in which instantaneous distance constraints are preserved exactly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref020">20</xref>]. The advantage of our method is that a single, exact mathematical analysis both provides constraint satisfaction and infinitesimal, coordinated directions of motion for the degrees of freedom of the protein. It naturally couples motions throughout the protein by many interconnected and interdependent cycles, making few additional assumptions on interactions. As a result, collective motions emerge which deform the protein along preferred dimensions. We apply our algorithm to compute a broad conformational distribution of the inactive and active states of the <italic>α</italic> subunit of free (i.e. not receptor-bound), apo (i.e. nucleotide-free) G<italic>α</italic>s. We demonstrate that our ensemble identifies detailed molecular mechanisms implicated in domain opening and activation of protein Gs. We compare the findings to an ensemble obtained with a state-of-the art torsional ENM. An ENM representation with torsional degrees of freedom is conceptually similar to our approach, and is known to better represent protein conformational changes than Cartesian ENMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref022">22</xref>]. We selected an implementation, the iMC module of iMod, that is capable of generating large domain motions by sampling along low-frequency normal modes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref023">23</xref>].</p>

<title>A kinematic representation of proteins</title>
<p>The linear, branched structure of proteins naturally forms a kinematic linkage, i.e. a chain with rigid groups of atoms, or rigid bodies, as links and rotatable bonds or degrees of freedom (DoF), as revolute joints. The DoFs are the backbone torsion angles (<italic>ϕ</italic> and <italic>ψ</italic>) and the side-chain torsion angles (<italic>χ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>). Bond lengths, bond angles and the peptide torsion angle <italic>ω</italic> are assumed fixed at their initial values in this study. Rigid bodies are the largest sets of atoms in a protein without internal, rotational degrees of freedom (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004361.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We initially set each atom or group of double-bonded atoms as a rigid body. The rigid bodies of atoms connected by a non-rotatable covalent bond are merged. Hydrogen atoms are explicitly included in the model. A vector <bold>q</bold> ∈ 𝕊<sup><italic>n</italic></sup>,<bold>q</bold> = (<italic>q</italic><sub>1</sub>, …, <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>)<sup><italic>T</italic></sup> completely specifies a conformation for a molecule with <italic>n</italic> rotational degrees-of-freedom.</p>
<p>We represent the kinematic linkage as a rooted, directed spanning tree, i.e. an acyclic graph <italic>G</italic> = (<italic>V</italic>, <italic>E</italic>) that connects all vertices <italic>V</italic> such that each one, except the root, has only one incoming, directed edge <italic>E</italic>.

Hydrogen bonds are encoded as distance constraints, resulting in closed loops or so-called kinematic cycles in <italic>G</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Previous sampling-with-constraint procedures relied on an elegant combinatorial pebble game algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref017">17</xref>] to identify exactly all rigid and flexible substructures in the molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref024">24</xref>].

<title>Validation</title>
<p>To validate our algorithm, we selected the three proteins with the largest RMSD between apo and holo conformations from a data set curated for predicting apo conformations from holo conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref027">27</xref>]. Hydrogen bonds shared between apo and holo conformations were included as constraints. The domains were determined as follows: L-Leucine binding protein (leub) domain 1 residues 1–119 and 251–327, domain 2 residues 120–250 and 328–345; Osmo protection protein (osmo) domain 1 residues 6–109 and 213–275, domain 2 110–212. Alginate binding protein (algi) domain 1 residues 1–133 and 310–400, domain 2 residues 134–309 and 401–490. For each holo conformation, 20,000 random samples were generated with exploration radius of 8Å for leub, 6Å for osmo and 10Å for algi, see the section KGS sampling below for details. To analyze the results, the centers of mass of the holo domains were first aligned with the <italic>z</italic>-axis of the laboratory coordinate system. Domain 1 in each sample in the conformational ensemble was aligned with domain 1 of the holo conformation before the zenith and azimuth angle of domain 2 of the sample were calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>We used the ligand-free (PDB 2ZIJ) and bound (PDB 1BB5) crystal structures of human lysozyme as starting conformations.

While any rigid body in the molecule can serve as the root <italic>R</italic>, we set <italic>R</italic> as the first rigid body at the N-terminus of the molecule. There were 767 cycle DoFs in the system. To ensure rapid and broad diffusion of the sampled ensemble, the sampling protocol inspired by Rapidly-exploring Random Trees of previous work was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref037">37</xref>], which we briefly summarize. The sampling pool was initialized with the minimized conformations of active or inactive apo G<italic>α</italic>s <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>init</italic></sub>. We generated a pool of 20,000 samples in an exploration sphere of fixed radius (20Å RMSD) from <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>init</italic></sub>, which was subdivided into shells 𝓢<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>i</italic> ∈ {1, …, 100} of width 0.2Å, as follows. At each sampling step, a shell 𝓢<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> was selected at random from the subset of shells containing at least one conformation. Next, an entirely random conformation <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>random</italic></sub> was generated. The conformation that was RMSD-closest to <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>random</italic></sub> in 𝓢<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> was selected as <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>seed</italic></sub>, and <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>random</italic></sub> was discarded. A random perturbation Δ<bold>q</bold> to <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>seed</italic></sub> was proposed, that was then projected onto the constraint manifold and applied to <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>seed</italic></sub> to obtain a new conformation <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>new</italic></sub>, i.e. <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>new</italic></sub> = <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>seed</italic></sub>+<bold>NN</bold><sup><italic>T</italic></sup>Δ<bold>q</bold>. If <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>new</italic></sub> did not contain clashes, it was added to the pool in the shell corresponding to its RMSD from <bold>q</bold><sub><italic>init</italic></sub>, else it was discarded. The exploration radius and shell width are adjustable parameters. The combination of values selected for this study were found to balance broad exploration and uniform coverage. The collision factor that scales VdW radii during collision detection was set to 0.75. The maximum rotation of a DoF was scaled to 0.29 degrees, which was found to reflect a good balance between fast divergence from initial structure and a high acceptance ratio. To test if the sampling trajectories had converged, we additionally generated a conformational distribution of 50,000 samples around the inactive and active states.

<p>We carried out ENM normal modes vibrational analysis (NMA) in internal coordinates (IC) with the software package iMOD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref023">23</xref>]. After first obtaining the IC normal modes for each structure with the iMODE tool, we generated a conformational ensemble of 20,000 samples with the default NMA Monte Carlo sampling procedure enabled by the iMC module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref023">23</xref>]. We obtained the first 20 normal modes by using all default settings, except enabling <italic>χ</italic> dihedral angles as DoFs to better agree with the KGS DoFs. By default iMC selects from the 5 lowest frequency modes for a Monte Carlo step. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004361.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. displays all the modes. We used coarse-grained all heavy-atom representation and a sigmoid function pairwise interaction potential with default parameterization. We scaled the parameter <italic>a</italic> (’linear factor to scale motion’) ten-fold to better match the amplitude of domain motions suggested by experimental measurements. Further increasing the scaling did not lead to better agreement.</p>
<p>To examine if a sigmoid function potential possibly over-constrained the system, we also sampled using a coarse-grained, CA-only representation with an essential dynamics (ED) potential function. A scale factor of <italic>a</italic> = 10 agreed with experimental data, but led to distortions in the models. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004361.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The software is implemented in C++. Calculations were performed on a single, 2.6GHz Intel processor core. Average time to obtain an accepted conformation was 8.9s, at an average acceptance ratio of 30%. Depending on the size of the molecule, computations take from several hours to a few days. No attempts were yet made to optimize the code. The performance limiting step is currently the repeated (𝓞(<italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup>)) calculation of RMSD within shells to ensure broad sampling. The shell width balances performance with broad diffusion.

<title>Validation</title>
<p>To validate our algorithm, we computed conformational distributions for three two-domain protein crystal structures that were determined in both holo and apo conformations. For each protein, the domains open, re-orient and conformationally adjust upon adopting the apo conformation. We observed conformational distributions directed along holo-apo pathways. Starting from the holo conformation, we found that conformational ensembles on the constraint manifold defined by interconnected cycles were highly biased toward the apo conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). Polar plots of the distribution of zenith (<italic>θ</italic>) and azimuth (<italic>ϕ</italic>) angles of relative positions of the centers of mass of the two domains reveal domain opening and collective, reorientating motions toward the apo conformation. No conformational pathways connecting the holo substate to the apo substate were observed, but it is unknown if ligand-free holo-apo conformational interconversion occurs for these proteins in solution. Additionally, sampling limitations or steric barriers between the states can prevent end-to-end pathways. Reaching sparsely populated, ‘excited’ substates often demand additional (experimental) restraints on conformational sampling techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

<p>We furthermore tested whether conformational distributions owing to collective motions on the constraint manifold can accord with free energy landscapes observed in solution. Apo human lysozyme displays large breathing motions, characterized by the angle <italic>θ</italic> between the <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> domains. The free-energy landscape for the reaction coordinates <italic>θ</italic> and RMSD to the holo crystal structure of apo and holo (triNAG-bound) human lysozyme was recently characterized from replica-averaged, RDC-restrained molecular dynamics simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref029">29</xref>]. While the free energy of apo lysozyme has a single minimum, the holo state revealed a second, sparsely populated ‘unlocked’ state centered on (49°,1.5Å) in addition to the main ‘locked’ state around (58°,0.9Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g003">Fig 3b</xref>). The holo protein is capable of sampling a wider range of <italic>θ</italic> angles than the apo structure, presumably to facilitate product release. Our conformational distributions starting from the (ligand-free) holo and apo structures revealed surprisingly similar conformational distributions compared to those from RDC-restrained simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g003">Fig 3b</xref>, left panel). The holo distribution samples more broadly, and more towards closed conformations (smaller <italic>θ</italic> angles) than the apo distribution, in agreement with the free-energy landscape observed from RDC restrained simulations. Additionally, weak local maxima were observed in the holo distribution, corresponding to the ‘locked’ and ‘unlocked’ state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g003">Fig 3b</xref>, right panel). The unlocked state corresponds to a sparsely populated, intermediate state, which was validated experimentally. Thus, collective motions on the constraint manifold enable quick diffusion away from the initial state along biologically-relevant directions that map the conformational landscape of the protein.</p>

While the precise mechanism of protein Gs-activation remains poorly understood, interaction with the activated receptor is incidental with the dissociation of GDP and the <italic>βγ</italic> subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref041">41</xref>]. G<italic>α</italic>s, which binds GTP after the release of GDP, subsequently interacts with many effector proteins in the cell.

<p>The activated (nucleotide-free) state of G<italic>α</italic>s involves a large motion of the AH-domain with respect to the stable Ras-domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref043">43</xref>]. Additionally, the <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub>-helix of G<italic>α</italic>s translates and rotates upward to interact with the cytoplasmic core of the receptor. The domain opening purportedly facilitates the release of GDP. The <italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub>–<italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> loop, which binds the purine ring of GDP, and the <italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub> strand also change conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The large distance separating the crystal structures of the active and inactive states suggests that G<italic>α</italic>s can access many different conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref044">44</xref>]. However, structurally characterizing and determining the sequence of events in the activation pathway by experimental means has proved challenging.

Additionally, the opening angle of the AH-domain upon activation is the subject of intense debate. Several lines of evidence suggest that crystal lattice formation may have played a role in selecting an extreme opening angle for the AH-domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref044">44</xref>].

<title>KGS samples the activation pathway of G<italic>α</italic>s</title>
<p>We first examined the conformational variability of the AH-domain between the active and inactive states with the methods KGS, iMC, and CONCOORD. The RMS deviations for KGS samples starting from the inactive state of the AH-domain of G<italic>α</italic>s was 13.5Å, while for the active state it was 5.8Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g004">Fig 4a</xref>). For iMC, the observed values were 5.2Å and 11.1Å, and for CONCOORD 9.7Å and 15.8Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g004">Fig 4b</xref>). In addition, all three methods identify large motions of helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> concurrent with the domain motions. The maximum opening angle Θ<sub><italic>max</italic></sub> between the two domains was 27.2 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004361.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, 37.9 degrees for 50,000 samples) for the inactive state KGS ensemble, compared to 91 degrees for the activated crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g002">Fig 2</xref>). iMC reported a maximum opening angle for the inactive AH-domain of around 9.9 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g005">Fig 5</xref>, left panel). The CONCOORD conformational ensemble reported a range of 15 − 20 degrees of an opening angle around the active state, and 18 degrees around the inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g005">Fig 5</xref>, right panel).</p>

<p>The change in opening angle between the AH-domain and the Ras-domain is shown as sampling progresses for KGS, iMC (left panel), and CONCOORD (right panel). For KGS, the inactive AH-domain opens to nearly 30 degrees (dark-red), while the active AH-domain ranges from 84.8 to 96.5 degrees (red). The inactive opening angle of iMC reaches 9.9 degrees, and ranges from 79.6 to 103.7 degrees for the active AH-domain. The opening angle of activated G<italic>α</italic>s in the <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub>AR:G<italic>α</italic>s crystal structure is indicated in the inset. The inactive opening angle of CONCOORD reaches around 18 degrees, and ranges from 74.6 to 111.4 degrees for the active AH-domain. For the active state, iMC and CONCOORD sample uniformly around the starting angle. The angle of the KGS samples slowly decreases towards the inactive state.</p>

</fig>
<p>Both iMC and CONCOORD sample with nearly uniformly fixed radius around the active starting conformation, which is rationalized by their reliance on an equilibrium conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In contrast, KGS, by design of its RRT-based sampling avoiding steric collisions, mimics a trajectory diffusing out of the starting conformation. KGS sampling of the activated state exhibited a slowing rate of change, while the opening angle of the inactive state still appeared to increase slightly at 20,000 samples, leveling of at 50,000 samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004361.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The lack of full convergence did not appreciably change the conformational distributions, but can moderately limit interpreting the ensemble as a collection of exchanging conformational substates. Interestingly, while KGS sampling of the active conformation initially exhibits greater conformational diversity away from the inactive state, later samples are directed more towards the inactive state.</p>
<p>The KGS ensemble for free, apo G<italic>α</italic>s compares very well with the RMSD and opening angle reported from experimental observations in solution. Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) spectroscopy measurements suggest that the average displacement of the apo AH-domain of Gi protein complexed with rhodopsin is 15Å [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref010">10</xref>]. From the nine models of receptor-bound Gi conformations reporting on the DEER observations, we measured an equivalent average opening angle Θ of 25.5 degrees (Θ<sub><italic>max</italic></sub> = 48.8 degrees) after alignment to the G<italic>α</italic>s Ras-domain.</p>
<p>The KGS ensemble suggests that ligand-free G<italic>α</italic>s is structurally and evolutionary designed to access a broad range of opening angles. However, a set of discrete samples connecting the inactive with the active state of G<italic>α</italic>s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g004">Fig 4a and 4b</xref>) was not observed. The sample acceptance ratio in KGS, i.e. samples not rejected owing to collisions between atoms, also differed substantially between the inactive and active states (35% vs 15%). These findings could signify a steep conformational barrier between the inactive and active crystal structures between 40 to 80 degrees of domain opening angle. For instance, in the activated state of <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub>AR:G<italic>α</italic>s, the <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>-helix of the Ras-domain is partially melted to accommodate the large motion.</p>

<sec id="sec017">
<title>Directionality of displacement</title>
<p>In the remainder, we focus on a direct comparison of the directional conformational variability of KGS and iMC since these methods are conceptually most alike. We calculated a distribution of angles between the mean displacements of C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub> atoms of the G<italic>α</italic> AH-domain for the two ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g006">Fig 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004361.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The mean displacement is the vector connecting the center of mass of all AH-domain C<sub><italic>α</italic></sub> atoms of the initial structure to the averaged center of mass of the ensemble, after alignment to the stable part of the Ras-domain. The angles of mean displacement for the AH-domain are visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g006">Fig 6</xref>. The angles of mean displacements did not align but were significantly shifted for both the active (57.6 degrees, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g006">Fig 6a</xref> yellow bar) and inactive state (70.2 degrees, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g006">Fig 6a</xref> gray bar). The long tails for the angle distributions, in particular for the inactive state, identify a significant number of residues for which the angle differ by more than 90 degrees. Thus, large-amplitude motions of G<italic>α</italic>s are described differently by the two procedures.</p>

</fig>
<p>The conformational distributions from KGS starting from the inactive form of G<italic>α</italic>s aligns with the proposed activation mechanism of the <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub>AR:G<italic>α</italic>s after GDP release. The direction of motion for the KGS inactive ensemble corresponds to a domain opening motion in the viewing plane, with a small component orthogonal to the viewing plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g006">Fig 6b</xref>). The iMC motion is nearly orthogonal to the viewing plane, resulting in a transverse ‘rocking’ motion, with a moderate component downward towards a domain opening motion. Floquet and coworkers observed a similar, pivoting motion for the AH domain around the <italic>α</italic>A helix, which is implicated in GDP release, from Cartesian NMA with the CHARMM27 force field for protein Gi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>The size of the vectors reflects the difference in RMSD amplitude of the ensembles. For the active state both methods have a significant component orthogonal to the viewing plane. For neither method the main displacement in the active state appears to be along the activation pathway, signifying that additional mechanisms, such as GTP hydrolysis, likely play a key role in G<italic>α</italic>s. The direction of mean displacement for iMC is nearly identical for the inactive and active ensembles. A possible explanation is that local structural changes in the AH-domain between the active and inactive state are modest, leaving interactions defined by the ENM largely unchanged between the states.</p>
<p>Receptor-induced conformational changes in helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> are believed to contribute to GDP release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref047">47</xref>]. Concomitant with activation, helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> undergoes a rotation and translation towards <italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub>. The magnitude and direction of these fluctuations in the KGS ensemble are striking, coinciding with those observed in MD simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref045">45</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g006">Fig 6c</xref> shows the view looking towards the cytoplasm from the receptor core. The top panel shows the <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> helix in its active conformation, and the bottom panel in its inactive conformation. The distribution of magnitudes and directions of the KGS displacement vectors along the helix in the inactive state (bottom panel) correspond remarkably well to a translation and rotation along a path to reach the active state (top panel). RMS amplitudes of 8.3Å and 7.9 Å were observed for <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub>-helix in the KGS ensemble of the active and inactive states. By contrast, the iMC displacement vectors are slightly smaller in magnitude in the inactive state (indicated by RMS spread of 1.4Å and 3.6 Å) and have a component nearly opposite to the activation pathway. Note that while in general normal mode vectors indicate undirected displacement, our displacement vectors were calculated directly from the ensembles.</p>

<p>Mean displacements for the KGS and iMC sampled G<italic>α</italic>s ensemble exhibit a clear pattern; they are larger for the AH-domain and vanishingly small for the Ras-domain in both the active and inactive state. The coordinated perturbations of DoFs by KGS resulted in intra-domain displacements shared by groups of contiguous residues. Three regions of the AH-domain separately display collective features indicated by elevated mean displacements, corresponding to the C-terminus of <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> and <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub>, <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> and <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub>, and <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub>. A remarkably similar pattern is observed for the iMC ensemble. Helices <italic>A</italic> − <italic>D</italic> are located towards the outer radius of the rotation of the AH-domain, explaining the elevated levels of mean displacement in both active and inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g002">Fig 2b</xref>). Surprisingly, their relative orientation remains well-preserved despite a sparse inter-secondary structure hydrogen-bond network in the AH-domain. The pattern of displacements is similar for the active and inactive state.</p>
<p>Analysis at the residue level reveals key details suggesting collective motion. In the Ras-domain, helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> shows a large displacement, exceeding the mean displacement values of the Ras-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g007">Fig 7</xref>, right-most shaded bands). The growth in amplitude towards the C-terminus is characteristic for the rotational motion we observed in the previous section. Interestingly, the single, unique feature standing out in an otherwise flat Ras-domain is elevated displacement for helix <italic>α</italic><sub>4</sub> and loop <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>–<italic>α</italic><sub>4</sub> (residues 320–340) in both active and inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g007">Fig 7</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g006">Fig 6d</xref> shows the motion of <italic>α</italic><sub>4</sub> and the adjacent loop. Helices <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> and <italic>α</italic><sub>4</sub> are implicated in GDP release. Similar motions were observed using Cartesian NMA with the CHARMM27 force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref013">13</xref>] in protein Gi. Strikingly, both the <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> and motions of <italic>α</italic><sub>4</sub> and the adjacent loop are absent in the iMC Gs active ensemble, but both are present in KGS. This strongly suggests these motions are conformationally coupled, but possibly shifted to higher modes in iMC.</p>
<p>The mean displacements up to residue number 80 suggest anti-correlated motions in iMC and KGS in the active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g007">Fig 7</xref>, top). The mean displacement reported by iMC is elevated owing to restraints between the BC loop in the AH domain and (truncated) helix <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>. This results in collective motions of the <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>-strand with the highly mobile AH domain. The amplitude of the iMC motions is likely overestimated, as it leads to significant distortions of the <italic>β</italic>-sheet in the Ras domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004361.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Similarly, the proximity of Linker I to helix F leads to collective motions in iMC. The absence of explicit constraints, i.e, hydrogen bonds in Linker I suppresses collective motions in KGS. While the precise nature of Linker I motions remains unclear, the absence of well-defined electron density in the crystal suggests this loop is highly mobile.</p>

In KGS, 43.4% of total DoFs are cycle DoFs and of those 41% are rigidified, indicated by vanishing RMSF for cycle DoFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g008">Fig 8</xref>). These DoFs are contained in the null space of the projection matrix <bold>NN</bold><sup><italic>T</italic></sup>. Rigidified cycle DoFs correspond largely to secondary structure elements, where DoFs are overconstrained by short or overlapping cycles. Free DoFs have larger RMSF than cycle DoFs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004361.t001">Table 1</xref>). If rigidified DoFs are excluded from the RMSF, a modest reduction of 20.5% in flexibility from free to cycle DoFs is observed.</p>

<p>By contrast, while iMC does not define free or cycle DoFs, we observed a reversed flexibility trend compared to the corresponding DoFs in KGS–the cycle DoFs are 1.8 times more flexible than free DoFs for iMC. One possible contributing factor to this somewhat paradoxical find is that normal modes are obtained from eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix defined by the potential function. Free DoFs, like those in surface side-chains, are, on average, subject to fewer restraints, and thus less likely to contribute to major modes. The magnitude of a trial move is scaled by the eigenvalues of the modes, and more constrained areas may thus dominate the size of the move. We also observed that large parts of the Ras-domain do not show elevated RMSF with iMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g008">Fig 8</xref>), signifying that many vibrational frequencies rather than a single mode dominate structural changes for this domain.</p>
<p>iMC locates elevated flexibility mainly in loop residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Linkers I and II stand out, as well as the <italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub>–<italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> loop. Note that the backbone DoFs for LI and LII are cycle DoFs owing to hydrogen bonds between, for instance, <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>β</italic><sub>2</sub>. By contrast, elevated variability in KGS is concentrated less in loop areas, and distributed more uniformly throughout the protein.</p>
<p>The magnitude of helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> RMSD spread is nearly identical in the two states. However, small, motional differences in specific helical sub-regions can signify different functionalities. Significant flexibility towards the C-terminal part of the helix would enhance <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub>-helix conformational selectivity for inactive-like conformers, while a more active-like conformation would promote specificity through small-scale deformations near the N-terminal part of the helix. For the inactive state we observe elevated variability in the KGS ensemble from the C-terminus of <italic>α</italic><sub>4</sub>, through <italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub>, up to the N-terminus of <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g008">Fig 8a</xref>, dashed rectangle I). The C-terminus of helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> and the <italic>α</italic><sub>4</sub>–<italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub> loop interact with the receptor. A conserved TCAV motif in the <italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub>–<italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> loop binds the GDP guanine ring. Helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> and strand <italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub> transmit receptor-induced conformational changes to facilitate GDP release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref040">40</xref>]. KGS elevated variability is present in the inactive state, but moderated in the activated state and shifted away from the <italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub> strand. The magnitude of variability is reduced from inactive to active state for both sampling techniques, suggesting that smaller changes dominate this area in the active state. This interpretation is supported by iMC motions, where elevated variability shifts from <italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub> to the N-terminus of <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> upon activation.</p>
<p>A heat map of conformational changes reveals a hotspot of highly elevated flexibility near the GDP binding pocket in the inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g008">Fig 8b</xref>, bottom left circled). Similarities with a heat map obtained from peptide amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) experiments, which report on exchange rates of amide hydrogens, are striking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref048">48</xref>]. While the increased exchange rates established general sensitivity to GDP release, our nucleotide-free analysis suggests that increase in dynamics or disordering of this segment is, at least partly, attributable to motion of helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> and the AH domain.</p>
<p>We also observed conformational coupling of the N-terminus of helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> to <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>, and the adjacent <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>–<italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub> loop (P-loop), which binds the nucleotide phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g008">Fig 8a</xref>, dashed rectangle II and circled in inactive state). How the elevated flexibility is further coupled is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g008">Fig 8b</xref>, left panels. Coupling in the GDP binding pocket extends to include helix <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>, helix <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub>, Linker II (SW I), and the N-terminus of <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub>. Functional, conformational coupling is revealed to a lesser extent by iMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004361.g007">Fig 7b</xref>, right panels). In particular, the close coupling around the GDP binding pocket appears absent, and elevated flexibility is mostly located in loop residues. For iMC, variability of <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> is shifted towards the C-terminal end of helix <italic>α</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Proteins interconvert between functional, often sparsely populated conformational substates at a multitude of spatiotemporal scales to perform their function and interact with other biomolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref051">51</xref>]. Understanding how these substates probe the conformational landscape and how they are coupled through collective motions can provide insights into molecular mechanisms and protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>Our conformational sampling algorithm maps small random perturbations, highly suggestive of equilibrium fluctuations, onto a constraint manifold that is defined by the hydrogen bonding network. Our new method does not require explicitly calculating rigid substructures of the protein. Instead, DoFs are subject to coordinated motion on the constraint manifold, and DoFs in isostatic or overconstrained substructures are intrinsically rigidified. Cycle DoFs contribute significantly to the distribution of the resulting conformational ensemble. Cycle DoFs make up nearly half of the DoFs, are distributed throughout the molecule, and their RMSF is only moderately reduced compared to free DoFs.</p>
<p>The coordinated motion and distribution of cycle DoFs can potentially provide new information about mechanisms of conformational coupling. Compared to iMC, we observed motions with larger amplitudes, but both methods were in agreement with accepted mechanisms. We were better able to distinguish molecular mechanisms, and locate the origin of conformational flexibility. Important rotational DoFs stand out, and are, surprisingly, located not just in loops to accommodate inter domain motion. Results for Linker I and (activated) loop residues 254–265 should be interpreted with care, as experimental evidence to support their initial conformation is limited. Conformational coupling in the iMC ensemble was less pronounced, and sometimes more difficult to distinguish owing to higher modes or reduced motional amplitudes. The limited range of motion of the iMC sampling procedure likely results from the assumption of harmonic vibrations around equilibrium positions in the ENM. Large deviations break the underlying assumptions and would perturb the topology of the initial conformation–drawbacks that KGS intrinsically avoids. In contrast to the KGS distributions, the RMSD for the inactive state are reduced compared to the active state. The interface between the AH-domain and Ras-domain is subject to restraints imposed by the ENM, which limits the amplitude of the motion along the activation pathway from the inactive state. Nonetheless, while the active state sampled ensemble exhibits a larger RMSD than the inactive state, an overall reduced amplitude with respect to KGS was observed. Interdomain ENM restraints in the direction of the activation pathway alone do not explain the reduced RMSD.</p>
<p>We observed a KGS ensemble along a pathway associated with activation for the <italic>α</italic> sub-unit of protein Gs. Conformational interconversions can occur through a myriad of alternative transition pathways. Computationally probing a multi-state conformational landscape through extensive MD simulations to obtain a probable minimum free energy pathway is often prohibitively expensive. In addition, sampling is generally affected by limitations and imperfections of the force fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref054">54</xref>]. At the expense of highly accurate energy estimates, our method efficiently explores the conformational space accessible to a protein while it maintains exactly covalent and hydrogen bond geometry, and avoids steric clashes. Nonetheless, interpretation of the ensemble as a collection of exchanging conformational substates would require long sampling trajectories to satisfy ergodic properties. Our method illuminates coupled intra- and interdomain motions, complementary to rigid-body domain sampling and subsequent loop rebuilding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref010">10</xref>]. Paired with sophisticated MD simulations or energy relaxation protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref056">56</xref>] our conformational ensemble can, for instance, serve as starting points for detailed transition path sampling.</p>
<p>An exceptionally striking feature of our KGS ensemble is the magnitude of fluctuation of helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub> concurrent with the G<italic>α</italic>s AH-domain motion. These coupled motions point to a potential molecular mechanism of <italic>concomitant</italic>, structural changes between two remote sites implicated in the release of GDP upon activation. There is increasing experimental evidence to support this mechanism, which was first predicted by computational means for protein Gi by Floquet and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref013">13</xref>]. Their NMA-based analysis of GDP-bound Gi identified a motion for the AH-domain that pivots on the long axis of the <italic>α</italic>A helix. Surprisingly, this transverse motion qualitatively agrees with our nucleotide-free iMC analysis. The similarity of nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound motions is likely owed to ENM interactions between the Ras and AH domain in iMC, which mimic interactions of the nucleotide with each domain. Essential Dynamics Analysis (EDA) of AH domain motions upon ejection of GDP on the phosphate side from selected nanosecond time scale Targeted Molecular Dynamics trajectories furthermore revealed close agreement with motions from NMA analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref046">46</xref>]. The transverse motion likely plays a key role in GDP release and Gi activation at nanosecond time scales. By contrast, whereas the AH domain motion for G<italic>α</italic>s observed from KGS analysis also exhibits the small transverse component, it is mainly directed along a domain opening trajectory in agreement with DEER measurements, potentially additionally identifying longer, micro- to millisecond time-scales motions. While it is speculative to join analyses from two different proteins, these observations do suggest an activation mechanism whereby a transverse ‘rocking’ motion facilitates or results from GDP release, which in turn leads to a domain opening motion. For inactive, apo G<italic>α</italic>s, elevated mobility is centered on a hotspot near the GDP binding pocket, extending to the N-terminus of helix <italic>α</italic><sub>5</sub>, <italic>α</italic><sub>1</sub>, and the adjacent P-loop. The mobile helix <italic>α</italic><sub>4</sub> is conformationally coupled to the hub through <italic>β</italic><sub>6</sub>.</p>
<p>Previous studies established that a conformational ensemble obtained by maintaining hydrogen bonds through iteratively refitting rigid substructures agrees well with MD simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref057">57</xref>]. In our method, the coordinated motions on the constraint manifold resulting from hydrogen bond encode ‘natural’ modes of deformation. However, these coupled motions and broad diffusion by a carefully selected sampling strategy come at the expense of a greatly simplified energy function. It allows our method to overcome high-energy barriers, but can lead to conformations with high physical energies. Thus, care should be taken in interpreting individual ensemble members prior to extensive energy minimization. Hydrogen bonding networks enforce collective motions that couple conformational substates implicated in GDP release. Our results highlight that in addition to stabilizing tertiary structure, hydrogen bonding networks mediate molecular mechanisms and dynamics. Indeed, evidence is emerging that hydrogen bonds mediate longe-range, correlated motions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004361.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>Our nullspace sampling procedure with explicit, holonomic constraints can relate motion to function by revealing molecular mechanisms. It enables researchers to formulate testable hypotheses about networks of residues that facilitate motions implicated in GDP release and AH-domain motion. In addition, our procedure could be augmented with intra-molecular distance constraints obtained from experimental data.</p>
