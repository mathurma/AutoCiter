<abstract>
<p>Hsp90 is a conserved molecular chaperone that assists in the folding and function of diverse cellular regulators, with a profound impact on biology, disease, and evolution. As a central hub of protein interaction networks, Hsp90 engages with hundreds of protein–protein interactions within eukaryotic cells. These interactions include client proteins, which physically interact with Hsp90 and depend on the chaperone for stability or function, as well as co-chaperones and partner proteins that modulate chaperone function. Currently, there are no methods to accurately predict Hsp90 interactors and there has been considerable network rewiring over evolutionary time, necessitating experimental approaches to define the Hsp90 network in the species of interest. This is a pressing challenge for fungal pathogens, for which Hsp90 is a key regulator of stress tolerance, drug resistance, and virulence traits. To address this challenge, we applied a novel biochemical fractionation and quantitative proteomic approach to examine alterations to the proteome upon perturbation of Hsp90 in a leading human fungal pathogen, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. In parallel, we performed affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry to define physical interacting partners for Hsp90 and the Hsp90 co-chaperones and identified 164 Hsp90-interacting proteins, including 111 that are specific to the pathogen. We performed the first analysis of the Hsp90 interactome upon antifungal drug stress and demonstrated that Hsp90 stabilizes processing body (P-body) and stress granule proteins that contribute to drug tolerance. We also describe novel roles for Hsp90 in regulating posttranslational modification of the Rvb1-Rvb2-Tah1-Pih1 (R2TP) complex and the formation of protein aggregates in response to thermal stress. This study provides a global view of the Hsp90 interactome in a fungal pathogen, demonstrates the dynamic role of Hsp90 in response to environmental perturbations, and highlights a novel connection between Hsp90 and the regulation of mRNA-associated protein granules.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All organisms must maintain protein homeostasis, despite remarkable intracellular macromolecular crowding and exposure to environmental stressors that perturb protein folding. Elevated temperature is a ubiquitous stress that causes protein damage and misfolding, thereby disrupting protein function and exposing hydrophobic residues that can trigger aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref001">1</xref>]. The resulting stress-dependent aggregates are comprised of protein/mRNA-associated granules known as heat shock granules, processing bodies (P-bodies), or stress granules, depending on the proteins present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref004">4</xref>]. These aggregates are thought to function as a mechanism for attenuating translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref006">6</xref>] and protecting cells during periods of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref002">2</xref>], suggesting that the formation and disaggregation of these granules must be a regulated process. Thus far, the Hsp104 disaggregase and the Hsp70 chaperone protein are known to aid in a disassembly of aggregates upon a return to non-stressful conditions in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref005">5</xref>]. Other chaperone proteins are likely to assist in assembly or disaggregation of granules due to their ability to transiently bind other proteins to aid in their folding, function, trafficking, and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref007">7</xref>], but the roles of these other chaperones have not yet been defined.</p>
<p>A core hub of protein homeostasis networks in eukaryotes is the heat shock protein Hsp90, a conserved and essential molecular chaperone that assists in protein folding and activation, protein complex assembly, and protein ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref010">10</xref>]. Many of the client proteins that interact with Hsp90 and depend on the chaperone for proper form and function are kinases, transcription factors, or other signalling proteins, thus placing Hsp90 at the center of many signal transduction networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref011">11</xref>]. Hsp90 is also involved in loading small RNAs onto Argonaute proteins, thus regulating the RNA-induced silencing complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref013">13</xref>] and implicating Hsp90 in RNA-protein complex assembly. Hsp90 function is regulated both by posttranslational modifications and by dynamic interactions with co-chaperones that influence conformational changes associated with the chaperone cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref008">8</xref>]. As a consequence of its key roles in regulating protein homeostasis and cellular signaling, Hsp90 has a profound impact on diverse facets of biology and disease, and modulates the translation of genotype to phenotype and the capacity to evolve new traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Fungi provide tractable model systems to both explore the impact of Hsp90 on genotype to phenotype relationships and define chaperone networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref018">18</xref>]. Targeting the fungal chaperone network is also a promising approach to mitigate a serious threat to human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref020">20</xref>]. Fungal pathogens kill as many people as malaria and tuberculosis worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref021">21</xref>], and are a growing public health threat with the pervasive evolution of resistance to our current limited arsenal of antifungal drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref022">22</xref>]. In a leading human fungal pathogen, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, impairment of Hsp90 function abrogates drug resistance, reduces tolerance to a myriad of stresses, induces a morphological transition from yeast to filamentous growth, and attenuates virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref024">24</xref>]. Although targeting Hsp90 may provide a powerful strategy to cripple fungal pathogens, and diverse Hsp90 inhibitor chemotypes have been explored in anticancer programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref025">25</xref>], the antifungal utility of current Hsp90 inhibitors is compromised by toxicity due to concurrent inhibition of the host chaperone protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref026">26</xref>]. Thus, it is critical to identify fungal-selective Hsp90 inhibitors or components of the Hsp90 chaperone network that enable stress responses, drug resistance, and virulence, and that are sufficiently divergent to enable selective targeting in the pathogen. Only a few Hsp90 client proteins important for these traits have been identified in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, including the Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); components of the Protein Kinase C (PKC) cell wall integrity cascade (Pkc1, Bck1, Mkk1, and Mkc1); the catalytic subunit of the calcineurin phosphatase, Cna1; the Cka2 casein kinase; the Cdc28 cyclin-dependent kinase; the Hsf1 transcription factor; the Cdr1 transporter; and the Cyr1 adenylyl cyclase protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref032">32</xref>]. Despite previous comprehensive analyses of Hsp90 networks in the model yeast <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, the established divergence in Hsp90 chemical genetic interactions, gene essentiality, and gene function between the species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref033">33</xref>] highlights the importance of directly characterizing the Hsp90 chaperone network in the pathogen.</p>
<p>Here, we define the global proteomic changes in response to perturbation of protein homeostasis and map the Hsp90 interaction network in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. We used a biochemical fractionation and quantitative proteomic approach to monitor the impact of Hsp90 perturbation on the proteome, and leveraged affinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify Hsp90 physical interaction partners. We also examined how the interaction network changes upon environmental perturbations, such as exposure to antifungal drug stress. In our downstream analyses, we evaluated the functional dependence of novel interactors on Hsp90, establishing Pbs2 as a new Hsp90 client that is influenced by environmental stress. Our analyses also revealed a role for Hsp90 in the regulation of stress-dependent posttranslational modification of Rvb1, a member of the Rvb1-Rvb2-Tah1-Pih1 (R2TP) complex. We further demonstrate that Hsp90 regulates the stability of stress granule and P-body proteins, including Dhh1, Kre30, and Cam1, and establish a connection between Hsp90 dependence and the formation of aggregates under thermal stress. Additionally, these stress granule and P-body proteins contribute to antifungal drug tolerance. Together, this greatly expands our knowledge of how Hsp90 regulates cellular stress responses and defines a protein homeostasis network in a human fungal pathogen.</p>

<title>Defining the Hsp90 interactome in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic></title>
<p>To characterize the impact of Hsp90 on the proteome and define the Hsp90 interactome, we used a combination of targeted affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and whole-cell quantitative proteomic approaches to identify proteins that interact with Hsp90 and depend on Hsp90 for stability. We first examined the physical interactors of Hsp90 by performing AP-MS analysis of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> Hsp90 and Hsp90 co-chaperones under standard laboratory growth conditions. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, identification of interactions between Hsp90 and client proteins was aided by the use of an E33A mutant of Hsp90 that effectively traps client proteins by decreasing Hsp90 ATPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref035">35</xref>]. We created the analogous heterozygous mutant (E36A) of Hsp90 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and then added a C-terminal tandem affinity purification (TAP) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag. To confirm that the tag and E36A substitution did not interrupt normal dimerization of Hsp90, we performed immunoprecipitation of the GFP-tagged Hsp90 proteins and demonstrated that the tagged proteins co-purified with untagged Hsp90 in western immunoblots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Similarly, an N-terminally tagged Hsp90 protein also co-purified untagged Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Additionally, we generated C-terminally TAP-tagged versions of nine Hsp90 co-chaperones (Aha1, Cdc37, Cpr6, Cpr7, Cns1, Hch1, Sba1, Sti1, and Sgt1) to more broadly map the Hsp90 interactome. We affinity purified each co-chaperone using immunoglobulin G (IgG) beads followed by tobacco etch virus (TEV)-protease cleavage and a second round of purification using calmodulin beads. To distinguish interactors from background, we used Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINTexpress) to compare the interactors identified with those identified with an unrelated TAP-tagged protein, Cas5, using a false discovery rate of 2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Through this analysis, we identified 256 significant associations for Hsp90 and the Hsp90 co-chaperones, covering 188 unique proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s006">S1 Table</xref>).

We then sorted the Hsp90 physical interaction dataset into functional categories based on gene ontology (GO) term mapping and hand annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We categorized Hsp90 interactors into clusters comprised of proteins involved in RNA binding and metabolism, cellular transport, metabolism, protein fate, and signalling, highlighting the diverse cellular processes impacted by Hsp90.</p>

<p>Notably, we were not able to observe interactions between Hsp90 and all of the Hsp90 co-chaperones through this approach. One hypothesis is that although the C-terminal tag on Hsp90 does not prevent Hsp90 dimerization or function, it could interfere with proteins binding to the Hsp90 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref015">15</xref>]. For example, the C-terminally tagged Hsp90 protein did not identify the Sti1 co-chaperone as an interactor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s006">S1 Table</xref>), presumably because this protein binds to the TPR domain at the C terminus of Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref037">37</xref>]. Using TAP-tagged Sti1 as the bait, however, we identified untagged Hsp90 as a strong interactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s006">S1 Table</xref>), highlighting the utility of the co-chaperone interactors in defining the Hsp90 network in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.</p>
<p>As an orthogonal approach to examine the Hsp90 interactome in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, we examined the proteome in response to perturbations to Hsp90. To allow for a quantitative and multiplexed analysis, we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) experiments to differentially label each sample. This experiment required auxotrophies to adequately label the proteins with stable isotopes; therefore, we generated a lysine auxotroph by deleting both alleles of <italic>LYS2</italic> from the diploid wild-type parental strain. We then used unlabeled L-lysine (light), <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-L-lysine (heavy), or 4,4,5,5-D<sub>4</sub>-L-Lysine (medium) to differentially label samples. For genetic control of <italic>HSP90</italic>, we first deleted one allele and placed the remaining allele under control of a tetracycline-repressible <italic>tetO</italic> promoter in the <italic>lys2</italic>Δ<italic>/lys2</italic>Δ strain background. This strain was then treated with the tetracycline analog doxycycline (DOX) for transcriptional repression of <italic>HSP90</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). As a complementary approach to compromise Hsp90 function, we used a potent and specific natural product inhibitor, geldanamycin (GdA), at 15 μM. These treatments did not impair viability but induced a morphological transition from yeast to filaments, consistent with inhibition of Hsp90 function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s002">S2B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref024">24</xref>]. We then performed deep fractionation of the soluble protein extracts under non-denaturing conditions using ion exchange–high performance liquid chromatography (IEX-HPLC), generating 120 fractions per sample. These methods were developed to maintain protein complexes and protein–protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref038">38</xref>]. Each sample was then examined by nano-flow liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the proteins present in each collected fraction.</p>
<p>Using this approach, we identified 1,177 distinct proteins, covering approximately 20% of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> proteome in the untreated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s007">S2 Table</xref>). This co-fractionation and LC-MS/MS approach had been used to identify stably interacting protein complexes based on co-elution in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref038">38</xref>], but has not been previously attempted for a fungal pathogen. From co-elution data, it is possible to identify new protein complexes without prior knowledge of complex formation, making it a useful tool to explore understudied organisms. For each of the conditions, the Spearman rank correlation of intensities, averaging ties, was computed for each pair of genes using the EGAD R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref039">39</xref>]. Taking the correlations for each condition as a network, the proteins were then clustered using affinity propagation using the apcluster R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref040">40</xref>]. Using this method, we identified 37 putative co-eluting clusters, which potentially represent protein complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s007">S2 Table</xref>). As an example, we identified a cluster comprised of each component of the 20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Together, these data highlight our ability to identify putative stable protein complexes based on co-fractionation.</p>

<p>Next, we compared the intensity, elution profile, and clustering of the identified proteins upon alterations in proteostasis induced by <italic>HSP90</italic> genetic depletion or inhibition, as compared with the untreated control sample. We identified 400 proteins for which abundance was altered by at least 1.5-fold in at least two fractions upon both Hsp90 inhibition and depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s008">S3 Table</xref>). As an example, we observed that both depletion and inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in increased levels of 20S proteasome proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). To examine this set in more detail, we examined proteasome protein levels in response to Hsp90 depletion in the <italic>tetO-HSP90/hsp90</italic>Δ strain or in response to treatment with GdA by western blotting. In the DOX-treated <italic>tetO-HSP90/hsp90</italic>Δ cells or the GdA-treated wild-type cells, we observed an increase in proteasome protein levels compared with vehicle controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), validating these SILAC protein quantifications.</p>
<p>In addition to changes in entire protein complexes, we can also examine specific proteins to determine their abundance upon depletion of Hsp90. Because of the established role of Hsp90 in stabilizing kinases, we examined the profiles of kinases identified in the proteomic analyses and observed 21 kinases with a &gt;1.5-fold change in abundance upon Hsp90 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s008">S3 Table</xref>). To examine an example kinase in more detail, we created a GFP-tagged version of the Mck1 dual specificity kinase protein in the wild-type and <italic>tetO-HSP90/hsp90</italic>Δ strains. Upon Hsp90 depletion with DOX, we observed that the Mck1-GFP protein decreased in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), demonstrating that Mck1 depends on Hsp90 for stability. From our combination of AP-MS approaches and proteome-level depletion quantifications, we identified proteins that both interact with Hsp90 and depend on Hsp90 for stability. In sum, we mapped the Hsp90 physical interaction network and defined proteomic changes upon Hsp90 inhibition.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>The Hsp90 interactome is modulated by stress</title>
<p>A key feature of the Hsp90 genetic interaction network is that it is environmentally contingent, with many genetic interactions only observed in the presence of an additional stressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref033">33</xref>]. However, for protein–protein interactions to change, there must be alterations in protein abundance, localization, or biochemical properties that could change the ability of two proteins to interact. In the model yeast <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, changes in Hsp90 interactors in response to stress have only been examined after treating cells with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) as a DNA-damaging stress, and in this study, relatively few proteins changed in their interaction with Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref041">41</xref>]. Because of the importance of Hsp90 for antifungal drug tolerance, we examined whether the Hsp90 interactome was altered upon exposure to two different antifungal drugs with distinct modes of action. For these experiments, we incubated cells with either the azole antifungal drug fluconazole, which targets biosynthesis of the membrane sterol ergosterol, or with the echinocandin antifungal drug caspofungin, which inhibits biosynthesis of cell wall ß-1,3-glucan. Both antifungals were used at concentrations that inhibit growth by approximately 20%. We then performed affinity purification of Hsp90<sup>E36A</sup>-GFP using “GFP-trap” resin, followed by mass spectrometry. This single-step purification allows for more quantitative measurements of changes in the Hsp90 interactome. To distinguish interactors from background, we compared interactors identified with Hsp90<sup>E36A</sup>-GFP with those identified with a control Eno1-GFP using SAINTexpress and a Bayesian false discovery rate (BFDR) cutoff of 2% to define significant interactors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s009">S4 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>We then examined the correlation in prey abundance of the significant physical interactors between the drug-treated and untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We identified 16 proteins that had at least a 2-fold change in peptide abundance upon drug treatment and many that were only significant interactors with Hsp90 under drug stress conditions. Overall, we observed a stronger correlation in peptide abundance between the untreated and fluconazole-treated samples (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.4185) than between the untreated and caspofungin-treated samples (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.1208) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The difference between the Pearson correlation coefficients is 0.29, which is statistically significant under the Fisher z-test (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0075), and Zou's 95% confidence interval (0.078–0.52) excludes 0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref043">43</xref>]. One signature was increased pulldown of translational regulators such as Sup35, Sup45, and Cam1 in response to caspofungin stress, but not in response to fluconazole. Together, these data demonstrate that there are shifts in the physical interactome of Hsp90 in response to antifungal drug treatment, suggesting that Hsp90 plays different roles in regulating proteostasis in response to different environmental perturbations.</p>

<title>Identification of a novel Hsp90 client protein in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic></title>
<p>We leveraged our analysis of the Hsp90 interactome to define Hsp90 client proteins in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. One interesting candidate was Pbs2, which is the kinase directly upstream of Hog1 in the Hog1 MAPK cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref044">44</xref>]. Hog1 is an established client of Hsp90 in both <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, and we have previously observed that Hsp90 can chaperone multiple steps of a single kinase cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref027">27</xref>]. We found that Pbs2 decreased in abundance in Hsp90 pulldowns with fluconazole treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We validated that endogenous untagged Hsp90 and C-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Pbs2 physically interact by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-HA agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

This occurred despite an increase in <italic>PBS2</italic> transcripts, demonstrating that the decrease in Pbs2 occurs at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Treatment with fluconazole was also sufficient to reduce Pbs2-HA levels, while treatment with caspofungin had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The reduction in Pbs2-HA levels upon fluconazole treatment was not due to a change in transcript levels, as quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments revealed no significant changes in <italic>PBS2</italic> levels upon drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). We had previously observed that membrane stress conditions, such as alterations in ergosterol biosynthesis, can overwhelm the functional capacity of Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref033">33</xref>]; this is consistent with the finding that the altered interaction between Hsp90 and Pbs2 was specific to membrane stress conditions. Together, this defines Pbs2 as an Hsp90 client in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and highlights the environmental contingency of Hsp90 interactions.</p>

<p>The CCT complex is required for tolerance to caspofungin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref027">27</xref>], but the R2TP complex has not been examined in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, Rvb1 and Rvb2 associate with Hsp90 through the Tah1 and Pih1 co-chaperones, and Hsp90 is required for Pih1 stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref045">45</xref>]. To investigate the relationship between Hsp90 and Rvb1/Rvb2 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, we first examined the levels of Rvb1 and Rvb2 proteins after antifungal drug treatment by western blotting. Upon treatment with fluconazole, the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> Rvb1 protein migrated as two bands, separated by approximately 10 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). There was no change in the Rvb2 protein migration upon drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We then examined Rvb1 levels in response to Hsp90 depletion in the <italic>tetO-HSP90/hsp90</italic>Δ strain. In DOX-treated <italic>tetO-HSP90/hsp90</italic>Δ cells, Rvb1 migrated as two bands, similar to what was seen in response to fluconazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). DOX treatment of the wild-type strain had no effect on Rvb1 migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Overall, this suggests that Hsp90 has a repressive effect on the posttranslational modification of Rvb1.</p>
<p>Next, we explored which posttranslational modification(s) could result in this altered Rvb1 migration. The increase in molecular weight is consistent with sumoylation, and high-throughput studies in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> predicted an interaction between the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) Smt3 protein and Rvb1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref046">46</xref>]. To test whether Rvb1 is sumoylated in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, we took advantage of an <italic>smt3</italic>Δ<italic>/smt3</italic>Δ mutant strain, in which the only SUMO-encoding locus has been deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref047">47</xref>]. In the absence of Smt3, treatment with fluconazole did not alter mobility of Rvb1, supporting the hypothesis that the posttranslational modification of Rvb1 is sumoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). We then used an anti-Smt3 antibody to immunoprecipitate sumoylated proteins from lysates of the wild-type or <italic>tetO-HSP90/hsp90</italic>Δ strain grown in the presence or absence of DOX. Probing with an anti-Rvb1 antibody revealed a band of the same size as the higher molecular weight Rvb1 band only when Hsp90 was repressed, consistent with Rvb1 being sumoylated in response to Hsp90 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>One potential mechanism for the increased sumolyation of Rvb1 upon Hsp90 depletion may be through Ulp1, a SUMO deconjugating enzyme that we identified as an Hsp90 physical interactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g001">Fig 1</xref>). If Ulp1 is an Hsp90 client, then compromise of Hsp90 function could reduce SUMO deconjugating activity, thereby increasing Rvb1 sumoylation. Therefore, we examined Ulp1 stability in response to Hsp90 depletion in the <italic>tetO-HSP90/hsp90</italic>Δ strain. In the DOX-treated <italic>tetO-HSP90/hsp90</italic>Δ cells, Ulp1 protein levels were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), suggesting that Ulp1 is a client of Hsp90. Together, these data demonstrate an interaction between Hsp90 and other chaperone complexes, in which Hsp90 represses the sumoylation of Rvb1 through interactions with the client protein Ulp1.</p>
<p>Ulp1 is a known physical interactor of Hsp90 in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref046">46</xref>], and the putative sumoylation site in Rvb1 (lysine 228) is conserved between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. Therefore, we examined Rvb1 and Rvb2 levels in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> after treatment with fluconazole to see whether sumoylation is a conserved fungal response to fluconazole stress. However, we did not observe a shift in molecular weight for either <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Rvb1 or Rvb2 proteins in response to fluconazole, suggesting that this response may be specific to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g005">Fig 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>Hsp90 stabilizes stress granule and P-body proteins</title>
<p>Through our proteomic experiments, we identified that Hsp90 interacts with or regulates the stability of many proteins involved in P-bodies, stress granules, and RNA binding. In our AP-MS experiments, we identified multiple stress granule or P-body proteins that interact with Hsp90, especially upon treatment with caspofungin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<p>To test whether some of these proteins with roles in stress granules or P-bodies depend on Hsp90 for stability, we generated C-terminally GFP- or HA-tagged strains in the wild-type and <italic>tetO-HSP90/hsp90</italic>Δ backgrounds. We chose Pab1, as it is a canonical stress granule marker, and Dhh1 as a canonical P-body marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref051">51</xref>], as well as Cam1 and Kre30, which are predicted to aggregate in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> based on similarity to their <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> homologs (Cam1 and Arb1) but have not been characterized previously in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. We monitored the stability of each of these proteins via western blotting after transcriptional repression of <italic>HSP90</italic> with DOX. We observed that Kre30 and Dhh1 were highly dependent upon Hsp90 for stability, with the GFP-tagged proteins reduced to close to the detection limit upon Hsp90 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). <italic>KRE30</italic> transcript levels were reduced by 50% upon Hsp90 depletion, while <italic>DHH1</italic> transcripts were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), demonstrating that the impact of Hsp90 depletion on Kre30 and Dhh1 is largely at the protein level. Cam1 stability was also dependent on Hsp90, with a 50% decrease in protein levels despite an increase in transcript levels upon Hsp90 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g006">Fig 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Finally, Pab1 did not appear to depend on Hsp90 for stability, as there was only a 30% decrease in protein levels and a corresponding 50% decrease in transcript levels upon Hsp90 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g006">Fig 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Together, this suggests that Kre30, Dhh1, and Cam1 are clients of Hsp90, while Pab1 is not. We also examined the levels of Pab1, Cam1, Kre30, and Dhh1 upon fluconazole or caspofungin treatment, and observed no major decreases in protein or transcript levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s004">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). This suggests that the observed changes in peptide counts for these proteins under drug stress are not due to a lack of the bait protein and instead could reflect a change in localization or requirement for chaperoning by these proteins.</p>
<p>Previous work in mammalian cells demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibition prevents P-body formation and decreases localization of specific protein to stress granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref054">54</xref>]. To test whether Hsp90 influences stress granule or P-body formation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, we first needed to establish that these proteins form aggregates, and differentiate between stress granules and P-bodies based on co-localization with the stress granule protein Pab1. We tagged Pab1 with red fluorescent protein (RFP) in the Cam1, Kre30, and Dhh1 GFP-tagged strain backgrounds and then treated the cells with a short heat shock (46°C for 10 minutes), as this treatment is sufficient to induce reversible protein aggregation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref002">2</xref>]. We observed clear punctae of fluorescence in strains with tagged Pab1, Kre30, Cam1, and Dhh1 after a 10-minute incubation at 46°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), consistent with the formation of stress-induced aggregates. Pab1 appeared to co-localize with Kre30, suggesting that these proteins are primarily in stress granules at 46°C. However, Pab1 did not fully co-localize with Cam1 or Dhh1, consistent with these proteins forming P-bodies that can be separate from the stress granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).</p>

<p>We then tested a range of temperature treatments to find the minimum temperature required to induce aggregation for each of these proteins. We hypothesized that increasing thermal stress would gradually overwhelm the functional capacity of Hsp90 and prevent it from chaperoning these proteins. The P-body protein Dhh1 was present as punctae at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), consistent with the idea that P-bodies are present at low numbers under basal growth conditions and increased upon stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref055">55</xref>]. Similar aggregates were observed when Dhh1 was tagged with RFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Surprisingly, treatment at a host physiological febrile temperature stress of 39°C for 10 minutes was sufficient to induce aggregates of Kre30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Aggregation of Cam1 occurred after incubation at 42°C for 10 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), and Pab1 only formed aggregates after incubation at 46°C for 10 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The temperature at which these proteins aggregated is correlated with the dependence of each protein on Hsp90 for stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), with Dhh1 and Kre30 showing both a strong dependence on Hsp90 for stability and a propensity towards aggregation. Together, this suggests that Hsp90 chaperone function is required to regulate the aggregation and localization of these proteins.</p>

<p>To build a protein–protein interaction network for Hsp90, we performed AP-MS on C-terminally tagged Hsp90 with the E36A “trap” mutant, which allows for the identification of increased numbers of Hps90 client proteins based on this substitution preventing the normal Hsp90 chaperone cycle. A limitation of this dataset is that we focused on interactions obtained with C-terminally tagged Hsp90. The presence of a C-terminal tag does not interfere with Hsp90 dimerization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), but it may prevent the binding of proteins to the C-terminal domain of Hsp90, especially those that bind to the TPR domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref015">15</xref>]. We also leveraged our AP-MS analysis of nine Hsp90 co-chaperones to illuminate additional components of the Hsp90 physical interaction network in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.</p>
<p>In parallel, we examined global proteome changes upon Hsp90 perturbations by measuring protein abundance and elution profiles in response to both transcriptional repression and pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90. Similar to our previous RNA sequencing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref056">56</xref>], transcriptional repression and pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in different effects to the cell, with Hsp90 transcriptional repression having more dramatic effects on the proteome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000358.s008">S3 Table</xref>). Together, our data greatly expand upon what we know about the Hsp90 interactome in this fungal pathogen, as only 25% of the identified interactors had been previously described in other species. This provides a foundation for investigating the specific roles for this conserved chaperone protein in this pathogen.</p>
<p>We leveraged these analyses to uncover new mechanisms through which Hsp90 regulates cellular responses to stress. First, we explored the role of Hsp90 as a classic chaperone of signal transduction cascades. We established that Pbs2, the kinase directly upstream of Hog1, is a client of Hsp90. The Hog1 signalling cascade is a key regulator of virulence, stress tolerance, and antifungal drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref059">59</xref>]. Similar to what we have previously observed for the Pkc1-MAPK cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref027">27</xref>], this analysis suggests that Hsp90 stabilizes multiple components of the Hog1-MAPK cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref028">28</xref>], although the effects of Hsp90 on allowing the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of Hog1 may be due in part to Hsp90 chaperoning of the Pbs2 kinase. Notably, previous work in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> demonstrated that multiple components of a signalling cascade may be degraded upon Hsp90 depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref060">60</xref>]; however, this did not appear to be through direct chaperoning of these proteins. Further analysis of the dynamic interactions between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> Hsp90 and multiple components of a single signalling cascade will likely reveal new insights into molecular control that enables the rapid sensing of environmental stresses and orchestration of crucial adaptive responses. Potentially, chaperoning multiple components of the same cascade may allow for fine-tuning of stress responses.</p>
<p>We also explored the role of Hsp90 in regulating protein posttranslational modification. The R2TP complex associates with Hsp90 in many organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref061">61</xref>]. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, we observed a physical interaction between Hsp90 and both Rvb1 and Rvb2, with the strength of the association modulated by stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000358.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We established that Rvb1 is sumoylated upon depletion of Hsp90 or upon fluconazole-induced cell membrane stress, which is thought to increase the cellular demand for Hsp90 and overwhelm its functional capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref033">33</xref>]. This specific posttranslational modification of Rvb1 has not been previously explored in other organisms, although in mammalian cells, Rvb2 is sumoylated to control nuclear localization of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref062">62</xref>]. Notably, we did not observe a change in either Rvb1 or Rvb2 posttranslational modifications in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> upon fluconazole treatment, suggesting that this regulation of the R2TP complex by Hsp90 may be specific to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. Future experiments will address the functions of the R2TP complex in chromatin remodeling, telomerase assembly, and small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) synthesis in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and how these functions are regulated by Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref061">61</xref>].</p>
<p>Our findings also implicate Hsp90 in regulating mRNA-associated granule formation upon stress. The canonical chaperones involved in the formation and disaggregation of mRNA-associated granules are Hsp70 and Hsp104 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref005">5</xref>]. However, we demonstrate that Hsp90 is required for the stability of multiple predicted mRNA binding proteins, including Dhh1, Kre30, and, Cam1. We established that all of these proteins form aggregates in response to heat stress, but that the minimum temperature required to induce aggregation varied for each protein. The proteins that were most dependent on Hsp90 for stability were also those that aggregated at the lowest temperatures. This suggests that in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, Hsp90 may be the key chaperone that regulates aggregation, as deletion of Hsp104 has little effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref063">63</xref>]. This may have profound implications for stress granule assembly in other systems, such as in the context of human cells, where protein interactions in stress granules are modulated by stress and aberrant dynamics are associated with disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref064">64</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the importance of Hsp90 in eukaryotic cell biology, exploring the chaperone network is a powerful approach to probe new facets of cellular function and regulation and to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention. As a core hub of protein homeostasis and cellular signalling, Hsp90 has emerged as a promising target for diverse diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and infections caused by eukaryotic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref066">66</xref>]. As a highly conserved chaperone that is essential for the viability of all eukaryotes tested, there are inherent challenges of selectively targeting Hsp90 in the context of disease while mitigating host toxicity. There has been considerable progress with targeting specific isoforms of Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref068">68</xref>], and there is potential to exploit differences in Hsp90 conformational states between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000358.ref070">70</xref>]. Our findings further emphasize the opportunity of targeting other components of the Hsp90 chaperone network. We find that there are many Hsp90 clients and functional relationships that are not conserved between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and the model yeast. This may suggest differences in biophysical properties of specific proteins between the species that alter dependence on Hsp90 or that organisms can engage distinct strategies to regulate the form and function of metastable proteins. These possibilities resonate with our findings of distinct Hsp90 interaction profiles in response to stress, which can alter protein conformation, activation, localization, and expression levels. By mapping the Hsp90 chaperone network, we have revealed new vulnerabilities in fungal pathogens that could be exploited for the development of strategies to cripple fungal pathogens and treat life-threatening infectious disease.</p>

For repression of Hsp90 gene expression, identical overnight cultures were grown, supplemented with 0.5 μg/mL DOX, and 50-mL subcultures with 5 μg/mL DOX. All cultures were grown for 4 hours at 30°C in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 200 rpm shaking to mid-log phase. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000<italic>g</italic>, washed in 1 mL ice -cold PBS, collected at 12,000<italic>g</italic> in 2-mL screw-cap tubes, then flash frozen and stored at −80°C.</p>
<p>Cell pellets were then resuspended in 1 mL of lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl, and 20% glycerol, with one protease inhibitor cocktail (complete, EDTA-free tablet, Roche Diagnostics) per 10 mL, 1 mM PMSF (EMD Millipore Chemicals, Etobicoke, ON, Canada), and 20 mM sodium molybdate (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) added fresh before use. The tube was filled with acid-washed glass beads until the beads were just below the meniscus at the top of the tube to reduce foaming during bead beating. Cells were disrupted by bead beating twice for 4 minutes, with a 7-minute break on ice between cycles. Lysates were recovered by a stacked transfer and then clarified by centrifugation at 15,339 rcf for 10 minutes at 4°C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis.</p>
