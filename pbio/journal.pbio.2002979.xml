<abstract>
<p>There is currently a demand for new highly efficient and specific drugs to treat osteoporosis, a chronic bone disease affecting millions of people worldwide. We have developed a combinatorial strategy for engineering bispecific inhibitors that simultaneously target the unique combination of c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, which act in concert to facilitate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Using functional fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based screening assays of random mutagenesis macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) libraries against c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, we engineered dual-specific M-CSF mutants with high affinity to both receptors. These bispecific mutants act as functional antagonists of c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin activation and hence of osteoclast differentiation in vitro and osteoclast activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. This study thus introduces a versatile platform for the creation of new-generation therapeutics with high efficacy and specificity for osteoporosis and other bone diseases. It also provides new tools for studying molecular mechanisms and the cell signaling pathways that mediate osteoclast differentiation and function.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Many bone diseases—including osteoporosis, in which the bones become brittle and fragile from loss of tissue—are characterized by excessive and uncontrolled bone resorption by bone-destroying cells known as osteoclasts. Therefore, controlled and specific inhibition of osteoclast activity is a desired outcome in treatments for bone diseases. Osteoclast differentiation and function are coordinated by cell surface receptors, including c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, which cooperate with one another to drive signals that are essential for osteoclast functions. Here, we describe the engineering, characterization, and testing of novel proteins that can target and inhibit both c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin at the same time, thereby providing a way of controlling osteoclast function. The study represents the first example of engineering a natural ligand, which acts as a signaling molecule, as a scaffold for binding not only its target protein but also a second target. We show that these engineered proteins inhibit osteoclast activity in a mouse model of osteoporosis. Our study describes potential inhibitors that target all the known functions resulting from c-FMS/integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> crosstalk and paves the way to create novel targeting proteins that could be used to treat osteoporosis. It also expands our understanding of the role of the c-FMS/α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin pathway in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation and function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteoporosis, a chronic skeletal disorder common in both women and men beyond the age of 50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref001">1</xref>], is the underlying cause of more than 8.9 million fractures annually worldwide, with the consequent high burden of social and economic costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref002">2</xref>]. The drugs initially used for the management of osteoporosis in women were based on estrogens, but long-term administration of these drugs is associated with increased risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref005">5</xref>]. To date, the most commonly prescribed drugs for osteoporosis are bisphosphonates, but these drugs, too, have nonspecific adverse side effects, such as gastrointestinal toxicity, renal toxicity, hypercalcemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref006">6</xref>]. A different therapeutic direction was recently opened with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the receptor for activation of the nuclear factor–kappa B (NF-кB) ligand (RANKL) antibody, denosumab, but the clinical promise of this drug has been offset by reports of adverse side effects, such as hypocalcemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref007">7</xref>] and atypical hip fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref008">8</xref>]. Thus, there is a pressing need for new efficient and highly specific drugs for the management of osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Central to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is excessive bone resorption by osteoclasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref009">9</xref>]. These cells differentiate from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage upon stimulation of two essential factors, monocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and RANKL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref010">10</xref>]. The importance of M-CSF and its receptor c-FMS in osteoclast function has been clearly illustrated in a study showing that both M-CSF–deficient and c-FMS–deficient mice suffer from retarded skeletal growth and osteopetrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref011">11</xref>]. Another factor that is essential for osteoclast functioning is α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, as indicated, for example, in studies showing increased bone mass in integrin β<sub>3</sub> knockout mice due to a functional defect in their osteoclasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref015">15</xref>]. The interaction of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin with the bone matrix induces a cytoskeleton organization that polarizes the osteoclast's resorptive machinery to the bone/cell interface, where it creates an isolated compartment consisting of an actin ring surrounding a ruffled border essential for resorption by the matured osteoclasts.</p>
<p>Importantly, in addition to the distinctive roles of c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin in osteoclast activity, these two factors also play a cooperative role in bone resorption. M-CSF signaling regulates bone resorption by crosstalk through its receptor c-FMS, with the signaling being activated by α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin. This signaling regulates cytoskeleton rearrangement, as both M-CSF and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin stimulate the same c-Src–initiated signaling complex essential for regulation of the osteoclast cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref018">18</xref>]. In addition, c-FMS alters the conformation of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin from a low-affinity to a high-affinity state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref019">19</xref>], and it activates the Rho GTPase family member Rac (which is essential for osteoclast cytoskeleton organization) in an α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-integrin–dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref020">20</xref>]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that β<sub>3</sub>-integrin–deficient mice have elevated concentrations of serum M-CSF and that impaired expression of differentiation markers of β<sub>3</sub>-integrin–deficient osteoclasts can be rescued by an increased concentration of M-CSF, suggesting a compensation mechanism between the actions of these receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition, c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin colocalize to the osteoclast cytoskeleton, suggesting that the crosstalk between these receptors takes place at the same cellular sites. Indeed, it has been shown that an endogenic complex of c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin coprecipitates from differentiated osteoclasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, the functional and spatial coupling of c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin in osteoclast differentiation and function, together with the osteoclast-exclusive presentation and crosstalk of these two receptors, suggests that an antagonist that could bind simultaneously to these two target receptors would serve as a highly specific and effective antiresorptive drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>We thus aimed to exploit both the osteoclast's need for functional c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and the specific expression of these two factors as a platform for developing a new generation of bispecific c-FMS/α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin antagonists for application in osteoporosis therapy and as tools to study osteoclast biology. In our rational design, two focused libraries were constructed, in each of which an Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) sequence (a motif crucial for α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin ligand binding) flanked by random amino acids was introduced into the dimerization interface of the M-CSF ligand with the aim to change its activity from agonistic to antagonistic. This modification blocks the interactions between two M-CSF monomers and hence their subsequent homodimerization and activation of the M-CSF/c-FMS signal transduction cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Our combinatorial strategy to further develop this unique antagonist involved the screening of the abovementioned focused libraries against α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin. Thereafter, functional FACS-based screening assays were applied to quantitatively select for M-CSF mutants with the highest expression, stabilities and affinities for both α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and c-FMS. With this approach, we generated a number of unique dual-specific M-CSF mutants capable of binding to and antagonizing the biological activity of both c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Testing the compatibility of the M-CSF/c-FMS system with the yeast surface display method</title>
<p>The M-CSF glycoprotein is secreted as a homodimer that, upon binding to two c-FMS receptors, induces c-FMS autophosphorylation followed by activation of downstream signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref023">23</xref>]. Our strategy for converting M-CSF from an agonist into an antagonist of the c-FMS receptor relied on impairing the ability of M-CSF to dimerize. To this end, we exploited the critical role of the cysteine in position 31 in the covalent dimerization of wild-type M-CSF (M-CSF<sub>WT</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref024">24</xref>], namely, we generated a mutant M-CSF with impaired covalent dimerization capability (designated M-CSF<sub>C31S</sub>) by replacing C31 with a serine residue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). To determine whether the M-CSF<sub>C31S</sub>/c-FMS system was indeed compatible with the yeast surface display (YSD) method, we transformed the M-CSF<sub>C31S</sub> gene into <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and determined M-CSF<sub>C31S</sub> protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>) and binding to soluble c-FMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). To evaluate the binding affinity of M-CSF<sub>C31S</sub> for c-FMS in the YSD system, we measured its apparent binding to different concentrations of soluble c-FMS (k<sub>D,app</sub> = 20 nM; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). The observed K<sub>D,app</sub> did indeed resemble the K<sub>D</sub> of 13.6 nM known from the literature for the M-CSF homodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref025">25</xref>], thereby validating the compatibility of YSD with the M-CSF<sub>C31S</sub>/c-FMS system.</p>

<title>Engineering and selection of M-CSF harboring RGD motif proteins with high affinity for c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin</title>
<p>To construct a dual-specific M-CSF monomer that can bind both c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, two libraries were created by replacing one of two loops on the M-CSF<sub>C31S</sub> scaffold with RGD, flanked by three random amino acids on each side, namely, by XXXRGDXXX, where X represents any random amino acid (designated M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s001">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). To identify and isolate M-CSF variants with high affinity for both c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, we generated a YSD construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) that allowed us to separate high-affinity clones from low-affinity clones by using flow cytometry. After confirming that M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> libraries were well expressed on the surface of the yeast cell wall and that these libraries did indeed bind 100 nM soluble c-FMS and 500 nM α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), we merged the two libraries and regarded them as a single library that consisted of 1.1 × 10<sup>7</sup> variants. For affinity maturation, the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> library was sorted in a stepwise manner against α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and c-FMS by using FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). To identify the specific variants that would bind both c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, we tested individual clones for c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin binding and identified three unique clones with high affinity for both receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). These M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants were designated 4.22, 4.24 (both from sort four), and 5.6 (from sort five) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s001">S1F Fig</xref>). Selective binding of these three variants to α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and not to other integrins was confirmed by evaluating their binding to α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>, α<sub>iib</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrins (250 nM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Since all three variants showed high specificity for α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, they were regarded as good candidates for osteoclast-specific drug development, since osteoclasts express high levels of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin as early as 48 h of differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref026">26</xref>].</p>

<title>Production, purification, and characterization of bispecific M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants and monospecific M-CSF controls</title>
<p>We produced the bispecific M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> protein variants and their monospecific controls, M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s001">S1E Fig</xref>) and M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s001">S1D Fig</xref>), with the aim to characterize these proteins in their soluble forms. The proteins were expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>, glycans were removed, and the nonglycosylated proteins were purified by using affinity and size exclusion chromatography, giving the expected size of approximately 21 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s007">S7A and S7E Fig</xref>). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the purified proteins showed similar curves, corresponding to a protein that consists mostly of α-helix motifs, which means that the RGD loops did not cause a significant change in the protein secondary structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). The CD spectra were also exploited to determine the melting temperatures of the proteins, giving 73 °C for variant 4.22, 77.5 °C for variant 4.24, 85 °C for variant 5.6, and 68.7 °C for M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub>; the melting temperature for M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> could not be determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s007">S7D Fig</xref>). The exact molecular weights of the purified variants and monospecific controls, determined by mass spectrometry, were as follows: 21.7 kDa for both variant 4.22 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s007">S7B Fig</xref>) and variant 4.24, 22 kDa for variant 5.6, 21.8 kDa for M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub>, and 21.7 kDa for M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub>.</p>
<p>To ensure that our purified proteins did not dimerize and would thus be able to inhibit c-FMS dimerization and downstream signaling, we incubated the proteins with the cross-linker reagent BS<sup>3</sup> (bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate) to enhance noncovalent intermolecular interactions and to enable visualization of these interactions. As expected, the three bispecific M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> proteins as well as the monospecific M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> and M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> proteins did not dimerize even at a very high BS<sup>3</sup> concentration of 2500 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). In contrast, M-CSF<sub>WT</sub> did dimerize at the very low BS<sup>3</sup> concentration of 25 μM. Since M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> and M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> do not dimerize in solution, they are expected to bind c-FMS and prevent its dimerization and activation.</p>

<title>Purified bispecific proteins bind c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin with different affinities but do not bind other RGD binding integrins</title>
<p>An optimal competitor for native protein receptors should exhibit a higher binding affinity (lower K<sub>D</sub>) than the binding affinities of their natural ligands. The K<sub>D</sub> of M-CSF<sub>WT</sub> to its c-FMS receptor lies in the low nanomolar range (13.6 nM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref025">25</xref>]. The binding affinity of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin to its natural ligand, vitronectin, is 40.7 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref027">27</xref>]. The binding affinities of M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub>, M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub>, and M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> to c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin were obtained from the equilibrium-binding phase of the sensorgrams measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). The affinities of the protein variants to c-FMS were lower than those of M-CSF<sub>WT</sub> as a result of the RGD loop substitution, resulting in K<sub>D</sub> values of 152 nM for 4.22, 219 nM for 4.24, 96 nM for 5.6, and 195 nM for M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s018">S1 Table</xref>). As expected, M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> did not bind to c-FMS. The binding affinities of the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> proteins to α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin were 199 nM for 4.22, 108 nM for 4.24, and 245 nM for 5.6, and the K<sub>D</sub> of M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> was 231 nM. As expected, M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> did not bind to α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin. Thus, consistent with the YSD results, the three M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> proteins demonstrated different affinities for α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and c-FMS: 4.24 had a low affinity for α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and a higher affinity for c-FMS, 5.6 exhibited high affinity for c-FMS and lower affinity for α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, and 4.22 had intermediate affinity levels for the two receptors. This heterogeneity in binding affinities underlines the plasticity of ligand-based bispecific antagonists, which can provide the most sensitive balance of efficacy and specificity. This binding heterogeneity may also enable us to predict the contribution of each of the two targets, c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, to osteoclast activation and differentiation (see following sections).</p>

<title>Computational docking model of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub>/c-FMS complex predicts the interaction interface</title>
<p>To better understand the interactions between M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variant 4.22 and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, a molecular docking procedure was performed with PatchDock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref028">28</xref>] both for the M-CSF<sub>C31S</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s011">S11 Fig</xref>) and 4.22 with the binding domains of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin. For further refinement, clustering was performed on the docking solutions, and the most abundant structure was used for the analysis of the model. The dimerization loop 1 of M-CSF is located on the opposite side of the molecule to the c-FMS binding domain. Thus, monomeric M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> is capable of simultaneous binding to both c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g004">Fig 4</xref>), since there is no steric clash between the native receptor c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin.

<title>M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants bind to both c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin expressed on cells</title>
<p>Assays for direct cell binding were performed on breast cancer cell line MD Anderson metastatic breast 231 (MDA-MB-231) and murine bone-marrow–derived monocytes (BMMs) for the following reasons. MDA-MB-231 cells express human α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and c-FMS on the cell membrane in a protein expression pattern that imitates the osteoclast state just before reaching full differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s014">S14C and S14D Fig</xref>). This cell line showed binding to 1 μM, 2.5 μM, and 7.5 μM of each of the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants 4.22 and 5.6 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), with variant 5.6 showing similar binding to 4.22. Murine BMMs express high levels of c-FMS and low levels of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s014">S14A and S14B Fig</xref>), a state that imitates an early osteoclast differentiation stage. For these cells, variants 4.22 and 5.6 showed similar dose-dependent binding. To show that M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants do indeed bind to c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin expressed on cells, we used specific competitors to these receptors, namely, cRGD, which will compete with α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin binding, and M-CSF<sub>WT</sub>, which will compete with c-FMS binding. M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variant 5.6 showed reduced binding to MDA-MB-231 in the presence of each competitor versus in the absence of inhibitors. Strikingly, the binding to the cells was significantly reduced in the presence of both inhibitors, thereby emphasizing that the ability to bind both receptors contributes to the total binding capability of the bispecific proteins. Moreover, the fact that the binding of variant 5.6 to the cells was stronger than that of M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> and M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> confirmed the advantage of the bispecific protein over the monospecific proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants inhibit induction of Akt and c-FMS phosphorylation</title>
<p>Upon binding to c-FMS, M-CSF<sub>WT</sub> induces c-FMS phosphorylation, which is essential for downstream signaling. To test whether binding of M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> inhibits the activation of c-FMS, we monitored its phosphorylation in the presence and absence of recombinant M-CSF in murine BMMs. As expected, the variants did not activate c-FMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s015">S15A Fig</xref>), and the inhibition of c-FMS phosphorylation correlated with the affinity of the different M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> proteins for c-FMS, with variant 5.6 (which binds c-FMS with the highest affinity) being the most efficient inhibitor and variant 4.24 (which has the lowest c-FMS binding affinity) the least efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). These data show the correlation between inhibition of c-FMS by the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> proteins and the binding affinity of the variant proteins to c-FMS. It is well known that human M-CSF<sub>WT</sub> can bind mouse c-FMS, but the binding affinity is much lower than that for mouse M-CSF to mouse c-FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref030">30</xref>]. Nonetheless, the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants significantly inhibited c-FMS phosphorylation and successfully competed with murine M-CSF in cells expressing murine c-FMS even though the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants were of human origin. This finding suggests that the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants should be highly effective as antagonists even in mouse cell models. The same experiment was performed for Akt activation with and without recombinant M-CSF. Akt activation has previously been shown to prolong cell survival in response to c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref031">31</xref>].

<title>M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> inhibits actin belt formation in mature osteoclasts</title>
<p>For a mature osteoclast to resorb bone properly, it must form a unique structure termed the "sealing zone"; this structure consists of an actin ring made from a dense actin mesh connected by adhesion complexes called podosomes. The formation of the actin ring involves several stages: at the beginning, podosomes are formed throughout the cell in a scattered manner; then groups of podosomes form small actin structures, known as belts, and upon osteoclast maturation, the belts move to the cell periphery, cluster, and form an actin ring. Podosomes contain high levels of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, which is essential for the formation on bones of proper actin rings with condensed podosome networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref033">33</xref>]. As opposed to cells grown on bone, osteoclasts cultured on glass produce actin belts but are unable to form stable actin rings. However, the preceding stages of the podosome network are similar for cells grown on bone and on glass and are known to be regulated by α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref034">34</xref>]. To test whether the inhibition of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin by bispecific M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants affects the organization of podosome networks, mouse BMMs cultured on glass were allowed to differentiate into mature osteoclasts to the point that multinucleated cells were formed and exhibited an actin belt structure. At this point, the inhibitors were added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before they were fixed and stained. Cells incubated only with M-CSF and RANKL without any inhibitor (i.e., positive control) formed a dense continuous actin belt structure. Addition of the monospecific M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> did not drastically inhibit actin belt formation and abundance, and osteoclasts presenting dense continuous actin belts were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>); nevertheless, scattered podosomes presenting immature belts were more abundant than in the positive controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g006">Fig 6</xref>, lower panel). Addition of either cRGD peptide, a well-established α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref035">35</xref>], or the monospecific M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> decreased actin belts’ distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The actin belts in cells incubated with these inhibitors had wider and fainter actin stain, probably as a failure of the podosomes to form condensed structures as higher distribution of scattered podosomes was observed in these cells. The bispecific M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variant 5.6, which exhibited the lowest affinity to α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, showed the same phenotype as cRGD and M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub>. Strikingly, the bispecific M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants 4.22 and 4.24 had the highest impact on actin belt formation and density. Dense actin structures and even scattered podosomes were hard to detect, and instead, the actin stain in osteoclasts cultured in the presence of these inhibitors had a diffusible appearance throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g006">Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s016">S16 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants inhibit osteoclast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To assess the ability of the three bispecific M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants and their monospecific controls, M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> and M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub>, to inhibit osteoclast differentiation, we monitored the effects of elevated concentrations of these proteins in cultures of differentiating BMMs or human peripheral blood CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. The proteins were added together with recombinant RANKL and human (for CD14<sup>+</sup> cells) or murine (for BMMs) M-CSF to initiate osteoclast differentiation. We note that as osteoclasts differentiate, the number of nuclei and the surface area increase as a result of cell fusion and cytoskeletal rearrangements, respectively. Strikingly, in cultures of differentiating BMMs and CD14<sup>+</sup> cells, all three M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants inhibited the nuclei number, surface area, total osteoclast number, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) absorbance, with inhibition being significant at a concentration as low as 50 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g008">Fig 8</xref>). To further validate the ability of the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants to inhibit osteoclast differentiation, the mRNA expression levels of osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) and NFATc1—two well-known osteoclast differentiation markers exhibiting increased expression during osteoclast differentiation—were evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref037">37</xref>]. The three M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants significantly inhibited OSCAR and NFATc1 expression while M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> had no inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g007">Fig 7F and 7G</xref>). In general, the ability of the M-CSF monospecific controls to inhibit osteoclast differentiation was inferior to that of the bispecific M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants, particularly in the human CD14<sup>+</sup> cell cultures. Since M-CSF signaling is known to regulate osteoclast survival, inhibition of M-CSF is expected to lead to a decrease in osteoclast survival. Indeed, a smaller number of cells was observed in osteoclasts cultured in the presence of the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants. In addition, an assay for cell death, based on propidium iodide (PI) permeability, in differentiating osteoclast cultures showed that the three M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> inhibitors and the M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> significantly increased cell death versus the small molecule GW2580 (a known inhibitor for c-FMS phosphorylation) used in the control assay. We note that M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> was unable to induce cell death, probably because of its inability to bind c-FMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g007">Fig 7H</xref>). To rule out nonspecific toxic effects of the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants on cell proliferation and survival, we added these inhibitors to murine bone-marrow–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), whose physiological microenvironment is the same as that of BMMs. No changes in survival and proliferation capabilities of BMSCs cultured with elevated concentrations of the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002979.g007">Fig 7I</xref>). Taken together, these results show that all M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants are highly efficient in inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and spreading even at a low concentration and have no apparent toxic effects on other primary bone-marrow–residing cells.</p>

<title>M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants 4.22 and 5.6 inhibit osteoclast activity in an animal model of osteoporosis</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of studies have demonstrated the crosstalk between biological processes mediated by c-FMS, α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, and their ligands in the context of osteoclast differentiation, cytoskeleton organization, and bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref019">19</xref>]. Since enhanced osteoclast function is an underlying cause of many bone-related disorders, with osteoclast differentiation and function being dependent on c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, these two proteins constitute attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. However, since these two receptors regulate common pathways, combination therapy or high drug doses may be needed to fully block the differentiation and resorption processes, with resulting increases in potential side effects and in the cost of therapy. Dual-specific proteins that could bind to and inhibit both c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin would therefore have superior therapeutic potential, as such proteins would offer improved binding avidity and selectivity compared to monospecific protein therapeutics. Nevertheless, despite extensive efforts in the field, there are currently no clinically approved therapeutic agents that are specific for both c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin. The new approach described here, which entails engineering dual-specific therapeutic proteins, is the first to use a natural ligand as a scaffold for engineering high-affinity binding to two therapeutic targets and to apply the engineered bispecific ligands in preclinical studies of osteoporosis.</p>
<p>We have shown in this study that M-CSF is an excellent scaffold for engineering bispecific ligands with affinity and specificity for both c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin. Many integrins recognize the RGD motif in extracellular matrix ligands, including fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen, and osteopontin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref038">38</xref>]. Since the RGD motif in natural ligands is typically found in flexible solvent-exposed loops, we mutated either loop 1 or loop 3, both of which are located in the dimerization interface of M-CSF<sub>WT</sub> and remain accessible in M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> monomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref039">39</xref>]. Mutating either one of these loops with an RGD sequence flanked by three residues on each side allows M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> to interact with α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin. This interaction does not disrupt the contact with the native c-FMS receptor, as the latter interacts with residues located on the opposite side of the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> ligand. Overall, the interaction area between M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variant 4.22 and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin is relatively large and scattered, in accordance with the physiological integrin–ligand interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>The M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants 4.22, 4.24, and 5.6 had enhanced inhibitory capabilities compared to M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> and M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub>, thereby highlighting the effects of the dual functionality that we engineered into these proteins. The M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants were shown to be better inhibitors of osteoclast actin ring formation and osteoclast differentiation than M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> and M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub>.We showed by SPR and cell-surface–binding assays that the engineered dual-specific M-CSF proteins can bind both α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and c-FMS receptors, leading to antagonism of immediate signaling events (c-FMS and Akt phosphorylation) and downstream biochemical events regulating osteoclast differentiation. Moreover, the presence of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and c-FMS on the surface of the cell enhances M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub>’s capability to bind it and lead to a stronger inhibition than the monospecific controls.</p>
<p>The three M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> proteins, 5.6, 4.22, and 4.24, which differed in the amino acids flanking the RGD motif, also differed in their binding affinities for c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin. These variations in affinities were translated into differences in their biological activities. Variant 5.6 had the highest binding affinity to c-FMS and accordingly showed the highest binding and inhibition of c-FMS and Akt phosphorylation in murine pre-osteoclast cells and the lowest inhibitory effect on actin ring formation. However, variant 5.6 exhibited lower inhibition of murine osteoclast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> than variants 4.22 and 4.24. The latter two variants showed higher binding affinity to α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin and a drastic inhibition of actin ring formation, which may suggest that increased binding to integrin led to a more efficient inhibition of murine osteoclast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. This notion is supported by our observation that inhibition of murine osteoclast differentiation was higher for M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> (the α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-integrin–only binder) than for variant 5.6. In contrast, variant 5.6 showed higher efficiency than M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> in inhibiting human osteoclast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, variant 5.6 showed better inhibition of bone resorption <italic>in vivo</italic> than variant 4.22, which suggests that higher affinity to c-FMS results in stronger inhibition of human osteoclast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and promotes inhibition of osteoclast activity in mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results could be explained by the fact that variant 5.6 exhibits better thermal stability than variant 4.22, although we cannot rule out the possibility that other differences, such as differences in proteostability, might affect their activities <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The main goal of this study was to exploit the attributes of M-CSF to engineer a versatile platform for the development of a targeted osteoporosis therapy. By demonstrating that this natural ligand could be engineered to function as a scaffold with the ability to target two receptors at the same time, we showed that engineering of natural agonists to function as receptor antagonists could become an alternative strategy for generating therapeutics not only for osteoporosis but also for other important biomedical targets. We envision that protein variants generated from such efforts could promote the development of the next generation of therapeutics, including, but not limited to, targeted drug delivery agents and selective tissue targeting probes. Similarly, this approach will provide new tools for studying molecular mechanisms and cell signaling pathways—not only those that mediate osteoclast differentiation and function but also pathways that are involved in different pathological processes.</p>

<p>For expressing the M-CSF<sub>C31S</sub> gene and the two M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> libraries on the yeast surface, the yeast culture was grown in the tryptophan-selective SDCAA medium (2% dextrose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% bacto casamino acids, 1.47% sodium citrate, 0.429% citric acid monohydrate, pH 4.5). This was followed by suspension in SGCAA medium (2% galactose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% bacto casamino acids, 1.47% sodium citrate, 0.429% citric acid monohydrate) for overnight incubation at 30 °C until the culture reached OD<sub>600</sub> = 10.0 (10<sup>8</sup> cells per ml). A number of cells equal to 10 times the library size was added to 1 ml PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (PBSA); the suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. For analysis of binding of M-CSF<sub>C31S</sub> and the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> libraries to c-FMS, yeast cells were incubated with mouse anti-c-myc antibody, 9E10 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) in a 1:50 ratio and different concentrations of soluble Fc-conjugated human c-FMS (R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. After an additional washing step, cells were labeled with secondary phycoerythrin (PE) anti-mouse (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and goat anti-human Fc FITC antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. For analysis of binding of M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> libraries to integrin, the experiment was performed in integrin binding buffer (IBB; 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>) + 1% BSA. The yeast cells were incubated with chicken anti-c-myc and different concentrations of soluble human α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin (R&amp;D Systems) for 1 h. After an additional washing step, cells were labeled with secondary PE-anti-chicken and FITC-anti-human β<sub>3</sub> integrin (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) antibodies for 30 min in the dark. Labeled cells were washed with 1 ml PBSA or IBB + 1% BSA. A total of five rounds of affinity maturation sorting were performed; in each sort, a diagonal shape was created with the aim to enrich the high protein binders. In each sort, 0.5% to 2% of the population was collected into a new tube containing SDCC medium. The first sort was performed against 500 nM c-FMS (sort 0), and the subsequent sorts against 500 nM α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin (sort 1), 250 nM α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin (sort 2), 100 nM α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin (sort 3), 20 nM α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin (sort 4), and 50 nM of c-FMS (sort 5).

The extracted plasmids were incubated with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-competent cells for 30 min on ice and transferred into 0.2-cm gap cuvettes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The cuvettes were inserted into a Micropulser electroporator (Bio-Rad) and pulsed with 2.5 kV. Immediately, 1 ml warm Luria Broth (LB) medium was added to each cuvette, and the suspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The bacteria were seeded on LB agar plates containing 1:1,000 ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C. Colonies were moved to LB medium containing ampicillin and grown overnight. The plasmids were extracted from the bacterial culture with HiYield plasmid mini kit (RBC, Bioscience, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

To determine the binding specificity to other RGD binding integrins—namely, α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>5,</sub> α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2b</sub>, and α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> (BioLegend)—the three chosen M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants (4.22, 4.24, and 5.6) were analyzed for binding to 250 nM of each integrin. To detect integrin binding, M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants were incubated with APC anti-human CD49d, APC anti-human CD41, FITC anti-human CD49e, or FITC anti-human CD5 (BioLegend) and analyzed with Accuri C6 flow cytometry analyzer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub>, M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub>, and M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants were produced, purified, and characterized as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s017">S1 Text</xref>.</p>

<p>Determination of binding of the soluble purified proteins to c-FMS and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin was performed on a ProteOn XPR36 (Bio-Rad). The M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants, M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub>, and M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> proteins were immobilized on the surface of the chip by using the amine coupling reagents sulfo-NHS, 0.1 M, and EDC (1-ethyl-3-[3dimethylaminopropyl]-carbodiimide, Bio-Rad), 0.4 M. To attach the M-CSF<sub>RGD,</sub> M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub>, and M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> variants covalently to the chip, 1 μg of each protein and 3 μg of BSA in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) were used to give 1,141, 900, 1,329, 1,272, and 1,337 response units (RUs) for M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> and M-CSF<sub>αvβ3</sub> variants 4.22, 4.24, and 5.6, respectively. Unbound esters were deactivated with 1 M ethanolamine HCl at pH 8.5, and the temperature was set at 25 °C. Then, the chip was rotated, and the human c-FMS soluble proteins (Sino Biological, China) were allowed to flow over the chip at six different concentrations (0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 nM) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min for 490 s, followed by dissociation for 600 s in PBS + 0.005% Tween (PBST). For determining α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin binding, the chip was regenerated using 50 mM NaOH at a flow rate of 100 μl/min, and different concentrations of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin proteins (0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 nM) were allowed to flow over the chip. The interactions obtained were normalized to the initial protein binding RUs to the chip surface. Then, for each concentration, the K<sub>D</sub> was obtained from the equilibrium binding phase of the sensorgram. To determine the α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin specificity for each M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variant, a new chip was loaded with different RGD binding integrins, as follows: 8.5 μg of α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin, 8.5 μg of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin, 6 μg of α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin, and 8.5 μg of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin, as well as 3 μg of BSA as a negative control. The proteins were covalently bound to the chip with 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) as described above. Then, 1 μM of the M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variant was allowed to flow over the chip at a rate of 50 μl/min for 409 s, followed by 600 s of dissociation with PBS + 1% Tween. The interactions obtained were normalized to the initial protein binding RUs to the chip surface. To achieve statistical significance, we made sure that the χ<sup>2</sup> values were at least 10% or lower than the R<sub>max</sub> values.</p>

<title>c-FMS and Akt phosphorylation assay</title>
<p>Murine BMM cells were obtained as described in the previous section. For this assay, 700,000 cells per well were seeded for differentiation with M-CSF (20 ng/ml) and RANKL (20 ng/ml) in a 6-well plate for 48 h held in an incubator at 37 °C. Then, the cells were incubated for 4 h in starvation medium (αMEM growth medium without fetal bovine serum [FBS]) at 37 °C. For the competition assay, cells were washed with PBS, and 1 μM of M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants and M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> with M-CSF<sub>WT</sub> (20 ng/ml) were added to each well for 1 min for c-FMS and 10 min for Akt; the plates were then immediately placed on ice. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (deoxycholate 0.5%, 25 mM NaF, 10 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>×2H<sub>2</sub>O, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors cocktail, 20 mM para-nitrophenylphosphate [PNPP]) and scraped from the wells, incubated for 10 min on ice, and centrifuged at 14,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 30 min; the supernatants were then transferred to fresh tubes. To determine whether the variants spontaneously activated c-FMS or Akt, the proteins were added without M-CSF<sub>WT</sub>, followed by lysis as described. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To include and analyze a large sample size, proteins from separate gels were compared using the following method. Fifteen μg of three protein samples were boiled, loaded, and separated on each 10% SDS PAGE for c-FMS and 12% SDS PAGE for Akt (for example, a gel was organized in the following way: protein ladder | 4.22 #1| 4.22 #2 | 4.22 #3 | protein ladder | 4.22 #1 | 4.22 #2 | 4.22 #3, with #1 in both lanes representing the same biological sample, #2 representing the same sample, etc.). Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) using a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). Membranes were cut into three parts, for example: ladder to 4.22 #3 that was blotted to c-FMS (first 4 samples from left to right above), ladder to 4.22 #3 that was blotted to pc-FMS (phosphorylated form of c-FMS), and low Mw part that was blotted to detect actin. In order to reduce the effects of different exposure times and device errors after blotting that was done with the same antibody stock, all the membranes were imaged at the same day with the same developing system (Fusion FX device manufactured by Vilber Lourmat), the same ECL incubation, and the same exposure times. To make sure that the same amount of protein was loaded and that the ECL-developing process was correct, we quantified and normalized each lane to its corresponding actin levels to see that there were no problems with loading or developing (Densitometry values are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002979.s020">S2 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>Every sample was normalized to its corresponding actin densitometric value (that was run on the same gel in the same lane) to exclude the effect of different exposure times. For example, 4.22 #1 pc-FMS was normalized to expression levels (4.22 #1 c-FMS) and to its own actin levels (4.22 #1 actin). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) + 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h. For detection of phosphorylated receptors, a 1:500 ratio of anti-phospho-M-CSF receptor (Tyr723) (Cell Signaling, MA, USA) and a 1:1,000 ratio of anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) (Cell Signaling) antibodies were added to 5% BSA in TBST for overnight incubation at 4 °C. For total receptor expression, a 1:1,000 ratio of anti-M-CSF receptor (Cell Signaling) and anti-Akt (Cell Signaling) antibodies were added to 5% BSA in TBST for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min with PBST. Then, the HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling) was added at a ratio of 1:1,000 for 1 h, and the membranes were washed again as described. All antibodies were used from the same stock for each blot. The membranes were developed using ECL-developing reagent (Biological Industries, Israel) according to the manufacturer's protocol and imaged using a Fusion FX device (Vilber Lourmat, Germany). Each membrane went through the same exposure time, which was according to the antibody that was used. Membranes were stripped with stripping buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 62.5 mM Tris HCl [pH 6.8], 0.8% β-mercaptoethanol) at 50 °C for 30 min, and the procedure was repeated again with actin antibody as a loading control (Cell Signaling). The intensity of the protein bands was measured using ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002979.ref043">43</xref>] with the analyze gels tool, and the phosphorylated c-FMS or Akt band intensity was normalized to c-FMS or Akt expression, respectively, and to its corresponding loading control on the same membrane (actin). The experiments with M-CSF<sub>c-FMS</sub> and M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variants 4.22 and 5.6 were repeated three times, and those with M-CSF<sub>RGD</sub> variant 4.24 were repeated six times.</p>
