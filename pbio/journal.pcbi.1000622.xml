<p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent cytokine that binds to specific receptors on the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. The signaling cascade triggered eventually leads to the formation of new capillaries, a process called angiogenesis. Distributions of VEGF receptors and VEGF ligands are therefore crucial determinants of angiogenic events and, to our knowledge, no quantification of abluminal vs. luminal receptors has been performed. We formulate a molecular-based compartment model to investigate the VEGF distribution in blood and tissue in humans and show that such quantification would lead to new insights on angiogenesis and VEGF-dependent diseases. Our multiscale model includes two major isoforms of VEGF (VEGF<sub>121</sub> and VEGF<sub>165</sub>), as well as their receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) and the non-signaling co-receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1). VEGF can be transported between tissue and blood via transendothelial permeability and the lymphatics. VEGF receptors are located on both the luminal and abluminal sides of the endothelial cells. In this study, we analyze the effects of the VEGF receptor localization on the endothelial cells as well as of the lymphatic transport. We show that the VEGF distribution is affected by the luminal receptor density. We predict that the receptor signaling occurs mostly on the abluminal endothelial surface, assuming that VEGF is secreted by parenchymal cells. However, for a low abluminal but high luminal receptor density, VEGF binds predominantly to VEGFR1 on the abluminal surface and VEGFR2 on the luminal surface. Such findings would be pertinent to pathological conditions and therapies related to VEGF receptor imbalance and overexpression on the endothelial cells and will hopefully encourage experimental receptor quantification for both luminal and abluminal surfaces on endothelial cells.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Angiogenesis is the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature that occurs in physiological (e.g., exercise) and pathological contexts (e.g., cancer). This process is often triggered by a signaling cascade that occurs upon ligand-receptor binding between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFR1/Flt-1, VEGFR2/KDR). These receptors are expressed by endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. Little is known about the quantitative proportion of abluminal receptors (facing the tissue) as compared to those on the luminal surface (facing the blood). We have built a compartment model with molecular details from human tissues to investigate why such experimental data would be of importance. We conclude that the receptor distribution on the endothelial cells can significantly alter the VEGF distribution and the VEGF signaling (through its binding to the receptors) and that quantification of luminal vs. abluminal VEGF receptors would shed light on VEGF signaling and VEGF-dependent mechanisms of angiogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Physiologic angiogenesis, the growth of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels, occurs in wound healing, pregnancy, exercise, and embryonic development. Diseases such as cancer and age-related macular degeneration are angiogenesis-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Ferrara1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>The growth of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels is mediated by several growth factors, one of which is a potent family of cytokines called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The VEGF family is composed of five members: VEGF-A (often referred to as VEGF), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and placental growth factor (PlGF). Alternative splicing of VEGF-A provides about 13 different VEGF isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-MacGabhann1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Roskoski1">[3]</xref>. Human VEGF consists of at least seven isoforms: VEGF<sub>121</sub>, VEGF<sub>145</sub>, VEGF<sub>148</sub>, VEGF<sub>165</sub>, VEGF<sub>183</sub>, VEGF<sub>189</sub>, and VEGF<sub>206</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Harper1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Shinkaruk1">[5]</xref>. Although VEGF<sub>121</sub>, VEGF<sub>165</sub>, VEGF<sub>183</sub> are diffusible, VEGF<sub>189</sub> and VEGF<sub>206</sub> are mainly sequestered in the extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Harper1">[4]</xref>. Amongst the major isoforms (with length 121, 165, 189 and 206 amino acids), VEGF<sub>121</sub> and VEGF<sub>165</sub> are more highly expressed than VEGF<sub>189</sub> and VEGF<sub>206</sub>. Furthermore, the roles of VEGF<sub>189</sub> and VEGF<sub>206</sub> in vivo remain to be clearly identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Roskoski1">[3]</xref>. For these reasons, we only consider VEGF<sub>121</sub> and VEGF<sub>165</sub> isoforms in the present model. These two isoforms bind VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 or Flt-1 in humans) and VEGFR2 (kinase insert domain receptor also designated as Flk-1, or KDR in humans). VEGF<sub>165</sub> binds to the non-signaling co-receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1) as well and serves as a bridge for the VEGFR2-NRP1 complex. It has been shown recently that VEGF<sub>121</sub> may also bind to NRP1; however, this binding is not sufficient to bridge the VEGFR2-NRP1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Pan1">[6]</xref>. Preliminary sensitivity analyses from our group suggest that incorporation of the binding between VEGF<sub>121</sub> and NRP1 does not drastically change the predictions regarding the VEGF distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Wu1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, this binding is not included in the model at the moment; this can be modified when more information becomes available. Finally, VEGF<sub>165</sub> contains a heparin binding domain, which allows it to bind to the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of the extracellular matrix and the cellular basement membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Ferrara2">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have introduced a compartment model of VEGF distribution in the human body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>. In the “healthy” set-up, the system was composed of two main compartments: the blood (vascular system) and the rest of the body. A third compartment was added for pathological cases to distinguish the diseased from the healthy tissue. VEGF<sub>121</sub>, VEGF<sub>165</sub>, and their respective interactions with VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and NRP1 were considered. VEGF was secreted by the parenchymal cells (in the healthy tissue) and the tumor cells (when the diseased tissue was assumed to be a breast cancer tumor). Other elements in the blood, such as platelets and granulocytes, sequester large amounts of VEGF and could potentially release significant amounts of VEGF as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Kusumanto1">[10]</xref>; the role of these processes in VEGF balance in the body is not known. However, since the rates of VEGF release from these blood elements have not been quantified, we have decided, as a first approximation, to neglect explicit representation of these sources; a distinct mathematical term can be added to the equations to model VEGF release from these elements in the future. We assume that the compartments are well-mixed and that freely diffusible (unbound) VEGF is transported by vascular permeability between the tissues and the blood.</p>
<p>The model presented here is an extension of our previously published model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>, as was a recent study that analyzed the effects of soluble VEGFR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Wu1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Wu2">[11]</xref>. Two major additions were made. First, lymphatic drainage of VEGF was added, serving as a second route for VEGF to be transported from the tissue to the blood compartment. Secondly, our previous model considered VEGF receptors to be solely expressed on the abluminal endothelial surface. Here, we included the presence of VEGF receptors and co-receptor NRP1 on the luminal endothelial surface based on the evidence that VEGFR2 (Flk-1, KDR) is also present on the luminal endothelial surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Feng1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the distribution of VEGF receptors between the abluminal and luminal surfaces of the endothelial cells (i.e., present solely on the abluminal endothelial surface; present solely on the luminal endothelial surface; or present on both surfaces of the endothelial cells) can impact the VEGF ligand distribution in the tissue and in the blood, as well as the VEGF signaling efficiency. The focus of this paper is to investigate the effects of receptor repartition on endothelial cellular surfaces and emphasize the importance of receptor quantification.</p>

<p>The model has been fully described in our previous paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>. To summarize, we distinguish between the vascular system (blood) and the rest of the body (represented by skeletal muscle). The tissue is divided into parenchymal cells and capillaries, separated by the interstitial space. This space is further subdivided into the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the basement membranes of the parenchymal cells and of the endothelial cells (PBM and EBM respectively). Secreted by parenchymal cells in the tissue, VEGF isoforms VEGF<sub>121</sub> and VEGF<sub>165</sub> diffuse freely and bind to VEGF receptors and neuropilin-1 that are expressed on the endothelial surfaces, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g001">Figure 1A</xref>.</p>

<p>A. Schematic of a tissue cross section. B. Compartment model. The vascular system is separated from the rest of the body. The blood compartment comprises the plasma (available to VEGF), the blood elements (blood cells, fibrin, clotting elements, etc.), as well as the luminal side of the basement membranes of the endothelial cells. The tissue compartment is composed of the parenchymal cells that secrete VEGF, the interstitium as well as the abluminal surface of the endothelial cells lining the capillaries. The fraction that is not accessible to VEGF is represented as a hatched area. The arrows illustrate inter-compartment and intra-compartment exchanges: secretion, vascular permeability, internalization of the receptors, lymphatic drainage, and clearance from the plasma. C. Schematic of the chemical interactions. Two isoforms of VEGF are considered: VEGF<sub>121</sub> and VEGF<sub>165</sub>. Free receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and NRP1) and free VEGF isoforms are located in the gray areas. VEGF<sub>121</sub> and VEGF<sub>165</sub> both bind VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. VEGF<sub>165</sub> also binds glycosaminoglycan chains (GAG) as well as the co-receptor NRP1. VEGF<sub>165</sub> can serve as a bridge for the formation of VEGFR2-NRP1 complex. Finally, VEGF<sub>121</sub> can bind to VEGFR1-NRP1 complex.</p>

<title>Computational model</title>
<p>A schematic of the computational design is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. We distinguish between the vascular system (“blood compartment”) and the tissue (“tissue compartment”). The tissue compartment is divided into two parts: the parenchymal cells where VEGF is secreted, and the interstitium. However, because the extracellular matrix is a porous medium, and because some pores are not accessible to freely diffusible molecules, only a fraction of the interstitial space is accessible to VEGF. This accessible region, called available fluid volume <italic>U<sub>AV</sub></italic>, is to be distinguished from the rest of the interstitial space. It is possible to link the available fluid volume to the total volume of the tissue <italic>U</italic> by the relation <italic>U<sub>AV</sub> = K<sub>AV</sub>. U</italic>, where <italic>K<sub>AV</sub></italic> represents the ratio between the available fluid interstitial space to the total volume, and can be expressed as the product of the partition coefficient and the porosity of the medium. Similarly, we partition the blood into plasma and the rest of the blood. Further details about the available fluid volumes for VEGF can be found in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>The model includes the expression of receptors on the luminal and abluminal endothelial surfaces as well as their internalization. In the mathematical setup, the receptors expressed on the abluminal endothelial surface are considered to be part of the “tissue compartment” while the receptors expressed on the luminal endothelial surface are part of the “blood compartment.” This permits a clear distinction between the two surfaces of the endothelial cells and their receptor expressions as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g001">Figure 1B</xref>.</p>
<p>Inter-compartment transport modes include vascular permeability and lymphatic removal. VEGF can extravasate and intravasate (bi-directional microvascular permeability). Note that hemodynamics is not considered in this compartment model because there is no evidence that the transport of VEGF is blood flow limited. The cytokine can also be drained from the tissue into the blood (unidirectional lymphatic drainage) or cleared from the plasma (e.g., by the kidneys or the liver, organs that are not explicitly represented in the model).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g001">Figure 1C</xref> summarizes the biochemical reactions that are included in our model. We consider two VEGF isoforms: VEGF<sub>121</sub> and VEGF<sub>165</sub>. Both isoforms bind to two receptor tyrosine kinases: VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. VEGF-VEGFR complex formation induces signal transduction in vivo. The model also includes the binding of VEGF<sub>165</sub> to neuropilin-1 (NRP1). Although VEGF<sub>121</sub> has been shown to bind to NRP1 as well, this binding does not bridge VEGFR2-NRP1 complex as VEGF<sub>165</sub> does <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Pan1">[6]</xref>. The inclusion of such binding to our model does not significantly affect the VEGFR2 signaling pathway, nor does it significantly change the VEGF distribution profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Wu1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, our present model does not include the possibility of VEGF<sub>121</sub>-NRP1 complex formation, but this could be readily added when kinetic information and quantitative data become available. Ternary groups can be formed either by the coupling of NRP1 and VEGFR1 then binding to VEGF<sub>121</sub> or by VEGF<sub>165</sub> bridging VEGFR2 and NRP1 to form a VEGFR2-VEGF<sub>165</sub>-NRP1 triplet. Besides binding to VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and NRP1, VEGF<sub>165</sub> contains a heparin-binding domain that permits the isoform to be sequestered by the extracellular matrix or the cellular basement membranes.</p>

<p>The system is described by 32 ordinary non-linear differential equations (19 for the tissue compartment and 13 for the blood compartment). These equations and the initial conditions were implemented using Visual FORTRAN 6 software on a PC. Transient solutions were calculated using an adaptive step-size Runge-Kutta 5<sup>th</sup>-order accuracy integrative scheme. A relative error tolerance of 10<sup>−5</sup> was used.

<p>The volume of the normal tissue corresponds to that of a 70-kg human subject with a skeletal muscle density of 1.06 g/cm<sup>3</sup> after subtracting 5,154 cm<sup>3</sup> of whole blood, i.e., 61,321 cm<sup>3</sup>. The parameters and the properties of the skeletal muscle (tissue compartment) are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000622-t001">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000622-t002"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000622-t003"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000622-t004">4</xref>. Briefly, the fluid volume fractions available for VEGF in the extracellular matrix, the parenchymal basement membrane and the endothelial basement membrane are 6.1987%, 0.0307% and 0.0087% of the total tissue respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000622-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the interstitial fluid volume accessible by VEGF is 6.2381% of the total volume (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000622-t004">Table 4</xref>). Total VEGF expression isoform ratio VEGF<sub>165</sub>∶VEGF<sub>121</sub> is taken to be 92%∶8% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Ng1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>We assume conservation of the density of receptors (ligated and unligated). In other words, at any time step, the density of receptors newly expressed on each membrane surface (luminal or abluminal) of the endothelial cells equals the density of receptors being internalized on that same surface. This assumption can be relaxed when more information on VEGF receptor dynamics become available.</p>
<p>Inter-compartment transport includes VEGF extravasation and intravasation (bidirectional transcapillary exchange) as well as lymphatic drainage of VEGF from the tissue to the blood. Unless specified otherwise, the vascular permeability to VEGF molecule is taken to be 4×10<sup>−8</sup> cm/s in accordance with our previous model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>. The lymphatic drainage in skeletal muscle of a healthy subject in the asleep, supine position has been reported to be between 1.7 and 2.5 µL/h/g <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Wu1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Aukland1">[14]</xref>. The total lymph flow rate at rest is estimated at 120 mL/hour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Guyton1">[15]</xref>, i.e., 2 cm<sup>3</sup>/min or 2.88 L/day (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000622-t005">Table 5</xref>). As a first approximation, we assume that the removal rate of VEGF from our tissue compartment through the lymphatics corresponds to this lymph flow rate.</p>
<p>In our previous model, we assumed a VEGF clearance rate from plasma of 0.0206 min<sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to a VEGF half-life of approximately 34 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>. This was based on simple non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of raw experimental data by Eppler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Eppler1">[16]</xref>, which lumps together all routes of VEGF elimination from plasma. In order to better estimate the direct VEGF clearance rate from plasma (through protein degradation or kidney filtration, etc.), as distinct from alternate routes such as receptor-mediated metabolism or disappearance of extravasated VEGF by ligated receptors after biodistribution to muscle tissue compartments (which already has separate explicit mathematical representation in our model), we have adopted a theoretical clearance rate derived by Eppler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Eppler1">[16]</xref> through physiological mechanism-based compartmental biodistribution modeling, which predicts an elimination rate of 3.89 hr<sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to a clearance rate of VEGF from the plasma of 0.0648 min<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000622-t005">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The VEGF plasma concentration in healthy subjects has been typically measured between 0.5–1.5 pM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Kut1">[17]</xref>. Unless specified otherwise, we maintain the average VEGF plasma concentration ∼1 pM in this model as a baseline. Note that the results are dependent on the expression of the receptors the quantitative knowledge of which in vivo is very limited.</p>

<title>Free VEGF concentration in plasma is significantly altered by the change of VEGF clearance rate from plasma but not by the introduction of the lymphatic drainage</title>

<p>A. Three scenarios are studied: scenario (a) our previous configuration from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref> (clearance rate <italic>c<sub>v</sub></italic> = 0.0206 min<sup>−1</sup>); scenario (b) new clearance <italic>c<sub>v</sub></italic> = 0.0648 min<sup>−1</sup> in the absence of lymphatic drainage; scenario (c) introduction of the lymphatic drainage of VEGF <italic>k<sub>L</sub></italic> = 2 cm<sup>3</sup>/min (120 mL/hour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Guyton1">[15]</xref>) with the new clearance <italic>c<sub>v</sub></italic> = 0.0648 min<sup>−1</sup>. B. Effect of VEGF secretion. Free VEGF concentration in the tissue is illustrated in blue.

<p>The secretion rate of VEGF in the tissue was varied from 0.05 to 0.35 molecule/cell/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). VEGF was expressed at a ratio of 92%∶8% for VEGF<sub>165</sub>∶VEGF<sub>121</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Ng1">[13]</xref>. We considered two vascular permeabilities for VEGF (4×10<sup>−8</sup> cm/s and 4×10<sup>−7</sup> cm/s). For clarity, we do not show curves that overlap. The free VEGF concentration in the available interstitial fluid (tissue compartment) was not significantly altered by the change of clearance rate, the introduction of lymphatic drainage or the change of permeability (blue curve corresponding to scenarios (a), (b) and (c)). Increasing the clearance rate in the absence of lymphatic drainage lowered the free VEGF level in the plasma (purple and red curves comparing scenarios (a) and (b)). The introduction of the lymphatic removal of VEGF did not change the concentration of free VEGF significantly (red curve; scenarios (b) and (c)). This result is in contrast to our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Wu1">[7]</xref>, where we examined higher and a larger range of lymphatic drainage rates for soluble proteins as a function of muscle activity (lymphatic pump), which significantly affected free VEGF concentration gradients between plasma and tissue interstitium. As mentioned in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>, increasing the vascular permeability to VEGF induced an increase of the plasma free VEGF concentration (dotted vs. dashed curves) without significantly altering the interstitial free VEGF level.</p>

<title>Increasing the vascular permeability to VEGF significantly affected the free VEGF concentration in blood but not in tissue</title>
<p>The different curves represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g002">Figure 2C</xref> illustrate the VEGF concentration responses in available interstitial fluid and plasma to vascular permeability for the three scenarios illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. Similar to that used in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>, the baseline of each simulation was taken such that, at a vascular permeability of 4×10<sup>−8</sup> cm/s, about 1 pM of free VEGF was present in the plasma (black dot). This means that the secretion rate had to be tuned for each simulation. The total VEGF secretion rates were 0.1126 (dashed curve), 0.2634 (dashed-dotted-dotted curve) and 0.2390 molecule/cell/s (solid curve) for scenarios (a), (b) and (c) respectively. We then varied the vascular permeability to VEGF from 4×10<sup>−9</sup> to 4×10<sup>−6</sup> cm/s. In all scenarios, free VEGF concentration in the available interstitial fluid was found to remain fairly constant over the range we considered. Increasing the clearance rate required a higher free VEGF concentration in the available interstitial fluid (blue dashed vs. dashed-dotted-dotted curves, i.e., scenario (a) vs. (b)). This is because a higher secretion was required to reach 1 pM of free VEGF at steady state in plasma when the clearance rate was increased. The introduction of the VEGF removal through the lymphatics reduced the free VEGF level in the tissue (dashed-dotted-dotted vs. solid curves, i.e., scenario (b) vs. (c)) since VEGF was drained from the available interstitial fluid into the plasma thus requiring a lower secretion rate to attain the 1 pM in the plasma. A similar behavior was noted in the blood for a range of vascular permeability higher than 4×10<sup>−8</sup> cm/s.</p>
<p>In our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>, three regions were identified: for a vascular permeability higher than 4×10<sup>−6</sup> cm/s, the free VEGF concentration in the plasma converged to that in the available interstitial fluid; for a vascular permeability lower than 4×10<sup>−8</sup> cm/s, free VEGF concentration in the plasma was fairly constant and close to zero; and for a vascular permeability range between 4×10<sup>−8</sup> to 10<sup>−6</sup> cm/s, the free VEGF concentration was approximately proportional to vascular permeability. These last two regions could still be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> for scenarios (b) and (c). However, it was clear that the new clearance rate and the introduction of VEGF lymphatic drainage required a higher vascular permeability for the free VEGF concentration in plasma to equal that in the tissue (as compared to scenario (a)). This is due to the fact that a higher net transport of VEGF from the tissue into the blood compartment is required to compensate the loss of VEGF with a higher clearance rate.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3a3">
<title>Free VEGF concentration in the plasma is affected by the vascular permeability as compared to the lymphatic drainage</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g002">Figure 2D</xref> shows the variation of free VEGF concentration in the tissue and plasma with the lymph flow rate. The removal rate of VEGF through lymphatics was varied from 0 to 10 cm<sup>3</sup>/min, i.e., 0 to 600 mL/h or 0 to 14.4 L/day. The baseline was taken so that, at a vascular permeability of 4×10<sup>−8</sup> cm/s, a clearance rate of 0.0648 min<sup>−1</sup> and a lymph flow rate of 2 cm<sup>3</sup>/min, about 1 pM of free VEGF was present in the plasma (black dot on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Free VEGF level does not change significantly in the tissue compartment. Within the tested range, increasing the rate at which VEGF is removed through the lymphatics increased the free VEGF concentration in the plasma. However, this augmentation was less noticeable when the vascular permeability was increased 10-fold (dotted vs. dashed curves): for a vascular permeability of 4×10<sup>−8</sup> cm/s, the free VEGF concentration in plasma varied from 0.89 to 1.44 pM (a 63% increase), whereas at a vascular permeability of 4×10<sup>−7</sup> cm/s, it varied from 5.01 to 5.31 pM (a 6% increase). This is due to competition between the transendothelial exchange of free VEGF (net permeability) and the lymphatic drainage of VEGF.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3a4">
<title>In the absence of clearance, the lymphatic drainage of VEGF can invert the gradient of free VEGF concentration across the endothelial barrier</title>
<p>We varied the clearance rate for VEGF from 0 (which corresponds to an infinite half-life of VEGF) to 0.09 min<sup>−1</sup> (about 8-minute VEGF half-life). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g002">Figure 2E</xref>. The free VEGF concentration in the available interstitial fluid was fairly insensitive to the change of clearance. However, the free VEGF level in plasma was significantly affected by the variation of clearance. The introduction of the lymphatics (red vs. light pink curves) did not significantly change the free VEGF concentration for most of the range of clearance rate studied. However, when the lymphatic drainage was introduced and the clearance of VEGF was set to zero (infinite half-life for VEGF in the plasma), the concentration of free VEGF was higher in the plasma than in the available interstitial fluid regardless of the vascular permeability to VEGF for the range we checked. In such case, the gradient across the endothelial cells (i.e., between the tissue and the blood compartments) was inverted. In the absence of the lymphatics and when the clearance was set to zero, the VEGF concentrations were equal, as expected. This effect was not as drastic for a vascular permeability of 4×10<sup>−7</sup> cm/s due to increased equilibration of the compartments by the intravasation/extravasation of VEGF.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3a5">
<title>Effects of VEGF receptors on free VEGF concentrations in available interstitial fluid and in plasma</title>
<p>We varied the density of receptors on the luminal and abluminal surfaces on the endothelial cells lining the capillaries and looked at the change of free VEGF concentrations in the tissue and in the blood compartments, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g003">Figure 3</xref>. The baseline was taken to be 1 pM of free VEGF concentration in the plasma in the absence of luminal receptors and in the presence of 10,000 VEGFR1, 10,000 VEGFR2 and 10,000 NRP1 on the abluminal side of the endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>. Note that using a single-compartment model of skeletal muscle we previously conducted a detailed sensitivity analysis on the effect of receptor density on VEGF distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-MacGabhann2">[18]</xref>. The vascular permeability was fixed at 4×10<sup>−8</sup> cm/s. The clearance rate was 0.0648 min<sup>−1</sup> and the lymph flow rate was set at 2 cm<sup>3</sup>/min. In this set of experiments, the secretion rate was not changed across the simulations and the total VEGF secretion rate was 0.2390 molecule/cell/s (with a VEGF expression rate ratio VEGF<sub>121</sub>: VEGF<sub>165</sub> of 92%∶8%, i.e., VEGF<sub>165</sub> secretion rate = 0.2199 molecule/cell/s and VEGF<sub>121</sub> secretion rate = 0.0191 molecule/cell/s). Unless specified otherwise, the density of receptors denotes the density of each species of receptors. For example, “5,000 abluminal receptors per endothelial cell” means “5,000 of each species (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and NRP-1) per endothelial cell located on the abluminal surface.” The luminal receptors were varied from 0 to 10,000 receptors per endothelial cell. However, the fixed secretion rate was too high to reach a steady state for an abluminal receptor density smaller than 2,500 receptors per endothelial cell. Increasing the density of luminal receptors did not affect the free VEGF concentration in the available interstitial fluid but drastically decreased that in the plasma. Increasing the density of abluminal receptors decreased the concentration of total free VEGF in both the tissue and the blood compartments. This is due to receptor binding: the higher the receptor density, the smaller the free VEGF concentration.</p>

Note that no steady state could be reached at such secretion rate in the absence of abluminal receptors. The free VEGF concentration in the available interstitial fluid was constant over the range of luminal receptor density and decreased exponentially with the density of abluminal receptors.

<p>First, keeping the free VEGF concentration in plasma constant fixes some of the outflows from the blood compartment since they are directly proportional to the VEGF concentration. In other words, the VEGF cleared from the blood was then constant throughout the simulations (2.94×10<sup>−3</sup> pmoles/s) and so was the rate of VEGF extravasation (2.65×10<sup>−4</sup> pmoles/s) as indicated on the model diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. VEGF disappearing by internalization of luminal ligated receptors (blood compartment) was proportional to the density of receptors on the luminal surface of the endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figure 4A</xref>iv). This was explained by the fact that the internalization terms of ligated receptors in the equations were expressed as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000622.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since we assumed a fixed total density of receptors at any time-step, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000622.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, VEGF disappearing by internalization of ligated receptors was linearly dependent on the density of luminal receptors. VEGF flow from the tissue to the blood compartment (intravasation and lymphatic removal of VEGF) was also found to be directly proportional to the density of luminal receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figures 4A</xref>iii and 4Av respectively). Although this may be surprising, it follows from the balance of the inflows and outflows in the blood compartment.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000622.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000622.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>so <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000622.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is also proportional to the density of receptors on the luminal endothelial surface. Since these two outflows differ only by a constant of proportionality, each term is therefore linearly dependent on the density of luminal receptors. These outflows are also directly proportional to the concentration of free VEGF in the available interstitial fluid, explaining the linear dependence of free VEGF concentration in the tissue compartment on the density of receptors on the luminal endothelial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figure 4A</xref>ii). Finally, VEGF secreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figure 4A</xref>i) and VEGF disappearing by internalization of its bound receptors on the abluminal surface of the endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figure 4A</xref>vi) reach saturation when the receptor density on the luminal endothelial surface is high enough to push the free VEGF concentration in the available interstitial fluid higher than K<sub>d</sub> of VEGF and its receptors (i.e., the saturation occurs when free VEGF in the available interstitial fluid is several times higher than K<sub>d</sub>(VEGF,VEGFR)). Interestingly, VEGF secretion and internalization through abluminal receptors were, however, linearly dependent on the density of receptors on the abluminal endothelial surface. This is mainly because the free plasma VEGF concentration was constant over the tested range of abluminal receptors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows the VEGF flows normalized to VEGF secretion. The ratios are given in percentages. In the absence of abluminal receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figure 4B</xref>i), most of the free VEGF intravasates (&gt;85%) regardless of the luminal receptor density while, in the presence of abluminal receptors, most VEGF disappears by internalization of abluminal ligated receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figures 4B</xref>ii–iv). When abluminal receptors are present, less than 25% of VEGF that has been secreted effectively enters the blood compartment. Increasing the luminal receptor density yields more VEGF entering the blood by intravasation. This is mainly due to the fact that the model requires a higher secretion rate to balance the increase in receptor density and internalization. Finally, unless there are no luminal receptors (in which case free VEGF disappears from the plasma by clearance), most free VEGF leaves the blood by internalization of the luminal ligated receptors.</p>

<title>When the receptors are evenly distributed on the endothelial cell surface, the VEGF plasma clearance and extravasation are minimized</title>
<p>We next examined how the ratio of receptor densities on the luminal vs. abluminal endothelial surface can impact transport. We fixed the density of total receptors (luminal and abluminal) to 10,000 per endothelial cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g006">Figure 6A</xref> illustrates three configurations.

This corresponds to the yellow dots on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. Scenario (b) represents the case where the receptors are evenly distributed between the abluminal and luminal surfaces of the endothelial cells, i.e., 5,000 receptors of each species are present in each compartment.

Finally, scenario (c) illustrates the case where all the receptors are located on the luminal endothelial surface, i.e., 10,000 receptors on the luminal surface of the endothelial cells and no abluminal receptors. This corresponds to the green dots on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. We investigated how the inter- and intra-compartment flows of VEGF vary between the configurations. We found that the transport of VEGF by intravasation, lymphatic drainage, and internalization of luminal ligated receptors increase when the receptors are “redistributed” from the abluminal to the luminal surface of the endothelial cells. However, to maintain 1 pM of free VEGF in the plasma, VEGF secretion varied significantly between the three scenarios considered. For comparison purposes, we therefore normalized the flows to VEGF secretion. These normalized inflows and outflows are noted in terms of percentages of VEGF secretion as indicated in parentheses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g006">Figure 6A</xref>.

The net transendothelial VEGF flow is the difference of VEGF intravasating and VEGF extravasating. As long as abluminal receptors are present, most secreted VEGF disappears by internalization upon binding to the abluminal receptors. In the absence of abluminal receptors, intravasation is the main route by which VEGF leaves the interstitial fluid. The fraction of VEGF entering the plasma is, in all cases, mainly driven by the permeability rather than by lymphatics.</p>

In the absence of luminal receptors (scenario (a) – bottom rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g007">Figures 7A</xref>i and 7Aii), most VEGF is in the form of the triplet VEGFR2-VEGF<sub>165</sub>-NRP1 (42%) while about a quarter of VEGF is sequestered in the interstitium. In the blood, free VEGF<sub>165</sub> accounts for 92% of the total population of VEGF. When there is an equal density of receptors on the abluminal and luminal sides (“even distribution” – scenario (b); middle rows), about 75% of VEGF in the tissue is sequestered in the interstitium. Interestingly, in the blood, most of the VEGF<sub>165</sub> is bound to VEGFR2 (or bridges VEGFR2-NRP1) while most of VEGF<sub>121</sub> is bound to VEGFR1 (or the VEGFR1-NRP1 complex). These results were even more pronounced when all the receptors were located on the luminal side (scenario (c) – top rows). One striking result was that free VEGF<sub>121</sub> represented between 0.07% to 0.25% of the total VEGF distribution in the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g007">Figure 7A</xref>i), and dropped from 8% to 0.06% of the total VEGF distribution in the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g007">Figure 7A</xref>ii) when the population of receptors “shifted” from the abluminal to the luminal surface of the endothelial cell.

<title>Because the VEGF secretion occurs in the tissue, VEGF binding to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 takes place predominantly on the abluminal surface of the endothelial cells, regardless of the ratio of the receptors on each surface of endothelial cell</title>

The ratio [VEGF bound to abluminal VEGFR1]/[VEGF bound to luminal VEGFR1] is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g009">Figure 9A</xref> and the ratio [VEGF bound to abluminal VEGFR2]/[VEGF bound to luminal VEGFR2] is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g009">Figure 9B</xref>. For most cases, these two ratios were higher than 1, meaning that the amount of VEGF bound to VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 was higher on the abluminal than on the luminal surface of the endothelial cells. This is explained by the fact that the VEGF secretion occurs in the tissue, leading to a VEGF gradient from the tissue to the blood compartment. However, a small region revealed more binding on the luminal side (ratio &lt;1) for VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g009">Figure 9B</xref>).

<p>We next compared how much VEGF is bound to VEGFR1 as compared to bound to VEGFR2. VEGFR2 is pro-angiogenic, whereas VEGFR1 is anti-angiogenic or modulatory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Autiero1">[19]</xref>, thus the ratio might represent pro- vs. anti-angiogenic signaling. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g009">Figure 9C</xref> illustrates the ratio [VEGF bound to VEGFR2]/[VEGF bound to VEGFR1] in each compartment (i.e., the abluminal and luminal surfaces of the endothelial cells).

Conversely, if the ratio is lower than 1, then VEGF is predominantly bound to VEGFR1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g009">Figure 9C</xref> shows that the two ratios are always higher than 1 in both the tissue and the blood compartments for our region of interest, meaning that the VEGF binds more to VEGFR2 than to VEGFR1, even though the total VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 densities are assumed equal (as mentioned previously, VEGFR1∶VEGFR2∶NRP1 are expressed on each endothelial cell surface in 1∶1∶1 ratio). Since the K<sub>d</sub> for VEGF-VEGFR2 is three times higher than the K<sub>d</sub> for VEGF-VEGFR1 binding, this means that this cannot be the consequence of a higher binding affinity for VEGFR2 but rather of the neuropilin-1 presence. We also note that the higher the receptor density on the abluminal endothelial surface, the more binding to VEGFR2 (as compared to VEGFR1) on this same surface. However, the magnitude of the ratio is much higher on the luminal endothelial surface (blood compartment) than on the abluminal endothelial surface (tissue compartment).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This extension of our previous model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref> is useful for exploring the effects of luminal vs. abluminal distribution of VEGF receptors on the endothelial surfaces. We have shown that such configurations can drastically affect the VEGF profile in the tissue and in the blood.</p>
<p>First, we have shown that the removal of clearance in the presence of lymphatics could reverse the free VEGF gradient between the tissue and the blood compartments. Such a situation might correspond to certain pathological conditions, but the simulation is also instructive as a characterization of the VEGF transport system. However, it is important to note that our current model does not explicitly include the convective component of transvascular permeability and such addition could attenuate the predicted gradient reversal. Secondly, at a fixed VEGF secretion rate, the free VEGF in the available interstitial fluid is much higher than that in the plasma. When the free VEGF concentration in the plasma is constant (∼1 pM), VEGF extravasation and plasma VEGF clearance over time are constant over the range of receptors we studied. We have found that the amount of VEGF disappearing by internalization of luminal receptors to which it binds, the amount of VEGF extravasating and the amount of VEGF removal from lymphatic drainage are all proportional to the luminal receptor density but insensitive to the abluminal receptor density. We have established a mathematical relationship between the amount of VEGF secreted and VEGF disappearing by internalization of abluminal receptors. Thirdly, we can summarize the VEGF transport between the tissue and the blood as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000622-g010">Figure 10</xref>. VEGF is secreted in the tissue. Depending on the receptor density on the abluminal and luminal endothelial surfaces, VEGF is mainly either sequestered by the matrix or binds to abluminal receptors. Upon binding, VEGF disappears by internalization of the abluminal receptors it has bound to. Only a small fraction (free ligands) enters the blood compartment (mainly by intravasation rather than lymphatic drainage). VEGF then disappears either by internalization of receptors located on the luminal endothelial surface to which they bind or, when the receptor densities are very low, by plasma clearance. This overall transport explains why, regardless of where the receptors are expressed on the endothelial cells (abluminal vs. luminal surfaces), the binding to the receptors occurs more in the tissue than in the plasma (since a higher concentration of free ligands is available in this compartment – due to secretion – as compared to the free VEGF in the blood). However, our simulations have revealed that for high abluminal and low luminal receptor densities, VEGF can bind “preferentially” to VEGFR1 on the abluminal surface and to VEGFR2 on the luminal surface of the endothelial cells. This result requires experimental exploration. In particular, this result shows that quantification of luminal vs. abluminal receptors can be crucial in understanding VEGF signaling in both physiological and pathological conditions. Finally, our simulations reveal that VEGF binds “preferentially” to VEGFR2 compared to VEGFR1. If VEGFR2 is shown to be pro-angiogenic and VEGFR1 is shown to be anti-angiogenic, then we can conclude that, overall, the signaling is mainly pro-angiogenic regardless of the receptor distribution on the endothelial cells.</p>

<title>Summary of VEGF transport in the body.</title>
<p>VEGF is secreted by parenchymal cells in the tissue. Most of VEGF is sequestered in the extracellular matrix or binds to the abluminal receptors and disappears by VEGF-bound receptor internalization. A small fraction (free VEGF) is transported from the available interstitial fluid to the plasma (mostly through the permeability route rather than by the lymphatics). Upon entering the blood, free VEGF either binds to luminal receptors and disappears by VEGF-bound receptor internalization or is cleared from the plasma.</p>

<p>Since VEGF receptor distribution between the abluminal and luminal endothelial surfaces plays such an important role, it would be interesting to investigate if some pathologies could be explained by decreased receptor expression or internalization. For example, in our previous model, we had shown that an increase in VEGF vascular permeability or secretion could not solely explain the increase of free VEGF concentration in plasma seen in cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Stefanini1">[9]</xref>. It could be interesting to see if deregulated receptor expression could explain the plasma VEGF increase in cancer (as compared to healthy subjects). The present model suggests, for example, that VEGF could intravasate in high proportion if the amount of VEGF disappearing by internalization of bound receptors decreases, i.e., if the internalization rate of the receptors or if the receptors expression decreases.</p>
<p>The present model also suggests that, since most of VEGF disappears via internalization of bound receptors (whether on the luminal or abluminal endothelial surface), the increase of internalization of receptors could potentially decrease VEGF signal transduction. This could be done either by increasing the internalization rate of the already-existing receptors or by bioengineering cells expressing VEGF receptors which would have the property of having a high binding affinity for VEGF as well as a higher internalization rates than endothelial cells. Decreasing the VEGF signal transduction of endothelial cells could have potential therapeutic applications.</p>
<p>For a complex system such as the VEGF receptor-ligand interactions and transport considered, it is necessary to add elements and further increase the degree of complexity step by step in order to understand the effect of each factor. We can outline further steps in refining the model. First, the model has looked at the effect of the receptors in the proportion 1∶1∶1 for VEGFR1∶VEGFR2∶NRP1. It would also be of interest to see how unequal ratios of receptors can influence the distribution and concentration of VEGF, especially when experimental data on receptor distribution in vivo become available. Secondly, at the moment, the model considers two isoforms of VEGF: VEGF<sub>121</sub> and VEGF<sub>165</sub>. Other isoforms could be added to the computational model when new quantitative information becomes available. The model could also include neuropilin-2 which could compete for VEGF. Thirdly, the introduction of soluble VEGFR1 (sFlt-1) would also be of interest, especially since recent results have shown that sFlt-1 can serve as an additional means for VEGF to be transported from the plasma into the tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Wu1">[7]</xref>. In that study, we hypothesized that the anti-angiogenic potential of sVEGFR1 may stem from its dominant-negative heterodimerization with cell surface VEGFRs and predicted that the circulating (plasma) level of sVEGFR1 is significantly higher than its interstitial concentrations, which could imply that sVEGFR1 may have a greater modulatory influence on luminal VEGFRs than abluminal VEGFRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Wu1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Wu2">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Platelets have been shown to be significant reservoirs of VEGF in the blood circulation. It would be interesting to include such elements into the model. Again, quantification of luminal receptors would be crucial, especially since platelets have been shown to sequester large amounts of VEGF and release VEGF from α-granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Italiano1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Wartiovaara1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the body tissue compartment was considered to have the properties of skeletal muscle. It could be important to distinguish between highly vascularized and relatively avascular organs, as well as elements with varying rates of lymphatic drainage. This would require experimental data on VEGF secretion and other tissue characteristics that at present are poorly known. Furthermore, luminal and abluminal receptors may not be equally accessible by VEGF possibly because of endothelial cell polarity: basement membrane on the abluminal side and glycocalyx on the luminal side.</p>
<p>A current assumption was the conservation of total (free and bound) density of receptors at each time step. In other words, we assumed that the internalization of receptors was equal to the receptor insertion per abluminal or luminal endothelial surface for each time point. Relaxing such assumptions and replacing them by the experimentally-based receptor dynamics would make the model more accurate.</p>
<p>In our model, we assumed that the vascular permeability was fixed. In reality, VEGF, also known as VPF (vascular permeability factor), plays an important role in regulating permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000622-Roberts1">[22]</xref>. An addition to the model would be to determine a quantitative relationship between the vascular permeability and the concentration of VEGF and include that relationship in the model.</p>
<p>Our study has shown that quantification of luminal vs. abluminal receptors could be very useful to better understand VEGF signaling and the mechanisms underlying VEGF-dependent diseases as well as angiogenesis and will motivate experimental exploration.</p>
