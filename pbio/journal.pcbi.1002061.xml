        <p>Cellular electrophysiology experiments, important for understanding cardiac
                    arrhythmia mechanisms, are usually performed with channels expressed in non
                    myocytes, or with non-human myocytes. Differences between cell types and species
                    affect results. Thus, an accurate model for the undiseased human ventricular
                    action potential (AP) which reproduces a broad range of physiological behaviors
                    is needed. Such a model requires extensive experimental data, but essential
                    elements have been unavailable. Here, we develop a human ventricular AP model
                    using new undiseased human ventricular data: Ca<sup>2+</sup> versus voltage
                    dependent inactivation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (I<sub>CaL</sub>);
                    kinetics for the transient outward, rapid delayed rectifier (I<sub>Kr</sub>),
                        Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange (I<sub>NaCa</sub>), and
                    inward rectifier currents; AP recordings at all physiological cycle lengths; and
                    rate dependence and restitution of AP duration (APD) with and without a variety
                    of specific channel blockers. Simulated APs reproduced the experimental AP
                    morphology, APD rate dependence, and restitution. Using undiseased human mRNA
                    and protein data, models for different transmural cell types were developed.
                    Experiments for rate dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (including peak and
                    decay) and intracellular sodium ([Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) in
                    undiseased human myocytes were quantitatively reproduced by the model. Early
                    afterdepolarizations were induced by I<sub>Kr</sub> block during slow pacing,
                    and AP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternans appeared at rates &gt;200 bpm, as
                    observed in the nonfailing human ventricle.
                    Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) modulated
                    rate dependence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling. I<sub>NaCa</sub> linked
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternation to AP alternans. CaMK suppression or SERCA
                    upregulation eliminated alternans. Steady state APD rate dependence was caused
                    primarily by changes in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, via its
                    modulation of the electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase
                    current. At fast pacing rates, late Na<sup>+</sup> current and
                        I<sub>CaL</sub> were also contributors. APD shortening during restitution
                    was primarily dependent on reduced late Na<sup>+</sup> and I<sub>CaL</sub>
                    currents due to inactivation at short diastolic intervals, with additional
                    contribution from elevated I<sub>Kr</sub> due to incomplete deactivation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Understanding and preventing irregular heart rhythms that can lead to sudden
                    death begins with basic research regarding single cell electrical behavior. Most
                    of these studies are performed using non-human cells. However, differences
                    between human and non-human cell properties affect experimental results and
                    invoke different mechanisms of responses to heart rate changes and to drugs.
                    Using essential and previously unavailable experimental data from human hearts,
                    we developed and validated an accurate mathematical model of the human cardiac
                    cell. We compared cellular behaviors and mechanisms to an extensive dataset
                    including measurements from more than 100 undiseased human hearts. The model
                    responds to pacing rate and premature beats as in experiments. At very fast
                    pacing rates, beat to beat alternations in intracellular calcium concentration
                    and electrophysiological behavior were observed as in human heart experiments.
                    In presence of drug block, arrhythmic behavior was observed. The basis for these
                    and other important rhythmic and irregular rhythm behaviors was investigated
                    using the model.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The first step toward preventing sudden cardiac death is understanding the basic
                mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias at the level of ion channel currents and the
                single myocyte action potential (AP), using both experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Myerburg1">[1]</xref> and theoretical models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Winslow1">[2]</xref>. Obtaining
                ventricular myocytes from human hearts for the study of arrhythmia mechanisms is
                both rare and technically challenging. Consequently, these mechanisms are usually
                studied with human channels expressed in non myocytes, or with non human (rodent or
                other mammalian) myocytes. However, these approaches have limitations, because
                functionally important accessory subunits and anchoring proteins native to
                ventricular myocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Ackerman1">[3]</xref> are absent in expression systems, and even among mammalian
                ventricular myocytes, ion channel kinetics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Akar1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Blechschmidt1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Zicha1">[6]</xref> and consequently arrhythmia
                mechanisms are strongly species dependent.</p>
      <p>These issues limit the applicability of results from animal studies to human cardiac
                electrophysiology and clinical arrhythmia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Rudy1">[7]</xref>. Measurements from undiseased
                human ventricular myocytes are a requisite for understanding human cell
                electrophysiology. Here, we present data from over 100 undiseased human hearts for
                steady state rate dependence, and restitution of the ventricular AP. Importantly, we
                also obtained essential new measurements for the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                current, K<sup>+</sup> currents, and Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                exchange current from undiseased human ventricle. These previously unavailable data
                are critically important for correct formulation of mathematical models for
                simulation of electrophysiology and cellular arrhythmia mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Rudy2">[8]</xref>. Using the new
                data together with previously published experiments, a detailed mathematical model
                of undiseased human ventricular myocyte electrophysiology and Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                cycling was developed and thoroughly validated over the entire range of
                physiological frequencies. This model is referred to as the ORd (O'Hara-Rudy
                dynamic) model throughout the text. Model comparisons are conducted with the ten
                Tusscher-Panfilov (TP) model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-TenTusscher1">[9]</xref>, and the Grandi-Bers (GB) model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Grandi1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The ORd model was used to describe cellular electrophysiology mechanisms specific to
                human ventricular myocytes. Underlying mechanisms of AP duration (APD) rate
                dependence and APD restitution were investigated. The effects of
                    Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) on known
                ionic current and Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling targets were incorporated and
                studied. Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and alternans were reproduced by the
                model. These are important arrhythmogenic phenomena that must be reproduced in order
                to study the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias in human and simulate clinical
                interventions such as drugs.</p>

        <p>Data for I<sub>CaL</sub> in the undiseased human ventricle are from Magyar et

                    and Fulop et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Fulop1">[12]</xref> (both at 37°C, model validation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Magyar et al.
                    measured steady state activation, steady state inactivation, and the current
                    voltage (I–V) curve. Fulop et al. measured recovery from inactivation.
                    However, neither study separated Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent inactivation
                    (CDI) from voltage dependent inactivation (VDI). In fact, no published data are
                    available which separate CDI and VDI in the undiseased or nonfailing human
                    ventricle. For this measurement, we made new recordings in undiseased human

                            visibly more rapid than decay for Ba<sup>2+</sup> or

        <p>Measurements were carried out with Ca<sup>2+</sup> as charge carrier,
                    allowing both CDI and VDI, or with Ba<sup>2+</sup> as charge carrier,
                    allowing only VDI. Results for Sr<sup>2+</sup> were similar to those for
                        Ba<sup>2+</sup>. From holding potential of −60 mV, 75 ms steps
                    were to potentials ranging from −40 to +50 mV (10 mV increments, 3
                    second interpulse interval, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g001">Figure

                    in the early phase of decay in which CDI effects are most prominent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Aggarwal1">[13]</xref>.

                        FRC(t,V<sub>m</sub>) = I(t,V<sub>m</sub>)/I<sub>peak</sub>(V<sub>m</sub>))
                    quantified the voltage and time dependence of inactivation for comparison
                    between charge carriers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g001">Figure
                        1B</xref> compares FRC for Ba<sup>2+</sup> (experiments top left,
                    simulations right), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (experiments bottom left,
                    simulations right). With Ba<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier, FRC
                    monotonically decreased with increasing voltage at all times after peak current.
                    This finding is consistent with dependence of inactivation on voltage alone. In
                    contrast, for Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, FRC did not decrease monotonically
                    with increasing voltage. Rather, Ca<sup>2+</sup> current FRC curves appear
                    to be effectively voltage independent. FRC for CDI+VDI was statistically
                    different from FRC for VDI-alone at the more hyperpolarized potentials
                    (−20 to 0 mV, unpaired two-tailed t-test, p&lt;0.01). Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                    ions caused additional inactivation at these voltages, where VDI-alone was
                    relatively weak. Since the only difference between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and
                        Ba<sup>2+</sup> cases was the charge carrier, it follows that
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions themselves were the source of the additional
                    inactivation. This is evidence that currents carried by Ba<sup>2+</sup>
                    inactivate due to VDI only, while Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents inactivate due
                    to both VDI and CDI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Findlay1">[14]</xref>. There is evidence that Ba<sup>2+</sup> can
                    cause ion dependent inactivation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Grandi2">[15]</xref>. However, Ba<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation
                    was estimated to be 100-fold weaker than CDI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Ferreira1">[16]</xref>, and its effects were not
                    appreciable in FRC experiments.</p>
        <p>To modulate VDI versus CDI in the model, the n gate was introduced, the value of
                    which represents the fraction of channels operating in CDI mode. Under
                    physiological conditions, I<sub>CaL</sub> inactivation is caused by a
                    combination of both CDI and VDI. That is, n is between 0 (all VDI) and 1 (all
                    CDI). This model was based on experiments by Kim et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Kim1">[17]</xref>, where CDI was observed to
                    function as a faster VDI, activated by elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, both
                    CDI and VDI are voltage dependent. The rate of decay in CDI mode is faster than
                    that in VDI mode. The Mahajan et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Mahajan1">[18]</xref> and Decker et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Decker1">[19]</xref>
                        I<sub>CaL</sub> models work similarly.</p>

                    occurs when all Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites are occupied. We considered
                    that the four Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding transitions are in rapid equilibrium
                    and solved the reversible two state reaction of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding
                    and CDI mode activation to obtain the differential equation describing the n
                    gate (Supplement <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002061.s001">Text S1</xref>, page 10).</p>
        <p>In both CDI and VDI modes, there are two weighted time constants for inactivation
                    (time constant weighting described in Methods). We determined time constants for
                    CDI and n gate kinetics in an attempt to represent the shape and magnitude of
                    the FRC measurements (i.e. CDI reduced FRC, particularly at negative
                    potentials). Time constants for VDI gates were determined by inactivation of
                        Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). AP clamp simulations using the formulated
                        I<sub>CaL</sub> model were similar to AP clamp experiments, where
                        I<sub>CaL</sub> was defined as the 1 µM nisoldipine sensitive current
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).
                    Specifically, currents showed spike and dome morphology. In experiments, peak
                    current was −3.0 µA/μF. It was −2.7 µA/µF in
                    simulations. Fast inactivation was 2.5 fold faster when phosphorylated by CaMK,
                    similar to the Decker et al. dog I<sub>CaL</sub> model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Decker1">[19]</xref> and as measured

        <p>The time constant for activation was determined by fitting time to peak from a
                    digitized current trace (Amos et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Amos1">[22]</xref>, their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g012">Figure 12C</xref>, in undiseased human ventricle at

                    V<sub>m</sub> = +40 mV). Greenstein et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Greenstein1">[23]</xref> showed
                    time to peak for hKv4.3 expressed in mouse fibroblast cells. The model provides
                    a qualitative match to these data (considering temperature and expression system
                    differences). That is, the model activation time constant decreases from a peak
                    value of 6.5 to 1.5 ms in near linear fashion with increasing voltage from
                    −20 to 60 mV.</p>
        <p>The inactivation gate has two time constants, each with voltage dependent
                    weighting. Inactivation kinetics and the I–V curve are accurate to the
                    experimental data. A small divergence between simulations and experiments was
                    observed at hyperpolarized potentials along the I–V curve (simulated
                    current was less than in experiments). This may be due to the fact that
                    experimentally measured currents were small and difficult to measure at these
                    potentials. In fact, current was not measureable in 21, 11, 5, and 1 out of 23
                    cells at V<sub>m</sub> = −40, −30, −20,
                    and −10 mV, respectively. Currents with zero values were not included in
                    the experimental I–V averages. However, these currents were included in
                    averages for obtaining steady state activation and steady state inactivation
                    curves in the model. This prevented over representation of the window current
                    (small, appearing late during phase-3 of the AP, shown later). The conductance
                    of the I<sub>to</sub> model was set so that phase-1 behavior of the simulated AP
                    would be similar to undiseased human endocardium experiments (small in
                    endocardium; maximum value ∼1 µA/µF). Measured endocardial APs
                    showed rapid phase-1 repolarization, but did not show positive time derivatives
                    during phase-1 (true notching was generally not observed). Thus, model
                        I<sub>to</sub> conductance was set to the maximum level which did not
                    violate these observations (∼1 µA/µF peak current at 1 Hz
                    pacing).</p>
        <p>CaMK effects on I<sub>to</sub> were incorporated based on measurements by Tessier

                    carried out with/without addition of 1 µM E-4031 to the standard bath
                    solution in order to obtain the difference current. Tail currents were elicited
                    by stepping from −40 mV to various potentials for 1000 ms, and then
                    stepping back down to −40 mV. The deactivation time constant was
                    determined by fitting the tail current decay. The time constant for activation
                    was found by stepping from −40 mV to various potentials for various

                    envelope of tail currents developed at different voltages was measured with an
                    exponential fit to obtain the time constant for activation. Since this process
                    was well fit by a single exponential, we made the fast and slow time constants
                    in the model converge on the activation limb, at depolarized potentials. The
                    steady state activation curve was determined from the I–V curve, after
                    dividing by the driving force, assuming maximal activation at the time of peak

                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), suggests its
                    participation in AP shortening during steady state pacing at fast rate and at
                    short diastolic intervals during restitution; this hypothesis will be explored
                    in a later section. The fast inactivation (rectification, instantaneous in the

                    experiments using a human AP voltage clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Important features of the

                    (current divided by driving force, then normalized). The time constant for
                    activation of late I<sub>Na</sub> was identical to that for fast I<sub>Na</sub>.
                    It is not possible to measure the time to peak for late I<sub>Na</sub> because

        <p>Since Koller measurements were performed in intact hearts, electrotonic coupling
                    effects would have played a role. Therefore, simulations in a strand of 100
                    coupled endo cells were conducted to test whether alternans occurred in coupled
                    tissue as well. Indeed, during CL = 280 ms steady state
                    pacing, alternans developed in the multicellular fiber (results shown in
                    Supplement Figure S10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002061.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>As in Livshitz et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Livshitz1">[77]</xref>, beat to beat alternans in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                    subsystem were the cause of the APD alternans in the model. Longer APs coincided

                    pacing cycle length (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g014">Figure 14A</xref>), we found that clamping the subspace

        <title>Currents Participating in Steady State APD Rate Dependence and APD
                    Restitution</title>
        <p>In order to describe the mechanisms underlying steady state rate dependence and
                    restitution of the APD in the model, it is instructive to first systematically
                    determine which currents participate in these phenomena. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g015">Figure 15</xref>, currents were plotted versus
                        V<sub>m</sub> during steady state and S1S2 restitution pacing for a variety
                    of CLs and DIs, respectively. If I–V curves are CL or DI independent (i.e.
                    curves overlap), then that current did not participate in steady state rate
                    dependence or restitution, respectively. Conversely, if I–V curves
                    depended greatly on CL or DI, then that current played at least some role in
                    these phenomena.</p>

        <p>As CL or DI decreased, fast I<sub>Na</sub>, responsible for the maximum AP
                    upstroke velocity and maximum V<sub>m</sub>, was reduced (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g009">Figure 9</xref>, and principles
                    detailed in Luo and Rudy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Luo1">[79]</xref>). This is because shortened time at resting potential
                    between beats prevents complete recovery from inactivation. Thus, at fast pacing
                    rates, and short DIs, maximum V<sub>m</sub> and upstroke velocity were reduced,
                    explaining some of what follows.</p>
        <p>During steady state pacing, I<sub>Ks</sub> was strongly rate dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g015">Figure 15A</xref>). The I–V
                    curves were dramatically different at different pacing CLs. However,
                        I<sub>Ks</sub> was a relatively small contributor to the rate dependence of
                    APD because I<sub>Ks</sub> density in human ventricle is small under basal
                    conditions (no β-adrenergic stimulation), and changes relative to slow rate
                    values produced minimal additional outward current at fast rates.</p>
        <p>Late I<sub>Na</sub>, I<sub>CaL</sub>, I<sub>NaCa</sub> and I<sub>NaK</sub> also
                    showed CL dependent changes during steady state pacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g015">Figure 15A</xref>). I<sub>NaK</sub> became more
                    outward at fast rates. The changes in I<sub>NaK</sub> were dramatic, and the
                    current density was relatively large. Thus, I<sub>NaK</sub> was an important
                    contributor to APD shortening at fast pacing rates. Late I<sub>Na</sub> became
                    dramatically less inward at fast rates, making it a secondary contributor to APD
                    shortening at fast rates. Changes in I<sub>CaL</sub> and I<sub>NaCa</sub>
                    opposed APD shortening at fast rates; these currents became more inward at short
                    CLs. I<sub>NaCa</sub> increased to match the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                    extrusion burden. Importantly, I<sub>CaL</sub> increased despite reduced channel
                    availability. I<sub>CaL</sub> inactivation gates recovered less between beats as
                    pacing rate increased (∼20% less at CL = 300 ms
                    compared to CL = 2000 ms). The same mechanism caused
                    reduced late I<sub>Na</sub> at fast rates (availability at
                    CL = 300 ms was ∼1/3 that at
                    CL = 2000 ms). However, influences of increased CaMK
                    facilitation combined with increased driving force (reduced maximum
                        V<sub>m</sub>) actually caused I<sub>CaL</sub> to become larger at fast
                    rates.</p>
        <p>If Na<sup>+</sup> is clamped to small values associated with slow pacing
                        ([Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ss</sub> = 6.2 mM
                    at CL = 2000 ms), preventing its accumulation at fast
                    rates, I<sub>NaK</sub> remains small and CL independent (this mechanism is
                    described later in detail), causing plateau voltages to become relatively CL
                    independent. Thus, with Na<sup>+</sup> clamp, I<sub>CaL</sub> changes with
                    pacing rate are different than under control conditions. CL independent plateau
                    voltages confer CL independence to the driving force for plateau
                    I<sub>CaL</sub>. Na<sup>+</sup> clamping reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> (via
                        I<sub>NaCa</sub>) which reduced activated CaMK and thus I<sub>CaL</sub>
                    facilitation. An interesting consequence is that with Na<sup>+</sup> clamp,
                        I<sub>CaL</sub> changes with CL help to cause APD shortening at fast rates,
                    whereas in control (i.e. no Na<sup>+</sup> clamp), I<sub>CaL</sub> changes
                    with CL oppose APD shortening.</p>
        <p>During restitution, late I<sub>Na</sub>, I<sub>to</sub>, I<sub>CaL</sub>,
                        I<sub>Ks</sub> and I<sub>NaCa</sub> showed DI dependent changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g015">Figure 15B</xref>). Dramatically less
                    inward late I<sub>Na</sub> at short DIs helped shorten the APD. The mechanism
                    was reduced availability due to residual inactivation at the start of the S2
                    beat. I<sub>CaL</sub> was reduced for the same reason. This was evident during
                    the plateau. CaMK facilitation did not depend on DI because Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                    accumulation (necessary for CaMK activation) is slow, occurring only after long
                    term pacing to steady state. Similarly, Na<sup>+</sup> did not accumulate
                    at short DIs, which kept I<sub>NaK</sub> constant. Therefore, plateau potentials
                    and I<sub>CaL</sub> driving force during the plateau were relatively DI
                    independent. Just as in the case of Na<sup>+</sup> clamp, these properties
                    combined to allow reduced availability of I<sub>CaL</sub> at short DI to
                    dominate the behavior. However, reduced maximum V<sub>m</sub> increased the
                    driving force during the time of peak I<sub>CaL</sub>, which caused peak current
                    to generally increase at short DIs. At extreme DI of 5 ms, the slow AP upstroke
                    (i.e. reduced dV<sub>m</sub>/dt) caused mild I<sub>CaL</sub> inactivation
                    coincident with activation, so the peak current was reduced compared to
                    DI = 10 ms.</p>
        <p>Changes in other currents (I<sub>to</sub>, I<sub>Ks</sub> and I<sub>NaCa</sub>),
                    though nonzero, were relatively minor due to timing. DI dependent changes that
                    increased or reduced current during phase-1 of the AP had little effect on final
                    repolarization time. The exception is I<sub>Kr</sub>. I<sub>Kr</sub> is large
                    enough that early spiking helped shorten APD at very short DIs (detailed
                    simulations follow).</p>

        <p>Steady state rate dependence of the APD was largely caused by accumulation of
                    intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> at fast rates. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure 16A</xref>. When

                    steady state pacing at CL = 2000 ms, APD lost much of its
                    sensitivity to pacing rate and remained relatively long. Conversely, when the

                    CL = 300 ms, the APD remained relatively short at all
                    rates. Pacing rate dependent [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ss</sub> changes are linked to the AP
                    via I<sub>NaK</sub>, which responds to
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels. I<sub>NaK</sub>
                    increased with [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> at fast rate. However
                    it did not increase, regardless of the pacing rate, when

                            lost almost all rate dependence. Note that slow rate

        <p>Steady state APD rate dependence was not completely eliminated by
                        Na<sup>+</sup> clamp alone. That is, clamping
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ss</sub> to slow rate values did not
                    cause APD curves to become absolutely flat with respect to CL, especially at
                    fast pacing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure
                        16A</xref>, shaded box CL = 300 to 700 ms, solid gray
                    line). This signifies that other mechanisms are involved. When in addition to
                    clamping [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ss</sub> to their slow rate values, we
                    also reset the inactivation gates for late I<sub>Na</sub>, and especially for
                    both late I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>CaL</sub> to their
                    CL = 2000 ms values at the start of each beat, the APD
                    curve flattened further at fast rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure 16A</xref>, dashed gray and dashed-dot-dot
                    gray lines, respectively). Importantly, resetting these inactivation gates
                    alone, without also clamping Na<sup>+</sup>, had little effect on APD rate
                    dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure 16B</xref>).</p>
        <p>As described previously, without Na<sup>+</sup> clamp, fast pacing caused
                    late I<sub>Na</sub> reduction and I<sub>CaL</sub> increase; the former helped
                    while the latter opposed APD shortening. However, with Na<sup>+</sup>
                    clamp, both currents became less inward with fast pacing. Thus, resetting
                        I<sub>CaL</sub> inactivation gates to slow rate values had different effects
                    with, versus without Na<sup>+</sup> clamping. Na<sup>+</sup> clamp
                    prolonged the APD. The prolongation and changed I<sub>CaL</sub> behavior after
                        Na<sup>+</sup> clamp rendered late I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>CaL</sub>
                    gate resetting more potent effectors of further AP prolongation; especially at
                    fast rates where residual inactivation between beats was substantial.</p>
        <p>Rate dependent Na<sup>+</sup> changes only occurred with the steady state
                    pacing protocol due to slow ion accumulation after lengthy pacing regimes. For
                    APD restitution, clamping [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ss</sub> to values from S1 pacing during
                    the S2 beat did not affect APD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure 16E</xref>). However, restitution was dramatically affected by
                    resetting inactivation gates for late I<sub>Na</sub> and/or I<sub>CaL</sub> to
                    their S1 starting values at the start of the S2 beat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure 16D</xref>). APD remained long for all DIs.
                    Conversely, when late I<sub>Na</sub> and/or I<sub>CaL</sub> inactivation gates
                    were reset to S2 starting values for DI = 5 ms, APD
                    remained short for all DIs. Again, resetting these inactivation gates to their
                    slow rate values had only minor effects on steady state APD rate dependence
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure 16B</xref>).</p>
        <p>At very short DIs, I<sub>Kr</sub> played an important role in APD restitution. In
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g017">Figure 17A</xref>, the fast and
                    slow time dependent deactivation gates (xr<sub>fast</sub> and xr<sub>slow</sub>,
                    respectively) were reset to their value at
                    DI = S1 = 1000 ms (dashed gray line,
                    compare to control solid black line). Deactivation of I<sub>Kr</sub> is slow
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). For
                    DI = S1, deactivation was complete between beats. At short
                    DIs, it was incomplete at the start of the S2 beat, enhancing I<sub>Kr</sub>
                    availability (early I<sub>Kr</sub> spiking, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g017">Figure 17B</xref>, bottom) and outward current that
                    contributes to APD shortening. The enhanced availability only mattered at very
                    short DIs, because at these DIs APD was short enough that increased outward
                    current during phase-1 of the AP affected final repolarization time. Changes to
                    currents during later AP phases 2 and 3 (during the plateau and early
                    repolarization, e.g. late I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>CaL</sub>), generally have
                    greater impact on the APD. Early I<sub>Kr</sub> spiking reduced maximum
                        V<sub>m</sub>, which affected all other currents, including late
                        I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>CaL</sub>.</p>

                    Simulations were in single endo cells paced to steady state at
                    CL = 1000 ms. Of note, the TP and GB models do not include
                    late I<sub>Na</sub>. The width of the I<sub>CaL</sub> peak and the morphology
                    were model dependent. It was “cigar shaped” in the TP model. In the
                    GB model, the I<sub>CaL</sub> peak was broad and poorly defined. The ORd model
                        I<sub>CaL</sub> peak was sharp, as seen in undiseased human ventricle

                    a similar morphology with the ORd model. The TP I<sub>Kr</sub> morphology is
                    characterized by an early spike and a wider late spike. The I<sub>Ks</sub>
                    density in the TP model was much larger than in the other models (∼10 fold
                    larger). Density and morphology of I<sub>NaCa</sub> was model dependent.
                        I<sub>NaCa</sub> was smallest in the ORd model (based on undiseased human
                    measurements, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).
                        I<sub>NaK</sub> was roughly 1.5 and 2 fold greater in GB and TP models,
                    respectively, compared with ORd. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peak was
                    much larger in the TP model than in the other models, which were similar to each
                    other. The decay rate of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was
                    somewhat slower in the ORd model (accurate to undiseased human measurements;

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Though the available undiseased human ventricle dataset has been missing essential
                elements, several human ventricle AP models have been developed and published. The
                Priebe and Beuckelmann model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Priebe1">[35]</xref> lacks human specific data for reformulation of major
                currents, and so was based in large part on its guinea pig predecessor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Luo2">[80]</xref>. The TP model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-tenTusscher1">[81]</xref> and
                updated version<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-TenTusscher1">[9]</xref> is easy to use, includes many reformulated currents, and
                simulates physiological restitution and alternans. However, both the TP and GB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Grandi1">[10]</xref> models lack
                sufficient I<sub>CaL</sub> data for validation, and cannot produce EADs. The GB
                model includes K<sup>+</sup> current reformulations using undiseased human data
                for validation, but does not produce AP or Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient alternans.
                EADs and alternans are both important mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis and should be
                reproduced in simulation studies of human arrhythmias. The Iyer et al. model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Iyer1">[34]</xref> is based almost
                entirely on data from human channels expressed in non myocytes. Though the expressed
                channels are human, native myocyte ion channels in the ventricle are composed of a
                variety of protein isoform combinations, auxiliary subunits, cytoskeletal elements,
                and membrane lipid composition, all of which may influence channel behavior.
                Anchoring and other regulatory proteins present in native cells also define the
                local environment for I<sub>CaL</sub> in particular<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Kobayashi1">[82]</xref>, but are not present in
                expression systems.</p>
      <p>Fink et al. modified the TP model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Fink1">[36]</xref> to include updated I<sub>Kr</sub> and I<sub>K1</sub>
                (with [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> dependence) formulations, based on
                undiseased human ventricular measurements. The rate of AP repolarization in this
                modified scheme is more accurate compared with the original TP model. For these
                advantages, the model sacrifices runtime speed (Markov formulation is used for
                    I<sub>Kr</sub>). Other core issues of the TP model carry over to this modified
                version (incorrect I<sub>CaL</sub>, non-physiologically large I<sub>Ks</sub>, and no
                EAD generation under appropriate conditions).</p>
      <p>We believe that the new undiseased human data presented here are essential, and
                substantially increase human specific model accuracy. Due to extensive validation
                using these new data, our model reproduces all of the following important
                physiological behaviors: 1) CDI versus VDI inactivation of I<sub>CaL</sub>; 2)
                reformulated, detailed and accurate kinetics (using weighted time constants) for
                    I<sub>to</sub>, I<sub>NaCa</sub>, I<sub>K1</sub>, I<sub>Kr</sub>,
                I<sub>Ks</sub>, fast I<sub>Na</sub>, and late I<sub>Na</sub>; 3) AP repolarization
                rate from 30% to 90% repolarization; 4) APD at all physiological
                pacing rates with/without block of major currents, 5) APD restitution with/without
                block of delayed rectifier currents; 6) transmural heterogeneity causing upright
                pseudo-ECG T-wave; 7) early afterdepolarizations (EADs); 8) effects of CaMK; and 9)
                AP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient alternans.</p>

        <title>EADs and Repolarization Rate</title>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of the model is its close correspondence to
                    experimental measurements of not only APD90, but also to APD30, 50 and 70 at all
                    physiologically relevant pacing rates and for S1S2 restitution. This large pool
                    of data has previously been unavailable. Accurate repolarization rate (i.e. time
                    between APD30 and 90) for the restitution protocol is crucial for simulating any
                    phenomenon related to reentrant arrhythmia, where head-tail interactions
                    determine refractoriness and vulnerability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Hund2">[83]</xref>. Use of new undiseased data
                    for currents that are active during the plateau and phase-3 of the AP

                    contributed to the correct repolarization rate.</p>
        <p>The rate of repolarization and its effects on I<sub>CaL</sub> control EAD

                    models to reproduce EADs may be due in part to their accelerated repolarization
                    rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). It may
                    also be caused by inaccurate formulation of I<sub>CaL</sub> inactivation,

        <title>Steady State APD Rate Dependence</title>
        <p>Due to the small amplitude and rapid deactivation kinetics of I<sub>Ks</sub> in

                    deactivation and larger amplitude I<sub>Ks</sub> make it the most important
                    current for steady state APD rate dependence (simulations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Faber2">[86]</xref> and experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Rocchetti1">[87]</xref>).
                    Phosphorylation by PKA in the case of β-adrenergic stimulation greatly
                    enhances both the activation rate and amplitude of I<sub>Ks</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Volders1">[88]</xref>. With

                    circumstances – the AP repolarizes in human ventricle experiments even
                    when I<sub>Kr</sub> is blocked<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Jost2">[85]</xref>, and clinical long QT syndrome type 1 is caused by

                    responsible for causing APD changes with pacing rate. Rather, our simulations
                    identified rate dependent changes in I<sub>NaK</sub> secondary to
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> accumulation as a primary cause
                    of APD rate dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure 16A,
                        16C</xref>). This finding is not new. Simulations in dog ventricle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Decker1">[19]</xref>, human
                        atrium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Koivumaki1">[91]</xref>, and in the GB human ventricle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Grandi1">[10]</xref> models all led to this
                    conclusion. However, findings from the Iyer human model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Iyer1">[34]</xref> differ, at least in part,
                    regarding this mechanism. In the Iyer model,
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> affected APD rate dependence via
                        I<sub>NaCa</sub>, which is primarily outward at fast rates. Rate dependence
                    in the TP model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-TenTusscher1">[9]</xref> is less [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>
                    dependent because, as Grandi discussed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Grandi1">[10]</xref>, I<sub>Ks</sub> is
                    exaggerated. Experiments by Pieske et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Pieske1">[57]</xref> investigated
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in heart failure, versus
                    nonfailing human ventricular myocytes. Pieske experiments demonstrate that rate
                    dependent [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> accumulation is an
                    important phenomenon in health and disease. However, additional experiments are
                    needed to determine whether and how [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>
                    affects I<sub>NaK</sub> and APD in human ventricle.</p>
        <p>In addition to I<sub>NaK</sub> and I<sub>NaCa</sub> (both included in the ORd
                    model), intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> is also mediated by fluxes related to
                        H<sup>+</sup>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
                    homeostasis. Exchangers and cotransporters move Na<sup>+</sup> ions down
                    the electrochemical gradient in order to offset the cost of H<sup>+</sup>,
                        CO<sub>2</sub>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> pumping. Na<sup>+</sup>
                    rate dependent handling and consequently I<sub>NaK</sub> should be affected by
                    these processes, which were not explicitly included in the ORd model. In the
                    absence of H<sup>+</sup>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
                    fluxes, it is possible that the role of I<sub>NaK</sub> might have been over
                    estimated. It is important to address this because I<sub>NaK</sub> and its
                    response to Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation was a major cause of APD rate
                    dependence in the model. Thus, we performed simulations where
                    H<sup>+</sup>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> effects on
                        Na<sup>+</sup> were explicitly included, using Crampin and Smith
                        equations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Crampin1">[92]</xref> (Supplement Figure S12 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002061.s001">Text
                    S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Quantitative details of Na<sup>+</sup> handling, I<sub>NaK</sub> and APD
                    rate dependence were affected when we included H<sup>+</sup>,
                        CO<sub>2</sub>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> handling processes. However,
                    the qualitative outcomes were not affected. I<sub>NaK</sub> increase with fast
                    pacing, secondary to Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation, was still the primary
                    determinant of APD rate dependence during steady state pacing.</p>
        <p>Removal of the effects of Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation on steady state APD
                    rate dependence by clamping [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ss</sub> did not completely eliminate
                    APD rate dependence. Especially at fast rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure 16A</xref>, shaded box
                    CL = 300 to 700 ms, solid gray line), APD was not
                    absolutely flat with respect to CL. APD rate dependence was largely unaffected
                    by resetting inactivation gates for late I<sub>Na</sub>, and/or I<sub>CaL</sub>
                    to their slow rate values at the start of each beat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure 16B</xref>). Interestingly, if these gates
                    were reset while also clamping Na<sup>+</sup> to slow rate values, the
                    APD-CL curve became almost completely flat, even at fast rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g016">Figure 16A</xref>, dashed gray and
                    dashed-dot-dot gray lines, respectively). Thus, accumulation of
                        Na<sup>+</sup> and consequent effects on I<sub>NaK</sub> is a major
                    cause of APD rate dependence, however, not the only cause. Other currents also
                    participate at fast pacing rates. Though the GB model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Grandi1">[10]</xref> demonstrated the
                        Na<sup>+</sup>/I<sub>NaK</sub>/APD rate dependence mechanism, it did
                    not show the additional effects of late I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>CaL</sub>. The
                    GB model cannot show these multi-factorial causes of APD rate dependence because
                    it does not include late Na<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g018">Figure 18</xref>), and because I<sub>CaL</sub>
                    kinetics are inaccurate due to lack of experimental data.</p>
        <p>Due to charge conservation, accumulation of
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is associated with an equal
                    reduction in [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and a volume converted
                        [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> increase in tissue clefts and
                    interstitial spaces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Livshitz2">[93]</xref>. This can affect behavior by increasing
                        I<sub>K1</sub> (its [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> sensitivity
                    is included in this model), which depolarizes resting voltage and reduces
                    excitability. However, our simulations represent experiments in an isolated
                    myocyte in a large bath, where [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is
                    constant. Even <italic>in vivo</italic>,
                        [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is tightly controlled via

        <title>APD Restitution</title>
        <p>We showed that in contrast to steady state rate dependence,
                        [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> had no effect on APD
                    restitution. Rather, restitution was primarily caused by the time course of
                    recovery from inactivation of late I<sub>Na</sub> and I<sub>CaL</sub>; processes
                    which had little effect on steady state-rate dependence of APD (absent

                    shorten the APD. APD rate dependence was caused primarily by concentration
                    changes, while APD restitution was caused by gating kinetics. Previous studies
                    have not made this important distinction between steady state rate dependence
                    and restitution mechanisms in human. The role of I<sub>CaL</sub> and its
                    inactivation kinetics in APD restitution reiterates the primacy of
                        I<sub>CaL</sub> in determining basic physiological behaviors, highlighting
                    the importance of the new I<sub>CaL</sub> experimental data, presented here, to
                    model development and validation.</p>
        <p>A role for late I<sub>Na</sub> in restitution could not have been hypothesized
                    using TP or GB models, which have no late I<sub>Na</sub>. The density of late
                        I<sub>Na</sub> was constrained in the ORd model by experiments from
                    nonfailing human ventricular myocyte measurements by Maltsev et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Maltsev1">[51]</xref>, where the
                    late current was measured 200 ms after the start of the voltage clamp step
                    (∼0.35 µA/µF I–V curve maximum). The maximum late
                        I<sub>Na</sub> during the free running AP model was much smaller (∼0.15
                    µA/µF, about half the I–V curve maximum) even at slow pacing
                    rates, where late I<sub>Na</sub> was largest. Late current is difficult to
                    measure directly, and it is possible that the current density was overestimated
                    due to selection bias. That is, late I<sub>Na</sub> is small, and not all cells
                    produced measureable late current (2 of 3 myocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Maltsev1">[51]</xref>). However, we consider the
                    model density of late I<sub>Na</sub> to be accurate based on model reproduction
                    of experiments which consistently showed substantial APD90 shortening following
                    application of 10 µM mexiletine in undiseased human myocardium (90%

        <p>The effect of transmural heterogeneity of accessory β-subunits was not
                    considered in the transmural cell type definitions. However, in the case of
                        I<sub>Ks</sub>, the KCNE1 β-subunit is transmurally heterogeneous. KCNE1
                    protein was about two times greater in M-cells compared to epi cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Szabo1">[69]</xref>. The

                    related description in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002061.s001">Text S1</xref>). Due to the small amplitude of human
                        I<sub>Ks</sub> in the absence of β-adrenergic stimulation,
                    implementation of KCNE1 heterogeneity did not appreciably affect the AP

                    Interestingly, the simulated effects of KCNE1 on activation rate and conductance
                    offset one another. That is, slowed activation and larger conductance in M-cells
                    yielded I<sub>Ks</sub> current that was remarkably close to the control case.

        <p>Steady state rate dependence of APD and APD restitution were the focus of the

                    experiments (same pacing protocols used in experiments were used in the

                    to the time dependence of APD changes. For abrupt CL reduction from 750 to 480

                    simulations, respectively, when CL was abruptly returned to 750 ms. When the CL
                    reduction was more severe, from CL = 750 to 410 ms, the

                    3) rate dependence of maximum (systolic)
                        [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (Supplement Figure S17 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002061.s001">Text S1</xref>),
                    4) rate dependence of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (Supplement
                    Figure S18 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002061.s001">Text S1</xref>), and 5) transmural cell type APD90 at steady state
                    (Supplement Figure S19 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002061.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The findings from our analysis were similar to those shown by Romero et al. using
                    the TP human AP model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Romero1">[101]</xref>. That is, in ORd and TP models, I<sub>Kr</sub> and
                        I<sub>CaL</sub> affect APD90 while I<sub>CaL</sub>, I<sub>NaCa</sub>, and
                        I<sub>NaK</sub> affect peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.
                    One important difference is the role for I<sub>Ks</sub>. A much larger role was
                    played by I<sub>Ks</sub> in the TP model (∼10 fold larger density than in
                    other human models, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g018">Figure
                        18B</xref>). In the TP model, I<sub>Ks</sub> is responsible for steady state
                    rate dependence of the APD (shown by Grandi et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Grandi1">[10]</xref>).</p>
        <p>I<sub>Kr</sub> conductance changes affect APD90 substantially in our model. This
                    was expected, since I<sub>Kr</sub> is the largest outward current (also in
                    experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002061-g008">Figure 8</xref>, and
                    in Romero's analysis using the TP model). Though I<sub>Kr</sub> affects
                    APD, it is not responsible for its rate dependence. Conductance changes in
                        I<sub>NaK</sub> did not substantially affect APD90 because I<sub>NaK</sub>
                    is a relatively small current. Yet, rate dependent changes in I<sub>NaK</sub>
                    (secondary to Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation at fast rate) were the primary
                    determinant of APD rate dependence. [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>
                    at different pacing rates, and thus its relative changes with rate, was by far
                    most sensitive to I<sub>NaK</sub> conductance (Supplement Figure S18 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002061.s001">Text S1</xref>).
                    This supports our strategy for setting I<sub>NaK</sub> conductance to reproduce

        <p>To keep the ORd model computationally efficient and parameters well constrained,
                    the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism was used in formulating current equations. This
                    choice was made as a design principal with the thought that interested users can
                    modularly replace any current or flux with more detailed Markov formulations of
                    mutation or drug effects as desired (e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Clancy1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Silva1">[66]</xref>). Similarly, intracellular
                        Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling can be modified (e.g. more spatial detail,
                    Markov ryanodine receptor implementation), or various signaling pathways and
                    related effects on ion channels can be added (e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Hund1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Heijman1">[89]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Saucerman1">[102]</xref>). The basic ORd model
                    has 41 state variables. In the absence of CaMK and its effects on target
                    currents and fluxes, the number of state variables is 31.</p>
        <p>Exclusion of Markov models increases parameter constraint. It also prevents the

                    activation-recovery interval, an indicator of the cellular epi APD, was ∼260
                    ms in healthy adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Ramanathan1">[104]</xref>. Human monophasic AP measurements are also in this
                        range<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Koller1">[58]</xref>.
                    Measurements from Drouin et al. showed longer APDs (∼350 ms in endo cells on
                    the cut transmural face at CL = 1000 ms). Having validated
                    the endo model based on more than 100 of our own endo AP measurements, we
                    thought it reasonable to use Drouin transmural APD ratios, rather than the
                    uniformly longer APDs themselves, for validation of the transmural cell type
                    models.</p>
        <p>The presence of M cell APs in the nonfailing human heart was observed by Drouin
                    et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Drouin1">[50]</xref>,
                    and more recently by Glukhov et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Glukhov1">[71]</xref>. However, there is
                    controversy regarding the M cell definition and its role in human. Our M cell
                    model was based on data where the M cell was defined by its transmural location.
                    The resulting simulated M cell AP corresponded with the “max cell”
                    observed by Glukhov.</p>
        <p>Recently, Sarkar and Sobie developed a method for quantitative analysis of
                    parameter constraint and relationships between parameters and target outputs in
                    AP models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002061-Sarkar1">[105]</xref>. We did not apply this analysis during model
                    development. However, the extensive validation of channel kinetics and the
                    emergent response of the AP to a variety of dynamic pacing protocols, used in
                    development and validation of the model, ensures sufficient parameter
                    constraint. The parameter sensitivity tests we performed were instructive,
                    though relatively limited (conductance changes only). Application of Sarkar and
                    Sobie's analysis to our model is beyond the scope of this paper, but should
                    provide worthwhile insights regarding inter-relatedness of processes in the
                    human ventricle, in addition to formally testing parameter constraint.</p>

        <title>Pacing Protocols</title>
        <p>For both experiments and simulations, we determined APD at 30, 50, 70 and
                    90% of complete repolarization (APD30–90, in ms). The start of the
                    AP was the time of maximum dV<sub>m</sub>/dt. The time of APDX occurred once
                    membrane voltage was X% of the resting value. Resting voltage was
                    measured immediately prior to each paced beat. For APD rate dependence, pacing
                    was to steady state. For APD restitution (S1S2, or static restitution), S1
                    pacing was at cycle length (CL) = 1000 ms. The S2 beat was
                    delivered at variable diastolic intervals (DIs), measured relative to APD90.</p>
        <p>The dynamic restitution protocol was simulated as in experiments by Koller et

                    beats). APD95 was plotted against DI (where DI = CL –
                    APD95). Unlike static S1S2 restitution, the dynamic restitution protocol allows
                    for more than one APD to be associated with a given DI. This is significant
                    because bifurcation in the dynamic restitution curve is believed to be

        <p>For all channels affected by CaMK, we created separate models for the fully CaMK

                    the proportion of channels affected by CaMK. To calculate the CaMK affected

        <title>Relative Weights in a Two Time Constant Scheme</title>
        <p>When measurements called for a gating process to be represented by both a fast
                    and a slow process, we included separate fast and slow gates. However, we did
                    not simply multiply fast and slow gates to modulate conductance as others have
                    done previously. To do so allows the fast process alone to completely control
                    deactivation/inactivation, and the slow process alone to completely control
                    activation/recovery. Rather, since measurements of bi-exponential behaviors
                    provide the relative weight of fast/slow processes, we modeled the measurements
                    accordingly, and used the weighted sum of fast and slow processes.</p>
