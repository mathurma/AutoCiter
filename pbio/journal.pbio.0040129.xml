				<article-title>Genes Affect Population Growth, but the Environment Determines How</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The dynamics of natural populations are thought to be dominated by demographic and environmental processes with little influence of intraspecific genetic variation and natural selection, apart from inbreeding depression possibly reducing population growth in small populations. Here we analyse hundreds of well-characterised local populations in a large metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly 
					<italic>(Melitaea cinxia),</italic> which persists in a balance between stochastic local extinctions and recolonisations in a network of 4,000 discrete habitat patches. We show that the allelic composition of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase 
					<italic>(Pgi)</italic> has a significant effect on the growth of local populations, consistent with previously reported effects of allelic variation on flight metabolic performance and fecundity in the Glanville fritillary and 
					<italic>Colias</italic> butterflies. The strength and the sign of the molecular effect on population growth are sensitive to the ecological context (the area and spatial connectivity of the habitat patches), which affects genotype-specific gene flow and the influence of migration on the dynamics of local populations. The biological significance of the results for 
					<italic>Pgi</italic> is underscored by lack of any association between population growth and allelic variation at six other loci typed in the same material. In demonstrating, to our knowledge for the first time, that molecular variation in a candidate gene affects population growth, this study challenges the perception that differential performance of individual genotypes, leading to differential fitness, is irrelevant to population dynamics. These results also demonstrate that the spatial configuration of habitat and spatial dynamics of populations contribute to maintenance of 
					<italic>Pgi</italic> polymorphism in this species.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The notion that a population's genetic composition influences its ecological dynamics is conceptually deeply rooted in population biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b003">3</xref>], but to date so few convincing examples have emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b006">6</xref>] that genetic effects on population dynamics are generally thought to be masked or effectively overridden by environmental and demographic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b007">7</xref>]. The exception is inbreeding depression reducing the growth rate of small natural populations, for which there is increasing evidence for both plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b008">8</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b009">9</xref>] and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b004">4</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b010">10</xref>] (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b011">11</xref>]). This is not surprising because fitness is generally expected to show an immediate decline with inbreeding, and the demographic consequences may become quickly apparent in small low-density populations. In contrast, the fitness consequences of genetically determined life-history variants are likely to be more dependent on the ecological context and therefore more difficult to detect, and there need not be any demographic consequences at all: natural selection may determine who survives and reproduces, but the number of individuals surviving might be determined by ecological limiting factors (soft selection).
			</p>
      <p>Molecular genetics has started to make an increasing impact in population biology through emphasis on detecting single gene effects in natural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b012">12</xref>] and through application of genomic tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b013">13</xref>]. As an example, Osborne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b014">14</xref>] have reported that two naturally occurring alleles of the 
				<italic>For</italic> gene, which encodes the cGMP-dependent protein kinase, influence foraging behaviour in 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> larvae and adults. The analogous gene in honeybees influences the regulation of division of labour between forager and nurse bees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b015">15</xref>]. Fitzpatrick et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b012">12</xref>] discuss other examples in behavioural ecology, but there are no comparable examples of allelic variation in candidate genes influencing population dynamics. A major obstacle to detecting such effects is the need to characterise in some detail the ecological context in which single gene effects or differences in gene expression might have demographic consequences in natural populations.
			</p>
      <p>In this paper we analyse the influence of molecular-level variation on population growth in a large data set from the well-studied metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly 
				<italic>(Melitaea cinxia)</italic> in the Åland Islands in southwest Finland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b016">16</xref>]. This metapopulation occurs in a network of approximately 4,000 small habitat patches (dry meadows). The local populations typically consist of less than ten groups of mostly full-sib larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b017">17</xref>], and they have a high risk of extinction. The metapopulation persists in a stochastic balance between extinctions and recolonisations, with around 500 habitat patches being occupied in any given year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b016">16</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b017">17</xref>]. The processes that influence local dynamics (including local extinction) in this species are well understood and include demographic and environmental stochasticity, habitat loss and alteration, emigration from small habitat patches, parasitism by two specialist parasitoids, and inbreeding depression (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b018">18</xref>]). Here we use a comprehensive sample representing hundreds of local populations, typed at seven variable genetic loci (five allozymes and two microsatellites), to analyse the possible dependence of annual change in population size on the genetic composition of the respective populations. For reasons explained below, we first focus on the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase 
				<italic>(Pgi)</italic> as a candidate gene but subsequently compare the results for the six other loci typed in the same material.
			</p>
      <p>
				<italic>Pgi</italic> is an attractive candidate for a polymorphic gene that might influence insect population dynamics. The energetic cost of insect flight is exceptionally high, with some glycolytic enzymes working at rates close to their maximal flux capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b019">19</xref>]. As the catalyst for the interconversion of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate, 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> plays a key role in glucose metabolism and the resupply of energy (ATP) to flight muscles. A previous study on the Glanville fritillary suggested that the ability to rephosphorylate ADP during active flight is associated with high dispersal rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b020">20</xref>]. 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> is often highly polymorphic in natural populations, and it is known to have major effects on fitness in a wide range of taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b024">24</xref>]. Studies on 
				<italic>Colias</italic> butterflies have demonstrated that different allelic combinations (electromorphs) of 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> exhibit distinct kinetic and thermal stability properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b025">25</xref>], leading to variation in flight performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b026">26</xref>] and associated fitness components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b029">29</xref>]. In the Glanville fritillary, recent studies have shown that the most frequent 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> genotypes (
				<italic>ff, fd, dd</italic>—denoting the homozygotes and heterozygote of the 
				<italic>f</italic> and 
				<italic>d</italic> alleles) differ in their flight metabolic rate and fecundity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b030">30</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>We show in this paper that the allelic composition of 
				<italic>Pgi,</italic> but not of the other loci studied, has a significant effect on the growth of local populations in the Glanville fritillary, and thus our results challenge the notion that differential performance of individual genotypes, leading to differential fitness, has no consequences for population dynamics. Moreover, the strength and the sign of the molecular effects on population growth are sensitive to the ecological context, the area and spatial connectivity of the habitat patches, which means that detecting such effects requires comprehensive knowledge of the landscape structure and ecology of the study populations. This study exemplifies how molecular genetic assays of candidate genes can be integrated into ecological field studies to address this central question in population biology.

      <title>Results</title>

        <title>Allelic Variation and Population Growth</title>
        <p>The design of the genetic sampling was aimed at covering the entire metapopulation and thereby all the ecological situations encountered by the local populations at the time of sampling. The pooled material consists of 1,198 larval families (mostly full-sib), each represented by one larva, sampled from all local populations that were known at the time of sampling (
					<italic>n</italic> = 346).
				</p>
        <p>We first describe the results for 
					<italic>Pgi,</italic> then summarise, in the next section, the results for the other loci. The two most common 
					<italic>Pgi</italic> alleles (electromorphs), 
					<italic>d</italic> and 
					<italic>f,</italic> had frequencies of 0.51 and 0.21, respectively, in the pooled material, while five other alleles made up the remaining 0.28. There was much variation among the populations. Considering only the larger populations with more than ten gene copies sampled, the frequency of 
					<italic>f</italic> was &lt;0.06 and &gt;0.42 in the lowest and the highest 10% of populations, respectively.
				</p>
        <p>We describe the 
					<italic>Pgi</italic> composition of local populations by two variables—the sum of the expected frequencies of the 
					<italic>ff</italic> homozygotes and 
					<italic>fd</italic> heterozygotes
					<italic>,</italic> denoted as 
					<italic>F,</italic> and the expected frequency of the 
					<italic>dd</italic> homozygotes, denoted as 
					<italic>D.</italic> We use 
					<italic>F</italic> to characterise populations because a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b030">30</xref>] showed that of the three most common genotypes, the 
					<italic>fd</italic> heterozygotes and 
					<italic>ff</italic> homozygotes have a higher flight metabolic rate and are more fecund than the 
					<italic>dd</italic> homozygotes. 
					<italic>F</italic> and 
					<italic>D</italic> ignore genotypes involving the rarer alleles, which have unknown but most likely lower fitness than the 
					<italic>ff</italic> and 
					<italic>fd</italic> individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b030">30</xref>]. Other combinations of genotypes contrasting the presence or absence of the 
					<italic>f</italic> allele produced similar results, which is not surprising because the respective variables are highly correlated (results for the other groupings of genotypes are summarised in the next section).
				</p>
        <p>To have reasonable estimates of 
					<italic>F</italic> and 
					<italic>D</italic> and to minimise the possible impact of inbreeding in the very smallest populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b031">31</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b032">32</xref>], we omitted populations with less than six 
					<italic>Pgi</italic> gene copies sampled and hence populations with less than three larval families at the time of sampling. The results were essentially the same in regression models including all of the populations but weighting the regression with the number of gene copies typed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040129-t001">Table 1</xref>, footnote).

        <title>Effect of Allelic Composition in Isolated Populations</title>
        <p>In the Glanville fritillary and other comparable butterfly metapopulations, many local populations are so well connected to each other that immigrants make a large contribution to reproduction, often of the order of 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b034">34</xref>,

        <p>Finally, as it is not obvious which combinations of 
					<italic>Pgi</italic> genotypes would best describe the populations for the present purpose, we analysed the effects of alternative groupings of populations' 
					<italic>Pgi</italic> genotypes on their growth using the material for the isolated populations (
					<italic>S<sub>i,t</sub>
					</italic> &lt; 15). Because the frequency of the 
					<italic>f</italic> allele in the metapopulation is relatively low (0.21), many combinations of genotypes involving 
					<italic>f</italic> are highly correlated. For instance, the correlation coefficient between 
					<italic>F</italic> and the frequency of 
					<italic>f</italic> is 0.92 (in the set of 139 populations with 
					<italic>N<sub>t</sub>
					</italic> ≥ 3). Although we do not expect that the present observational data would suffice to critically discriminate which particular 
					<italic>f</italic>-including genotypes have the strongest influence on population dynamics, we calculated alternative models in which we explained 
					<italic>R</italic> with the expected frequency of particular genotype(s), ln 
					<italic>A,</italic> and their interaction. The fraction of variance explained (
					<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) by models with different genotypes were as follows (
					<italic>x<sub>f</sub>
					</italic> is the frequency of 
					<italic>f</italic>): 
					<italic>F</italic> ( 
					<italic>= x<sub>f</sub> x<sub>f</sub>
					</italic> +

					<italic>x<sub>f</sub> x<sub>f</sub>
					</italic> + 
					<italic>2 x<sub>f</sub>
					</italic> (1 − 
					<italic>x<sub>f</sub>
					</italic>) 0.19. Using just the frequency of

        <title>Influence of Habitat Patch Area on the

				</title>
        <p>The positive effect of

					<italic>R</italic> is consistent with the greater average clutch size of 
					<italic>fd</italic> and 
					<italic>ff</italic> individuals than of 
					<italic>dd</italic> individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b030">30</xref>], but why should habitat patch area interact with a population's genotypic composition to influence its dynamics? The patch area effect is not due to a correlated effect of population size, although larger patches tend to have larger populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b017">17</xref>] (correlation coefficient 0.21 between ln 
					<italic>N<sub>t</sub>
					</italic> and ln

				</p>
        <p>The likely explanation relates to the expected time spent in the natal habitat patch by, and the oviposition schedules of, females with different 
					<italic>Pgi</italic> genotypes, which differ in many life-history traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b020">20</xref>,

					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b033">33</xref>], we estimated the values of most of these traits and calculated the expected lifetime egg production of females with and without the 
					<italic>f</italic> allele in small and large habitat patches (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The lifetime reproductive outputs thus obtained were 205 and 298 eggs for

					<italic>f</italic> females, in small and large patches, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040129-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Essentially, the prediction is for 
					<italic>f</italic> females to perform relatively better in small patches due to their faster maturation and higher rate of egg-laying in early life but relatively worse in large patches due to shorter life span and shorter residence time. The interaction between genotype and patch area in egg production is consistent with the comparable interaction between

    <sec id="s3">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present results demonstrate conclusively that among-population allelic variation at 
				<italic>Pgi,</italic> or variation in linkage disequilibrium with that locus, affects population growth in the Glanville fritillary. There was complete lack of comparable effects in six other loci that were typed in the same material, which underscores the biological significance of the results for 
				<italic>Pgi.</italic> Furthermore, the striking contrast between 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> and the other loci also provides a control for any confounding factors: the present results cannot be explained by population history (founder effects, drift), inbreeding, or the spatial population structure, because all such factors affect all loci in the same manner.
			</p>
      <p>At this stage, we cannot exclude the possibility that the association between allelic variation in 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> and population growth would be due to some other genes linked with 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> rather than 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> itself. For instance, it is possible that 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> is located within an inversion maintaining long-term linkage disequilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b038">38</xref>]. However, the comparative evidence strongly suggests that 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> is causally involved. Most important, the results on allelic variation in 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> influencing flight metabolic performance, mating success, and oviposition rate are broadly similar for the Glanville fritillary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b030">30</xref>] and for 
				<italic>Colias</italic> butterflies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b029">29</xref>], despite these taxa having diverged tens of millions of years ago. If the parallel results were due to loci linked with 
				<italic>Pgi,</italic> the linkage would have to be inconceivably strong. In 
				<italic>Colias,</italic> the different 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> variants show differences in their kinetic properties and thermal stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b025">25</xref>] that appear to explain differences in the performance of different genotypes in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b029">29</xref>]. In 
				<italic>Colias eurytheme, Pgi</italic> alleles differ at multiple amino acid sites, but the most consistent differences among electromorphs occur at positions in the loops across the interface between the two monomers of which the molecule consists, which are positions where variation is likely to affect the catalytic properties of the molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b039">39</xref>]. These same sites lie within the only regions of the gene showing strong evidence of selection, based on analysis of nucleotide diversity and hitchhiking by Tajima's D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b039">39</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Arguably, even if allelic variation in 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> affects life-history traits as suggested for the Glanville fritillary and 
				<italic>Colias,</italic> it is not necessary that such variation would have consequences for population dynamics. On the other hand, it would also not be very surprising to detect population dynamic consequences of variation in flight metabolic performance and oviposition rate in butterflies. Flight metabolic performance in the Glanville fritillary influences migration rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b030">30</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b036">36</xref>], and migration rate influences the dynamics of the mostly small local populations in the large metapopulation that we have studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b016">16</xref>]. Density-dependent population regulation is weak in these populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b016">16</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b017">17</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b033">33</xref>], which means that variation in fecundity is expected to have an immediate influence on population growth rate.
			</p>
      <p>In addition to demonstrating an effect of molecular variation and natural selection on population dynamics, an important message from this study is context dependence of these molecular effects. First, 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> composition had a strong effect only in isolated populations, in which population dynamics are relatively little affected by migration from other populations. Second, the interaction between allelic composition and habitat patch area is highly significant, apparently reflecting some of the known differences in the performance of different genotypes in small versus large habitat patches. Thus, our results suggest that the population dynamic consequences of populations' 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> composition may be immeasurable in many situations in the field without experimentally perturbing the allelic frequencies, yet the 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> effect may be very apparent and strong in particular situations, such as the numerous small isolated populations in the present study but possibly also in, for example, the expanding front of invasive species.
			</p>
      <p>
				<italic>Pgi</italic> polymorphisms in butterflies and possibly other taxa may be maintained by heterozygote advantage and a trade-off between enhanced catalytic efficiency and thermal stability among the 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b029">29</xref>]. Heterozygote advantage and molecular trade-offs may operate also in the Glanville fritillary, but whether they do or not, it is clear that molecular variation in 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> interacts with habitat structure and spatial dynamics to influence population growth, which then again feeds back to influence variation in 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> in the heterogeneous landscape. Thus, this study demonstrates not only that genetic variation and natural selection may influence population dynamics but also that the spatial configuration of habitat and spatial dynamics of populations may contribute to the maintenance of genetic polymorphisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b020">20</xref>]. An important challenge for future research is to quantify these statements with metapopulation models explicitly dealing with the 
				<italic>Pgi</italic> locus (and possibly other loci) and parameterised with empirical data of the type in 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040129-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Such a model is needed to fully integrate knowledge of the fitness consequences of molecular variation with spatiotemporal demographic dynamics.

        <p>In early September 1995, we sampled pre-diapause larvae in their “winter nests” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b017">17</xref>] by taking one larva from each larval group that was recorded in each local population (
					<italic>n</italic> = 346 populations, 1,198 larvae). Roughly 50% of the larval groups are recorded during the annual censuses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b017">17</xref>]. The larvae were typed for adenylate kinase 
					<italic>(Ak),</italic> glutamate oxaloacetate transferase 
					<italic>(Got),</italic> peptidase A 
					<italic>(PepA),</italic> peptidase B 
					<italic>(PepB),</italic> and

					<italic>Pgi</italic>) and two microsatellites in each population as a surrogate measure of inbreeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b031">31</xref>].

        <title>Lifetime reproductive success</title>
        <p>We calculated lifetime egg production as a measure of reproductive success of females with and without the 
					<italic>Pgi-f</italic> allele in small and large habitat patches using the following results and assumptions. Among the 139 populations in 1995, the average sizes of “small” and “large” populations were 0.10 and 0.89 ha, respectively, using the limit of 
					<italic>A</italic> = 0.3 ha between the two size classes (as in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040129-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Below, 
					<italic>f</italic> and non-
					<italic>f</italic> refer to individuals with and without the 
					<italic>Pgi-f</italic> allele, and 
					<italic>L</italic> and

				</p>
        <p>Mating occurs faster in more mobile females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b036">36</xref>], and many probably less mobile females remain unmated for a long time, especially in small habitat patches with small numbers of males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b040">40</xref>]. We do not have quantitative data, but the following are plausible values for the daily probability of becoming mated: 
					<italic>f<sub>L</sub> =
					</italic> 1.0, 
					<italic>f<sub>S</sub>
					</italic> = 0.5, non-
					<italic>f<sub>L</sub> =
					</italic> 0.5, non-
					<italic>f<sub>S</sub>
					</italic> = 0.25.
				</p>
        <p>In the experiment of Hanski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b036">36</xref>], the first clutch was laid on day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040129-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). We assume that the daily probability of laying the first clutch (conditional on mating) was 0 for the first 3 d and 0.5 for the subsequent days.
				</p>
        <p>Empirical data collected by M. Saastamoinen (unpublished data) gave the following daily probabilities of laying subsequent clutches, and the average clutch sizes: 
					<italic>f =</italic> 0.4, non-
					<italic>f =</italic> 0.5, and 
					<italic>f =</italic> 220, non-
					<italic>f =</italic> 150. These clutch sizes gave higher lifetime egg production than observed in the experiment of Hanski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b036">36</xref>]; hence we reduced the clutch sizes to 80% of the above values, 
					<italic>f =</italic> 175, non-
					<italic>f =</italic> 120.
				</p>
        <p>In the experiment described by Hanski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b036">36</xref>], daily mortality of females from new populations increases sharply after the age of 14 d but much less steeply in females from old populations. The following values estimated by C. Zheng (unpublished data) were used (equating new-population and old-population females with 
					<italic>f</italic> and non-
					<italic>f</italic> females): 
					<italic>f</italic> females before and after day 14, 0.05 and 0.3; non-
					<italic>f</italic> females before and after day 14, 0.05 and 0.15.
				</p>
        <p>Butterflies were assumed to stay in the natal patch until they became mated and had laid their first clutch, after which they emigrated with the following daily probabilities: 
					<italic>f<sub>L</sub> =
					</italic> 0.2, 
					<italic>f<sub>S</sub>
					</italic> = 0.4, non-
					<italic>f<sub>L</sub> =
					</italic> 0.05, non-
					<italic>f<sub>S</sub>
					</italic> = 0.4. The justifications are as follows. Hanski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b037">37</xref>] found daily emigration probabilities of 0.05 and 0.11 for females originating from old and new populations from a habitat patch of 0.35 ha. The new populations have a higher frequency of 
					<italic>f</italic> females than old populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b030">30</xref>]. We do not have data for the scaling of emigration rate with patch area in 
					<italic>f</italic> and non-
					<italic>f</italic> females, but it is likely that all butterflies have high emigration rate from very small patches (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b041">41</xref>] for a comparison between the sexes in the butterfly 
					<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Proclossiana eunomia</named-content>).
				</p>
        <p>These calculations involve many assumptions that merit further study. It is also possible that there are additional behavioural differences among the 
					<italic>f</italic> and non-
					<italic>f</italic> females. Furthermore, the above calculations ignore the role of males. It is possible that males with the 
					<italic>f</italic> allele are particularly successful mates (as in 
					<italic>Colias</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040129-b029">29</xref>]), which would further enhance the reproductive success of females in populations with a high frequency of the 
					<italic>f</italic> allele.
