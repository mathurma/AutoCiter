<p>Secondary structure in mRNAs modulates the speed of protein synthesis codon-by-codon to improve accuracy at important sites while ensuring high speed elsewhere.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Rapid cell growth demands fast protein translational elongation to alleviate ribosome shortage. However, speedy elongation undermines translational accuracy because of a mechanistic tradeoff. Here we provide genomic evidence in budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells that the efficiency–accuracy conflict is alleviated by slowing down the elongation at structurally or functionally important residues to ensure their translational accuracies while sacrificing the accuracy for speed at other residues. Our computational analysis in yeast with codon resolution suggests that mRNA secondary structures serve as elongation brakes to control the speed and hence the fidelity of protein translation. The position-specific effect of mRNA folding on translational accuracy is further demonstrated experimentally by swapping synonymous codons in a yeast transgene. Our findings explain why highly expressed genes tend to have strong mRNA folding, slow translational elongation, and conserved protein sequences. The exquisite codon-by-codon translational modulation uncovered here is a testament to the power of natural selection in mitigating efficiency–accuracy conflicts, which are prevalent in biology.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Protein synthesis by ribosomal translation is a vital cellular process, but our understanding of its regulation has been poor. Because the number of ribosomes in the cell is limited, rapid growth relies on fast translational elongation. The accuracy of translation must also be maintained, and in an ideal scenario, both speed and accuracy should be maximized to sustain rapid and productive growth. However, existing data suggest a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, making it impossible to simultaneously maximize both. A potential solution is slowing the elongation at functionally or structurally important sites to ensure their translational accuracies, while sacrificing accuracy for speed at other sites. Here, we show that budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells indeed use this strategy. We discover that a codon-by-codon adaptive modulation of translational elongation is accomplished by mRNA secondary structures, which serve as brakes to control the elongation speed and hence translational fidelity. Our findings explain why highly expressed genes tend to have strong mRNA folding, slow translational elongation, and conserved protein sequences. The exquisite translational modulation reflects the power of natural selection in mitigating efficiency–accuracy conflicts, and our study offers a general framework for analyzing similar conflicts, which are widespread in biology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rapid cell growth demands expeditious protein synthesis, which requires a large number of ribosomes. Because ribosomes are limited during rapid cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Warner1">[1]</xref>, fast translational elongation is desired to minimize ribosome sequestration and alleviate ribosome shortage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Bulmer1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kudla1">[4]</xref>. However, several lines of evidence suggest that speedy elongation undermines translational accuracy when other cellular factors such as tRNA concentrations are kept constant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Rodnina1">[5]</xref>. For example, mutations in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> that increase the elongation speed decrease translational fidelity, and vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Tubulekas1">[6]</xref>. Similarly, adjusting the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration during <italic>in vitro</italic> protein synthesis has opposite effects on the elongation speed and translational accuracy (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s001">Figure S1A</xref> for a potential mechanistic explanation of the tradeoff between the speed and accuracy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Johansson1">[7]</xref>. Translational errors are harmful, because of the material and energy waste in synthesizing dysfunctional proteins and the increased risk of deleterious protein misfolding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Drummond1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Yang1">[10]</xref> and misinteraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Yang2">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Given the tradeoff between translational accuracy and elongation speed, a fascinating question is how cells respond if the objective is rapid growth. An obvious strategy is sacrificing speed for accuracy at residues that require accurate translation, while forgoing accuracy for speed at residues where errors are tolerable. Here we investigate whether cells indeed use this strategy and the potential mechanism allowing for the modulation of elongation speed and accuracy codon by codon. The study is made possible by the recent development of the ribosome profiling technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia1">[12]</xref>, which allows estimating elongation speed with codon resolution. In fact, analyses of ribosome profiling data have identified several factors that impact the elongation speed, including, for example, codon usage relative to tRNA concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qian1">[3]</xref>, mRNA secondary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Tuller1">[13]</xref>, and positively charged amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Charneski1">[14]</xref> in eukaryotes and anti–Shine-Dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Li1">[15]</xref>. Here we focus on the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> unless otherwise noted, because of the availability of various datasets in this model eukaryote that are necessary for our analysis.</p>

<title>Conserved Yeast Genes Tend to Have Relatively Slow Translational Elongations</title>
<p>We first used ribosome profiling data to estimate the ribosome density at each codon of each mRNA, which is the relative number of ribosomes whose aminoacyl (A) site is occupied by the codon at a given moment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qian1">[3]</xref>. Assuming negligible ribosome dropoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qian1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Li2">[16]</xref> and homeostasis of cellular protein abundance, we further estimated the translational initiation rates from genomic measurements of mRNA expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia1">[12]</xref>, protein abundances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ghaemmaghami1">[17]</xref>, and protein degradation rates (see Materials and Methods) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Belle1">[18]</xref>. The relative elongation speed of a codon in an mRNA is the translational initiation rate of the mRNA divided by the ribosome density of the codon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qian1">[3]</xref>. We removed the first 50 codons of each coding sequence from our elongation speed analysis to avoid the potential interferences from the reported 5′ elongation “ramp” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Tuller2">[19]</xref> and factors related to translational initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kudla1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Gu1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>The evolutionary conservation of a residue among orthologous proteins (i.e., the inverse of its evolutionary rate) is a proxy for its structural and/or functional importance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kimura1">[21]</xref> and hence the requirement for translational accuracy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Drummond1">[8]</xref>. Similarly, the average conservation of all residues of a protein measures the average requirement for its translational accuracy. Hence, our hypothesized solution to the tradeoff between translational fidelity and elongation speed predicts that the more conserved a gene is, the slower its translational elongation is. Indeed, the average elongation speed of an mRNA is negatively correlated with the average evolutionary conservation of its protein sequence estimated by comparing with orthologs from five other fungal species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; see Materials and Methods for the calculation of averages), suggesting that our hypothesized solution is used by yeast cells at least at the gene level. While the above ribosome profiling dataset was generated from a strain with the S288C background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia1">[12]</xref>, the same pattern was observed when two additional yeast ribosome profiling datasets, generated in two other strains both of the SK1 background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Brar1">[22]</xref>, were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s001">Figure S1B and D</xref>).</p>

<title>Slower translational elongation of yeast genes with higher demands for translational accuracy.</title>
<p>(A) Average elongation speed for a gene decreases as the mean evolutionary conservation of the gene at the protein sequence level increases. The 1,862 yeast genes analyzed are grouped into 30 equal-sized bins. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval of the mean, estimated by bootstrapping the genes 1,000 times. The plot is shown in a log scale on the x axis because evolutionary conservation is calculated by the inverse of evolutionary rate and hence can be very large for proteins with very low rates of evolution. Spearman's rank correlation of the original unbinned data is shown. Note that the rank correlation does not depend on the scale used in the plot. (B) Average elongation speed for a gene decreases as the expression level of the gene increases. The 2,237 yeast genes analyzed are grouped into 30 equal-sized bins. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval of the mean, estimated by bootstrapping the genes 1,000 times. The plot is shown in a log scale on the x axis because the frequency distribution of gene expression level is known to follow a power law. Spearman's rank correlation of the original unbinned data is shown. Note that the rank correlation does not depend on the scale used in the plot. (C) Gene expression rank changes due to an environmental shift from a rich medium to an amino acid starvation medium are negatively correlated with changes in the rank of translational elongation speed. The 1,653 yeast genes that have relevant information are each depicted by a dot.</p>

<title>Theoretical and Empirical Evidence for Decelerated Elongation of Highly Expressed Genes</title>
<p>The expression level of a gene (i.e., its cellular mRNA concentration) is another potential predictor of the requirement for translational accuracy, because the fitness cost of mistranslation increases with the number of translational errors, which is proportional to the amount of protein synthesis and hence mRNA concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Drummond1">[8]</xref>. Nevertheless, the selective pressure for fast elongation to lessen ribosome sequestration also intensifies as the expression level of a gene rises, because a given increase in elongation speed reduces ribosome sequestration more when occurring to a highly expressed gene than to a lowly expressed gene. To predict the outcome of these competing demands, we built a mathematical model that estimates the fitness impact of translational speed and accuracy (see Materials and Methods).</p>
<p>The first part of our model considers the benefit of reducing ribosome sequestration by accelerated elongation. The model assumes equilibrium in cellular protein concentration for each gene, which is achieved by a balance of protein synthesis, degradation, and dilution due to cell division. We parameterized the model with the best estimates from the literature (see Materials and Methods) and calculated the fitness advantage (<italic>s<sub>v</sub></italic>) due to a predefined change (<italic>Δν</italic>) in elongation speed from a baseline for gene <italic>g</italic>. This model showed that, given <italic>Δν</italic>, the absolute value of <italic>s<sub>v</sub></italic> is greater when <italic>Δν</italic> occurs to a highly expressed gene than to a lowly expressed gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, given the expression level, the fitness advantage does not increase linearly with <italic>Δν</italic>, but shows a diminishing return, evident from the increasing distances between the contour lines when <italic>Δν</italic> increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This phenomenon is expected, because as <italic>Δν</italic> in gene <italic>g</italic> increases, ribosomes spend a larger fraction of time on genes other than <italic>g</italic>, effectively reducing the benefit of the increased elongation speed in <italic>g</italic>.</p>

<title>Model prediction of the fitness effect as a function of the relative elongation speed and expression level of a focal gene.</title>
<p>(A) Fitness effect of an increase in elongation speed that mitigates ribosome sequestration. The fitness advantage is shown as a function of elongation speed (relative to the baseline of 20 codons per second) and gene expression level of the focal gene. The magnitude of fitness advantage is shown by different colors, and each solid contour line shows the combinations of gene expression level and elongation speed that result in the same fitness effect. (B) Fitness effect of an increase in elongation speed that reduces translational fidelity. (C) Combined fitness effect of an increase in elongation speed that mitigates ribosome sequestration but also reduces translational fidelity. The dotted line depicts the speed change that results in the biggest fitness increase for a gene with a given expression level. (D) Combined fitness effect of an increase in elongation speed when each of seven parameters in the model varies. Each column of plots has one varying parameter (indicated at the top of the column), whereas the other six parameters remain constant. The value of the varying parameter is indicated in each plot, whereas the values of the other six parameters are indicated in the plots of the middle row. White space in heat maps indicates undefined regions due to either negative elongation speeds or higher translation error rates than allowed by the model. Total mRNA refers to the total number of mRNA molecules per cell.</p>

<p>The second part of our model addresses the fitness cost of mistranslation caused by accelerated elongation. We extrapolated the quantitative relationship between elongation speed and accuracy from experimentally determined tRNA selection reaction rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Johansson1">[7]</xref>. The fitness cost of mistranslation is estimated by assuming that protein molecules containing errors tend to misfold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Drummond1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Yang1">[10]</xref> and by using the recently measured fitness cost of protein misfolding in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-GeilerSamerotte1">[9]</xref>. Similar to the first part of the model, we estimated the fitness effect (<italic>s</italic><sub>t</sub>) of translational errors under different <italic>Δν</italic> and expression levels. The model showed that, given <italic>Δν</italic>, the absolute value of <italic>s</italic><sub>t</sub> is greater when <italic>Δν</italic> occurs to a highly expressed gene than to a lowly expressed gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We then combined the two parts of our model (<italic>s</italic> = <italic>s<sub>v</sub></italic>+<italic>s</italic><sub>t</sub>) to estimate the net gain in fitness due to changes in elongation speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We found that the optimal <italic>Δν</italic> (i.e., the <italic>Δν</italic> maximizing the fitness) is −12.2 and −5.3 codons per second for genes with the highest (5,000 mRNA molecules/cell) and lowest (1) expressions considered, respectively. More importantly, our model predicts a negative correlation between the expression level of a gene and its optimal <italic>Δν</italic> (the dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This prediction appears to be robust to almost all variations of the parameters in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). It is worth pointing out here that, due to the complexity of modeling, we did not consider the loss-of-function effect of translational errors in our model. Because such errors are expected to have bigger effects on highly expressed genes than on lowly expressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Cherry1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Gout1">[24]</xref>, they would further reduce the optimal elongation speed for highly expressed genes, but would have a minimal impact on lowly expressed genes.</p>
<p>The prediction of our model is empirically supported. Specifically, analysis of each of the three yeast ribosome profiling datasets reveals a significantly negative correlation between mRNA concentration and elongation speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s001">Figure S1C and E</xref>). Hence, both our model and the empirical data show that, for highly expressed genes, the demand for translational fidelity trumps that for fast elongation. Furthermore, the partial correlation between expression level and elongation speed remains significant after the control of evolutionary conservation (Spearman's ρ = −0.606, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−236</sup>); so does the partial correlation between evolutionary conservation and elongation speed after the control of expression level (ρ = −0.112, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>).</p>
<p>While all of the above analyses used the ribosome profiling data and gene expression data from rich media, the corresponding data generated from a starvation condition is available for the strain with the S288C background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia1">[12]</xref>. If the elongation speed of a gene can be regulated across environments (see Discussion), our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) would predict a lower speed in the environment where the gene expression is higher. Supporting this prediction, we observed a negative correlation between a gene's between-environment difference in the rank of expression level and that of elongation speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As a negative control, we repeated the above analysis using data from two replicated experiments under the rich media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia1">[12]</xref>. Indeed, the correlation observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g001">Figure 1C</xref> now vanishes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s001">Figure S1F</xref>; see also Materials and Methods), confirming that the original correlation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g001">Figure 1C</xref> is genuine.</p>

<title>Evidence from the Ribosome Run-Off Experiment in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells</title>
<p>Mouse embryonic stem cells were recently subjected to a ribosome run-off experiment, which directly estimates the mean elongation speed for a segment of mRNA without the need to know the translational initiation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia2">[25]</xref>. Because of the design and the limited resolution of the experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia2">[25]</xref>, we estimated the elongation speed for meta-genes representing groups of genes rather than individual genes (see Materials and Methods). We found the average elongation speed of a gene group to be negatively correlated with both its mean protein sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and mean expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that both the conflict between translational speed and accuracy and its resolution are similar between unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. These findings also demonstrate the robustness of our results to different experimental approaches and analyses (see Materials and Methods).</p>

<title>Within-Gene Analysis Reveals Codon-by-Codon Modulation of Elongation Speed and Accuracy</title>
<p>After examining the elongation speed variation among genes, we analyzed it among codons within each yeast gene. Because all codons within a gene share the same translational initiation rate, this analysis is uninfluenced by potential errors in the initiation rate estimation. We first focused on the ribosome profiling data from the strain with the S288C background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia1">[12]</xref>. Among the 1,590 genes with necessary information, the rank correlation between the elongation speed at a codon and the evolutionary conservation of the corresponding amino acid residue encoded by the codon is negative for 854 genes, significantly more than the random expectation of 1,590/2 = 795 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.002, binomial test). The ribosome profiling data from the two strains of the SK1 background also show similar results (strain A14201, 1,202 out of 1,985 genes, <italic>p</italic>&lt;2×10<sup>−21</sup>; strain gb15, 1,207 out of 1,999 genes, <italic>p</italic>&lt;5×10<sup>−21</sup>). We also randomly shuffled the elongation speeds of all codons within a gene and calculated the correlation between speed and conservation. Compared with the correlations calculated from the randomly shuffled data, the real correlations are skewed toward negative values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), as predicted by our hypothesis. To further evaluate the relationship between speed and conservation within a gene, we constructed a 2×2 table by classifying each codon in the gene into one of four categories based on its elongation speed and evolutionary conservation, and calculated an odds ratio (<italic>OR</italic><sub>1</sub>) from the table (see Materials and Methods). The greater the <italic>OR</italic><sub>1</sub> (relative to 1), the stronger the support for our hypothesized strategy. We similarly generated a randomly expected <italic>OR</italic><sub>1</sub> by shuffling the elongation speeds among codons within the gene. We found that the real <italic>OR</italic><sub>1</sub> values are significantly skewed toward larger values when compared with their random expectations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Using the Mantel–Haenszel (MH) procedure to combine the information from all genes, we found the overall <italic>OR</italic><sub>1</sub> to exceed 1 significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Similar patterns as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g004">Figure 4</xref> were observed when the yeast ribosome profiling data from two other strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Brar1">[22]</xref> were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The relatively small deviations from expectations for the correlation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <italic>OR</italic><sub>1</sub> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g004">Figure 4B</xref> are not unexpected, because these analyses were carried out at the codon level, where stochasticity in the ribosome profiling data is substantial due to the small number of reads per codon. To better gauge the effect size, we calculated the ratio in ribosome density between conserved codons (i.e., with invariant amino acids among the six fungal species examined) and nonconserved codons within each gene. In the 100 genes with the highest expressions (which are expected to have the largest numbers of reads), the median and mean of this ratio are 1.07 and 1.45, respectively, corresponding to a 7% and 30% deceleration of elongation, respectively, for conserved codons compared with nonconserved codons (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s017">Text S13</xref>). Collectively, these results support our hypothesis that, within a gene, the translational elongation of a codon is slower when the demand for accuracy is higher.</p>

<title>The Mechanism of Modulating the Tradeoff Between Elongation Speed and Accuracy</title>
<p>What is the molecular mechanism underlying the codon-level modulation of the tradeoff between elongation speed and translational accuracy? A potential answer is synonymous codon usage bias (CUB). It has long been assumed that preferentially used synonymous codons are translated faster than unpreferred codons due to differences in the concentration of their cognate tRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Sorensen1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Hershberg1">[28]</xref>. Recent studies in <italic>E. coli</italic>, yeast, and mouse with ribosome profiling or run-off experiments, however, found similar elongation speeds for synonymous codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qian1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Li1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia2">[25]</xref>. Hence, despite that CUB is known to impact translational accuracy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Drummond1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Akashi1">[29]</xref>, CUB is unlikely to modulate the speed–accuracy conflict. To confirm this, for each of the 18 amino acids encoded by more than one codon, we used an odds ratio (<italic>OR</italic><sub>2</sub>; see Materials and Methods) to measure, within each gene, the relationship between the preference and elongation speed of its synonymous codons. <italic>OR</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt;1 indicates that preferred codons are translated faster than unpreferred codons, and vice versa. We then combined such information from all genes with available information, by the MH procedure. For the strain of the S288C background, 11 amino acids show <italic>OR</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), not significantly more than the random expectation of 9 (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.20, binomial test). The overall <italic>OR</italic><sub>2</sub> combined from 18 amino acids by the MH procedure is 0.98, not significantly different from 1 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.215; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The same analysis was conducted for the other two yeast strains and similar patterns were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s003">Figure S3A and C</xref>). These results demonstrate that the within-gene variation in elongation speed among all codons of an amino acid is not attributable to differences among synonymous codons, suggesting that even the same codon would have different elongation speeds according to different requirements for translational accuracy at different positions of a protein. To verify this prediction, we defined <italic>OR</italic><sub>3</sub>, which is the same as <italic>OR</italic><sub>1</sub> except that it is calculated for each of the 61 sense codons (see Materials and Methods). That is, for a given codon in a given gene, <italic>OR</italic><sub>3</sub>&gt;1 indicates that evolutionary conservation predicts slow translation, and vice versa. Because of the lack of data for one of the codons, we calculated <italic>OR</italic><sub>3</sub> for each of the remaining 60 sense codons in each gene and then statistically combined them across genes. Because <italic>OR</italic><sub>3</sub> is calculated separately for each codon, it has a relatively large standard error, especially for codons that are rarely used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Nonetheless, 42 codons show <italic>OR</italic><sub>3</sub>&gt;1, significantly more than the random expectation of 30 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001, binomial test). There are seven codons whose <italic>OR</italic><sub>3</sub>&gt;1 significantly, whereas no codon has <italic>OR</italic><sub>3</sub>&lt;1 significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). When combined for all codons, <italic>OR</italic><sub>3</sub> significantly exceeds 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). As anticipated from the result on <italic>OR</italic><sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), the deviation of <italic>OR</italic><sub>3</sub> from 1 is relatively small. However, the actual size of effect on translational accuracy by slowed elongation would be better estimated by controlled experiments for individual codons (see below). Notwithstanding, the above observations from the strain of the S288C background, along with similar results from the two strains with the SK1 background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s003">Figure S3B and D</xref>), confirm our prediction and suggest that the regulation of the elongation speed of a codon relies on information beyond the identity of the codon.</p>

<p>What could that information be? It was recently reported that mRNA folding strength and ribosome density are positively correlated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Tuller1">[13]</xref>, suggesting the possibility of mRNA secondary structures serving as elongation brakes. However, the previously shown correlation between mRNA folding and ribosome density was observed for 40-base stretches of mRNA, not specific enough for codon-level modulation of elongation speed. To test whether mRNA secondary structure modulates elongation speed and accuracy codon by codon, for each mRNA, we measured the rank correlation between the elongation speed of a codon at the ribosome A site and the local mRNA folding strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kertesz1">[30]</xref> of the nucleotide that has a predefined distance from the first nucleotide of the focal codon. Unless otherwise noted, the folding strength of a nucleotide site is defined as the probability that the nucleotide is paired in the mRNA secondary structure. The predefined distance is referred to as the offset, ranging from −20 to +20 bases in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). For each offset used, we then calculated the mean correlation from all genes. The strongest signal observed is a negative correlation at the offset of +12 bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4A and D</xref>), which is where mRNA enters the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia1">[12]</xref>. Our observation is not an artifact of read mapping ambiguity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4G and H</xref>; see Materials and Methods). It is further supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> RNA folding strengths quantified at a relatively high temperature (55°C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4I</xref>; see Materials and Methods) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Wan1">[31]</xref>, computationally predicted ribosome-bound RNA folding strengths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4J</xref>; see Materials and Methods), and <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements of RNA folding strengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Rouskin1">[32]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4K</xref>; see Materials and Methods). These results strongly suggest that the elongation speed of a codon is influenced by the folding strength of its downstream nucleotide at the entrance of the ribosome, consistent with recent findings from <italic>in vitro</italic> single-molecule studies of translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qu1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Wen1">[34]</xref>. We found that the above correlation is stronger for genes with more conserved protein sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g006">Figure 6C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4B and E</xref>) or higher expressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g006">Figure 6D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4C and F</xref>), where the demand for translational accuracy is greater (although this could also be due to better data quality for highly expressed genes). The impact of mRNA secondary structure appears to be independent from that of positively charged residues in the nascent peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4L</xref>), another determinant of the elongation speed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Tuller1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Charneski1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Lu1">[35]</xref>. To estimate the effect size of mRNA folding at offset +12 on elongation speed, we calculated, within each gene, the ratio in average ribosome density between codons with high and low RNA folding strengths at offset +12 (see Materials and Methods). In the 100 genes with the highest mRNA concentrations, the median of this ratio is at least ∼1.78 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4N</xref>), corresponding to a ∼40% reduction in elongation speed when a weakly folded nucleotide at offset +12 is changed to strongly folded. This effect is comparable in magnitude to the effect of positively charged residues on elongation speed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Charneski1">[14]</xref> and is stronger than other proposed elongation decelerating mechanisms (see Materials and Methods) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Stadler1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Zinshteyn1">[37]</xref>, but none of these factors appear to modulate the speed–accuracy tradeoff (see below).</p>

<p>If local mRNA folding is the mechanism by which the tradeoff between translational accuracy and elongation speed is modulated, the amino acid conservation of a codon, reflecting the demand for translational accuracy, should be positively correlated with the mRNA folding strength at offset +12. Furthermore, a positive correlation at offset 0 is also expected, because if strong mRNA folding at a nucleotide position is important, mutations at the position will tend to be deleterious and purged by natural selection; consequently, the nucleotide and the codon containing the nucleotide are likely to be conserved evolutionarily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Park1">[38]</xref>. Consistent with these predictions, the two highest peaks in the offset-correlation plot are found at offsets 0 and +12, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Because the folding strengths of neighboring nucleotides are highly similar (see Materials and Methods), the strong signal at offset −1 is likely due to its similarity with offset 0 in mRNA structure. Indeed, the signal is substantially reduced if a partial correlation at offset −1 is calculated after the control of mRNA folding strength at offset 0 (mean ρ = −0.010, binomial <italic>p</italic> = 3.54×10<sup>−3</sup>).</p>
<p>We found mRNA secondary structures to be the dominant mechanism optimizing the speed–accuracy tradeoff, because the within-gene rank correlations between the elongation speed of a codon and the conservation of its encoded amino acid no longer differ from the random expectations after the control of the mRNA folding strength at offset +12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4J</xref>). We estimated that a single mutation that increases the mRNA folding strength of one nucleotide has a fitness effect ranging from 1.5×10<sup>−6</sup> to 7×10<sup>−3</sup> (i.e., 0.00015% to 0.7% fitter), depending on the mRNA concentration (see Materials and Methods). Because this number greatly exceeds the inverse of the effective population size (∼10<sup>7</sup>) of yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Wagner1">[39]</xref>, such mRNA folding-altering mutations can be targeted by natural selection.</p>

<title>Experimental Validation</title>
<p>To experimentally verify the impact of mRNA folding at offset +12 on translational accuracy, we used a yeast dual luciferase reporter system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kramer1">[40]</xref> to quantify the mistranslation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This system contains a chromosome-bound transgene that produces two luciferases, Renilla and firefly, in a fusion protein, allowing the measurement of concentration-independent firefly activity by the ratio between the observed firefly (<italic>F</italic>) and Renilla (<italic>R</italic>) activities. We used three mutants of the firefly segment of the fusion gene, in which codon <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAA</named-content> (Lys) at position 529 was replaced with <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTT</named-content> (Phe), <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAG</named-content> (Stop), and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AGG</named-content> (Arg), respectively. In these mutants, only proteins with mistranslation to Lys at position 529 can display a firefly activity, because no other side chain interacts with the luciferase substrate as the Lys side chain does <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kramer1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kramer2">[41]</xref>. Consequently, the <italic>F</italic>/<italic>R</italic> ratio of the mutant, relative to that of the wild-type (i.e., <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAA</named-content> at position 529), measures the translational error rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kramer1">[40]</xref>. Our model predicts that the mistranslation rate at codon 529 is influenced by the mRNA folding strength at offset +12. We computationally predicted the folding strength at offset +12 using its 3′ sequence, totaling 57 nucleotides from the +12 site to the stop codon. In the wild-type firefly mRNA, the +12 site relative to codon 529 is unpaired, and the only possible synonymous mutation at this site does not render it paired. To create a “paired” version in which the +12 site is paired, we swapped the synonymous codons in the 3′ sequence such that the protein sequence, nucleotide composition, and codon usage are all unaltered. The “paired” version we chose has eight synonymous differences and a greater mRNA folding strength, compared with the wild-type (see Materials and Methods). We similarly swapped the synonymous codons in the 3′ sequence to create an “unpaired” version as a negative control, which also contains eight synonymous differences from the wild-type, but with an unpaired +12 site and a relatively low mRNA folding strength (see Materials and Methods). We quantified the firefly and Renilla activities for all 12 constructs (one wild-type and three mutants at position 529 combined with three versions of the 3′ sequence) and calculated their associated mistranslation rates. When the wild-type 3′ sequence was used, mistranslation rates at position 529 measured in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) resemble those previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kramer1">[40]</xref>. Note that although Kramer et al. originally thought that codon <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTT</named-content> cannot be mistranslated to Lys and thus regarded the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTT</named-content> mutant as a negative control, their experimental data showed otherwise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kramer1">[40]</xref>. Specifically, they reported that the firefly/Renilla ratio is significantly higher for the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTT</named-content> mutant than several other mutants they used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kramer1">[40]</xref>; the only viable explanation is that the mistranslation rate is nonzero and is higher for <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTT</named-content> than for these other mutants. Our result for the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TTT</named-content> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) is consistent with theirs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kramer1">[40]</xref>.</p>

<p>(A) Experimental design. Concentration-independent firefly activity (<italic>f</italic>) is measured by the ratio between the firefly (<italic>F</italic>) and Renilla (<italic>R</italic>) signals. The firefly lysine codon <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAA</named-content> at position 529 (marked in blue in the fusion gene) is replaced with <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AGG</named-content>, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAG</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UUU</named-content> in three mutants, respectively. Because only protein molecules with lysine at position 529 would display luciferase activity, the rate of mistranslation to lysine at position 529 can be estimated by <italic>f</italic>/<italic>f</italic><sub>wt</sub>, where <italic>f</italic><sub>wt</sub> is the <italic>f</italic> value for the wild-type (wt) (i.e., <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAA</named-content> at codon 529). Three versions of the 3′ sequence (region depicted in green in the fusion gene) are respectively used for the white, red, and blue dots in panel (B). (B) The rate of mistranslation to lysine at codon 529 (<italic>f</italic>/<italic>f</italic><sub>wt</sub>) is influenced by the pairing status at the +12 nucleotide. Each genotype was measured in three biological replicates, depicted by three dots. Each dot represents the mean value from four technical repeats of each biological replicate, and the error bar shows the associated standard error. The <italic>p</italic> values are from <italic>t</italic> tests based on the three biological replicates. Note that for <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UUU</named-content>, each white dot is higher than each red dot, which has a probability of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001910.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.05 under the null hypothesis of no difference between white and red dots.</p>

<p>In support of our hypothesis, for each of the three mutants of codon 529, pairing at the +12 site in mRNA reduces the mistranslation rate by at least 50%, compared with their respective wild-type versions where the +12 site is unpaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Furthermore, unpairing the +12 site in our negative control more or less brought back the mistranslation rate to the original level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). These results confirm the effect of mRNA secondary structure, especially the pairing status at offset +12, on translational accuracy, and demonstrate that the effect size can be substantial.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated through mathematical modeling and empirical genomic data analysis that the conflict between translational accuracy and speed is mitigated by sacrificing the speed at codons requiring high accuracy while compromising the accuracy for speed at other codons. By correlating between elongation speed and mRNA folding strength, we discovered that the adaptive tuning of translational speed and accuracy is achieved by differential mRNA folding at offset +12, which serves as a brake to control the elongation speed. Finally, we experimentally validated the impact of mRNA folding at offset +12 on translational accuracy by manipulating the DNA sequence of a transgene in yeast. Taken together, these results provide a unified model of codon-by-codon modulation of translational speed and accuracy, substantially improving our understanding of the translational process and its regulation.</p>
<p>Strong mRNA folding at offset +12 is expected to delay translocation during elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qu1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Wen1">[34]</xref>, but under the current model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Rodnina1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Zaher1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Eyler1">[43]</xref>, eukaryotic translational fidelity is ensured during codon selection at the ribosome A site. Although we experimentally demonstrated the impact of downstream mRNA folding on translational fidelity, the underlying molecular details are unclear. One possibility is that mRNA folding at offset +12 induces a ribosomal conformational change that alters the kinetics of codon selection (e.g., the tRNA acceptance/rejection rate ratio), which could affect the elongation speed and accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s001">Figure S1A</xref>; see also Materials and Methods). Solving the structure of the translating ribosome–tRNA–mRNA complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-BenShem1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Frank1">[45]</xref> with different mRNA folding strengths at offset +12 may offer direct evidence for this model. In addition, tracking the GTP hydrolysis rate during translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Johansson1">[7]</xref> and single-molecule studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qu1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Wen1">[34]</xref> may also help understand the molecule mechanism involved. Most of our genomic analysis (except <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4J</xref>–K) is based on <italic>in vitro</italic> mRNA folding strengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Kertesz1">[30]</xref>, which are only proxies of <italic>in vivo</italic> strengths. Thus, the actual impact of mRNA folding is expected to exceed what <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g006">Figure 6</xref> reveals. Furthermore, our findings imply that mRNA folding <italic>in vivo</italic> is environment-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Cristofari1">[46]</xref>, such that the same mRNA would fold somewhat differently to allow environment-specific tuning of elongation speed. RNA-binding proteins potentially play an important role in environment-specific mRNA folding; future studies should aim to identify these proteins and understand their environment-specific regulations. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001910-g006">Figure 6B</xref> also suggests a positive effect of mRNA folding at offset −13 on elongation speed (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−21</sup>), although this effect is an order of magnitude weaker than the negative effect of mRNA folding at offset +12 (on the basis of fraction of variance explained). The positive effect at offset −13 requires further validation and its biological consequences are currently unknown. Another documented effect of mRNA folding on translational accuracy is pseudoknot triggered frame-shifting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ritchie1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although our experiment directly measured translational accuracy, it was done at only one locus. Systematic estimation of translational accuracy with reasonable sensitivity is nontrivial, because systems like the one used here are not scalable to the entire genome. However, with rapid improvements of proteomic techniques such as high-coverage mass spectrometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-deGodoy1">[48]</xref>, it may be possible to measure translational errors for a large fraction of the proteome in the near future, and our results should be verified at a large scale at that time.</p>
<p>CUB was widely thought to affect elongation speed. But our analysis, along with several recent reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qian1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Li1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia2">[25]</xref>, argues against the role of CUB in regulating the elongation speed in wild-type cells. The interaction between positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide and the negatively charged ribosome exit tunnel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Charneski1">[14]</xref> and mRNA folding at the +12 site appear to be independent factors impacting the elongation speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4L</xref>). However, the occurrence of positively charged amino acids is presumably determined largely by the structure and function of a protein and thus cannot be frequently deployed for regulating the elongation speed. By contrast, the degeneracy of the genetic code allows a certain degree of flexibility in using mRNA secondary structures for regulating the elongation speed. Consistent with this logic, we found mRNA secondary structures to be the dominant mechanism optimizing the speed–accuracy tradeoff (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s004">Figure S4M</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results contrast the common belief of faster elongation of more abundant mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Sharp1">[49]</xref>. Rather, due to the high demand for translational accuracy of abundant proteins and the tradeoff between accuracy and speed, natural selection has resulted in slower translational elongation of more abundant mRNAs. Our findings suggest that the enigmatic positive correlation between gene expression level and mRNA folding strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Park1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Zur1">[50]</xref> at least partially results from selection for slower translational elongation of more abundant mRNAs to minimize mistranslation. Strong pressure for translational fidelity at a codon maintains an mRNA folding requirement at its +12 position and leads this position to evolutionary conservation. Because the demand for translational accuracy increases with expression level, the above mechanism brings an additional constraint to the evolution of highly expressed proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Drummond1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Yang1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Yang2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Park1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated that, to minimize ribosome sequestration, transcriptomic synonymous codon usage should be proportional to the concentrations of their cognate tRNAs such that the cellular demand and supply of tRNAs are balanced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qian1">[3]</xref>. This model is unaffected by the present finding of variable elongation speeds within and between genes, because the time needed for recycling a tRNA is much longer than the codon selection time (see Materials and Methods); consequently, the supply of tRNA is dictated by the tRNA recycling time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). Nonetheless, codon choice at a position may be constrained by the accuracy requirement at its −12 position, adding yet another layer of complexity to CUB.</p>
<p>Similar to protein translation, many biological processes face a tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. A well-known example is in genome replication. It was observed that RNA viruses employ two unique strategies for genome replication, namely the “geometric replication” mode and the “stamping machine” mode. In the geometric replication mode, each RNA strand serves as a template for the synthesis of complementary strands with the same efficiency, whereas in the stamping machine mode, a strand is reiteratively used as a template to synthesize multiple copies of the complementary. Compared with the latter, the former mode is efficient but error-prone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Martinez1">[51]</xref>. It was reported that the turnip mosaic virus (+) and (−) RNA amplification occurs through a mixed strategy, with 93% of genomes via stamping machine and 7% resulting from geometric replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Martinez1">[51]</xref>. Another documented tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy occurs in co-translational protein folding. Computational models predict that slowing the translation can increase the accuracy of co-translational folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-OBrien1">[52]</xref>. Experimentally, disruption of a cluster of unpreferred codons has been shown to affect protein folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Zhang1">[53]</xref>. Given that unpreferred codons are not translated slower than preferred codons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qian1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Li1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia2">[25]</xref>, the experimental result may be due to a change in elongation speed caused by an alteration in mRNA secondary structure. Although selection for co-translational folding accuracy can be an additional reason for a reduced speed of elongation, we were not able to detect a correlation between the elongation speed and protein structural features. This is probably because of the complexity of co-translational protein folding that makes it difficult to have a universal offset between structurally important sites and ribosome stalling codons.</p>
<p>In a more general context, although it is impossible to simultaneously maximize both efficiency and accuracy, it is often possible, at least in principle, to find optimal solutions in which the competing demands are mutually compromised in such a fashion that the resulting fitness is maximized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Shoval1">[54]</xref>. Our finding of the exquisitely modulated translational speed and accuracy at the codon level is a strong testimony that such conflicts can and have been alleviated through mutation and selection. Because the efficiency–accuracy conflict is a form of antagonistic pleiotropy (AP), our results echo the recent report that AP is often resolvable, at least in part, when there is sufficient selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qian2">[55]</xref>. The molecular mechanisms of AP resolution, however, prove to be diverse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Qian2">[55]</xref>.</p>

<p>Tradeoff between elongation speed and accuracy. (A) A cartoon illustrating the tradeoff between elongation speed and accuracy mediated by the tRNA acceptance/rejection rate ratio. For a given codon, the cognate tRNA molecules in the cell are shown by circles and the noncognate tRNAs are shown by rectangles. We use white and black symbols to represent the tRNAs that are accepted and rejected by the ribosome, respectively. That is, the acceptance to rejection rate ratio is the number of white symbols divided by the number of black symbols. According to ribosomal kinetics, the ratio between the acceptance/rejection rate ratio of the cognate tRNA and that of the noncognate tRNA is a constant (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s015">Text S11</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Johansson1">[7]</xref>. That is, (Wc∶Bc)/(Wn∶Bn) is a constant, where Wc, Bc, Wn, and Bn are the numbers of white cognate, black cognate, white noncognate, and black noncognate symbols, respectively. Note that (Wc∶Bc)/(Wn∶Bn) is equivalent to <italic>d</italic> in Eqs. [12], [13], and [14] (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s008">Text S4</xref>). The existence of an efficiency–accuracy tradeoff can be proven mathematically (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s008">Text S4</xref>). As an example, we arbitrarily assign (Wc∶Bc)/(Wn∶Bn) = 3 and the probability for the ribosome to encounter a cognate tRNA to be 50%. The top row of the figure shows relatively low acceptance/rejection rate ratios, whereas the bottom row shows relatively higher acceptance/rejection rate ratios. It is obvious that when the acceptance/rejection rate ratios are low, the elongation speed is low, because the ribosome needs to wait longer to have a tRNA accepted. The speed can be calculated by the fraction of white symbols among all symbols. The accuracy is the faction of white circles among all white symbols. The types of symbols counted in each equation are indicated in the gray-shaded regions below the numbers. One can see that the top row has a higher accuracy than the bottom row.

See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s011">Text S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001910.s016">Text S12</xref> for details. (M) Cumulative probability distributions for the observed and randomly expected within-gene partial rank correlations between the evolutionary conservation of the encoded amino acid of a codon and its elongation speed, after the control of mRNA folding strength (PARS) at offset +12. KS test, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of the equality of the two distributions. The ribosome profiling dataset of Ingolia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001910-Ingolia1">[12]</xref> was used. (N) The effect of mRNA folding strength at offset +12 on ribosome density. Within each gene, we calculated the ratio in average ribosome density between codons with high folding strengths at offset +12 and those with low folding strengths at offset +12. High (or low) folding strength is defined as the highest (lowest) 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% (the x axis) of the PARS values within each gene. The median ratio (y axis) in the 100 genes with the highest expressions is showed. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals, estimated from bootstrapping the genes 1,000 times.
