</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Secretory vesicles in endocrine cells store hormones such as growth hormone (GH) and insulin before their release into the bloodstream. The molecular mechanisms governing budding of immature secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and their subsequent maturation remain unclear. Here, we identify the lipid binding BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain protein PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1) as a key component early in the biogenesis of secretory vesicles in GH-producing cells. Both PICK1-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice displayed somatic growth retardation. Growth retardation was rescued in flies by reintroducing PICK1 in neurosecretory cells producing somatotropic peptides. PICK1-deficient mice were characterized by decreased body weight and length, increased fat accumulation, impaired GH secretion, and decreased storage of GH in the pituitary. Decreased GH storage was supported by electron microscopy showing prominent reduction in secretory vesicle number. Evidence was also obtained for impaired insulin secretion associated with decreased glucose tolerance. PICK1 localized in cells to immature secretory vesicles, and the PICK1 BAR domain was shown by live imaging to associate with vesicles budding from the TGN and to possess membrane-sculpting properties in vitro. In mouse pituitary, PICK1 co-localized with the BAR domain protein ICA69, and PICK1 deficiency abolished ICA69 protein expression. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, PICK1 and ICA69 co-immunoprecipitated and showed mutually dependent expression. Finally, both in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of type 2 diabetes and in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice, we observed up-regulation of PICK1 mRNA expression. Our findings suggest that PICK1, together with ICA69, is critical during budding of immature secretory vesicles from the TGN and thus for vesicular storage of GH and possibly other hormones. The data link two BAR domain proteins to membrane remodeling processes in the secretory pathway of peptidergic endocrine cells and support an important role of PICK1/ICA69 in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Regulated secretion of peptide hormones, such as growth hormone (GH) and insulin, represents a fundamental process in controlling physiological homeostasis. In endocrine cells, hormone-containing vesicles bud from the Golgi apparatus to enable storage and regulated release into the blood stream. Here we show that two proteins with a lipid membrane-shaping BAR domain, PICK1 and ICA69, work together in the pituitary gland and the pancreas to facilitate the budding of early secretory vesicle from the Golgi apparatus. The physiological significance of our findings was borne out by showing that mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies lacking the PICK1 encoding gene have marked growth retardation. PICK1-deficient mice showed increased fat accumulation, reduced body weight and length, as well as reduced glucose clearance from the blood stream. Consistent with these findings, we observed a severe reduction in GH storage in the pituitary and impaired secretion of both insulin and GH in response to physiological stimuli. Finally, we found that PICK1 expression levels were raised in a fly model of type 2 diabetes and in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. These results indicate that alteration of PICK1 expression might play a role in pathophysiological processes of metabolic diseases and/or in a protective compensatory mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The regulated secretory pathway is a hallmark of endocrine, exocrine, and neuronal cells and involves formation of secretory vesicles to enable storage and regulated secretion of cargo molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Borgonovo1">[2]</xref>. Peptide hormones and neuropeptides are synthesized as larger precursors in the endoplasmic reticulum and targeted to the Golgi apparatus. At the trans-Golgi network, the precursors are packaged into immature secretory vesicles that bud from the TGN. During maturation of the immature vesicles, the precursors are processed to active hormones, which are secreted in a regulated manner by fusion of the secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. Although several steps in the regulated secretory pathway have been characterized, the mechanism underlying biogenesis of the secretory vesicles is still poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Borgonovo1">[2]</xref>. A key question is, which molecular components that are responsible for the membrane remodeling and reshaping that is required for budding of vesicles from the TGN and the subsequent maturation of these vesicles. Previous studies indicated that generation of the necessary membrane curvature at the TGN depends on lipids such as diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, and cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Yeaman1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Wang1">[5]</xref>. In addition, it has been suggested that hormone precursors aggregate together with chromogranins in membrane rafts of the TGN, thereby providing a driving force for vesicle budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Huh1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim2">[7]</xref>. The general importance of chromogranins has been substantiated both by depletion experiments in endocrine cells and overexpression experiments in non-endocrine fibroblast-like cells leading to “de novo” formation of dense core-like granules containing chromogranin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Huh1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim2">[7]</xref>. However, the exact molecular components involved in secretory vesicle formation remain unknown.</p>
<p>BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domains are crescent-shaped dimeric α-helical modules that are essential in dynamic remodeling of lipid membranes by means of their unique capacity to both sense and impose membrane curvature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Peter1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Mim1">[11]</xref>. BAR-domain proteins have been implicated in a variety of cellular functions including clathrin-mediated endocytosis where at least four different BAR-domain proteins, including FCHO1/2, endophilin, amphiphysin, and SNX9, are known to be involved in the vesicle budding and fission process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Henne1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-McMahon1">[13]</xref>. Analogous to the plasma membrane, the TGN is a “hotspot” for membrane remodeling and vesicle formation; however, the processes occurring at the TGN have not been characterized in similar details.</p>
<p>Protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) is a BAR domain protein with homology to the BAR domain proteins ICA69 (islet cell autoantigen 69) and arfaptin 1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Steinberg1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Madsen2">[18]</xref>. The protein is widely distributed in the body with highest known expression in the brain, pancreas, and testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao1">[19]</xref>. In the brain, PICK1 is found in many different regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao1">[19]</xref> and known for regulating trafficking and phosphorylation of neurotransmitter receptors, such as the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptor, to which PICK1 binds via an N-terminal PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Steinberg1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Jin1">[17]</xref>. Recently, we unexpectedly discovered that in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, PICK1 is almost exclusively expressed in peptidergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Jansen1">[20]</xref>. Peptide hormones released from these neurosecretory cells are critical for growth and metabolism, but the functional significance of PICK1 expression in these cells is unknown. Of further interest, previous data have suggested that PICK1 exists in part in a heterodimeric complex with the homologous BAR domain protein, ICA69 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao1">[19]</xref>. ICA69 was originally identified as diabetes-associated autoantigen in islet cells of the pancreas and is functionally poorly characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Pilon1">[21]</xref>. It contains an N-terminal BAR domain with homology to the PICK1 BAR domain and a rather long C-terminal domain of unknown structure and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao1">[19]</xref>. ICA69 has been suggested to regulate neurosecretory processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Spitzenberger1">[22]</xref> and to prevent synaptic targeting/localization of PICK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we show that PICK1 is not only expressed in neurosecretory cells of <italic>Drosophila</italic> but also in hormone-producing cells of the mouse pituitary. Phenotypic characterization of mutant PICK1-deficient flies and mice reveal that both are characterized by marked somatic growth retardation. In the flies, this can be rescued by reintroducing PICK1 selectively in peptidergic neurosecretory cells. In the PICK1-deficient mice, we find clear signs of GH deficiency that can be attributed to reduced formation of GH-containing dense core secretory vesicles in the pituitary. We find moreover evidence for decreased levels of prolactin in the pituitary as well as for impaired insulin secretion from the pancreas. Our further analyses indicate a transient localization of PICK1 to early secretory vesicles budding from the TGN, and in vitro we find that the PICK1 BAR-domain can actively sculpt lipid membranes. We also obtain evidence that PICK1 exerts its action in endocrine cells in a heterodimeric complex with ICA69. A more general role of the PICK1/ICA69 complex in secretory vesicle formation is supported by the observation that PICK1 and ICA69 promote vesicular chromogranin localization in non-endocrine COS7 cells. Furthermore, PICK1 mRNA expression is up-regulated in both a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. Summarized, our results suggest a hitherto unknown key role of PICK1 and ICA69 in secretory vesicle formation at the TGN and indicate a putative role of PICK1 during metabolic disease.</p>

<title>Growth Retardation in PICK1-Null <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>By immunostaining we observed an unanticipated PICK1 signal in neurosecretory cells of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Jansen1">[20]</xref>. Because some of these cells secrete peptides governing growth and metabolism, we compared the body weight of <italic>Drosophila</italic> PICK1-null mutants with wild-type (WT) flies. Adult flies, which were homozygous or transheterozygous for two <italic>PICK1</italic>-null alleles, <italic>PICK1<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>PICK1<sup>2</sup></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Jansen1">[20]</xref>, exhibited significant weight loss compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The weight loss was fully rescued in both females and males when expressing PICK1 under control of the <italic>DIMM</italic> promoter, using the <italic>c929-GAL4</italic> driver line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Jansen1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Park1">[23]</xref>. This is in agreement with <italic>DIMM</italic> encoding a transcription factor important for differentiation of peptidergic cells and with the observation that the expression of PICK1 and DIMM largely overlaps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Jansen1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Park1">[23]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, somatic growth and energy homeostasis is influenced by a family of insulin-like peptides (dILPs) that function equivalently to growth hormone (GH) and insulin in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Shingleton1">[24]</xref>. When driving PICK1 expression under the dILP2 promoter, normal growth was rescued in females with a nonsignificant trend in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Together, the results suggest that to ensure proper growth regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PICK1 must be expressed in peptidergic cells, of which cells secreting dILPs play a major role.</p>

<title>Somatic Growth Retardation and GH Deficiency in PICK1-Deficient Mice</title>
<p>To probe the importance of PICK1 for neuroendocrine function in mammals, we studied mice with targeted disruption of the PICK1 gene (PICK1-deficient mice) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Steinberg1">[14]</xref>. In accordance with our <italic>Drosophila</italic> findings, PICK1-deficient mice displayed significantly lower body weight and length compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g001">Figure 1B–C</xref>). To evaluate the body composition of the mice, we performed MRI scans, which revealed significantly higher fat percentage in PICK1-deficient animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, the percentage of lean body mass was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). However, as expected from the lower body weight and length, the absolute lean mass in grams was significantly decreased in PICK1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–B).</p>
<p>The PICK1-deficient mice did not differ significantly from WT littermates in their food and water intake, energy expenditure, or preference for fuel consumption, as determined in calorimetric cages over 72 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s001">Figure S1C</xref>–H). This suggested that the growth impairment and change in body composition were likely the result of a defect in the function of anabolic hormones. Surmising that GH might be a prime candidate, we measured liver weight, IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) levels, and femur length, all well-established markers of the average daily GH secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kwan1">[25]</xref>. Note that because GH is secreted in a pulsatile manner, direct measurements of plasma GH do not reliably assess total GH secretion. Indeed, the weight of the liver, the femur length, and both the IGF-1 plasma level and liver mRNA level were significantly decreased in PICK1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g002">Figure 2A–D</xref>). To assess the ability of the mice to secrete GH in response to a physiologically relevant stimulus, we measured the plasma level of GH 5 min after treatment with ghrelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Sun1">[26]</xref>. In PICK1-deficient mice, the plasma levels of GH were significantly lower after ghrelin than in littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). This decrease in secretion might be the result of impaired hormone storage since the total content of GH in the pituitary was markedly decreased in PICK1-deficient mice, as measured by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The content of prolactin was also significantly decreased, whereas a tendency toward reduction was seen for ACTH and TSH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The impaired storage of GH was not caused by decreased transcriptional activity, because quantitative PCR revealed similar GH mRNA levels in WT and PICK1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, the GH receptor mRNA levels were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g002">Figure 2G</xref>), possibly reflecting a mechanism to compensate for the decreased GH level.</p>

<title>Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Reduced Insulin Secretion in PICK1-Deficient Mice</title>
<p>To characterize further the influence of PICK1 on metabolism, we performed oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). In response to the glucose load, we observed a significant delay in plasma glucose clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and, consistent with this, also a decrease in insulin secretion in PICK1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These findings indicate that not only GH secretion but possibly also insulin secretion is impaired in the absence of PICK1. The impaired glucose tolerance was not due to the insulin resistance commonly observed in obese animal models of T2D. On the contrary, an insulin tolerance test (ITT) revealed increased insulin sensitivity in the PICK1-deficient mice as illustrated by a significant reduction in AUC (area under curve) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In accordance with the increased insulin sensitivity, we observed increased insulin receptor expression in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, increased insulin sensitivity has previously been observed in animal models characterized by impaired GH action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Yakar1">[27]</xref>. Finally, we found decreased plasma triglyceride levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), as described in other rodent models of GH deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Higami1">[28]</xref>. Together, our data suggest that the metabolic phenotype of PICK1-deficient mice is characterized to a large degree by a GH deficit.

<title>Rescue of the Metabolic Phenotype Observed in PICK1-Deficient Mice by Exogenous Administration of GH</title>
<p>To elucidate better the contribution of the GH deficiency to the phenotype observed in the PICK1-deficient mice, we administrated GH once daily to adult (12–16 wk old) mice for 3 wk. Before the treatment was initiated, we measured body weight and body composition of the mice as well as performed oral glucose tolerance and ITTs. Importantly, the data described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g003">3</xref> were confirmed in this cohort of mice (unpublished data). During the treatment period, the body composition was measured every week. The PICK1-deficient mice gradually approached the lean body mass of the littermate WT control mice and were indistinguishable from these already after 2 wk of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), consistent with a rescue of the phenotype by GH administration. We also observed a rescue of the strongly decreased IGF-1 mRNA levels in the liver of the PICK1-deficient mice—that is, the IGF-1 mRNA level in the liver after GH treatment was not significantly different from WT littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The GH treatment, however, did not affect glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, the increased insulin sensitivity was rescued by GH administration, as no difference between PICK1-deficient mice treated with GH and wild-type littermate controls was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g003">Figure 3C</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In summary, the data substantiate the contribution of the GH deficiency to the metabolic phenotype of PICK1-deficent mice and emphasize the conceivable additional contribution from impaired insulin secretion.</p>

<title>PICK1 Is Expressed in the Pituitary and PICK1-Deficiency Leads to a Reduced Pool of Dense Core Secretory Vesicles</title>
<p>To investigate the cellular basis for the metabolic phenotype of PICK1-deficient mice, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of pituitaries from WT and PICK1-deficient mice. Intense PICK1 immunoreactivity was observed in a large fraction of WT pituitary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Around half of the PICK1-positive cells were also positive for GH, while essentially all GH-positive cells showed concomitant PICK1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In individual WT cells, the GH staining formed a dense, often arc-shaped, pattern. Interestingly, in pituitaries from PICK1-deficient mice, the GH staining appeared less intense and less well organized, with no or only very few cells showing the WT pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Electron microscopy confirmed the difference in intracellular structure of the GH-producing cells (identified by their characteristic architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Ozawa1">[30]</xref>). In the PICK1-deficient GH cells, we observed a reduction in the number of secretory dense core vesicles (DCVs) compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g005">Figure 5B–C</xref>). The remaining vesicles were located at the cellular periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) with a possible slight decrease in the average size of the vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). These observations further support that the GH pool is reduced in PICK1-deficient mice.</p>

<p>To assess whether PICK1 also was expressed in other endocrine cells of the pituitary, we performed immunostainings for prolactin and ACTH. A large proportion of cells with ACTH immunoreactivity were positive for PICK1 and, like GH in GH-producing cells, the ACTH immunosignal formed a circular pattern around the nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s003">Figure S3</xref>). For prolactin-positive cells, we also observed PICK1 immunosignal in a fraction of the cells, but we also observed cells that were positive for prolactin but showed no detectable PICK1 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, PICK1 expression is not restricted to GH-producing cells of the pituitary, coherent with a putative role of PICK1 in secretion of other pituitary hormones.</p>

<title>PICK1 Is Expressed in GH-Producing GH1 Cells and Is Critical for GH Storage</title>
<p>To exclude that the reduced GH pool was due to a defect in hypothalamic regulation, we studied GH1 cells, a GH-secreting cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Shapiro1">[31]</xref>. Immunostainings of these cells revealed a strong PICK1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). To test if PICK1 is critical for the GH level in GH1 cells, we used shRNA to knock down PICK1 expression. Knockdown of PICK1 significantly decreased GH immunoreactivity, and thereby conceivably GH storage in shRNA transfected cells, which were identified by their obligate coexpression of EmGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6A–C</xref>). A control shRNA construct neither decreased PICK1 nor GH immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Note that because only ∼5% of the GH1 cells were transfected with the shRNA constructs, it was not possible to assess PICK1 knockdown by, for example, western blotting or the effect on GH levels by ELISA. We should also note that PICK1 deficiency is unlikely to cause enhanced degradation of GH via the lysosomal pathway. Knockdown of PICK1 did not enhance co-localization of GH with lysosomal markers such as lysotracker and LAMP1, and overnight incubation of PICK1-depleted GH1 cells with an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation (leupeptin) did not rescue the GH immunosignal (unpublished data).</p>

Confocal laser scanning micrographs of GH1 cells immunostained for endogenous PICK1 (red) and the cis-Golgi marker giantin (top), the trans-Golgi (TGN) marker TGN38 (middle), and the TGN/immature vesicle marker syntaxin 6 (bottom) (all in green).

<p>To test if PICK1 deficiency in other isolated endocrine cell lines depletes the secreted hormones, we analyzed the effect of PICK1 knockdown in the ACTH-producing AtT-20/D16v-F2 cell line (ATT20) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Gumbiner1">[32]</xref>. In accordance with our findings for GH in GH1 cells, we observed a strong PICK1 immunosignal, and shRNA-mediated knockdown of PICK1 expression significantly reduced the ACTH immunosignal in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>The reduced number of GH-containing DCVs in the pituitary of PICK1-deficient mice, together with reduced GH immunoreactivity in GH1 cells upon PICK1 knockdown, suggest that PICK1 might be directly involved in the biogenesis of GH-containing secretory vesicles. However, although we observed some colocalization of PICK1 with GH punctae in the GH1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, inset ii, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), the PICK1 staining did only in part localize to the GH-positive vesicles and was also seen in juxtanuclear clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The transferrin receptor, a marker of the early endocytic and recycling pathway, did not co-localize with these juxtanuclear PICK1 clusters, nor did the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s005">Figure S5A</xref>–B). To quantify the co-localization we applied Van Steensel's cross-correlation analysis, in which the Pearson cross-correlation is calculated as the signal from one channel (i.e., blue for PICK1) was shifted relative to the signal from the other channel (i.e., green for GH) in the x-direction pixel by pixel. In the Van Steensel's cross-correlation function, the Pearson cross-correlation is then plotted against Δx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Bolte1">[33]</xref>. Consistent with partial but specific co-localization between PICK1 and GH, the cross-correlation function peaked at Δx = 0 with a value of ≈0.13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, we observed essentially no cross-correlation with transferrin or LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s005">Figure S5D</xref>).</p>
<p>We then tested whether PICK1 colocalized with markers for the entire Golgi (58K), the cis-Golgi (GM130, giantin), or the trans-Golgi network (TGN38). Although we did observe some overlap, the PICK1 staining generally displayed a more punctate pattern than the Golgi markers. Moreover, the PICK1 signal was preferentially enclosed by, or closely associated with, the Golgi markers rather than directly co-localizing with them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s006">S6A</xref>–B). Cross-correlation analysis confirmed these observations and revealed the highest maximum cross-correlation value (∼0.4) for TGN38 compared to ∼0.2 for giantin that also displayed a strongly broadened peak, consistent with adjacent localization of PICK1 and giantin with little true overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6F</xref>).

Moreover, we observed that PICK1 immunoreactivity surrounded zones of high dILP2 immunoreactivity in dILP-producing cells, with only partial overlap between the two signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s006">Figure S6D</xref>).</p>

A more striking co-localization was observed for syntaxin 6, a marker of immature secretory vesicles leaving the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Klumperman1">[34]</xref>. When focusing on the punctate staining, it was possible to identify many punctae positive for both PICK1 and syntaxin 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). Furthermore, by staining simultaneously for PICK1, GH, and syntaxin 6, we were able to identify punctae and thus presumably early, immature vesicles positive for PICK1, syntaxin 6, and GH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s006">Figure S6E</xref>–F). Cross-correlation analysis of the syntaxin 6/PICK1 staining substantiated the strong co-localization; that is, the cross-correlation function peaked essentially at ΔX = 0 with a maximum value of 0.55. Importantly, this suggests stronger co-localization between PICK1 and syntaxin 6 than between PICK1 and the Golgi markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>We next tested how PICK1 localization was affected by brefeldin A (BFA), an Arf1 inhibitor, which acutely arrests vesiculation at the Golgi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Nebenfuhr1">[35]</xref>. Interestingly, a brief (5 min) treatment with BFA enhanced the apparent co-localization of PICK1 with TGN38 relative to syntaxin 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Cross-correlation analysis of these data showed that in the absence of BFA the cross-correlation between the PICK1 and syntaxin 6 immunosignal was clearly higher than that between PICK1 and TGN38, whereas the cross-correlation signal was essentially identical after BFA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Brief (5 min) brefeldin A treatment traps PICK1 in the trans-Golgi. Confocal images of GH1 cells immunostained for PICK1, and the trans-Golgi marker TGN38, and the trans-Golgi/immature vesicle marker syntaxin 6 before (top) and after 5 min BFA treatment (bottom). Panels show from left signal from immunolabeled PICK1 (Alexa Fluor 568 signal), signal from TGN38 (Alexa Fluor 488 signal), signal from syntaxin 6 (Alexa Fluor 647 signal), and overlay of the three channels. Insets highlight an area with overlapping localization of PICK1 and syntaxin 6 but with PICK1 adjacent to TGN38 (top) and colocalization of PICK1 with both syntaxin and TGN38 (bottom). (B) Quantification of the PICK1 colocalization with TGN38 and syntaxin 6 after 5 min BFA treatment using Van Steensel's cross-correlation function, which reports the Pearson cross-correlation as a function of the relative movement of the two channels with respect to each other. Both syntaxin 6 and TGN38 show a sharp peak of similar height close to Δx = 0, indicating specific co-localization. Co-localization was quantified for 10–20 cells from three independent experiments, and data are means ± SE. Note that the drop in peak values compared to no BFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6F</xref>) likely reflects the increased diffuse localization of both markers after BFA treatment. (C) Fast time-lapse dual color live confocal imaging showing transient association of YFP-PICK1 BAR with the Golgi marker GalT-Cerulean. Images are maximal intensity projections of representative time-lapse series for YFP-PICK1 BAR (left), YFP PICK1 BAR V121E-L125E (middle), and YFP-PICK1 BAR 3KE (right). The gray scale projections (left images) show the YFP channel alone, indicating highly dynamic behavior of YFP PICK1 BAR (left) and more static behaviour of YFP-PICK1 BAR V121E-L125E (middle) punctae, whereas no punctae are seen for YFP-PICK1 BAR 3KE (right). The dual color projections (right images, YFP channel in yellow, Cerulean channel in blue) show that most of the activity for YFP-PICK BAR (left) is lining the Golgi, whereas YFP-PICK1 BAR V121E-L125E (middle) shows activity throughout the cell. Circles indicate transiently appearing punctate structures (lasting for less than 10 frames, ∼30 s). Crosses indicate stable punctate structures lasting for more than 10 frames. (D) Time-lapse series of two transient punctate structures of YFP-PICK1 BAR, and (E) two stable punctate structures of YFP-PICK1 BAR V121E-L125E. Scale bar, large images 5 µm, time lapse 1 µm. (F) Tubulation of surface-immobilized artificial giant membrane vesicles by the PICK1 BAR domain. Purified and Alexa Fluor 488–labeled GST-PICK1 BAR or GST-PICK1 BAR V121E-L125E (control) with impaired membrane binding capacity. Protein was incubated at room temperature with surface immobilized and fluorescently labeled vesicles before confocal fluorescent imaging. No effect was seen for the mutant, whereas massive tubulation was seen with GST-PICK1 BAR. Arrow indicates a budding vesicle from a single GV.</p>

<p>Note that after BFA treatment the cross-correlation maximum was lower for both TGN38 and syntaxin 6 (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). This is most likely a consequence of an increased diffuse staining of both TGN38 and syntaxin 6 as expected upon BFA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Summarized, the data indicate that BFA traps PICK1 in the TGN and thus that PICK1 might be recruited to the TGN before localizing to Golgi proximal structures. This observation would be consistent with a role of PICK1 in budding of immature vesicles from the Golgi and thereby a function that parallels the role of other membrane-sculpting BAR domain proteins in budding processes such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Henne1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-McMahon1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>To provide further evidence that PICK1 is recruited to the TGN to participate in the vesicle budding process and to investigate the kinetic behavior of PICK1, we first expressed in GH1 cells PICK1 tagged N-terminally with GFP (green fluorescent protein). Unfortunately, overexpressed GFP-PICK1 localized diffusely in GH cells consistent with the previously described autoinhibition of the PICK1 BAR domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Madsen2">[18]</xref>. However, truncation of the N-terminal PDZ domain relieves this autoinhibition, and indeed YFP-PICK1 BAR showed punctate localization in GH cells, with many punctae lining the Golgi compartment (identified by expression of the Golgi marker GalT, β1,4-galactosyltransferase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cole1">[36]</xref> tagged with cerulean fluorescent protein (GalT-Cerulean) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s007">Figure S7</xref>). In contrast, a YFP-PICK1 BAR mutant with strongly reduced lipid binding capacity (3KE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Jin1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Madsen2">[18]</xref> showed diffuse localization in the cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Live confocal imaging of cells co-expressing YFP-PICK1 and GalT-Cerulean revealed a highly dynamic behavior of the YFP-PICK1-positive punctae, in particular in the area lining the Golgi compartment, as illustrated by the maximal intensity projection of the time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, we frequently observed transient events of punctate structures appearing transiently at the edge of the Golgi compartment. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, events lasting for less than 10 frames (∼30 s) are indicated by white dots, whereas stable punctate structures (&gt;10 frames) are indicated by crosses (see also Movie S1). Of the transient events, seven out of 10 occurred at the edge of the Golgi compartment, and two of these events are shown as time series (1 and 2) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7D</xref>. The punctate structures appeared in many cases to originate from protrusions from the Golgi, suggesting that YFP-PICK1 BAR associates with vesicles budding from the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Whether PICK1 dissociates from the newly formed vesicles within the 30 s time frame or whether the vesicles diffuse out of the plane could not be determined. Interestingly, introduction of two negative charges on the hydrophobic face of a putative N-terminal helix of the PICK1 BAR domain (PICK1 BAR V121E-L125E) did not change the punctate localization (Figures S7 and 7C); however, most punctae appeared stable (indicated by crosses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) and we did not see any transient events at the edge of the Golgi during the time lapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7E</xref> and Movie S2). This suggests that V121E-L125E unlike the 3KE mutant is capable of localizing to and clustering at the Golgi but unable to dissociate from it. Notably, it was recently suggested that N-terminal amphipathic helices in BAR domains might facilitate fission events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Boucrot1">[37]</xref>. Summarized, the data demonstrate that the PICK1 BAR domain gets recruited to the Golgi and associates with vesicles that bud from the Golgi network. This further substantiates the idea that PICK1 is critical during the early stages of secretory vesicle formation.</p>
<p>We next asked whether the PICK1 BAR domain is capable of sculpting membranes and thus potentially contributes directly to the budding process. We incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> the isolated and purified PICK1 BAR domain with surface-immobilized artificial giant membrane vesicles. Confocal imaging showed that the PICK1 BAR domain indeed pulled tubular structures from the vesicles, whereas PICK1 BAR V121E-L125E had no observable effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Unfortunately, we could not test the effect of PICK1 BAR 3KE because it expressed poorly in the bacteria, making it impossible to obtain sufficient amount of pure protein for the experiment (unpublished data).</p>

<title>PICK1 Exists in a Complex with ICA69 and PICK1-Deficiency Abolishes ICA69 Protein Expression in Mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>The cellular localization of PICK1 partially resembled that of the closely related BAR domain protein ICA69 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Spitzenberger1">[22]</xref>, previously suggested to associate with PICK1 in neurons via BAR domain heterodimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao1">[19]</xref>. Indeed, ICA69 was expressed in GH1 cells and showed striking colocalization with PICK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) as also reflected in the cross-correlation analysis revealing a sharp peak at Δx = 0 with a maximum &gt;0.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Moreover, ICA69 and PICK1 co-immunoprecipitated in extracts from GH1 cells, supporting that the two proteins form a heterodimeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g008">Figure 8C–D</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of PICK1 expression in GH1 cells caused a parallel robust decrease in the ICA69 protein level, as evidenced by a marked decrease in immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g008">Figure 8A,E,F</xref>). We also assessed ICA69 expression in ATT20 cells, and similar to our observations in GH1 cells, there was significant ICA69 immunostaining overlapping with the PICK1 signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of PICK1 in ATT20 cells significantly reduced ICA69 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s008">Figure S8B</xref>–C).</p>

<p>These observations in GH1 cells led us to investigate ICA69 expression and localization in the pituitary of WT and PICK1-deficient mice by immunohistochemistry. In WT mice, the ICA69 immunosignal clearly overlapped with the PICK1 signal both at the cellular and subcellular levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). Strikingly and consistent with our findings in GH1 cells, we were unable to detect ICA69 expression in PICK1-deficient mice by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). This lack of ICA69 protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting of pituitary extracts from PICK1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g008">Figure 8H</xref>) and was not caused by reduced transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g008">Figure 8I</xref>). To assess whether PICK1-dependency of ICA69 expression is evolutionary conserved, we expressed <italic>Drosophila</italic> ICA69 tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) in peptidergic neurons of WT and PICK1 null flies. In WT neurosecretory neurons, the immunoreactivities of exogenous ICA69-HA and endogenous PICK1 overlapped extensively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). In flies co-expressing ICA69-HA and PICK1A under the control of the pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 driver, we were also able to co-immunoprecipitate the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g009">Figure 9B–C</xref>). Furthermore, the ICA69 immunosignal was dramatically reduced in PICK1-null flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g009">Figure 9D</xref>). We next tested the converse possibility that the PICK1 protein level depends on the ICA69 level, by knocking down ICA69 expression with a UAS-ICA69-RNAi construct. ICA69-RNAi markedly reduced endogenous PICK1 staining, with no change in control brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g009">Figure 9E</xref>). Likewise, Western blots showed a severe drop in the PICK1 immunosignal in ICA69-RNAi flies compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g009">Figure 9F–G</xref>). RT-PCR analysis verified reduced ICA69 mRNA levels in ICA69-RNAi flies, whereas PICK1 mRNA levels were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g009">Figure 9H</xref>). Conversely, in PICK1-null flies ICA69 mRNA was not reduced, whereas PICK1 mRNA was hardly detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g009">Figure 9I</xref>). We finally tested whether the mutual interdependency of PICK1 and ICA69 expression could be reproduced in GH1 and ATT20 cells. This was indeed the case, as shRNA-mediated knockdown of ICA69 led to a parallel decrease in apparent PICK1 expression in both cell lines (Figures S8D–F and S9A–C).</p>

<p>Together, the data suggest that PICK1 might exert its function in a heterodimeric complex with ICA69 and that the two proteins stabilize one another. The ability of PICK1 to stabilize expression of ICA69 was supported by expression of the proteins in a non-endocrine cell line. Flp-In T-REx 293 cells stably expressing HA-tagged ICA69 (HA-ICA69) in a tetracycline-dependent manner (Flp-In T-REx 293 HA-ICA69 cells) were transfected with YFP-PICK1 or empty plasmid before induction of the cells with tetracycline for 24 h. Western blotting revealed several folds higher ICA immunoreactivity in YFP-PICK1-expressing cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s010">Figure S10</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated whether PICK1 together with ICA69 might have a general role in the formation of secretory vesicles. Previously, it was shown that expression of chromogranin A (CgA) in non-endocrine cells can lead to formation of dense core-like granules in non-endocrine cells, consistent with the functional importance of chromogranins in secretory vesicle formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Huh1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim2">[7]</xref>. If, as suggested by our data, PICK1 together with ICA69 function to facilitate the formation of secretory vesicles, we hypothesized that co-expression of PICK1 and ICA69 together with CgA should promote formation of CgA-positive vesicles in non-endocrine cells. First, we expressed PICK1 fused to GFP (GFP-PICK1) and HA-ICA69 either alone or together in COS7 cells. When expressed alone, the resulting GFP-PICK1 and HA-ICA69 immunosignals were relatively uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm showing little co-localization with the Golgi marker giantin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). However, when expressed together, the GFP-PICK1 and HA-ICA69 immunosignals clustered around the nucleus and showed marked overlap with the giantin immunosignal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). When expressed alone in COS7 cells, CgA fused to GFP (CgA-GFP) localized primarily to a Golgi-like juxtanuclear compartment with little localization to punctate structures in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g010">Figure 10B</xref>), a localization that was confirmed in giantin co-stainings (unpublished data). However, when GFP-PICK1 and HA-ICA69 were expressed together with CgA-GFP, we observed a remarkable redistribution of CgA-GFP. Now, CgA-GFP localized to a much higher degree to punctate structures in the cytoplasm, possibly representing CgA containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). Quantification showed that the punctate signal relative to total signal increased almost 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g010">Figure 10C</xref>), consistent with the concept of a direct role of the PICK1/ICA69 complex in formation of CgA containing vesicles. Notably, the majority of the immunosignal from GFP-PICK1 and ICA69 was seen in the Golgi-like juxtanuclear compartment and little co-localization of GFP-PICK1 and HA-ICA69 with CgA in vesicular structures. Importantly, this is agreement with our observation for GH-positive vesicles in GH-1 cells; that is, PICK1 and ICA69 localize primarily to the early secretory vesicles and not necessarily to the mature vesicles.</p>

<title>Altered Expression of PICK1 in Models of Metabolic Diseases</title>
<p>Given the profound metabolic changes in PICK1-deficient flies and mice, we wanted to assess whether PICK1 might be linked to metabolic pathophysiology. First, we used a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of T2D, in which larvae are grown on a high-sugar diet (HSD). As a consequence of the HSD, they develop hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and other hallmarks of human T2D. Moreover, larval development under HSD is considerably delayed due to the resistance of the peripheral tissues to the dILPs, which control <italic>Drosophila</italic> growth and sugar homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g011">Figure 11A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Musselman1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Ashcroft1">[40]</xref>.

The deregulated glucose metabolism was verified by decreased oral glucose tolerance, increased fasting glucose, and increased fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g011">Figure 11C–D</xref>) as well as increased basal and glucose-stimulated plasma insulin levels (basal insulin, 115±17 pg/mL in control mice and 1,110±170 pg/mL in DIO mice p&lt;0.0001; glucose stimulated insulin, 1,830±190 pg/mL in control mice and 7,460±970 pg/mL in DIO mice, <italic>p</italic>≤0.0001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study suggests that the membrane-sculpting BAR domain protein PICK1 serves an important and hitherto unknown role in endocrine physiology by controlling the efficiency of dense core secretory vesicle biogenesis in peptidergic endocrine cells. Our initial key observation is that flies and mice that are deficient in PICK1 display marked somatic growth retardation. In the flies, we can link this phenotype to absence of PICK1 from peptidergic neurons secreting somatotropic peptides functionally equivalent to GH and insulin in mammals. In the mice, we can link the phenotype to impaired storage and secretion of GH from the pituitary and likely also of insulin from the pancreas. At the cellular level, EM analysis of mouse pituitary showed that PICK1 deficiency leads to a prominent decrease in the pool of secretory vesicles. There was no apparent change in vesicle size and appearance, which is consistent with a simple decrease in the rate of secretory vesicle formation. To exclude possible effects of deficient hypothalamic regulation, we also knocked down PICK1 expression in GH1 cells, an immortalized GH-producing cell line. This procedure markedly reduced apparent GH levels, in agreement with our observations in the pituitary.</p>
<p>Co-localization studies suggested that PICK1 primarily is localized adjacent to the Golgi, and we observed strong co-localization with syntaxin 6 that marks immature vesicles budding from the TGN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Klumperman1">[34]</xref>. Our co-localization experiments were quantitatively strongly supported by application of Van Steensel's cross-correlation analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Bolte1">[33]</xref>, although we should note that despite the outcome of this analysis, the experiments do not exclude that PICK1 and ICA69 might reside in yet unidentified compartments as well. Nonetheless, it was striking to observe how a brief brefeldin A treatment enhanced co-localization with TGN, suggesting that PICK1 transiently associates with this compartment. In addition, we could show by live imaging of GH1 cells that the WT PICK1 BAR domain gets recruited to the Golgi and dynamically associates with vesicles that bud from the Golgi network. Together with the ability of the PICK1 BAR domain to tubulate membranes in vitro, these observations support a direct involvement of PICK1 in budding of GH containing vesicles from the TGN.</p>
<p>Our phenotypic analysis of PICK1-deficient mice demonstrated classical characteristics of GH deficiency, including decreased body weight and length, increased body fat accumulation, less lean body mass, reduced ghrelin-induced GH secretion, reduced liver weight, and decreased IGF-1 expression substantiated both by decreased plasma levels and lower mRNA expression in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Alatzoglou1">[42]</xref>. An even more severe metabolic phenotype of PICK1-deficient mice was suggested by decreased glucose tolerance combined with impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion. These observations agree with those of Xia and colleagues showing impaired insulin secretion from β-cells in the pancreas of PICK1-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao2">[29]</xref>. Xia and colleagues did not, however, observe increased insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, they found a small but significant increase in daily food and water intake of the PICK1-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao2">[29]</xref>, where we observed a tendency toward an increase. We have no immediate explanation for these apparent discrepancies other than they might be caused by slight differences in the experimental procedures and the fact that the PICK-deficient mice, although derived from the same knock-out strain, have been maintained separately. It is important to note that increased insulin sensitivity indeed is known to be associated with impaired GH function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Yakar1">[27]</xref>. In further agreement with impaired GH function and increased insulin sensitivity, we identified an up-regulation of insulin receptor protein levels in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Dominici1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Wang2">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>To assess the importance of the GH deficiency for the metabolic phenotype, we administered GH to PICK1-deficient mice, and we observed an increase in lean body mass approaching WT levels within 2 wk. After the treatment, insulin sensitivity was similar to that of WT mice, and IGF1-mRNA expression levels were not significantly different from WT animals. In the glucose tolerance test, we saw no signs of recovery, suggesting that the decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion observed in the PICK-deficient mice is independent of the GH-deficient phenotype. On the other hand, GH treatment is known to be diabetogenic and could negatively affect the glucose tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Yakar1">[27]</xref>. It remains nevertheless an open question whether PICK1 is critical for secretory vesicle biogenesis in peptide-producing endocrine cells in general. In the pituitary, we observed a significant decrease also in prolactin content, but only a trend was seen for ACTH and TSH. However, knockdown of PICK1 in ACTH-producing ATT20 cells led to a significant decrease in apparent ACTH levels, showing that PICK1 might be important for ACTH secretion at least in isolated cells. A more general role of PICK1 in peptide hormone secretion is therefore possible, and it is important to keep in mind that in the PICK1 knock-out mice, adaptive changes occurring during development might compensate for the absence of PICK1 in some systems and not in others, maybe depending on the turnover rate of the secretory vesicle pool.</p>
<p>It is interesting that PICK1 deficiency does not completely deplete the pool of secretory vesicles in the GH-producing cells. This indicates that PICK1 serves primarily to accelerate vesicle formation, trafficking, and maturation. Such a role would also be compatible with previous studies stressing that other cellular components are important for driving TGN vesicle budding and formation. Cholesterol has been proposed to play a role via its ability to promote formation of membrane rafts on the cholesterol-enriched maturing face of the TGN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Wang1">[5]</xref>. Moreover, chromogranins, which are present in secretory vesicles of all neuroendocrine cells, were suggested to constitute a driving force for vesicle budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Huh1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim2">[7]</xref>. Chromogranins aggregate together with prohormones at conditions corresponding to those inside the TGN (i.e., at low pH in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>), and the budding process might be stimulated by associations of these aggregates with membrane rafts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Huh1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim2">[7]</xref>. Remarkably, we could show that co-transfection of PICK1 and ICA69 promotes punctate localization and possibly vesicular storage of chromogranin in non-endocrine COS7 cells, supporting the interesting possibility that chromogranins operate together with the PICK1/ICA69 complex in the biogenesis of secretory vesicles. Hence, PICK1 might, together with ICA69, associate with cholesterol-enriched microdomains on the maturing face of the TGN and thereby impose the necessary bending of the lipid bilayer.</p>
<p>In the accompanying paper, Xia and colleagues propose that PICK1 and ICA69 are associated primarily with immature vesicles positive for proinsulin, while PICK1 alone is associated with mature insulin-positive vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao2">[29]</xref>. We did not find evidence for this distinction in GH1 cells where the co-localization between the two proteins is remarkable, with a Pearson cross-correlation value &gt;0.8. Possibly, there is a functional difference between the two different types of endocrine cells. An important difference is that biosynthesis of insulin involves conversion of proinsulin to insulin, which is not the case for GH. Of note, because the vesicle maturation process involves conversion of proinsulin to insulin, it is possible in insulin-producing cells to use the proinsulin level as a measure of secretory vesicle maturation, which cannot be done in GH-producing cells.</p>
<p>BAR domain proteins have previously been implicated in other budding processes such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Current insights suggest that at least four different BAR domain proteins including the FCHO1/2, SNX9, amphiphysin, and endophilins are involved. Recently, it was demonstrated that FCHO1/2 is required for induction of the initial membrane curvature and thereby for nucleation of clathrin-coated pit formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Henne1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-McMahon1">[13]</xref>. In subsequent steps, amphiphysin is believed to play a role in membrane bending and dynamin recruitment to clathrin-coated pits, SNX9 in AP2 and dynamin binding, and endophilins in dynamin and synaptojanin recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Henne1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-McMahon1">[13]</xref>. However, although both endocytosis and secretory vesicle biogenesis involve vesicle budding, there are also inherent differences between the two processes. For example, the putative driving force provided by a high density of prohormones and chromogranins inside the TGN is not available for endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Kim1">[1]</xref>. Thus, the present data extend the role of two BAR domain proteins to a vesicle-budding process that is different in nature from that of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. An interesting question is whether other BAR domain proteins are involved in addition to PICK1 and ICA69.</p>
<p>With the exception of a function in acrosome biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Xiao1">[45]</xref>, PICK1 has been known almost exclusively for its roles in regulating trafficking and phosphorylation of membrane proteins in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Steinberg1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Jin1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Dev1">[46]</xref>. Hence, our data reveal a remarkable functional diversity of the PICK1 protein by identifying a so far unknown evolutionary conserved function. PICK1 is known particularly for regulating surface levels and subunit composition of AMPA-type glutamate receptors, and thereby for synaptic plasticity including both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as other types of plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Steinberg1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Jin1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Dev1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Gardner1">[50]</xref>. Despite the convincing evidence for these conclusions, it is interesting to consider that the role of PICK1 in synaptic plasticity might also depend on its role in controlling secretory vesicle biogenesis. PICK1 may be involved in storage and secretion of, for example, neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which are known to play an important role in regulating synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Carvalho1">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>PICK1 co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated with the homologous BAR domain protein ICA69 that differs from PICK1 by not having an N-terminal PDZ domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao1">[19]</xref>. We also observed that ICA69 protein expression was strongly dependent on PICK1 in mice, GH1 cells, ATT20 cells, and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain. In FlpIn 293 cells without a regulated secretory pathway, PICK1 enhanced ICA69 protein expression, adding further support to a direct stabilizing role of PICK1. In GH1 cells, ATT20 cells, and flies, we could demonstrate the reciprocal dependency; that is, knockdown of ICA69 reduced PICK1 protein expression. Altogether, the data support that PICK1 exerts its function in a heterodimeric complex with ICA69. This agrees with previous observations indicating heterodimerization of PICK1 with ICA69 in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Cao1">[19]</xref>. Of interest, ICA69 was proposed to be involved in regulating secretion from neurosecretory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Spitzenberger1">[22]</xref> and was also shown to be an effector of the small GTPase Rab2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Buffa1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Sumakovic1">[53]</xref>. Future experimental efforts should further clarify the functional impact of the PICK1/ICA69 interaction.</p>
<p>Because of the severe endocrine dysfunction and changed metabolic homeostasis that we observe in PICK1-deficient mice, we tested whether PICK1 expression might be altered in two metabolic disease models, one in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Musselman1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Ashcroft1">[40]</xref> and one in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Ellacott1">[41]</xref>. In adult flies, reared during development on a HSD, PICK1 mRNA levels increase significantly, and correspondingly PICK1 mRNA levels in the pituitary increase in mice fed on a high-fat diet (DIO mice). We also measured plasma IGF-1 levels in the DIO mice as a marker of GH secretion and found a trend toward an increase. Interestingly, a significant increase in circulating IGF-1 levels was found in a recent study on obese mice introduced to a high-fat diet at a slightly younger age than the mice used on our study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-CordobaChacon1">[54]</xref>. Furthermore, it should be noted that evaluation of the plasma level of free or total IGF-1 in obesity might be complicated by factors such as IGF binding proteins and fat mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Arafat1">[55]</xref>. Summarized, PICK expression appears sensitive to metabolic changes that characterize metabolic syndrome and/or T2D; hence, it is possible that PICK1 plays a role in the pathophysiological process of metabolic diseases or in a protective compensatory mechanism.</p>
<p>It is also striking that the phenotype of the PICK1-deficient mice resembles the clinical symptoms associated with human GH deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Alatzoglou1">[42]</xref>. Congenital GH deficiency has an incidence of one in 4,000–10,000 children, of which the majority is expected to be caused by genetic factors. Nonetheless, the causative genetic defect has only been identified in a small fraction of these patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Alatzoglou1">[42]</xref>. Variants of the PICK1 and perhaps ICA69 could very well be responsible for a subset of idiopathic GH-deficiency patients characterized by decreased somatic growth and increased fat accumulation. Finally, the identification of a BAR domain protein as a key player in controlling storage and secretion of GH and possibly other hormones should prove important for our general understanding of secretory processes and potentially lead to the development of new treatments for diseases characterized by impaired secretion of hormones.</p>

Adult 17–21-wk-old PICK1-deficient mice were treated with GH (250 mg/20 g mouse) once daily for 3 wk. The mice were scanned in an echo MRI every week, and after the two first weeks of treatment, the mice were fasted for 16 h and challenged with an OGTT, and additionally 4 d later, the mice were exposed to an ITT after 2 h fasting. One experimental day and also 2 d before final termination by cervical dislocation, no GH was administrated. After termination the liver was dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen in small pieces.</p>

<title>Glucose Metabolism Measurements</title>
<p>OGTTs were carried out in 10–13-wk-old mice. The animals were fasted overnight for 16–18 h with free access to water. Glucose (1.5 g/kg body weight) was orally administered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Dominici1">[43]</xref>. Blood glucose levels were monitored in the blood samples obtained from tail punctures using a handheld glucometer (Ascensia Contour Glucometer, Bayer) before and after glucose administration. At time points 0 and 15 min, blood was collected from the orbital sinus for measuring plasma insulin levels using Sensitive Insulin RIA KIT (Linco Research). Mice at age 27–29 wk were used for ITT. Food was removed 2 h before the test. Mice were i.p. injected with insulin at a dose of 0.75 U/kg body weight (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Yakar2">[61]</xref>.

<title>Quantitative Real-Time PCR</title>
<p>Relative mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-QPCR) using the Mx3000P from Stratagene and SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM (Takara) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Holst1">[62]</xref>. The relative levels of genes, from different samples, were compared by the ΔΔCt method, using the tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ), or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) as reference gene. In flies in which the internal control was <italic>Rp49</italic>, a gene encoding a ribosomal subunit was used. Before calculating the ΔΔCT value, primer efficiency was validated by standard curve measurements, and primers with more than 95% efficiency was used. A calibrator sample was included in each assay for normalization between runs. RNA was extracted with RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using the ImProm-IITM Reverse Transcriptase (Promega).</p>
<p>For RT-PCR in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, total RNA was purified from fly heads with Nucleospin RNA-II columns (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). For RT-PCR on liver samples, one steel bead together with 1 ml of QIAzol Lysis Reagent were added and mixed with a TissueRuptor. First strand synthesis was performed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). As internal control, the gene <italic>Rp49</italic> encoding a ribosomal subunit was used. RT-PCR was performed on a Mx3000P (Stratagene) using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR Supermix with ROX added as reference dye (Invitrogen).</p>

Finally, the samples were washed in 8×10 min in PBX and 2×5 min in deionized water at RT and mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Polyclonal rabbit anti-<italic>Drosophila</italic> PICK1 (SPY740, described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Jansen1">[20]</xref>) and polyclonal rabbit anti-<italic>Drosophila</italic> golgin-97 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Sinka1">[63]</xref> were used in a concentration of 1∶300, polyclonal rat anti-dILP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Geminard1">[64]</xref> was used in a concentration of 1∶800, and monoclonal rat anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche) was used in a concentration of 200 pg/ml. As secondary antibodies, we used Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (for PICK1 and golgin 97), Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rat IgG (for ICA69-HA), and Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rat IgG (for PICK1-HA and dILP2). For detection of dILP2, flies were kept on standard medium complemented with dried yeast.</p>
<p>For mouse immunohistochemistry, adult mice were sacrificed by decapitation, brains were rapidly removed, and pituitaries from PICK1 WT (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and PICK1-deficient mice (<italic>n</italic> = 7) were dissected out. Pituitaries were then rapidly frozen and kept at −80°C until further processing. Subsequently, pituitary sections were cut on a cryostat (15 µm) and mounted on superslide glasses (SuperFrost Plus, Menzel-Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany). Mounted pituitary sections were fixated in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min and then rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times followed by preincubation for 30 min with 5% (v/v) goat serum in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. For PICK1 colocalization with hormones, sections were then incubated with mouse monoclonal PICK1 antibody (2G10, 1∶500), rabbit polyclonal GH antibody (1∶500, DAKO Cytomation A/S, Denmark), rabbit polyclonal ACTH antibody (1∶250, Abcam, UK), or rabbit prolactin antibody (1∶200, Abcam, UK). For PICK1 colocalization, studies with ICA69 mouse monoclonal PICK1 antibody (2G10, 1∶500) and rabbit polyclonal islet cell autoantigen (ICA-69) (1∶100, source, a kind gift from Massimo Pietropaolo, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Spitzenberger1">[22]</xref> were incubated at 4°C overnight.

<title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>For immunocytochemistry, cells were trypsinized and seeded on polyornithine-coated coverslips in six-well plates (150,000–300,000 cells/well depending on cell type). COS7 and Flp-In T-REx cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 16 h in Optimem (Invitrogen) using a total of 1 µg DNA/well. In general, we transfected ∼80% of the COS7 cells and ∼40% of the Flp-In T-REx cells.

<title>RNAi-Mediated Knockdown in GH1 and ATT20 Cells</title>
<p>For GH1 and ATT20 RNAi studies, cells were used the BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector Kit (Invitrogen, USA). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) with the pcDNA 6.2-GW vector, which has co-cistronic expression of miRNA with EmGFP (Emerald Green Fluorescent Protein), which permits visual selection of cells expressing the pre-miRNA. We used two pre-designed BLOCK-iT miR RNAi Select oligos against rat PICK1 and rat ICA69 (both PICK1 shRNAs but only one ICA69 shRNA worked in the mouse ATT20 cell line) as well as the negative control supplied.

<title>Confocal Microscopy and Image Analysis</title>
<p>Visualization of mouse pituitary sections and cell lines was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope using an oil immersion numerical aperture 1.4 63× objective (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The Alexa Fluor 488 dye, GFP, YFP, and EmGFP were excited with the 488 nm laser line from an argon–krypton laser, and the emitted light was detected using a 505–550 nm band pass filter. The Alexa Fluor 568 dye was excited at 543 nm with a helium–neon laser, and the emitted light was detected using a 560–615 nm band pass filter. For three color experiments, the Alexa Fluor 647 was excited at 633 nm with another helium-neon laser, and emitted light was detected using a 650 long pass filter. Channels were imaged separately. Resulting images were combined using IMAGEJ software (Rasband W. S., ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). <italic>Drosophila</italic> specimens were visualized using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope (20× and 63× water immersion objectives), a Zeiss 510 upright confocal microscope with a C-Apochromat 63×/1.2 W Corr water immersion objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001542-g007">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s003">Figure S3G</xref>), or a Zeiss 710 upright confocal microscope using a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.40 Oil DIC M27 oil immersion objective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001542.s003">Figure S3H</xref>). The Alexa Fluor 488 dye was excited with a 488 nm argon laser line, the Alexa Fluor 546 dye was excited with a 543 nm helium-neon laser, and the Alexa Fluor 647 dye was excited with a 633 nm helium-neon laser.</p>
<p>For quantification of PICK1, GH, and ICA69 immunoreactivity in GH1 and ATT20 cells, EmGFP expressing cells were outlined in the green channel, yielding separate regions of interest (ROIs), and the non-EmGFP expressing cells were grouped as a single ROI. Background levels were subsequently adjusted separately for each picture in the red and the blue channel before the total intensities of the ROIs were measured. Finally, the cumulated intensity of each EmGFP expressing ROI was compared to the average intensity of cells in the Non-EmGFP ROI within the same cell cluster. All image analysis was performed using IMAGEJ software (RasbandW. S., ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Finally, the data were transferred to GraphPad Prism Statistical Software Version 4.0 for presentation and statistical analysis. The data did not show normal distribution according to the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Hence, the Mann–Whitney Rank Sum Test was used for statistical analysis of data.</p>
<p>Quantification of co-localization was done using Van Steensel's cross-correlation function, which reports the Pearson cross-correlation as a function of the relative movement of the two channels with respect to each other. This was done using the JaCoP Plug-in for ImageJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Bolte1">[33]</xref> with the x-shift set to 20 pixels. Co-localization was quantified for 10–20 cells from three independent experiments. According to the cross-correlation function, completely co-localizing structures will show a cross-correlation function, peaking sharply at ΔX = 0 with a maximum value close to one, and mutually exclusive structures will tend to show no peak or even a dip at ΔX = 0. Partial co-localization will give rise to reduced maximum cross-correlation, as will noise. For adjacent and partially overlapping structures, the cross-correlation peak will become broader and/or shift away from a maximum at ΔX = 0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001542-Bolte1">[33]</xref>. Quantification of punctate to total CgA-GFP signal in COS7 cells was done in ImageJ by thresholding the images and making a ROI excluding the coherent cluster of CgA-GFP containing the rest of the cell. The cumulated intensity outside the cluster was divided by the cumulated intensity for the entire cell. Finally, the data were transferred to GraphPad Prism Statistical Software Version 4.0 for presentation and statistical analysis.</p>

Imaging was performed on the following day and was done at ∼35°C. Cerulean-GalT was exited with the 458 nm laser line and YFP with the 514 nm laser line from the argon laser and the emitted light directed through a 515 nm beam splitter and detected through 475–525 nm band pass and a 530 nm LP filter, respectively. We observed minimal cross-talk between the channels using these settings. We imaged an area of ∼24×24 µM (260×260 pixels) and switched between the two channels after every scanned line. Time lapses contained 100 frames with ∼3 s time resolution. Maximal intensity projections were carried out using ImageJ, and the presented images, time lapses, and supplemental movies were passed through the mean filter (radius 2 pixels) in ImageJ.</p>

Purity and integrity of the protein were inspected by SDS–PAGE, and labeling efficiency was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. Giant membrane vesicles were prepared from a lipid mixture containing 40% Phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 32% Phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), 10% Phosphatidylserine (DOPS), 10% Cholesterol, 5% Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), 0.5% DOPE-biotin, and 0.5% DOPE-Atto633 (Attotec). All lipids were from Avanti polar lipids. The lipids were mixed from chloroform stocks and a thin lipid film was formed in a teflon cup upon solvent evaporation. The giant vesicles were generated by standard rehydration in TBS buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 95 mM NaCl) overnight at 37°C.
