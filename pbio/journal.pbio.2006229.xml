<article-title>Cryptochrome: The magnetosensor with a sinister side?</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Exposure to man-made electromagnetic fields (EMFs), which increasingly pollute our environment, have consequences for human health about which there is continuing ignorance and debate. Whereas there is considerable ongoing concern about their harmful effects, magnetic fields are at the same time being applied as therapeutic tools in regenerative medicine, oncology, orthopedics, and neurology. This paradox cannot be resolved until the cellular mechanisms underlying such effects are identified. Here, we show by biochemical and imaging experiments that exposure of mammalian cells to weak pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) stimulates rapid accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a potentially toxic metabolite with multiple roles in stress response and cellular ageing. Following exposure to PEMF, cell growth is slowed, and ROS-responsive genes are induced. These effects require the presence of cryptochrome, a putative magnetosensor that synthesizes ROS. We conclude that modulation of intracellular ROS via cryptochromes represents a general response to weak EMFs, which can account for either therapeutic or pathological effects depending on exposure. Clinically, our findings provide a rationale to optimize low field magnetic stimulation for novel therapeutic applications while warning against the possibility of harmful synergistic effects with environmental agents that further increase intracellular ROS.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Repetitive low-intensity magnetic stimulation has been used in the treatment of disease for over 50 years. Associated benefits have included alleviation of depression, memory loss, and symptoms of Parkinson disease, as well as accelerated bone and wound healing and the treatment of certain cancers, independently of surgery or drugs. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that repetitive magnetic field exposure in human cells stimulates production of biological stress response chemicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). At moderate doses, we find that reactive oxygen actively stimulates cellular repair and stress response pathways, which might account for the observed therapeutic effects to repetitive magnetic stimulation. We further show that this response requires the function of a well-characterized, evolutionarily conserved flavoprotein receptor known as cryptochrome, which has been implicated in magnetic sensing in organisms ranging from plants to flies, including migratory birds. We conclude that exposure to weak magnetic fields induces the production of ROS in human cells and that this process requires the presence of the cryptochrome receptor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Weak electromagnetic radiation (μT-mT), which increasingly pollutes our environment, has been associated with dual and seemingly contradictory effects on human health. On the one hand, possibly deleterious public health consequences have elicited considerable debate on safety and exposure limits to electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref004">4</xref>]. On the other hand, weak magnetic fields have been applied as therapeutic tools, notably in the form of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs), which have shown benefits in a broad range of regenerative medicine therapeutics, as well as in the alleviation of depression, reducing symptoms of Parkinson disease, and reducing memory loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref010">10</xref>]. Such PEMFs also affect nonexcitable tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref009">9</xref>] and are below firing threshold for neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref012">12</xref>] consistent with magnetic field effects and thereby activation of a biological magnetoreceptor. The current challenge is therefore to identify these putative magnetosensor(s) and to propose a mechanism that may explain the seemingly disparate effects of EMFs in medicine and in public health.</p>
<p>A possible class of biological magnetoreceptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref013">13</xref>] are the cryptochromes, which are conserved flavoprotein receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref014">14</xref>] implicated in magnetosensing in organisms ranging from plants to migratory birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref016">16</xref>]. Cryptochrome receptors undergo redox reactions in the course of their activation that lead to the synthesis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref019">19</xref>]. ROS are global regulators that are implicated in numerous cellular signaling functions related to response to stress and ageing and are toxic at high concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref023">23</xref>]. In mammalian cells, cryptochromes are both cytosolic and nuclear proteins that have been characterized for a role as core components of the circadian clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref025">25</xref>] but that are not known to respond to external magnetic fields. However, recombinant mammalian cryptochromes expressed in a heterologous <italic>Drosophila</italic> system are reported to confer magnetic sensitivity in behavioral assays in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref016">16</xref>], and they were recently proposed to play a role as sensors of low EMFs in the onset of childhood leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref026">26</xref>]. This raises the question of whether cryptochromes could be implicated in magnetic sensitivity in humans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To explore this question, we chose to use PEMF exposure as a source of magnetic stimulation because it has demonstrated therapeutic effects on a wide variety of mammalian cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref010">10</xref>]. To determine whether cryptochromes are implicated in PEMF effects, we first established whether a known magnetosensitive cryptochrome can mediate a response to a PEMF signal in a well-established magnetically sensitive model system. We used the fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, which display a natural behavioral avoidance response to static magnetic fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref016">16</xref>]. Adult flies were placed on square petri plates to lay eggs for 24 hours and were subsequently removed. The ensuing hatched larva migrated freely over the plate for several days before choosing a location to attach to and form sessile pupa for metamorphosis. These pupae were located randomly around the perimeter of the plate, with preference for the corners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We tested magnetic sensitivity, with a coil generating continuous PEMF at 10 Hz, with peak amplitude of 1.8 mT at the level of the larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s002">S2</xref> Figs), placed underneath one of the 4 corners of the petri plate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and methods</xref>). Fly larvae grown under these conditions avoided the corner of the petri plate above the PEMF device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) compared to the other corners. Both Canton S (WTS) and Oregon (WTO) wild-type fly strains showed this avoidance response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) in blue light (which activates <italic>Drosophila</italic> cryptochrome; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) but not in red light (which does not activate <italic>Drosophila</italic> cryptochrome; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). As a control, a 1.0 mm mu-metal plate, which blocks static or low-frequency magnetic fields, was inserted between the magnetic coil and the petri plate containing the fly larvae. In these conditions, larvae did not show the avoidance response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). As a further control, we tested a coil in which the wire had been wound in an antiparallel fashion in order to cancel the magnetic field without altering the current in any way (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and methods</xref>); this was also ineffective in causing an avoidance response. We next observed that fly mutants deficient in cryptochrome (<italic>cry</italic><sup>b</sup> and <italic>cry</italic><sup>02</sup>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref027">27</xref>]) did not avoid the PEMF, confirming a role for cryptochrome in this response.

<p>A possible mechanistic basis for this fly avoidance response was suggested by recent observations that ROS are byproducts of cryptochrome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref028">28</xref>] linked to signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref030">30</xref>]. Furthermore, at high concentrations, ROS are toxic metabolites implicated in oxidative stress and ageing, which damage cell membranes, nucleic acids, and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref020">20</xref>], consistent with the behavioral avoidance response. In contrast, at physiological concentrations, ROS are reported to have beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref023">23</xref>], consistent with the observed therapeutic effects of PEMF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref010">10</xref>]. To determine whether the PEMF signal stimulates formation of ROS, <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (Sf21) insect cell cultures overexpressing DmCry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref028">28</xref>] were stimulated by PEMF in blue light for 15 minutes in the presence of the ROS label, {5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2’,7’-dichlorofluorecein diacetate} (DCFH-DA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref028">28</xref>]. Confocal image analysis revealed a marked increase in fluorescent signal in PEMF-treated cells compared to unstimulated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In contrast, no visible effect of PEMF stimulation was observed in Sf21 cells lacking DmCry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These data indicate that PEMF stimulation leads to intracellular accumulation of ROS and that this effect requires <italic>Drosophila</italic> cryptochrome.</p>
<p>Although flavin binding affinity is reportedly poor for vertebrate cryptochromes in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref031">31</xref>], they nevertheless confer light-sensitive phenotypes in expressing transgenic flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref027">27</xref>] and undergo light-sensitive conformational change in the avian retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref032">32</xref>], indicating that flavin is bound in vivo. Moreover, vertebrate-type cryptochromes are shown to undergo photoreduction and flavin radical formation in whole cell cultures, using an EPR spectroscopic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref033">33</xref>]. These properties are consistent with the capacity to undergo flavin redox state interconversion and to form ROS, as do other cryptochromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref034">34</xref>]. We therefore tested for ROS induction following PEMF stimulation of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, grown in darkness for 48 hours in the presence or absence of PEMF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g002">Fig 2</xref>). After incubation, the extracellular media were scored for secreted hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), a byproduct of ROS formation, using the Amplex Ultra Red fluorescence detection substrate as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref035">35</xref>]. The concentration of ROS was significantly elevated in media from PEMF-treated cell cultures compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g002">Fig 2</xref>). To evaluate toxicity of prolonged exposure to PEMF, we counted cells at the end of the exposure period (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and methods</xref>). A marked decrease in cellular growth was observed in PEMF-exposed HEK293 cultures compared to untreated controls, consistent with the toxicity of accumulated ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g002">Fig 2</xref>). To assess a possible effect of cryptochrome on this response, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lines with double HsCry1 and HsCry2 mRNA knockdown were constructed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) and similarly analyzed. These shRNA lines deficient in both HsCry1 and HsCry2 showed no significant effect of PEMF either on cell growth or on ROS secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>), in marked contrast to wild type. Therefore, these magnetic field effects appear to involve cryptochrome function and formation of ROS in human cells.</p>

<p>We further analyzed PEMF effects on mammalian cells using fluorescence imaging to detect multiple ROS forms. As observed for the Sf21 insect cell experiments above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), HEK293 cells were incubated in the presence of DCFH-DA at 37 °C for 15 minutes in the presence or absence of PEMF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Fluorescent ROS labeling increased significantly in PEMF-stimulated cells compared to unstimulated control cell cultures. ROS staining can be seen in both nuclear and cytosolic compartments, with areas of concentration in nuclear speckles (nucleoli) and vesicular structures (E.R and Golgi), consistent with subcellular localization of mammalian cryptochromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref036">36</xref>].</p>

<p>To further confirm the involvement of cryptochrome in this response, we examined cells from murine cryptochrome mCry1/mCry2 double knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref037">37</xref>]. Specifically, we analyzed immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell cultures from wild-type and mCry1/mCry2 double knockout lines, using the ROS fluorescence imaging techniques used for the HEK cell cultures. A marked induction of intracellular ROS after 15 minutes of PEMF stimulation was observed in wild-type MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g003">Fig 3</xref>, middle panels), equivalent to those observed for the HEK293 human cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g003">Fig 3</xref>, upper panels). However, mCry1/mCry2 null mutant cell cultures treated in an identical manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g003">Fig 3</xref>, lower panels) showed no visible increase in ROS labelling. Taken together, these data show that cryptochrome is necessary for PEMF-induced ROS formation in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>To further define the effects of PEMFs and relate them to therapeutic consequences observed in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref010">10</xref>], we performed microarray analysis of gene expression in HEK293 cells cultured with or without 3 hours of PEMF stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s010">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s011">S2</xref> Tables). Several hundred genes were up-regulated or down-regulated by PEMF stimulation. Of these transcripts, a significant proportion encoded proteins localized to nuclear, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s014">S5 Table</xref>). Significantly, bioinformatic gene ontology (GO) analysis of biochemical function showed enrichment in oxidoreductase function consistent with increased production of ROS (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s015">S6 Table</xref>). Furthermore, promoter analysis of PEMF-induced genes indicated that a majority (75%) contained promoter elements known to interact with ROS-responsive transcription factors. These data are consistent with stimulation of ROS-responsive genes following PEMF exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s016">S7 Table</xref>). Furthermore, they parallel the imaging data of these HEK293 cells, which showed enhanced localization of ROS to the nuclear, Golgi, and ER compartments, whereas transcription of proteins localized to these compartments are particularly enriched among PEMF-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s014">S5 Table</xref>). Thus, the induction of ROS by PEMF is indicated by two entirely independent and complementary approaches: imaging and transcriptome analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A widely held paradigm for cryptochrome magnetosensing involves a radical pair-based mechanism, whereby the singlet/triple interconversion rates of unpaired radicals formed in the course of cryptochrome redox chemistry can be altered by static magnetic fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref013">13</xref>]. This provides a mechanism whereby cryptochrome reaction rates and product yields, including of H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub> and other ROS formed during the cryptochrome redox cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref028">28</xref>], can be altered by magnetic fields. Recent experiments probing the light dependence of magnetic orientation in birds have pinpointed cryptochrome flavin reoxidation as the likely step for radical pair formation leading to magnetic sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref038">38</xref>]. Such flavin reoxidation, which occurs independently of light, involves reaction of cryptochrome-bound reduced flavin with molecular oxygen and fulfills the criteria of radical pair formation during magnetoreception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref039">39</xref>]. Nonetheless, in the case of both avian and drosophila cryptochromes, the initial formation of reduced flavin requires light (by the process of flavin photoreduction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref038">38</xref>]. This explains the requirement for light in establishing magnetic sensitivity in flies and birds because reduced flavin is required for the magnetically sensitive redox reaction (reoxidation) to ensue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>By contrast, mammalian-type cryptochromes appear to function independently of light in their role in the circadian clock and as negative regulators of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref025">25</xref>]. However, mammalian-type cryptochromes reportedly occur in a partially reduced redox state in vivo even in dark-adapted cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref040">40</xref>]. As a consequence, they would retain the characteristics to respond to magnetic fields by a mechanism whereby flavin reoxidation is stimulated, with an ensuing burst of ROS synthesis consistent with our observations. We also note that, although there has been overwhelming evidence for a radical pair-based magnetic sensing mechanism involving vertebrate cryptochromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref013">13</xref>], the possibility of unrelated cry-dependent magnetosensing mechanisms cannot be excluded. For example, a recently suggested interaction of cryptochrome with the putatively magnetosensitive MagR protein could also be consistent with our data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref041">41</xref>], whereas reported magnetic sensitivity mediated through a C-terminal overexpression construct of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cryptochrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref042">42</xref>] also suggests alternative magnetosensors impacting on a cry-based magnetosensing mechanism.</p>
<p>A mechanism based on regulation of ROS can explain both the beneficial and deleterious effects of magnetic stimulation that have so long puzzled the field. For example, proposed deleterious effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref026">26</xref>] of low-frequency EMFs could result from elevated ROS, which inform about exposure to magnetic fields either in human treatment or in public health. This result is furthermore consistent with past suggestions that the lifetimes and reactivity of 0<sub>2</sub> and ROS (both paramagnetic species) may be affected by magnetic fields in living systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref005">5</xref>]. However, prior speculation has focused exclusively on ROS generated via metabolic pathways of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain or via cell membrane–associated NADPH oxidases. Here, we implicate a flavoprotein receptor and signaling molecule, which is suitably positioned within the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref036">36</xref>], to induce localized changes in ROS concentration and/or reactivity in close proximity to redox-sensitive and/or ROS-regulated nuclear signaling molecules. We note that the prolonged PEMF signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s002">S2</xref> Figs) used in the current study has no therapeutic application and is apparently harmful to cell cultures over long periods. However, a range of alternate frequencies and amplitudes of PEMF signal have been empirically derived that provide proven physiological benefits involving cellular repair and healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref012">12</xref>]. These beneficial PEMF effects are compatible with modulation of intracellular ROS within a therapeutic range resulting in stimulation of ROS responsive cellular defense and repair mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, from a public health perspective, our work shows that exposure to even such low levels of magnetic fields as those generated by PEMF devices have definite physiological consequences. It should be noted that peak output at less than 1.8 mT is within an order of magnitude of emissions by household electronic devices and of current safety guidelines for exposure to EMF in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref004">4</xref>]. In keeping with our results, it has also been shown that the low-level man-made EMFs emitted from electrical equipment in public buildings can disrupt orientation in birds, a process that has also been linked to both cryptochromes and magnetoreception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref043">43</xref>]. Although current epidemiological studies have not provided conclusive evidence of EMF-induced pathology in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref004">4</xref>], our results raise the possibility of synergistic harmful effects with other environmental or cellular factors that stimulate intracellular ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref020">20</xref>]. More refined epidemiological studies taking these factors into consideration are therefore essential for a true assessment of long-term impact of EMFs on public health.</p>

Light sources and growth conditions on complete media were as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006229.ref027">27</xref>]. For the larvae migration studies (pupal distribution), adult drosophila were transferred to a square plate (12.5 cm × 12.5 cm) containing complete rich medium and were allowed to lay eggs. After a period of 24 hours, the adults were discarded and the plates placed under the indicated light conditions (blue or red light) for 3 days at 23 °C. Subsequently, a single corner of each plate was exposed to PEMF from underneath for an additional 5 days. Temperature differential between corners was less than 0.5 °C. The control condition was established by shielding the plate from the PEMF device with 1.0 mm mu-metal sheeting, which was measured to reduce magnetic field signal by 85%. Once pupal development was complete, the distribution of the now nonmotile pupae could be readily scored by counting the number of pupae in a defined area of the plate. As the pupae showed a preference for the corners of the plates, we evaluated 3.12 × 3.12 cm<sup>2</sup> areas over each of the 4 (PEMF treated versus untreated) corners and compared the corners that had received no PEMF treatment with those exposed to PEMF. Statistical methods were as follows: for each experimental condition, a total of between 8 and 10 plates were analyzed (<italic>n</italic> = 8–10). The number of drosophila counted in each corner was expressed as the percentage of the total number of pupae ± SEM per plate. All statistical tests were carried out using SPSS (version 20, IBM Corporation, NY). Data were analyzed for normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), so the differences between the PEMF and mean of the 3 non-PEMF corners per plate were compared using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney-U post hoc where appropriate.

<p>Further details of the behavioral experimental setup are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s003">S3 Fig</xref> as follows: the position of the plate containing drosophila growth media and growing larva under which the PEMF coil was placed (upper left) is designated as the position “1,” the “test” corner. The PEMF coil was at a distance of 1 cm from the bottom of the test plate containing the drosophila larvae. The temperature at all 4 corners was measured, and the PEMF device did not cause any change in temperature from the other corner positions of the plate.

<p>HEK293 cells were grown and maintained in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM), supplemented by 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were cultured in 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks to expand cell number. After reaching confluence, the cells were seeded in 12-well plates. The volume of medium totaled 1 mL. Medium was then changed every 2 days. The cultures were incubated in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37 °C in the same incubator (Fisher Scientific; Model 5). The temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> levels were monitored daily and were maintained at 37 °C and 5%, respectively. All experiments were conducted in the same incubator. To control for location in the incubator and any associated electromagnetic noise or other spatial variation, the orientation of experimental and control cultures were periodically reversed, and 0.3 mm mu-Metal shielding was applied between PEMF-treated and control cell culture dishes within the incubator. Cells were seeded and allowed to rest for 4 hours under the same background conditions, at which time the magnetic exposures began. This time is denoted as t<sub>0</sub>. Fluorometric detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was performed using the horseradish peroxidase-linked Amplex Ultra Red (Invitrogen) fluorometric assay. HEK cells were seeded at a concentration of 25.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in a 12-well plate and were exposed to PEMFs for the duration of the experiment. Medium was aspirated off, and cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 2 hours with DMEM containing 2% FBS, 0.2 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 10 μM Amplex UltraRed (AUR). Resorufin fluorescence was measured by a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter. Cellular number and resorufin fluorescence were measured at the same termination points. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was normalized to cell count. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> calibration curves with HRP-AUR in PEMFs did not show any difference compared to control, thus demonstrating that PEMFs do not interact with the detection system.</p>

<title>8. Cancelled magnetic field coil control experiments</title>
<p>As a control to eliminate the possibility of artifact due to temperature and/or vibrational factors generated by the pulsed field device, we designed and built a modified PEMF coil in which the wire was folded in half before precision winding to achieve an antiparallel current travelling in opposite directions within the same coil during activation. This antiparallel coil had the same wire length and dimensions as the test coil used in our experiments, and it was driven by the same pulsed field generator device and with the identical current—which, because of the antiparallel winding of the coil, ran simultaneously in opposing directions within the coil. The signal measured in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s007">S7 Fig</xref> shows that, whereas there are residual spikes in the antiparallel field coil (panel B) that could not be cancelled, these spikes are less than 0.01 seconds in duration in comparison to the magnetic signal in the original PEMF coil, which lasts for 0.5 seconds (panel A). The residual spikes are not visible on panel D because they are too short lived for the detection limit for the instrument at this time scale. We conclude that these residual spikes are of negligible duration compared to the signal given out by the intact coil and are demonstrably too brief to trigger a biological response. As a result, we achieved a significant reduction (cancelling) of the pulsed magnetic field (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) while keeping all other parameters (electric current driven by the pulsed field device) the same.</p>
<p>We tested the effect of the cancelled PEMF field on the behavioral avoidance response of wild type (Canton S) fly pupa according to the methods used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006229.g001">Fig 1</xref>. We measured the number of pupa in the corner of square petri plates exposed to the antiparallel (cancelled PEMF field) coil compared to the test coil (generating the PEMF signal) placed beneath the plate corner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). The flies did not show an avoidance response to the cancelled field (antiparallel coil), indicating that the magnetic field of the PEMF was indeed triggering the response.</p>
<p>We next evaluated the effect of the cancelled magnetic field coil on the stimulation of ROS in mammalian cell culture experiments. Using both HEK and MEF cell cultures, we observed that significant stimulation of ROS formation occurred only in response to PEMF but not to the antiparallel, PEMF-cancelled magnetic field (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006229.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, these data indicate that there was no discernable artifact introduced into our experiments through the operation of the pulsed field device and that positive results required the presence of the magnetic field.</p>
