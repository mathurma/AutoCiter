        <p>Analysis of <italic>Sox</italic>17 mutant mice reveals that gap junction coupling across the gut endoderm of the embryo transmits the left-right asymmetric signal from the node to the site of asymmetric organogenesis in mice.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Establishment of left-right (LR) asymmetry occurs after gastrulation commences and utilizes a conserved cascade of events. In the mouse, LR symmetry is broken at a midline structure, the node, and involves signal relay to the lateral plate, where it results in asymmetric organ morphogenesis. How information transmits from the node to the distantly situated lateral plate remains unclear. Noting that embryos lacking <italic>Sox17</italic> exhibit defects in both gut endoderm formation and LR patterning, we investigated a potential connection between these two processes. We observed an endoderm-specific absence of the critical gap junction component, Connexin43 (Cx43), in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants. Iontophoretic dye injection experiments revealed planar gap junction coupling across the gut endoderm in wild-type but not <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant embryos. They also revealed uncoupling of left and right sides of the gut endoderm in an isolated domain of gap junction intercellular communication at the midline, which in principle could function as a barrier to communication between the left and right sides of the embryo. The role for gap junction communication in LR patterning was confirmed by pharmacological inhibition, which molecularly recapitulated the mutant phenotype. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Cx43-mediated communication across gap junctions within the gut endoderm serves as a mechanism for information relay between node and lateral plate in a process that is critical for the establishment of LR asymmetry in mice.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Superficially, humans, like other vertebrates, are bilaterally symmetrical. Nonetheless, the internal configuration of visceral organs reveals a stereotypical asymmetry. For example, human hearts are generally located on the left and the liver on the right side within the body cavity. How this left-right asymmetry is established is an area of interest, for both intrinsic biological significance and its medical application. In the mouse, the initial event that breaks left-right symmetry occurs at the node, a specialized organ located in the midline of the developing embryo. Somehow this initial asymmetry leads to a cascade of events that results in the activation of a genetic circuit on the left side of the embryo, which then leads to asymmetric organ formation. Here we show that the laterality information that is generated at the node is transferred to the lateral extremity of the embryo across the gut endoderm, which is the precursor tissue of the respiratory and digestive tracts and associated organs such as lungs, liver, and pancreas. <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant mouse embryos exhibit defects in gut endoderm formation and fail to establish left-right asymmetry. Analysis of the mutants reveals that gap junction coupling across the gut endoderm is the mechanism of left-right information relay from the midline site of symmetry breaking to the site of asymmetric organogenesis in mice.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The elaboration of the major axes of the embryo (anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral, and left-right) occurs at the time of gastrulation, the morphogenetic process that forms the primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and definitive endoderm). The molecular definition of a left-right (LR) axis precedes the establishment of an overt asymmetry in that dimension, a common feature across bilateral animals. Despite some species-specific differences, the sequence of key events and core components involved in the establishment of LR asymmetry appears conserved across vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Burdine1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Lee1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>An initial LR symmetry-breaking event occurs in a specialized organ located at the embryonic midline, this being the node in the mouse. Around embryonic day (E) 7.75, equivalent to the early head-fold (EHF) stage, cilia protruding from the posterior-apical surface of node cells begin rotating, thereby generating directional fluid flow within the node microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Nonaka1">[3]</xref>. Whether through interpretation of mechanical flow forces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-McGrath1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Tabin1">[5]</xref> or asymmetric distribution of signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Nonaka1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Tanaka1">[6]</xref>, nodal flow is believed to trigger a wave of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the left side of the node <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-McGrath1">[4]</xref>, as well as left-biased asymmetric perinodal expression of <italic>Nodal</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Shiratori1">[7]</xref>. By E8.5, equivalent to the ∼4 somite stage, an asymmetric readout of this symmetry-breaking event is the activation of the <italic>Nodal/Lefty2/Pitx2</italic> genetic cascade within the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Hamada1">[8]</xref>. Activation of these factors is required for asymmetric organogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Hamada1">[8]</xref>. The embryonic midline is thought to act as a “midline barrier” in keeping signals confined to their respective sides, both by virtue of its morphological structure and by expressing specific factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Lee1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>An unresolved question in the establishment of LR asymmetry in the mouse embryo is the mechanism of communication between the midline site of symmetry-breaking and the lateral plate tissues initiating asymmetric morphogenesis. By virtue of their location, cells that lie between the node and lateral plate are likely to provide the medium for signal relay. The gut endoderm and paraxial mesoderm are attractive candidate tissues for mediating signal transmission since they lie adjacent to both the node and lateral plate mesoderm. Moreover, perinodal asymmetric events, including calcium release and <italic>Nodal</italic> expression, occur in endodermal cells lining the node <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-McGrath1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Shiratori1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Zhou1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Using live imaging and genetic labeling, we previously noted that the gut endoderm of the mouse embryo forms by widespread intercalation of epiblast-derived definitive endoderm (DE) cells into the overlying visceral endoderm (VE) epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon1">[10]</xref>. At gastrulation, DE progenitors intercalate into the distally positioned embryonic VE epithelium, also referred to as the emVE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Mesnard1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Nowotschin1">[12]</xref>, which constitutes the surface cell layer of the embryo. This multifocal intercalation of DE cells leads to the widespread dispersal and dilution of emVE cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-FerrerVaquer1">[13]</xref>. As a result, the emergent gut endoderm tissue is comprised of cells of two distinct origins: DE and emVE. Furthermore, we noted that in addition to their scattered distribution within the gut endoderm, residual emVE cells exhibited a second stereotypic distribution in that they were absent from, but congregate around, the node and midline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Viotti1">[15]</xref>. Even though the precise cellular dynamics orchestrating emVE displacement at the node and midline remain unknown, these data suggest that lateral dispersal in the future gut endoderm and midline displacement in the future notochord may be regulated independently.</p>
      <p>The <italic>Sry</italic>-related HMG box transcription factor Sox17 is a key conserved factor involved in endoderm formation in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Stainier1">[16]</xref>. Mice lacking <italic>Sox17</italic> have a depletion of DE cells, possess an abnormal gut tube, and die around E10.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-KanaiAzuma1">[17]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant mouse embryos also display gross morphological features commonly observed in mutants of LR asymmetry establishment, including a failure to turn from a lordotic to a fetal position, an open body wall, and cardiac defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-KanaiAzuma1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Sakamoto1">[19]</xref>. We therefore reasoned that a detailed analysis of the <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant might provide further insight into the gut endoderm defects and whether gut endoderm morphogenesis and LR patterning are coupled.</p>
      <p>Here we report that <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant embryos exhibit a failure in emVE dispersal as well as defects in LR patterning. We noted that widespread emVE and DE cell intercalation in the prospective gut endoderm was severely affected in mutants. By contrast, emVE displacement at the midline was not. This suggested that lateral dispersal in the future gut endoderm and midline displacement in the future notochord are likely to be distinct morphogenetic processes, the former of which requires Sox17.</p>
      <p>One mode of communication across epithelia is through gap junctions. We identified Connexin43 (Cx43) as the predominant gap junctional constituent expressed in the endoderm at a time soon after widespread emVE and DE cell intercalation is complete, when node to LPM signal relay likely occurs. In <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, we noted that Cx43 is absent in the gut endoderm. We demonstrated gap junctional coupling on both the left and right sides of the gut endoderm of wild-type embryos, but not in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants. We also observed that gap junction coupling in the mesoderm was isolated from the endoderm. Since Cx43 localization within the mesoderm was comparable in wild-type and mutant embryos, we concluded that LR signals must be propagated across the endoderm epithelium. Our studies also revealed an absence of gap junctional coupling across cells at the midline in wild-type embryos, thereby providing the first functional visualization of a midline barrier in the mouse.</p>
      <p>Collectively our observations identify the gut endoderm as a key tissue of communication between node and LPM during the establishment of LR asymmetry in the mouse. We demonstrate that Cx43-mediated gap junction coupling across the endoderm is necessary for the correct temporal and spatial propagation of asymmetric signal(s) from the node to the LPM.</p>

        <title><italic>Sox17</italic> Mutants Fail to Establish LR Asymmetry</title>
        <p><italic>Sox17</italic> mutant embryos exhibit a dysmorphic heart, have an open ventral body wall, and fail to turn (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s001">S1D</xref>′) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-KanaiAzuma1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Sakamoto1">[19]</xref>. Since these features are characteristic of mutants with defects in LR patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Hamada1">[8]</xref>, they prompted us to determine whether LR asymmetry is established in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants. To do so, we analyzed the expression of components of the core circuitry controlling the establishment of LR asymmetry in mice: genes encoding the TGFβ family proteins Nodal and Lefty2, and the homeodomain protein Pitx2. In E8.5 wild-type embryos, <italic>Nodal</italic> was expressed around the node and along the left LPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). In stage-matched <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, <italic>Nodal</italic> was present around the node, but absent (three out of eight embryos analyzed) or reduced and restricted posteriorly (five out of eight embryos analyzed) in the left LPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g001">Figure 1A′–1B″</xref>). <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants also exhibited ectopic patchy domains of <italic>Nodal</italic> expression on both the left and right sides. Notably, these ectopic patches of gene expression were not in cells of the mesoderm layer; instead, they were located superficially and were confined to the endoderm layer of the embryo, as analyzed below.</p>

        <p>Sections through mutant embryos revealed that the ectopic patches of gene expression comprised cells that were located on the embryo's surface, while in wild-type embryos gene expression was only detected in cells residing in a deeper location within the embryo, within the mesoderm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s001">Figure S1F</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s001">S1H</xref>′). <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant embryos at the early somite (ESom) stage (E8.25), prior to the onset of LPM expression, already exhibited ectopic expression of <italic>Nodal, Lefty1/2</italic>, and <italic>Pitx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s001">Figure S1I</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s001">S1N</xref>′). Thus ectopic gene expression preceded LPM gene expression, and so could be due to a failure in the downregulation of an earlier domain of expression. Analysis of <italic>Nodal</italic> in early head-fold (EHF) stage (E7.75) <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants revealed widespread ectopic patchy expression in the gut endoderm epithelium on the surface of the embryo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s001">Figure S1O</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s001">S1Q</xref>′). These data demonstrate that Sox17 is required for left LPM expression of the <italic>Nodal/Lefty/Pitx2</italic> genetic cascade operating in the establishment of LR patterning in mice, and that absence of Sox17 results in patchy ectopic expression of these genes within the gut endoderm (see summarizing cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g001">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s012">Table S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Aberrant Gut Endoderm Morphogenesis in <italic>Sox17</italic> Mutants</title>
        <p>Having confirmed that <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants failed to establish LR asymmetry, we investigated whether this phenotype was linked to the endoderm defects that were previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-KanaiAzuma1">[17]</xref>. To better understand the progression of gut endoderm morphogenesis in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, we used the <italic>Afp::GFP</italic> reporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon3">[21]</xref>. The <italic>Afp::GFP</italic> transgene permits visualization of VE cells (GFP-positive), which can be discriminated from DE cells (GFP-negative) within the gut endoderm on the embryo's surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon1">[10]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Since the VE encapsulates the epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm prior to gastrulation, <italic>Afp::GFP</italic> embryos exhibit homogenous widespread GFP fluorescence across the entire surface of the conceptus. By the EHF stage, the cellular movements driving gut endoderm morphogenesis during gastrulation are near complete. Extraembryonic VE (exVE) GFP-positive cells positioned proximally overlying the extraembryonic ectoderm remain homogenous in the region that will form the visceral yolk sac. By contrast, GFP-positive emVE descendents located distally overlying the epiblast become dispersed and are scattered between DE cells on the embryo's surface. We analyzed EHF stage wild-type and <italic>Sox17</italic> heterozygous embryos that were also hemizygous for the <italic>Afp::GFP</italic> reporter and confirmed that the emVE had fully dispersed, as evident by a distally positioned scattered GFP-positive population of cells in the gut endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g002">Figure 2A–2D</xref> and unpublished data). By contrast in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant embryos, the distally positioned emVE appeared as a uniform GFP-positive sheet on the ventral surface of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g002">Figure 2A′–2D′</xref>). The only regions in which GFP-negative cells could be identified were around the anterior intestinal portal, the site of foregut invagination, and around the node and midline. Overall, these observations suggested that in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants there was a failure to disperse the emVE within the future mid- and hindgut and that the displacement of emVE at the midline was generally unaffected.</p>

        <p>To confirm that the <italic>Afp::GFP</italic> reporter was functioning as a short-term cell lineage label due to perdurance of GFP (as we noted previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Viotti1">[15]</xref>) and exclude the possibility that GFP was being ectopically expressed by DE cells within the gut endoderm of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, we determined the localization <italic>GFP</italic> transcripts in <italic>Sox17<sup>+/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Afp::GFP<sup>Tg/+</sup>,</italic> as well as <italic>Sox17</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup>;<italic>Afp::GFP<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> embryos. In head-fold (HF) stage (E7.75–8.0) wild-type <italic>Afp::GFP</italic> embryos, <italic>GFP</italic> was transcribed only in the exVE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s002">Figure S2A</xref>).

Additionally, the pan-VE marker <italic>Apoc2</italic> was undetectable in the gut endoderm of both wild-type and <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s002">Figure S2B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s002">S2D</xref>′). These data suggest that in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, as in wild-type embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon1">[10]</xref>, emVE cells change their state and downregulate expression of VE markers coincident with the intercalation of epiblast-derived DE. The GFP-positive cells that colonized the gut endoderm area of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants were therefore emVE-derived. These cells had undergone an initial step in endoderm morphogenesis, namely cell identity reprogramming, by downregulating emVE markers, and had become poised for integration into the gut tube.</p>
        <p>To determine if the failure to disperse the emVE persisted, we analyzed <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants at later embryonic stages. At the ∼4 somite stage (E8.5), wild-type embryos and <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants were indistinguishable by gross morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g002">Figure 2E and 2E′</xref>). However, high-resolution examination of the localization of GFP-positive cells in embryos hemizygous for the <italic>Afp::GFP</italic> transgene revealed an aberrant distribution suggesting severe gut endoderm defects in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g002">Figure 2F–2L′</xref>). We simultaneously analyzed the distribution of FoxA2, a marker of gut endoderm as well as node and midline cells. Anteriorly, in wild-type embryos the region in the vicinity of the anterior intestinal portal contained sparsely scattered emVE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g002">Figure 2F–2H</xref>). By contrast in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, a greater density of emVE cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g002">Figure 2F′–2H′</xref>). Posteriorly, in the prospective hindgut region of wild-type embryos, emVE cells were dispersed, while in the midline emVE cells were displaced and congregated around the node and midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g002">Figure 2I–2K</xref>). By contrast, in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants the epithelium on the ventral surface of the embryo was homogenously GFP-positive and so almost entirely emVE-derived. This suggested a failure in emVE cell dispersal and DE intercalation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g002">Figure 2I′–2K′</xref>). However, the node and midline regions appeared as largely GFP-negative areas. This suggested that the morphogenetic movements of gut endoderm morphogenesis (involving emVE dispersal), and midline formation (which we propose involves emVE displacement), can be genetically uncoupled and are likely to be distinct.</p>
        <p>Notably, closer scrutiny of the midline structures indicated that in a subset of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant embryos, emergent node areas did contain some emVE-derived cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g002">Figure 2L–2L′</xref>). This indicates that even though gut endoderm morphogenesis and midline formation are likely to be regulated by different mechanisms, the two processes are dependent on each other for correct execution. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that defective gut endoderm morphogenesis in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants occurs due to a failure to disperse the emVE. Moreover, our results reveal that the morphogenetic events that drive gut endoderm and midline morphogenesis are distinct.</p>

        <p>To better understand the role of Sox17 during gut endoderm and midline morphogenesis, we determined the localization of Sox17 at the time when these tissues form. Maximum intensity projections of confocal <italic>z</italic>-stacks of Sox17 immunofluorescence on wild-type embryos revealed that Sox17 protein was always nuclear-localized with a high signal-to-noise ratio. At the late bud (LB) stage (E7.5), when emVE cells were dispersed within the gut endoderm of wild-type embryos, and node and midline structures were emerging and displacing emVE cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Lee1">[2]</xref>, Sox17 was detected in both emVE and DE cells within the gut endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g003">Figure 3A–3E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s005">Movie S1</xref>).

Some GFP-negative patches were present, likely corresponding to first cohorts of anterior primitive streak (APS)-derived node and midline cells having reached the embryo's surface. These cell cohorts were devoid of Sox17. Posterior views of LB stage embryos revealed uniform levels of Sox17 in all gut endoderm cells, including cells overlying the primitive streak (PS) representing the posterior visceral endoderm (PVE) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g003">Figure 3H and 3I</xref>).</p>

        <p>By the EHF stage when the node and midline had emerged (E7.75), Sox17 was present in cells of the gut endoderm, but absent from cells of both the node and the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g003">Figure 3J–3M</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s006">Movie S2</xref>). At the late head-fold (LHF) stage (E8.0), when the anterior intestinal portal begins its invagination, Sox17 was present throughout the gut endoderm except in regions of the foregut where it had become downregulated, while continuing to be undetectable in cells of the node and midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g003">Figure 3N–3Q</xref>). These data indicate that Sox17 localized to cells of the gut endoderm irrespective of their origin and that it was absent from cells of the node and midline. This suggested that the primary site of action of Sox17 was within the gut endoderm. The observation that Sox17 was absent from node and midline in wild-type embryos suggested that Sox17 is not involved in node morphogenesis per se. Thus, the inability of emVE cells to completely clear the node area in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants was likely a secondary effect resulting from the failure of the emVE to disperse.</p>

Defects within the gut endoderm might result in perturbed communication across the epithelium lying between node and lateral plate, and consequently result in a failure in the establishment of LR asymmetry.</p>
        <p>Gap junction communication has been implicated in signal relay between the site of symmetry-breaking and tissues of asymmetric morphogenesis in several organisms, including frog, chick, and rabbit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Vandenberg1">[26]</xref>. Our previous studies in the mouse demonstrated that cell-cell junctions dynamically disassemble and reassemble during emVE dispersal and concomitant DE cell intercalation takes place during gut endoderm morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon1">[10]</xref>. We therefore investigated the presence and distribution of gap junctions within the gut endoderm of wild-type embryos and <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>Since connexins are core gap junction components, we determined which connexins were expressed in the mouse embryo around the time of LR asymmetry establishment. Expression profiling of embryonic regions of EHF stage (E7.75) wild-type embryos revealed that of the 19 characterized connexin genes, all of which were present on the array, only two were expressed above background levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s003">S3C</xref>). The most abundant was <italic>Gja1</italic>, the gene encoding Connexin43 (Cx43).</p>
        <p>We investigated the localization of Cx43 in wild-type embryos and <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants carrying the <italic>Afp::GFP</italic> VE-reporter transgene. Cx43 immunofluorescent localization was generally observed as puncta located at cell-cell interfaces. We interpret these puncta as representing gap junction complexes. Up until the onset of emVE dispersal, the distribution of Cx43 was comparable in wild-type and <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant embryos. Notably, Cx43 puncta were observed in all tissue layers: throughout the visceral endoderm, in the extraembryonic ectoderm, as well as within the epiblast and mesoderm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s004">Figure S4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s004">S4L</xref>′ and unpublished data). By the EHF stage (E7.75), when the emVE had dispersed, Cx43 puncta were detected within exVE and gut endoderm of wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g005">Figure 5A–5H</xref>). However, in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, while Cx43 puncta were detected in exVE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g005">Figure 5A′–5D′</xref>), they were absent in the undispersed emVE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g005">Figure 5E′–5H′</xref>). To determine if this absence of Cx43 localization persisted, we analyzed embryos at later embryonic stages. At the ESom stage (E8.25), posterior views of wild-type embryos showed Cx43 puncta in the node, midline, mesoderm, yolk sac, and all gut endoderm cells, regardless of their origin (emVE or DE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g005">Figure 5I–5P</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s009">Movie S5</xref>). In <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, Cx43 puncta were present in the node, midline, and yolk sac, but notably were absent from the gut endoderm epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g005">Figure 5I′–5P′</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s009">Movie S5</xref>). Collectively, these observations reveal that puncta comprising Cx43, the major gap junction component expressed in embryos of these stages, were not present amongst cells of the gut endoderm in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, suggesting a specific absence of gap junctions in this tissue.</p>

        <p>Injections into gut endoderm cells of wild-type <italic>Afp::GFP</italic> VE-reporter expressing embryos resulted in Neurobiotin dye propagation across several cell diameters within the gut endoderm epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g006">Figure 6C–6I</xref>). Neurobiotin propagation occurred regardless of whether an emVE or DE cell was injected. Moreover, the propagation of Neurobiotin occurred irrespective of whether cells situated on the right or left side of the embryo were injected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g006">Figure 6J–6L</xref>). Interestingly, even though we observed Cx43 puncta in the node and midline of wild-type embryos, Neurobiotin never propagated from the gut endoderm to cells of the node and midline, and so never crossed the midline between the left to the right side of gut endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g006">Figure 6J–6L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s010">Movie S6</xref>).

Thus, gap junction communication within the gut endoderm was uncoupled from other germ layers and was isolated between left and right sides of the gut endoderm by a midline barrier in wild-type embryos.</p>
        <p>We then performed dye tracer experiments on <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants.

        <title>Pharmacological Perturbation of Gap Junction Function <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> in Failure to Establish LR Asymmetry</title>
        <p>As an independent test of whether gap junction communication was required for the establishment of LR patterning in mice, we investigated whether its pharmacological inhibition might repress signal transfer from the embryonic midline (the node) where symmetry is broken, to the lateral plate, where it is affected, and in doing so affect expression of LR asymmetry markers in the LPM. Embryos from the EHF-LHF stage (E7.75–E8.0) were cultured until the ∼4 somite stage in the presence of gap junction inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). To ensure that inhibitors did not interfere with node morphogenesis, we selected only embryos in which the node had emerged to the surface of the embryo. To ensure that inhibitors were acting in the temporal window during which node to lateral plate signal relay must occur and were effective before LPM gene activation, we selected only embryos in which somites had not yet formed. Two inhibitors were used: Mefloquine hydrochloride, which selectively blocks Cx36 and Cx50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Cruikshank1">[29]</xref>, and 18 alpha-Glycyrrhetinic acid, a general gap junction blocker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Davidson1">[30]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A cascade of events establishes LR asymmetry in mice. A central unresolved question in this process is the nature of the step between symmetry-breaking at the midline and the tissues executing asymmetric morphogenesis at the lateral plate. To date, mouse mutants exhibiting LR patterning defects fall into three categories based on their expected site of gene function: the node, the LPM, and the midline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Hamada1">[8]</xref>. No mutant affecting LR asymmetry has been reported to act within the gut endoderm, a tissue situated between the site of symmetry-breaking (the node) and the effector tissue of asymmetric morphogenesis (the lateral plate). Our studies reveal Cx43-mediated communication through gap junctions across the gut endoderm epithelium as a mechanism for information relay between node and LPM in the establishment of LR asymmetry in mice (for model, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001276-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

        <title>The LR Asymmetry Phenotype of <italic>Sox17</italic> Mutants</title>
        <p>Analysis of the <italic>Nodal/Lefty/Pitx2</italic> cascade of asymmetrically expressed genes indicated that LR asymmetry was not correctly established in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants. <italic>Pitx2</italic>, the gene downstream in the pathway, was never detected in the left LPM of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants. Interestingly, our data revealed some variability in the expression of asymmetry genes higher up in the cascade in embryos lacking Sox17. While many <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants exhibited no expression of <italic>Nodal</italic> and <italic>Lefty1/2</italic> in the LPM, others exhibited reduced and regionally restricted expression of these genes within the left LPM. In wild-type embryos, expression of <italic>Nodal</italic> in the LPM starts in a small region at the level of the node and subsequently expands anteriorly and posteriorly within the LPM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Shiratori1">[7]</xref>. The observation of reduced <italic>Nodal</italic> and <italic>Lefty1/2</italic> expression in the LPM of some <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant embryos revealed that the pathway had been activated, suggesting some signal was being relayed from the node to the LPM.</p>
        <p>This raised the possibility that minimal emVE cell dispersal, observed in some mutants, may have been sufficient for gap junction communication. Dye coupling tracer experiments argued against the possibility of gap junction coupling in the <italic>Sox17</italic> mutant, because Neurobiotin was never observed to propagate between cells within the gut endoderm of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants. Nonetheless, since it was not technically feasible to inject every cell within the gut endoderm epithelium of a single embryo, we cannot rule out the possibility that occasional gap junctional coupling may have occurred in a minor population of endoderm cells in some <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants. Alternatively, another connexin may partially compensate for the absence of Cx43 in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants. Our expression profiling did identify <italic>Cx31</italic>, another connexin gene expressed at EHF stages, albeit at low levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001276.s003">Figure S3</xref>). An upregulation of compensatory connexin(s) within the gut endoderm of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants might permit some communication between node and LPM, allowing sufficient signal transmission to occur for minimal activation of the pathway in the left LPM. The levels of signal might not be robust enough to fully activate the cascade, preventing it from spreading within the LPM. Indeed, when wild-type embryos were cultured in the presence of inhibitors of all connexins, we observed a complete failure to activate LPM gene expression.</p>
        <p>Our analysis of LR asymmetry markers also revealed the presence of ectopic patches of expression on both sides of the midline of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, with ectopically expressing cells situated on the embryo's surface. Notably, we never observed such ectopic expression in wild-type embryos that had been cultured in the presence of gap junction inhibitors, which we added at the HF stages, suggesting they originated from a defect preceding the emergence of the node and subsequent events of LR asymmetry establishment. In support of this, expression analysis in EHF stage <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants already revealed ectopic expression of <italic>Nodal</italic> in the endoderm. In PS stage wild-type embryos, <italic>Nodal</italic> is expressed in the entire emVE and then becomes downregulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Mesnard1">[11]</xref>. This downregulation might not occur correctly in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, possibly as a consequence of the emVE not being dispersed. The ectopic <italic>Nodal</italic> patches are subsequently likely to induce <italic>Lefty2</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic>.</p>

        <p>Even though some of the features have been documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Yamanaka1">[31]</xref>, the precise cellular behaviors that drive node and midline morphogenesis, and in particular regarding the emergence of cells onto the embryo's surface, remain to be elucidated. It has been proposed that groups of node precursor cells emerge from the APS and insert into the emVE epithelium at the distal tip of the conceptus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Yamanaka1">[31]</xref>. Once on the embryo's surface, cohorts of node cells gradually coalesce to form a single node pit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Lee1">[2]</xref>, thereby providing a mechanism for collectively displacing emVE cells from the midline.</p>
        <p>The absence of Sox17 from the node and midline suggested that this transcription factor is not directly involved in node and midline formation. Accordingly, the node and midline structures emerged onto the embryo's surface in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants. This suggested that morphogenesis of the gut endoderm and node/midline are distinct processes and that they are uncoupled in the absence of Sox17.</p>
        <p>We therefore interpret that failure to clear all emVE cells from the node region in a subset of mutant embryos as a secondary defect resulting from a failure in emVE dispersal. A completely emVE-derived gut endoderm might confine emVE cells to the midline, thereby hampering emergence of node progenitors onto the embryo's surface. Notably, the presence of residual emVE cells within the node of mutants did not disrupt leftward nodal flow and subsequent induction of asymmetric perinodal gene expression.</p>

        <title>Linking the Gut Endoderm to LR Patterning</title>
        <p>The observation that gut endoderm of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants lacked Cx43 puncta focused our attention on gap junctions as the potential cause for the failure in LR asymmetry establishment. We previously demonstrated that dynamic and widespread rearrangements of cell-cell junctions occur during the intercalation of DE cells into the overlying emVE layer during gut endoderm morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon1">[10]</xref>. Prior to the onset of gastrulation, Cx43 puncta were detected at cell-cell interfaces within the emVE of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants. Since in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants the emVE did not become dispersed and would not need to be rearranged to accommodate intercalation of DE cells, we expected the Cx43 puncta to be maintained in the mutant endoderm. However, <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants displayed no Cx43 puncta within the endoderm between the no bud (OB) and EHF stages.</p>
        <p>LR defects have not been described in mutants lacking <italic>Cx43</italic>. The original study characterizing a <italic>Cx43</italic> knockout mouse strain reported that mutants survive to term, dying at birth from heart defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Reaume1">[32]</xref>. Moreover, subsequent work revealed genetic background-related differences in the phenotypes resulting from conditional <italic>Cx43</italic> ablations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-WienckenBarger1">[33]</xref>. It remains to be determined whether <italic>Cx43</italic> mutant animals exhibit features representing a failure of LR patterning, including <italic>situs inversus</italic> or heterotaxia.</p>
        <p>Even though cells comprising the gut endoderm of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants were almost exclusively of emVE origin, our findings argued that they complete an initial step in gut endoderm morphogenesis by downregulating markers of VE identity, as do emVE cells in wild-type embryos prior to their dispersal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Kwon1">[10]</xref>. Thus in the absence of DE cells within the gut endoderm epithelium of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants, a new wave of gap junction formation may have failed to occur. Further studies will be required to determine whether genes encoding gap junction components are direct targets of Sox17 or whether a failure in epithelial remodeling affects Cx43 localization. In either case, we reasoned that absence of Cx43 puncta within the gut endoderm caused a failure in gap junction coupling across this tissue in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants.</p>

        <title>Gap Junction Coupling Across the Gut Endoderm</title>
        <p>Our findings revealed that gap junction coupling occurs between gut endoderm cells and that this mode of communication propagates signals in both the left and right sides of the embryo. Gap junction coupling occurred across several cell diameters extending from a perinodal location to the lateral plate. Since coupling occurred between DE and emVE cells, cells of two distinct origins intercalate to form a congruent epithelium comprising the gut endoderm. Gap junction communication in the gut endoderm is planar and isolated from surrounding tissues. The observation that the gut endoderm was capable of gap junction communication on both the left and the right sides suggested that it acts as a passive medium for relay of asymmetric LR information. This is in accord with the fact that in certain mutants having defects in LR asymmetry, expression of genes in the LPM can be right-sided or bilateral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Hamada1">[8]</xref>. If the node region, as a result of perturbed nodal flow, dictates to send asymmetry signals to the right or in both directions, the unbiased gut endoderm obediently propagates the signal to the right or to both sides. Furthermore, by revealing a lack of gap junctional coupling across the midline, our experiments also provide the first functional visualization of a midline barrier in the mouse. Importantly, the fact that some <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants exhibited limited expression of <italic>Nodal</italic> and <italic>Lefty1/2</italic> in the left LPM suggests that the LPM is responsive to LR patterning signals. Thus, we conclude that the LR asymmetry defect in <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants lies in perturbed LR signal propagation. Notably, these observations have also been noted by Saijoh and colleagues, who have gone on to demonstrate that the left LPM of <italic>Sox17</italic> mutants is responsive to LR patterning signals from Nodal-source cells (Y. Saijoh et al., unpublished work, personal communication).</p>
        <p>The identity of the transmitted signal(s) is unknown: the signal that relays information must be produced in the vicinity of the node, transferred across the gut endoderm, which when reaching the interface with LPM must trigger the <italic>Nodal/Lefty/Pitx2</italic> cascade. One molecule shown to travel through gap junctions is calcium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Isakson1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001276-Praetorius1">[36]</xref>.
