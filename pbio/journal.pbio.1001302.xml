        <p>A live-cell imaging study reveals that a positive feedback loop between dynamin and actin contributes to efficient endocytic membrane scission.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis proceeds by a sequential series of reactions catalyzed by discrete sets of protein machinery. The final reaction in clathrin-mediated endocytosis is membrane scission, which is mediated by the large guanosine triophosphate hydrolase (GTPase) dynamin and which may involve the actin-dependent recruitment of N-terminal containing BIN/Amphiphysin/RVS domain containing (N-BAR) proteins. Optical microscopy has revealed a detailed picture of when and where particular protein types are recruited in the ∼20–30 s preceding scission. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms and functions that underpin protein recruitment are not well understood. Here we used an optical assay to investigate the coordination and interdependencies between the recruitment of dynamin, the actin cytoskeleton, and N-BAR proteins to individual clathrin-mediated endocytic scission events. These measurements revealed that a feedback loop exists between dynamin and actin at sites of membrane scission. The kinetics of dynamin, actin, and N-BAR protein recruitment were modulated by dynamin GTPase activity. Conversely, acute ablation of actin dynamics using latrunculin-B led to a ∼50% decrease in the incidence of scission, an ∼50% decrease in the amplitude of dynamin recruitment, and abolished actin and N-BAR recruitment to scission events. Collectively these data suggest that dynamin, actin, and N-BAR proteins work cooperatively to efficiently catalyze membrane scission. Dynamin controls its own recruitment to scission events by modulating the kinetics of actin and N-BAR recruitment to sites of scission. Conversely actin serves as a dynamic scaffold that concentrates dynamin and N-BAR proteins at sites of scission.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cells internalize surface receptors via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process in which receptors concentrate in clathrin-coated pits in the plasma membrane that pinch into the cell as membrane vesicles. The mechanism by which vesicles pinch off from the plasma membrane is referred to as membrane scission and this requires the large guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) dynamin, curvature sensing/inducing N-terminal helix containing Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (N-BAR) domain proteins and regulation by the actin cytoskeleton. The precise mechanism of dynamin recruitment to scission sites, the kinetics of this recruitment, and how dynamin regulates recruitment of its binding partners and scission is not well understood. In this study we used an optical assay to measure the recruitment kinetics of dynamin, actin, and N-BAR proteins BIN1 and endophilin2 to individual clathrin-mediated endocytic scission events. We show that there is a positive feedback loop between dynamin and actin at membrane scission sites: dynamin regulates actin recruitment and actin assembly stabilizes dynamin recruitment. The kinetics of dynamin, actin, and N-BAR protein recruitment are in turn regulated by dynamin's GTPase activity. Conversely, inhibiting actin dynamics decreases the incidence of scission and decreases the amplitude of dynamin recruitment to scission events by around 50%. Our data suggest that dynamin, actin, and N-BAR proteins cooperate to catalyze efficient membrane scission and that dynamin controls its own recruitment to scission by modulating the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) begins when a clathrin-coated bud forms at the plasma membrane through the processive recruitment of cargo, adaptors, and accessory proteins including curvature inducing/sensing BIN/Amphiphysin/RVS domain (BAR) domain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Kirchhausen1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Takei1">[3]</xref>. The actin cytoskeleton may also play a role in the late stages of clathrin-coated bud formation in some cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Lamaze1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Yarar1">[7]</xref> through force generation and/or through segregation of lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Kaksonen1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Liu1">[10]</xref> (though see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Boucrot1">[11]</xref>). The process is completed when the constricted membrane neck of the clathrin-coated bud is severed to release a clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) in a reaction involving guanosine triophosphate (GTP) hydrolysis by the large GTP hydrolase (GTPase) dynamin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Damke1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Takei2">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite this timeline of the molecular dynamics of CCV formation, the underlying mechanisms that govern how and when endocytic proteins arrive and depart from sites of CME are still poorly understood. Pharmacological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Macia1">[14]</xref> and live cell imaging studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Loerke1">[15]</xref> in conjunction with dynamin mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Narayanan1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Sever2">[18]</xref> have shown that the GTPase activity of dynamin is not solely involved in the scission reaction but also is functionally relevant at earlier time points during clathrin-coated bud maturation (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Mettlen1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ramachandran1">[20]</xref> for recent reviews). This finding suggests that the GTPase activity of dynamin could have a role in regulating the recruitment kinetics of endocytic proteins such as N-terminal containing BIN/Amphiphysin/RVS domain (N-BAR) proteins, actin, and actin effectors in the seconds preceding scission. In support of this hypothesis, N-BAR proteins can directly bind to dynamin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ringstad1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-David1">[22]</xref> and also promote the generation of highly curved membrane templates to which dynamin preferentially binds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Pucadyil1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Roux1">[24]</xref>. This suggests a cooperative relationship with dynamin during membrane scission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Takei1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Farsad1">[25]</xref>. Moreover dynamin recruitment and actin polymerization occur over a similar time course in the seconds preceding scission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref>. Thus the dynamin GTPase cycle could potentially modulate endocytic actin and N-BAR protein dynamics. It has been proposed that dynamin is a negative regulator of endocytic actin dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ferguson1">[27]</xref>. There is also evidence that the GTPase activity of dynamin is required for actin polymerization in some cellular contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Lee1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Orth1">[29]</xref> and dynamin can bind filamentous actin (F-actin) and promote actin polymerization via F-actin uncapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Gu1">[30]</xref>. However, despite the circumstantial evidence, it remains unclear whether the dynamin GTPase cycle regulates actin polymerization and the recruitment dynamics of dynamin and key dynamin binding partners to clathrin-coated buds in the ∼20 s before scission in vivo. Conversely actin could play a role in concentrating dynamin at sites of scission because dynamin binds directly to F-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Gu1">[30]</xref> and F-actin binding effectors are implicated in actin polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Cao1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Kessels1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we investigated potential dependencies between dynamin, actin, and N-BAR protein recruitment during CME by employing the “pulsed pH assay”: a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM)–based assay that detects the internalization of transferrin receptor at individual clathrin-coated structures (CCS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Merrifield2">[33]</xref>. By using scission events as a spatial and temporal reference the kinetics of protein recruitment to sites of scission can be measured with 2-s resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Merrifield2">[33]</xref>. We found that dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton have complementary regulatory functions during mammalian CME: dynamin GTPase activity regulated the kinetics of dynamin, actin, and N-BAR recruitment and, in turn, a dynamic actin cytoskeleton was required to concentrate dynamin and N-BAR proteins at sites of scission. Our data indicate that a feedback mechanism exists between dynamin and actin in the moments leading up to membrane scission during CME.</p>

Cells were assayed with the pulse pH assay by synchronizing image acquisition with local perfusion of a target cell with alternate low and high pH buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; in the following text TfR7 refers to the TfR-phl signal at pH7, and TfR5 refers to TfR-phl signal at pH5). The moment of vesicle formation was detected when a fluorescent puntcum of TfR-phl appeared in an image acquired at pH5 (TfR5 t = 0 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for description of quantification and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Merrifield2">[33]</xref> for details).

            <p>(A) Sequential images from a TIR-FM image series of an NIH-3T3 fibroblast stably expressing dyn1(WT)-mCherry (Dyn1, lower panel) and transiently expressing TfR-pHl (TfR, upper panel). CCS were marked by spots of TfR-phl (spots, TfR images, pH7). At pH5 the fluorescence of externally accessible TfR-SEphl at CCS and on the membrane quenched to reveal acid-resistant, internalized TfR-phl. (B) Dyn1(WT)-mCherry was recruited shortly before scission. Time series of an example CCS (marked by TfR7, upper panel), which hosted a scission event (indicated by arrow, TfR5 image series) to which dyn1(WT)-mCherry was recruited (lower image series). Quantified fluorescence measurements from the time series shown on right (dark green, TfR7; light green, TfR5; blue, Dyn1). Dots correspond to the images shown. Scission manifested as an abrupt increase in the TfR5 fluorescence signal as the endocytic vesicle was occluded from external acidification. (C) Example full-length TfR7 fluorescence traces of CCS showing associated scission events and dyn1(WT)-mCherry recruitment. Example events of CCS that hosted one scission event (two sets of traces on left), two scission events (set of traces upper right), or three scission events (set of traces lower right). Scission events were classified as “terminal” (T) or “non-terminal” (NT) depending on whether the host CCS persisted or disappeared following scission (see text for explanation). Grey boxes indicate time over which CCS were visible. (D–E) Ensemble recruitment signatures of dyn1(WT)-mCherry for terminal events (D) or non-terminal events (E). Similar recruitment kinetics were observed in cells expressing dyn1(WT)-mCherry either stably (light blue) or transiently (dark blue). Transient “flickering” of dyn1(WT)-mCherry manifested as elevated pre-scission dyn1(WT)-mCherry fluorescence (black line and arrow on (D)), which persisted in non-terminal events following scission (E). Error bars represent standard error of the mean. Grey lines in (D and E) represent 95% confidence limits for random fluorescence measurements (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).

        <p>Scission events were used as a fiducial marker to align dyn1(WT)-mCherry fluorescent recruitment signals and generate an average ensemble recruitment “signature”; a temporal readout of a protein's recruitment relative to scission. The recruitment signature reflects the dynamic equilibrium between protein free in the cytosol and accumulated at the CCS. The dyn1(WT)-mCherry ensemble recruitment signature peaked at 2 s before vesicle detection (t = 0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>), consistent with previous measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref> and dynamin's role in catalyzing membrane scission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Pucadyil1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Bashkirov1">[36]</xref>. The average ensemble dyn1(WT)-mCherry recruitment signature was equivalent for NIH-3T3 cells that were transiently or stably expressing dyn1(WT)-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). For scission events defined as “terminal” (hosted by a parent CCS that disappeared after scission, see TfR7 channel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; and also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref>), the low amplitude “flickering” observed at individual events manifested as an elevated pre-scission fluorescence, which disappeared following scission (see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In the recruitment signature to scission events defined as “non-terminal” (hosted by a parent CCS that persisted post-scission at the plasma membrane and could host multiple scission events; see TfR7 traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) the elevated fluorescence persisted after scission, indicating continual dynamin flickering at the remaining portion of CCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The low amplitude “flickering” indicated that dynamin was present at CCS at early time points and suggested transient recruitment, with dynamin constantly “hopping” on and off CCS until time points close to scission when its recruitment was stabilized.</p>

        <title>Dynamin GTPase Mutants Have Different Effects on the Recruitment Kinetics of Dynamin to Scission</title>
        <p>We hypothesized that dynamin's GTPase activity was involved in recruiting dynamin to CCS. If this were correct, mutant versions of dynamin with altered enzymatic kinetics should have distinctive recruitment signatures relative to scission. To test this hypothesis we assayed the recruitment of six GTPase domain dynamin mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Marks1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Song1">[38]</xref> tagged with mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

        <p>By inspection we found that GTPase domain point mutants with similar enzymatic kinetics had similar recruitment signatures. To quantify the similarity between the six GTPase mutants and wild type (WT), we compared the pre-scission recruitment signatures (from −82 s to t = 0) of each point mutant and WT pair-wise and arranged them into a dendrogram by hierarchal clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Mutations that mainly effect k<sub>cat</sub>, dyn1(S61D)-mCherry, dyn1(T65D)-mCherry, and dyn1(T65H)-mCherry grouped together and slowed the burst of dynamin to a similar degree at time points close to scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Dyn1(T141A)-mCherry, a mutant with reduced affinity for GTP but greater rate of GTP hydrolysis, was surprisingly similar to dyn1(S61D/T65D/T65H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Dyn1(T141D), a mutant with reduced GTP binding and hydrolysis, had a dramatically slower rate of build-up in the seconds leading to scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Finally dyn1(T65A)-mCherry, a mutant with a low affinity for GTP and rate of GTP hydrolysis, was the least similar to any other recruitment signature, and had a unique recruitment profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2E</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s007">Video S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Dynamin has been implicated in regulating multiple stages of CCV formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Loerke1">[15]</xref>. To understand these regulatory mechanisms we focused on the dyn1(T65A) mutant, as its recruitment signature displayed a high level of recruitment from the earliest time points before scission (−80 s to −20 s pre-scission) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>). This suggested dyn1(T65A) affected the transient “flickering” of dynamin and was recruited at higher levels to CCS during the early stages of CCS formation. Kymograph analysis of dyn1(WT)-expressing cells showed that dyn1(WT) was significantly recruited in the seconds before vesicle appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast dyn1(T65A) was significantly recruited at or shortly after the point of de novo CCS formation and appeared to be enriched at CCS from early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2H</xref>; and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s007">Video S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>In previous studies the expression of dyn1(T65A) was shown to significantly decrease the rate and extent of transferrin uptake measured using bulk assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Marks1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Bethoney1">[39]</xref>, although it was not as potent a dominant negative as dyn1(K44A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Bethoney1">[39]</xref>. Similar to these earlier results we found that dyn1(T65A) lowered the incidence of scission events; although, once again, it was a much less potent inhibitor of scission activity when compared to dyn1(K44A) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s006">Table S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, dyn1(T141D) did not cluster with dyn1(T65A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), despite similar enzymatic constants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Song1">[38]</xref>. Dyn1(T141D) did not affect the transient “flickering” phase of dynamin recruitment but had a slower burst of recruitment associated with scission, and hence was more similar to dyn1(S61D/T65D/T65H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further investigate the kinetics of dynamin association with CCSs we compared the mobility and turnover of dyn1(WT/T65A) using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). A 3-µm<sup>2</sup> region containing CCS (indicated by mCherry-Clc) was selected and bleached and the fluorescence recovery of dyn1(WT/T65A)-EGFP and mCherry-Clc was measured in the following 100 s. Dyn1(T65A)-EGFP had a lower mobile fraction and slower half-time of recovery compared to dyn1(WT)-EGFP (mobile fraction of 59% versus 80%, and half time of recovery of 5.3 s versus 3.9 s, respectively) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s001">S1F</xref>). Dynamin is recruited to clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Damke1">[12]</xref>, and these results indicate that dyn1(T65A) turned over at CCS at a slower rate. The turnover and mobility, as measured by FRAP, of mCherry-Clc in cells expressing dyn1(WT) or dyn1(T65A) was very similar suggesting that the turnover of clathrin at CCS was independent of the dynamin GTPase cycle. These latter findings are congruent with published data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Wu1">[40]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the mutant assayed using the pulse pH assay peak recruitment was at t = −2 s suggesting continuous dynamin recruitment up until the point of scission (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s006">Table S1</xref>). All measurements were carefully performed at equivalent expression levels, although in a background of endogenous WT dyn1/2, and at present we do not know the relative proportions of endogenous and mutant dynamin at any given scission event. However, the variation between the recruitment profiles of specific mCherry-tagged GTPase mutants shows that dynamin's recruitment to CCS was regulated by its GTPase cycle.</p>

        <title>Dynamin GTPase Cycle Regulates Both CCS Maturation and Scission</title>
        <p>Previous analysis of single scission events in 3T3 fibroblasts revealed CCS can host multiple scission events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref>. The time between CCS nucleation to the first detected scission event was equivalent to the time between successive scission events, if they occurred, at persistent CCS. Therefore the underlying kinetics of clathrin-coated bud formation was relatively constant, despite the observed variability of CCS lifetimes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Merrifield2">[33]</xref> and total CCS lifetime was not an accurate measure of the underlying kinetics of CCV formation for CCS, which hosted multiple scission events. To understand dynamin's role in CCS maturation, we measured the average time from CCS nucleation to the first detected scission event in cells expressing dyn1(WT), dyn1(S61D) and dyn1(T65A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g003">Figure 3A–3C</xref>). We found that expression of dyn1(S61D) and dyn1(T65A) increased the time from CCS nucleation to scission in comparison to the expression of dyn1(WT) (156 s and 216 s versus 104 s, respectively). For CCS, which hosted from one up to three scission events, the average time from nucleation to the <italic>n</italic>th scission event increased linearly, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Therefore, dyn1(T65A) and dyn1(S61D) significantly slowed the underlying kinetics of clathrin-coated bud formation and, by definition, the endocytic activity per CCS was significantly lower in cells expressing these mutants. The magnitude of this effect was greatest for dyn1(T65A)-expressing cells. Dyn1(T65A) is a point mutant with a strong effect on GTP binding and hydrolysis, and its expression increased the time course of CCS maturation by ∼2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

        <p>For comparison the dynamics of three GED mutants were also measured: dyn1(K694A), dyn1(K694E), and dyn1(R725A) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s002">Figure S2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s002">S2C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Sever1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Sever2">[18]</xref>.

        <p>To further investigate the strong effect of dyn1(T65A) on vesicle formation, we analyzed the ultrastructure of CCS in dyn1(WT), dyn1(T65A), and dyn1(K44A) expressing NIH-3T3 cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to select NIH-3T3 cells expressing bicistronic constructs encoding dyn1(WT/T65A/K44A) tagged with hemagglutinin antigen (HA) and green fluorescent protein (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Cells were prepared for electron microscopy (EM) to investigate the effect of dynamin expression on the ultrastructure of coated pits. Compared to untransfected NIH-3T3s or dyn1(WT)-HA expressing NIH-3T3s, dyn1(T65A)-HA expressing cells accumulated coated pits with tubulated necks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>; Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 0.021); although the effect was not as strong as the expression of the dominant negative dyn1(K44A)-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>). The potent effect of dyn1(K44A) on the incidence of scission (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s006">Table S1</xref>) and the ∼4 fold increase in frequency of tubulated coated pits compared to cells expressing dyn1(T65)-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g003">Figure 3F</xref>) suggested that the tubulated coated pits in the dyn1(K44A)-expressing cells were dead-end structures that were unable to pinch off, as previously concluded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Damke1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-vanderBliek1">[41]</xref>. By contrast the relatively moderate increase in tubulated coated pits in dyn1(T65A)-HA expressing cells suggested coated pits were slowed at this late phase close to scission, but were still endocytically competent structures that could pinch off to form CCVs. Collectively these data are consistent with previous studies and suggest dynamin's GTPase cycle regulates both clathrin-coated bud maturation and scission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Macia1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Mettlen1">[19]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Dynamin's GTPase Cycle Regulates the Kinetics of Actin and N-BAR Protein Recruitment</title>
        <p>Dynamin directly interacts with F-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Gu1">[30]</xref>, actin-associated proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Schafer1">[42]</xref>, as well as molecules that induce/sense membrane curvature such as N-BAR proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Takei1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ringstad1">[21]</xref>. Given these biochemical interactions, how do the endocytic dynamics of actin and N-BAR proteins compare to that of dynamin? We observed transient foci of lifeact-mCherry, a vital probe for F-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Riedl1">[43]</xref>, at individual scission events that appeared ∼20 s before scission and then decayed in fluorescence intensity post-scission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). We observed endophilin2 (endo2)-mCherry recruitment (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s003">Figure S3B</xref>) over a similar time window, consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref> and localization of endo2-mCherry to the highly curved membrane neck of deeply invaginated CCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Sundborger1">[44]</xref>. A comparison of the ensemble recruitment signatures confirmed that actin, endo2, and dynamin were recruited to sites of scission over a similar time window (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s003">Figure S3C and S3D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref>). The ensemble recruitment signatures of NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing endo2-mCherry or transiently expressing BIN/Amphiphysin/RVS domain containing protein 1 (BIN1)-mCherry were very similar with a prominent burst of recruitment that peaked at 2–4 s before scission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s003">Figure S3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s006">Table S1</xref>). These data suggest that actin, dynamin, and N-BAR proteins are present at CCS in the seconds leading up to scission and vesicle formation.</p>
        <p>Next we asked whether dynamin's GTPase cycle modulated actin and N-BAR protein recruitment to sites of scission. To examine if the kinetics of endocytic actin and N-BAR recruitment were regulated by dynamin's GTPase cycle we created bicistronic constructs to co-express lifeact-mCherry or endo2/BIN1-mCherry in tandem with WT or GTPase mutant versions of dynamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). The recruitment signature of lifeact in a background of co-expressed dyn1(WT) and dyn1(T141A) showed only subtle differences to that of lifeact alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>) and had little effect on the slope of actin recruitment/de-recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Although it had no effect on the slope of actin recruitment, co-expression of dyn1(WT) did shift the lifeact recruitment signature ∼4 s towards scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The co-expression of dyn1(S61D) and dyn1(T65A) decreased the slope of actin recruitment with dyn1(T65A) having the strongest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g004">Figure 4F–4H</xref>). Actin recruitment in cells expressing dyn1(S61D) had a shift in the recruitment signature ∼8 s away from scission. The actin recruitment signature in cells expressing dyn1(S61D) and dyn1(T65A) still peaked at t = 0, but F-actin build-up began at much earlier time points (&gt;∼20 s and &gt;∼30 s pre-scission for dyn1(S61D) and dyn1(T65A), respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). In contrast the slope of actin de-recruitment from CCS was accelerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). In all dynamin GTPase mutants assayed actin enrichment peaked at t = 0. We conclude from these experiments that the enrichment of actin at sites of CME scission was regulated by dynamin's GTPase activity either directly or indirectly and that dyn1(T65A), the most potent GTPase mutant tested, had the strongest effect.</p>

        <p>The dynamin GTPase cycle had a similar effect on the rate of N-BAR protein recruitment to sites of scission.

        <p>Examinations of actin-disrupting drugs on CME have historically relied on pre-incubations (typically 30 min to 1 h) prior to examination with static techniques (such as biochemical assays or EM) or indirect optical assays for CME function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Lamaze1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Yarar1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Boucrot1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Fujimoto1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Gaidarov1">[47]</xref>. Despite these studies the mechanistic role of actin in mammalian CME is still enigmatic. To gain a more precise mechanistic understanding of the role of actin in mammalian CME and how actin dynamics are interconnected with other endocytic proteins we developed a four-channel perfusion system, which allowed the local perfusion of a target cell with latrunculin-B in conjunction with the pulsed pH assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In a typical experiment a target cell was perfused with alternating high and low pH buffers containing vehicle DMSO (channel 1 and 2) for ∼13 min (400 frames) and then switched to alternating high and low pH buffer (channel 3 and 4) containing DMSO and 2.5 µM latrunculin-B. After 26 min (800 frames) the perfusate was switched back to channel 1 and 2 to wash out the latrunculin-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Image stacks were analyzed by separating them into 400-frame blocks corresponding to data acquired under DMSO, 0–13 min and 14–26 min exposure to latrunculin-B and during the wash out phase. Thus, unlike previous studies, we could directly measure CCS dynamics and scission events before, during, and after exposure to latrunculin-B.</p>

            <p>(A) Logic diagram illustrating a four-channel perfusion system under transistor to transistor logic (TTL) control used to perfuse a target cell with drugs whilst detecting single scission events. Cells were first perfused with buffer containing vehicle (DMSO), then buffer containing latrunculin-B, followed by washout with buffer containing vehicle. (B) Example TIR-FM images of a cell expressing lifeact-mCherry and TfR-phl during acute exposure to 2.5 µM latrunculin-B. Within 6 min the majority of F-actin stress fibers had disappeared from the adherent cell surface and fewer CCS were visible. Washout of latrunculin-B resulted in the resumption of actin dynamics and a recovery in the number of CCS. (C) Lifeact-mCherry was not recruited to scission in the presence of latrunculin-B. Recruitment signature normalized to the random confidence interval (see Methods). Inset: histograms of peak lifeact-mCherry fluorescence (horizontal scale bar indicates the number of event; vertical scale bar corresponds to 20 s). Data pooled from five cells (DMSO pre-exposure, 1,559 events; 0–13 min exposure to latrunculin-B, 724 events; 14–26 min exposure, 758 events; and DMSO washout, 1,078 events). (D–F) Inhibition of actin dynamics reduced the incidence of scission by ∼50% (D), increased the proportion of scission events classified as non-terminal (E), and reduced the incidence of de novo CCS formation (F). Error bars represent SEM. (G) Inhibition of actin dynamics increased the time from de novo CCS nucleation to the <italic>n</italic>th detected scission event at CCS that host single or multiple scission events (limited to a maximum of three detected events).

        <p>On exposure to 2.5 µM latrunculin-B we observed the disappearance of actin foci, membrane ruffling, and actin stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). By 6 min lifeact-mCherry had a cytosolic localization, with only a few stable actin structures remaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s008">Video S2</xref>), and this was coincident with a reduction in the number of CCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In the presence of latrunculin-B we were unable to measure significant lifeact-mCherry recruitment relative to scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).

Although scission events were observed, latrunculin-B reduced the incidence of scission by &gt;50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) and resulted in a greater proportion of events classified as non-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). This suggested larger and more stable CCSs tended to host scission events in the absence of F-actin (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s006">Table S1</xref>). Latrunculin-B decreased the incidence of de novo CCS formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Yarar1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Boucrot1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Merrifield2">[33]</xref>. Although the incidence of CCS nucleation was reduced in frequency, we measured an increase in the average time from nucleation to scission for CCS that did form de novo in the presence of latrunculin (150 s compared with 117 s in presence of DMSO only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5G</xref>).

        <title>Actin Dynamics Regulate the Recruitment of Dynamin and N-BAR Proteins to Scission</title>

We measured dynamin recruitment to sites of scission before, during, and after washout of latrunculin-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We found that latrunculin-B did not perturb the pre-scission “flickering” phase of dynamin recruitment but the burst of dynamin recruitment leading up to scission was strikingly decreased in amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s009">Video S3</xref>). Histogram analysis of dynamin fluorescence peaks revealed that between 0–13 min exposure to latrunculin-B there were still many events (∼16%) with a fluorescent peak at 2–4 s before scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6A</xref> inset; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref>. However after 13 min the fluorescent peaks appeared to be randomly distributed in time, indicating a reduction in the fluorescence intensity of the dynamin burst at scission relative to background fluorescence.

            <title>Inhibition of actin perturbs the kinetics of dynamin recruitment, but has minimal impact on GAK recruitment.</title>
            <p>(A) Acute inhibition of actin decreased the amplitude of peak dyn1(WT)-mCherry recruitment. Inset: histograms of peak dyn1(WT)-mCherry fluorescence for each scission event that composed the ensemble average (horizontal scale bar indicate the number of event, vertical scale bar correspond to 20 s). Recruitment traces from five cells: (DMSO pre-exposure, 875 events; 0–13 min exposure to latrunculin-B, 430 events; 14–26 min exposure, 451 events; and DMSO washout, 743 events). (B) The burst of endophilin2-mCherry recruitment at time points close to scission was ablated by exposure to latrunculin-B. Inset: histograms of peak fluorescence for each scission event. Recruitment traces of events from five cells (DMSO pre-exposure, 1,547 events; 0–13 min exposure to latrunculin-B, 885 events; 14–26 min exposure, 854 events; and DMSO washout, 1,445 events). (C) The kinetics of GAK recruitment was insensitive to latrunculin-B. Inset: histogram of peak fluorescence for each scission. Recruitment traces of events taken from three cells (DMSO pre-exposure, 1,070 events; 0–13 min exposure to latrunculin-B, 392 events; 14–26 min exposure, 472 events; and washout, 1,445 events). (D-F) Latrunculin-B exposure decreased the peak amplitude of dynamin (D) and endo2 (E) recruitment, but had a negligible effect on the amplitude of GAK recruitment (F).

        <p>To test whether actin dynamics regulated the burst of dynamin at scission and not the pre-scission “flickering” at CCS, we examined the effects of latrunculin-B on the recruitment of the dyn1(T65A). The addition of latrunculin-B did not perturb the enrichment, or pre-recruitment, of dyn1(T65A)-mCherry at CCS (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s010">Video S4</xref>). However, as observed with dyn1(WT), the disruption of actin dynamics with latrunculin-B decreased the amplitude of the final burst of dyn1(T65A)-mCherry recruitment at scission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>). As observed in untransfected NIH-3T3s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), morphometric analysis of NIH-3T3 cells expressing dyn1(T65A)-HA exposed to latrunculin-B showed a significant increase in “omega” shape coated pit profiles and a reduction of “tubulated” coated pits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). Thus these data demonstrate that dynamin pre-scission flickering is actin independent and occurs at early stages during CCS maturation. By contrast the burst of dynamin at scission is actin dependent and correlates with the formation of a tubulated coated pit.</p>
        <p>We next examined endo2 recruitment to scission events before, during, and after the washout of latrunculin-B. The addition of latrunculin-B caused the loss of endo2 puncta associated with CCS (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s011">Video S5</xref>), consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ferguson1">[27]</xref>. In the presence of latrunculin-B the recruitment signature of endo2 was still above random; however, there was no longer a prominent burst of recruitment at time points close to scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Histogram analysis of the fluorescence peaks of endo2-mCherry at individual scission events were randomly distributed across time points before and after scission in the presence of latrunculin-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, inset). When the perfusate was switched back to channel 1 and 2, endo2-mCherry recruitment to scission resumed with identical kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s011">Video S5</xref>). Latrunculin-B had an identical effect on the BIN1 recruitment signature (unpublished data). We therefore conclude that although there was evidence of basal recruitment to CCS, a dynamic actin cytoskeleton was required for N-BAR recruitment to scission. Given that the recruitment profiles of BIN1 and endo2 were identical and responded in an identical manner to perturbations, we conclude that a single mechanism governs endo2 and BIN1 recruitment to CCS and that actin serves to concentrate N-BAR proteins at CCS at time points close to scission.</p>
        <p>To examine whether inhibition of actin has an effect on CME reactions occurring post-scission, we examined the effect of latrunculin-B on the recruitment of GAK. We observed no difference in the magnitude or rate of GAK-mCherry recruitment in presence of latrunculin-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6C</xref>; see Video S6). However, in the presence of latrunculin-B, peak GAK recruitment was shifted 4 s towards scission (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s006">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that the post-scission de-polymerization of actin changed the timing of CCV uncoating relative to scission.</p>
        <p>To quantify the effect that inhibition of actin dynamics had on the amplitude of dynamin and N-BAR recruitment we calculated the difference in fluorescence intensity between the early stages before scission (−82 to −42s pre-scission, grey area on graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>) and peak recruitment relative to scission (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s006">Table S1</xref>). Dynamin recruitment decreased by &gt;50% on initial exposure to latrunculin-B (0–13 min) and &gt;70% during 14–26 min exposure to latrunculin-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The effect on endo2 was even more dramatic with 14–26 min exposure to latrunculin-B ablating any enrichment of endo2 in comparison to pre-scission time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). We conclude that changes in magnitude of the dynamin and N-BAR recruitment signal did not arise from a global repositioning of the plasma membrane or the clathrin bud in the evanescent field, because the amplitude of GAK recruitment was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we used quantitative microscopy to examine the kinetics of dyn1(WT) and dyn1(GTPase mutant) recruitment to individual endocytic events in live cells. Detailed analysis revealed two distinct phases of dyn(WT) recruitment: a low amplitude phase in the early stages of CCS maturation and a prominent spike that increased over 20–30 s and culminated in scission. Dynamin's GTPase cycle regulated both phases of recruitment, regulated the association of actin and N-BAR proteins with CCS and modulated CCS maturation. These experiments suggest that in addition to a mechanochemical enzyme dynamin also has a regulatory role, as proposed by previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Macia1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Mettlen1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The initial phase of dyn1(WT) association with CCS (&lt;∼20–30 s prior to scission) manifested as low amplitude “flickering” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which was proportional to overall CCS size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref> and which suggested low copy number and most likely transient dynamin association with the clathrin lattice. The turnover of dynamin at CCS was confirmed using FRAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Dynamin was localized to flat and hemispherical clathrin lattices using EM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Damke1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Evergren1">[51]</xref> and a rate-limiting, mechanistic, role for dynamin at early time points has previously been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Macia1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Loerke1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Sever1">[17]</xref>. The finding that dyn1(T65A) was enriched at early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2</xref>) suggested that dynamin's GTPase activity regulated the early recruitment phase. This finding was unexpected because, in the absence of highly curved membrane, dynamin was expected to be either unassembled or present as short-lived multimers with low instrinsic GTPase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Faelber1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Warnock2">[55]</xref>. One possible explanation is that the low GTP affinity and rate of hydrolysis for dyn1(T65A) caused dynamin to be preferentially fixed in a conformation that stabilized linear oligomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Faelber1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ford1">[53]</xref>. Alternatively the GTPase cycle could have regulated the binding kinetics of dynamin with SH3 domain interacting partners, such as intersectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Simpson1">[56]</xref>, present at flat or hemispherical clathrin lattices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Shpetner1">[57]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Overall it seems unlikely that dynamin plays an essential role in the early stages of CCS formation because deeply invaginated tabulated coated pit profiles are still able to assemble in dynamin null fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ferguson1">[27]</xref>. However, dynamin is thought to be rate limiting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Loerke1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Sever1">[17]</xref> and was shown to regulate the efficiency of these early CME reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Loerke1">[15]</xref>. Alternatively dynamin's transient association with CCS at early stages (where its activity is not required per se) could be a mechanism by which dynamin senses the progression or state of CCS maturation, possibly by interacting with SH3 domain containing proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ramachandran1">[20]</xref>. Such a mechanism could allow dynamin to be precisely targeted in the later stages of CCV biogenesis where it is mechanistically required for invagination and scission. This targeting could prevent coated pits from stalling, potentially leading to abortive endocytic events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Loerke1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>At ∼20–30 s before scission the dyn1(WT) fluorescent signal increased rapidly, which suggested a stabilized enrichment of dynamin at the CCS, which peaked at scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref>. This phase occurred over a similar time window as N-BAR protein and F-actin recruitment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Like the initial phase of dynamin recruitment, the kinetics and time course of this phase were regulated by its GTPase cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, we showed that the expression of dynamin GTPase mutants with impaired GTPase activity (dyn1(S61D) and dyn1(T65A)) slowed the time course of N-BAR protein and actin polymerization over the ∼20–30 s leading up to scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g004">Figure 4H and 4I</xref>). This time course was similar to the later stages of invagination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Merrifield2">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Saffarian1">[58]</xref> and suggested dynamin regulated the kinetics of invagination via the buildup of F-actin and N-BAR proteins.</p>
      <p>Dynamin has a regulatory function in cellular processes dependent on Arp2/3-NWASP actin polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Lee1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Orth1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Schafer1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ochoa1">[50]</xref>. However, does dynamin regulate actin polymerization directly or indirectly during CCV biogenesis? In an earlier study the analysis of arrested coated bud profiles in dynamin1/2 knock out fibroblasts suggested that dynamin terminated actin dynamics at CCS by mechanically catalyzing scission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ferguson2">[59]</xref>. The increased frequency of tubulated coated pits in cells expressing dyn1(T65A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g003">Figure 3F</xref>) is congruent with this hypothesis. However, the subtle effects that distinct GTPase mutants have on the rate of lifeact recruitment suggest a direct regulatory role on the kinetics of F-actin polymerization at CCS. Whether dynamin exerts its effect on actin dynamics via endocytic actin effectors such as syndapin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Kessels2">[60]</xref>, cortactin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Cao1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Kaksonen2">[61]</xref>, or Abp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Kessels1">[32]</xref>, via a second GTPase Cdc42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Shen1">[62]</xref> and/or more directly by binding F-actin and promoting uncapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Gu1">[30]</xref>, remains unclear. Nonetheless we believe our data are congruent with the idea that dynamin's regulatory role on actin dynamics during CME has a temporal context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Loerke1">[15]</xref> and that dynamin can function as a regulatory GTPase, which controls actin polymerization, and a mechano-chemical enzyme, but that these functions are temporally distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g007">Figure 7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Macia1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Narayanan1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Mettlen1">[19]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Model of the reciprocal regulatory mechanisms between dynamin and actin during CME.</title>
          <p>(A) During the early stages of CME dynamin has a transient association with the CCS which is modulated by the GTPase cycle (inset 1). As the CCS grows actin is recruited possibly generating auxiliary force to drive invagination. Dynamin regulates the rate of actin recruitment, in a mechanism that is dependent on it GTPase cycle (inset 2). The growth of dendritic actin networks around the clathrin bud form a scaffold that stabilizes dynamin and N-BAR proteins at the constricted neck of deeply invaginated CCS (inset 3). The coordinated recruitment of dynamin, actin, and N-BAR proteins promotes the efficient catalysis of membrane scission and the release the CCV into the lumen of the cell. The catalysis of scission also leads to the termination of actin polymerization and the breakdown the dendritic actin network.

      <p>The role of actin in mammalian CME is controversial. As we have shown here productive CME scission events do occur in the presence of actin-disrupting drugs, similar to previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Yarar1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Merrifield2">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Fujimoto1">[46]</xref>. These observations have led to the suggestion that actin is dispensable in the canonical mammalian model of CME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Kirchhausen1">[1]</xref>, at least for cultured cells. Nonetheless, disrupting the actin cytoskeleton clearly has profound effects on the CME machinery: the efficiency of the entire reaction was significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g005">Figure 5</xref>) including, from morphological analysis, the final stages of CCS invagination (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001302.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Moreover, we along with others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Yarar1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ferguson1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Merrifield2">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Collins1">[63]</xref> have observed that actin and actin-associated factors are recruited and enriched at CCS in mammalian cells. We now show that actin modulates the degree of recruitment of N-BAR proteins and dynamin. Collectively these data suggest that evolution has indeed delegated a functional role for actin in mammalian CME. Perhaps a more pertinent question for future studies is why in mammalian cells, in comparison to yeast, CME has evolved a high level of mechanistic redundancy.</p>
      <p>The detailed debate over the potential function of the actin cytoskeleton in CME has primarily focused on whether actin generates the force for membrane deformation during invagination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Aghamohammadzadeh1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Boulant1">[67]</xref> or plays a role in lipid segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Liu2">[68]</xref>. Our experiments did not disprove these potential functions. However, we showed that a dynamic actin cytoskeleton did control the amplitude of dynamin and N-BAR recruitment to the CME scission reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, in addition to a mechanical function, we suggest actin serves as a scaffold to concentrate endocytic effectors at CCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g007">Figure 7</xref>), perhaps similar to mechanisms found in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Sankaranarayanan2">[69]</xref>. The decrease in amplitude of the dynamin signal in the presence of latrunculin-B suggests that, under non-perturbed conditions, a greater amount of dynamin was recruited to CCS than was required to catalyze scission. Under normal conditions an actin scaffold could stabilize dynamin above the minimum threshold required for scission, promoting dynamin assembly and a more efficient scission reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
      <p>Structural studies on dynamin have proposed that membrane scission is driven by GTP binding and dimerization between adjacent rungs in the dynamin spiral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Faelber1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ford2">[70]</xref>. This event results in the formation of a “productive” dynamin spiral that can exert shear forces on the membrane when GTP is hydrolyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Faelber1">[52]</xref>, thereby leading to the catalysis of membrane scission. The slower build up of GTPase mutants in the ∼20–30 s preceding scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and the prolonged lifetime of CCS in dyn1(S61D/T65A) expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g003">Figure 3</xref>) could partially be a result of the slower formation of a “productive” dynamin spiral. However we believe that subtle rearrangements of assembled dynamin at the deeply invaginated coated pit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Faelber1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Ford2">[70]</xref> cannot solely account for the longer time course of dyn1(S61DT65A) recruitment. Instead a more likely scenario is the slower build up of dynamin GTPase mutants reflected a slower rate of invagination and neck constriction.</p>
      <p>Events immediately following scission were subtly affected by both dyn1(S61D/T65A) expression and latrunculin B treatment. In cells expressing dyn1(S61D/T65A) the dissociation of actin and N-BAR proteins from sites of scission was accelerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g004">Figure 4</xref>), while in cells transiently bathed in latrunculin B the post-scission accumulation of GAK was slightly augmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). This finding suggests that some factor necessary for events following scission, perhaps a particular phosphoinositide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Massol1">[71]</xref>, accumulates in nascent clathrin-coated buds with an impaired scission machinery.</p>
      <p>Collectively our data are congruent with a model wherein dynamin's association with CCS follows a series of temporally distinct stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001302-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Association of dynamin with coated pits at stage 1 (&lt;∼20–30 s prior to scission) most likely requires the proline rich domain (PRD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Bethoney1">[39]</xref> and the amount of dynamin recruited is proportional to the size of the clathrin lattice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Taylor1">[26]</xref>. The accelerating accumulation of dynamin in the late stages of invagination in stage 2, 20–30 s prior to scission, is augmented by actin and, in turn, dynamin controls the rate of actin accumulation and the recruitment of curvature inducing/sensing N-BAR proteins. This forms a feedback loop, making the late stages of invagination directional and essentially irreversible. Stage 3 is scission itself at the deeply invaginated CCS, mediated by dynamin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Pucadyil1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001302-Bashkirov1">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The findings presented here show that, in addition to its well-established role in scission (stage 3), dynamin's GTPase cycle is also involved in the targeting of dynamin to CCS in stages1 and 2 and modulates the recruitment of actin and N-BAR proteins in the late stages of invagination (stage 2). The major challenges are to unravel the mechanism(s) by which dynamin's GTPase activity controls dynamin targeting to CCS prior to the formation of a constricted invagination, to precisely understand how dynamin controls actin polymerization in the final stages of invagination and to correlate the observed patterns of protein recruitment to dynamic changes in CCS topology.</p>

For electron microscopy of resin-embedded sections, cells grown in Petri dishes were briefly washed twice with PBS and then fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA; 2%) and glutaraldehyde (2.5%) in sodium cacodylate (0.1 M at pH 7.2). To examine CCS ultrastructure in the presence of latrunculin-B NIH-3T3s cell were incubated for 10 min in HBS containing either latrunculin-B (2.5 µM) or DMSO.

(E) The average mobile fraction, as determined by FRAP, of dyn1(WT) (<italic>n</italic> = 20 cells) and dyn1(T65A) (<italic>n</italic> = 17 cells). On average Dyn1(T65A) had a decreased mobile fraction in comparison to dyn1(WT) (59% versus 80% mobile fraction, respectively; Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) suggesting a significantly increased association with CCS. The mobility of mCherry-Clc was also analyzed and found not to be significantly different in cells expressing dyn1(WT) or dyn1(T65A) (53% versus 51% mobile fraction, respectively; Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 0.61). (F) The average half time of fluorescence recovery for dyn1(WT) and dyn1(T65A). Dyn1(T65A) had a slower recovery time than dyn1(WT) (5.3 s versus 3.9 s, respectively; Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 0.027). The recovery time of mCherry-Clc was not found to be significantly different in cells expressing dyn1(WT) or dyn1(T65A) (13.8 s versus 12.4 s, respectively; Student's <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> = 0.31).

Inset: histograms of peak dyn1(T65A)-mCherry fluorescence for each scission event that composed the ensemble average (horizontal scale bar indicate the number of event, vertical scale bar correspond to 20 s).
