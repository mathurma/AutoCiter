<p>New quantitative data show that the Bicoid morphogen gradient is generated from a dynamic localized source and that protein gradient formation requires protein movement along the anterior-posterior axis.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>The Bicoid morphogen gradient directs the patterning of cell fates along the anterior-posterior axis of the syncytial <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo and serves as a paradigm of morphogen-mediated patterning. The simplest models of gradient formation rely on constant protein synthesis and diffusion from anteriorly localized source mRNA, coupled with uniform protein degradation. However, currently such models cannot account for all known gradient characteristics. Recent work has proposed that <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA spatial distribution is sufficient to produce the observed protein gradient, minimizing the role of protein transport. Here, we adapt a novel method of fluorescent in situ hybridization to quantify the global spatio-temporal dynamics of <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA particles. We determine that &gt;90% of all <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA is continuously present within the anterior 20% of the embryo. <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA distribution along the body axis remains nearly unchanged despite dynamic mRNA translocation from the embryo core to the cortex. To evaluate the impact of mRNA distribution on protein gradient dynamics, we provide detailed quantitative measurements of nuclear Bicoid levels during the formation of the protein gradient. We find that gradient establishment begins 45 minutes after fertilization and that the gradient requires about 50 minutes to reach peak levels. In numerical simulations of gradient formation, we find that incorporating the actual <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA distribution yields a closer prediction of the observed protein dynamics compared to modeling protein production from a point source at the anterior pole. We conclude that the spatial distribution of <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA contributes to, but cannot account for, protein gradient formation, and therefore that protein movement, either active or passive, is required for gradient formation.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The Bicoid protein gradient plays a crucial role in determining the anterior body pattern of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. This gradient is the classic example of morphogen-mediated patterning of a developing metazoan and serves as a major topic for mathematical modeling. Accurate modeling of the gradient requires a detailed account of the underlying <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA distribution. The classic model holds that mRNA protein gradient arises via protein diffusion from mRNA localized at the anterior of the developing egg. In contrast, recent proposals suggest that an mRNA gradient generates the protein gradient without protein movement. In this study, we introduce a novel mRNA quantification method for <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, which allows us to visualize each individual mRNA particle accurately in whole embryos. We demonstrate that all but a few mRNA particles are confined to the anterior 20% of the egg, and consequently that the protein must move in order to establish a gradient. We further report that the mRNA distribution is highly dynamic during the time of protein synthesis. In numerical simulations, we show that incorporating realistic spatial locations of the individual source mRNA molecules throughout the developmental period is necessary to accurately model the experimentally observed protein gradient dynamics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Accurate development of metazoan embryos requires precise production, reception, and interpretation of patterning cues along appropriate spatial axes on realistic timescales. Many embryonic patterning events utilize graded spatial distributions of patterning molecules, or morphogens, whose activities rely fundamentally on molecular interactions susceptible to environmental fluctuations and stochasticity in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Wolpert1">[1]</xref>. Despite the widespread occurrence of morphogen-mediated tissue patterning, in most cases little or no quantitative data exist regarding the dynamics of gradient establishment or the spatio-temporal regulation of morphogen production.</p>
<p>The wealth of molecular and genetic tools available in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> offers an optimal context in which to study the basis of developmental accuracy in embryonic patterning by morphogens. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, anterior-posterior (AP) axial patterning originates with maternal cues deposited into the developing egg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-RiveraPomar1">[2]</xref>. Among these cues is the transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd), the mRNA of which localizes at the anterior cortex of the oocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Frigerio1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Weil1">[6]</xref>. Translation of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is believed to commence upon fertilization, after which the embryo undergoes 13 rapid nuclear mitotic cycles (n.c.) without cytokinesis. By the start of interphase 14 about 2 h after egg deposition (AED), the embryo consists of a syncytial blastoderm layer of about 6,000 nuclei at the cortical surface, surrounding the interior core of yolk and vitellogenic nuclei. During the blastoderm stage Bcd protein distributes along the AP axis as an exponentially decaying gradient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Driever1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>, and nuclear Bcd activates target genes in a dosage-dependent manner (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Ephrussi1">[10]</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, quantitative analysis of living embryos expressing Bcd-GFP revealed that the protein gradient remains nearly unchanged subsequent to the arrival of nuclei to the cortex at n.c. 10 (about 85 min AED), and therefore that the nuclear gradient achieves stability within only about 80 min at 25°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, nuclear gradients at n.c. 14 exhibit remarkable reproducibility between embryos: along the AP axis, similarly positioned nuclei in different embryos contain Bcd-GFP concentrations that differ by only about 10% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>. In principle, this level of precision would be sufficient for nuclei to distinguish their AP positions with an error of only a single nuclear diameter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor2">[11]</xref>. These observations raise fundamental questions regarding the underlying cell-biologic mechanisms responsible for the rapid, precise establishment of nearly equivalent gradients in essentially every embryo.</p>
<p>One such question concerns the dependence of protein gradient formation on the strength, localization, and dynamics of the underlying <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA. Females carrying altered genetic dosages of <italic>bcd</italic> produce gradients of altered amplitude, resulting in mispatterned embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Driever2">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Namba1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, the packaging of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNAs into discrete ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, and their subsequent localization to the anterior oocyte cortex, requires a suite of maternal factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-StJohnston2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Kugler1">[17]</xref>). Ooctyes lacking these factors produce embryos with distorted protein gradients resulting from <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA translation at inappropriately posterior locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Driever2">[12]</xref>. The reliable formation of the Bcd protein gradient must depend, at least in part, on the spatial distribution and the number of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA molecules. While prior work has utilized in situ hybridization to document the spatial distribution of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA during embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Frigerio1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-StJohnston1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Cha1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Spirov1">[19]</xref>, no work has yet determined <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particle numbers or examined their global localization in the developing embryo.</p>
<p>A second question regards the biophysical processes affecting the Bcd protein, such as its transport and degradation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Grimm1">[20]</xref>). The observed exponentially decaying nuclear steady state Bcd protein distribution is consistent with analytical models of gradient formation via constant anterior protein synthesis, coupled with diffusion and uniform degradation throughout the embryo (the SDD model). Within this model, the effective diffusion constant of the Bcd protein D and the protein lifetime τ determine the dynamics of gradient formation. A relatively short τ would allow the gradient to reach an equilibrium distribution (i.e. when protein degradation is matched by new synthesis) within the available developmental time of ∼2 h. Conversely, a relatively long protein lifetime will prohibit the achievement of such an equilibrated state within that time. Likewise, larger or smaller values of D will increase or decrease, respectively, the predicted distance a protein can move away from its source mRNA. A direct measurement of D for cytoplasmic Bcd-GFP at n.c. 13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref> yielded a substantially slower diffusion constant than for comparably sized, biologically inert molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor3">[21]</xref>, and about an order of magnitude too low to account for the rapid achievement of a steady state gradient with the appropriate length constant. More recent work has suggested the presence of multiple populations of Bcd-GFP, where a fraction of Bcd-GFP may diffuse rapidly enough to establish stability in the time available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-AbuArish1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Porcher1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Slow diffusivity, however, would be consistent with an alternate model in which the protein gradient arises from graded <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Spirov1">[19]</xref>. Low values of D coupled with rapid protein degradation would minimize protein movement away from source molecules, so that the local mRNA amount would predominately determine protein concentration along the AP axis. Under these conditions, sufficiently mobile mRNA would greatly impact the dynamics of gradient formation, and protein diffusion contributes only minimally. However, at present it is difficult to evaluate the legitimacy of these models, or to determine what values of D and τ, if any, might accurately describe the dynamics of Bcd gradient formation, because no quantitative data exist which span the first 80–90 min of development.</p>
<p>To address these questions, we developed two novel quantitative measurement approaches. First, we adapted a method of fluorescent in situ hybridization to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo employing fluorescently labeled DNA oligonucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Femino1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Raj1">[25]</xref>. This method allowed us to identify individual <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particles and determine their positions and intensities. We found that <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particles undergo movement into the core of the embryo, away from their initial site of localization at the ooctye cortex, by the end of the third cleavage division (within 30 min AED). Subsequently, <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is relocalized to the egg cortex during cortical nuclear migration (mitoses 6 to 9, 55 to 75 min AED), during which <italic>bcd</italic> particles tend to dissociate without <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA degradation. Despite the dynamic behavior of <italic>bcd</italic> particles, at all times &gt;90% of mRNA is localized within the anterior 20% of the embryo, a distribution which is insufficiently extended to produce the observed protein gradient in the absence of large-scale protein redistribution along the anterior-posterior axis.</p>
<p>Second, we measured nuclear Bcd-GFP levels during presyncytial stages using GFP fluorescence in fixed embryos. We discovered that Bcd-GFP does not begin accumulating in nuclei until interphase 6, about 45 min AED, reaching peak levels 50 min later in n.c. 11 and 12. Unexpectedly, in fixed samples we found that the nuclear gradient declines between n.c. 13 and n.c. 14, a result which differs from prior analysis of living embryos. We present evidence that attributes this difference in part to delayed fluorescence maturation of GFP in living embryos.</p>
<p>Finally, to examine whether the <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution impacts protein gradient formation, we incorporated its observed spatio-temporal dynamics into numerical simulations of protein production and movement. We found that models utilizing the actual mRNA distribution result in improved predictions of protein gradient dynamics, compared to models employing a single point source at the anterior pole. Therefore, we conclude that although the spatially extended mRNA localization contributes to the protein gradient, mRNA localization alone cannot account for protein gradient dynamics. Our results demonstrate that protein movement, whether active or passive, is a necessary component of Bcd protein gradient formation.</p>

<title>Fluorescently Labeled DNA Oligonucleotides Allow Visualization of Individual Diffraction-Limited <italic>bcd</italic> RNP Complexes</title>
<p>To examine <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution in fixed embryos, we adapted a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Femino1">[24]</xref> using a set of 48 20-mer DNA oligonucleotides complementary to the <italic>bcd</italic> open reading frame (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s017">Table S1</xref>) directly conjugated to AlexaFluor fluorophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Raj1">[25]</xref>. This approach has been used previously to detect single mRNA molecules in mammalian cell culture and <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Raj1">[25]</xref>. By employing directly labeled oligonucleotides as probes, we bypassed the use of antibodies and enzymes for detection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Lecuyer1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Boettiger1">[28]</xref>, and thus minimized nonspecific background, nonlinear signal response, variable tissue penetration by reagents, or other potential difficulties associated with quantification of conventional FISH signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Arvey1">[29]</xref>. Using standard laser scanning confocal microscopy, we can readily detect the anterior localization of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA at low magnification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and distinguish individual <italic>bcd</italic> RNP complexes in high resolution images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">2</xref>).</p>

<p>To obtain the complete three-dimensional (3d) structure of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution, we generated high resolution confocal stacks at high magnification, such that a spatial unit voxel represents a volume of 75 nm×75 nm×420 nm. These stacks span the entire left or right half of each embryo from the midsagittal plane to the embryo surface, representative of the entire embryo due to left-right symmetry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">2</xref> show typical images of embryos labeled during interphase 4 and interphase 11, respectively. Corresponding 3d stacks are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s018">Movies S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s019">S2</xref>. Images taken at the anterior of labeled embryos reveal readily identifiable individual <italic>bcd</italic> RNP particles above background noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figures 1A–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">2A–D</xref>), whereas the embryo posterior is essentially devoid of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figures 1F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">2E–F</xref>). Individual particles appear on multiple neighboring z-slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figure 1H</xref>), owing to the objective's spatially extended point spread function (PSF).</p>
<p>To obtain counts of discrete <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particles, their localization, and fluorescence intensities, we designed custom image analysis software to determine the spatial positions, radii, and fluorescence intensities of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particles (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s002">Figure S2</xref>, the analysis algorithm discriminates between overlapping particles which densely populate the anterior and readily detects dim particles. A large majority of detected <italic>bcd</italic> particles are circular in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), confirming that the algorithm resolves closely neighboring particles. The particles have a spatial extent of about 3 pixels on average, corresponding to a physical distance of ∼200 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This is identical to the PSF in the confocal slices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s003">Figure S3</xref>), indicating that the particles are smaller than the diffraction limit of our microscopy. The extended PSF dictates that each mRNA particle must be detected simultaneously on consecutive z-slices, and the algorithm uses this property to discriminate true particles from local background noise (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We identified an optimal threshold for distinguishing between candidate particles and random fluorescence fluctuations by examining posterior stacks which contain few particles (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s004">Figure S4</xref>). As additional controls, we examined background fluorescence in cleavage stage embryos processed without any probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s005">Figure S5A–C</xref>) or exposed to probes against the purely zygotically expressed gene <italic>giant</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s005">Figure S5D–F</xref>). Both show a low level of fluorescent signal, but no detected particles. These controls allow us to exclude falsely identified particles.</p>

<title><italic>bcd</italic> RNP Complexes Form a Short Anterior Gradient at All Times, With &lt;1% of <italic>bcd</italic> Present in the Posterior 60% of the Egg</title>
<p>To quantify the spatial distributions of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA, we examined embryos ranging from n.c. 3 to n.c. 14. During all stages of development, <italic>bcd</italic> particles are found in a graded distribution peaking at around 7% egg length (EL, as measured from the anterior pole) and leveling off at nearly zero particle density by 40% EL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Confocal images taken at both early cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and blastoderm (n.c. 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">Figure 2</xref>, and n.c. 13, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s007">Figure S7</xref>) stages reveal a higher density of <italic>bcd</italic> particles in anterior compared to posterior regions. Moreover, anteriorly localized particles are brighter than those toward the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The higher density of brighter anterior particles results in a sharp, steep gradient of total <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution within the anterior third of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). At all times, 90% or more of total <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is found within the anterior 20% of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-StJohnston3">[35]</xref>.

<p>Although the majority of mRNA particles are detected in the anterior 20%, we nevertheless observe faint discrete particles scattered along the entire AP axis. During both cleavage and blastoderm, very few or no particles are detected in the posterior embryo core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figures 1F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">2E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s007">S7E–F</xref>). Conversely, a small number of particles exhibiting weak fluorescence sparsely populate the posterior surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figures 1I–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">2G–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s007">S7I–L</xref>). A handful of particles can be detected even at almost 100% EL near the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">Figure 2K–L</xref>). Thus, we can document even the small fraction of particles that either fail to localize during oogenesis or which are transported an unusually large distance away from the anterior cortex after egg activation. To our knowledge, <italic>bcd</italic> RNP complexes have not been detected in the posterior of wild-type embryos. These observations demonstrate the exquisite sensitivity of our method to the presence of dimly fluorescent <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particles. However, we emphasize that the particles found in the entire posterior 60% of the embryo constitute less than 1% of the total <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). These particles are uniformly dimly fluorescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) and are found at a sparse density which does not change significantly during development. Translation of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is repressed by Nanos activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Wharton1">[36]</xref>, silencing posteriorly localized <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA.

<title><italic>bcd</italic> RNP Complexes Translocate from the Embryo Core to the Cortex Concomitant with Nuclear Expansion</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that egg activation triggers release of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA from its initial tight localization at the anterior egg cortex, resulting in a posterior dispersion of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA within 25 min at 25°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Weil2">[30]</xref>. This corresponds to the interphase of n.c. 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s008">Figure S8</xref>), by which time <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA has already reached its most posterior extent, where it remains from n.c. 4 through 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3E and 3F</xref>). The AP particle distribution at n.c. 4 therefore results from this early release of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA from the cortex. Prior to and during n.c. 6, 97% of all <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is found in the anterior 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), with the remainder forming a gradient which drops to nearly zero before 40% EL.</p>
<p>In midsagittal planes at n.c. 4, regions near the embryo surface contain fewer particles than the center of the embryo (compare upper and lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Consistent with this, confocal planes taken near the embryo surface contain fewer particles compared to the same AP position at the midsagittal plane (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figure 1A and 1I</xref>). Therefore, much of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is not near the cortex but is found in the embryo interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g001">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s001">S1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s008">S8</xref>), as observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-StJohnston1">[5]</xref>. In low magnification images, we often observe mRNA localization in a wedge or cone-shaped distribution jutting in toward the interior core of the embryo in midsagittal planes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s008">Figures S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s009">S9A–D</xref>), suggesting the presence of uncharacterized structures along which <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particles might translocate upon egg activation. The observation that particles do not progress further into the posterior after n.c. 3 supports the idea that <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is tethered to underlying cytoskeletal structure(s) throughout embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Ferrandon1">[32]</xref> and is not free to diffuse.</p>
<p>We observed a marked change in <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA spatial localization after interphase 6. As the nuclei undergo expansion toward the axial poles beginning at the sixth mitosis and continuing at n.c. 7, <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA moves ahead of the expanding nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g004">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s001">S1C–E</xref>). <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA progresses to the cortex during nuclear cortical migration between n.c. 8 to 10, such that in midsagittal planes at n.c. 11, <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is highly enriched near the embryo cortex, with the majority of fluorescence found within about 25 µm of the embryo surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">Figures 2A–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g004">4A</xref>). This enrichment is also apparent in z-slices collected at the cortical nuclear layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">Figures 2G–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g004">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s007">S7G–L</xref>).

<title><italic>bcd</italic> mRNA Particles Disassemble During Cortical Translocation, But <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA Is Not Degraded Until the Onset of Cellularization</title>
<p>Concomitant with the particle relocalization, the distribution of fluorescence intensities shifts from bright to dim spot intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), and the number of detected particles tends to increase with developmental age from about 70,000 per embryo in cycles prior to n.c. 7, to about 110,000 particles in blastodermal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

<p><italic>bcd</italic> RNA is degraded with other maternal mRNAs at the midblastula transition during n.c. 14; prior to this time, no degradation of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Berleth1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Surdej1">[37]</xref>.

During this time, wholesale zygotic gene expression is activated, maternal mRNAs are degraded, and cellular membranes form between the cortically positioned nuclei. We gauged the approximate age of fixed embryos in n.c. 14 on the presence of the cellularization front and the morphology of nuclei which elongate during cellularization. Immediately following the 13<sup>th</sup> mitosis, embryos exhibit particles with intensity and spatial distributions similar to the earlier blastoderm stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g005">Figure 5A, 5D, 5G</xref>).

<p>The earliest time at which we can detect nuclear Bcd-GFP is about 45 min AED, when Bcd-GFP begins to accumulate in the most anteriorly positioned nuclei during the first 2 min of the sixth interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), coinciding with the expansion of nuclei into the cloud of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA and with the onset of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA relocalization. We detect Bcd-GFP fluorescence above background autofluorescence in nuclei positioned within the anterior third of the embryo when the nuclei extend from about 25% to 60% EL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

<title>The Nuclear Bcd Gradient Forms During n.c. 6–10, Is Stable During n.c. 11–13, and Decays Thereafter</title>
<p>Between the sixth mitosis and interphase 10, nuclei migrate toward the egg cortex as an expanding, elliptical shell, while continuing to accumulate Bcd-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g006">Figure 6A–D</xref>). A gradient of nuclear Bcd-GFP can be readily distinguished within the anterior third of the embryo from n.c. 7 and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g006">Figure 6B, C</xref>). By n.c. 9, Bcd-GFP is apparent in nuclei throughout the anterior half of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), demonstrating the continued heightening of Bcd-GFP levels along the AP axis. The nuclei arrive at the egg cortex and form the syncytial blastoderm upon completing the ninth mitosis. From n.c. 10 onward, the Bcd-GFP gradient is evident in single confocal slices of the midsagittal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g006">Figure 6E–I</xref>), reminiscent of images of Bcd-GFP obtained previously by live imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>To quantify the Bcd gradient at these early stages, we extracted nuclear fluorescence intensities from embryos expressing both Bcd-GFP and Histone-RFP. The latter provides a nominally uniform fluorescence signal in all nuclei and serves as a reference to normalize Bcd-GFP values at different optical depths in the sample (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Corrected nuclear Bcd-GFP gradients between n.c. 6 and n.c. 11 show that at all positions along the AP axis, nuclear Bcd-GFP rises continuously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g007">Figure 7A and 7C</xref>). The shape of the gradient, however, does not change (see slopes on log-linear inset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), whereas its amplitude continues to rise and increases by a factor of ∼3 over the course of n.c. 6–11. The embryo-wide increase in Bcd-GFP is abruptly halted along the entire AP axis at n.c. 11–12, by which time nuclei have attained Bcd concentrations &gt;90% of their maximal values. Therefore, the nuclear gradient forms over approximately 50 min between n.c. 6 and n.c. 11. During n.c. 11 and 12 nuclear Bcd-GFP concentration remains within ∼95% of its maximum along the whole AP extent. After n.c. 12, nuclear concentrations drop, starting at the anterior; by n.c. 13, values in the anterior 20% of the embryo are approximately 80%–90% of their maxima at n.c. 12.

<p>These observations of gradient dynamics differ sharply from the <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution, which at no time resembles an exponentially decreasing gradient reaching to &gt;75% EL, such as observed for Bcd-GFP from n.c. 9 onward. Bcd-GFP is visible in nuclei positioned at 50% EL and beyond from n.c. 8 onward, yet at these positions we observe essentially no mRNA particles. Instead, the protein gradient can only be accounted for if protein moves towards the posterior from anteriorly localized mRNA.</p>

<title>Delayed GFP Maturation Can Account for Apparent Discrepancy Between Gradients in Fixed and Live Tissue and Provides Further Evidence for Cytoplasmic Protein Movement</title>
<p>By live imaging, nuclear Bcd-GFP levels appear relatively stable after the 10<sup>th</sup> mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>, in contrast to our observations in fixed tissue. Additionally, we observe that the decay length of fixed gradients is approximately 0.15 EL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g008">Figure 8A</xref> inset), compared to a decay length of around 0.2 EL in live embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>. These differences do not result from the use of different microscopy methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s012">Figure S12</xref>) and therefore must arise from the fixation procedure.</p>
<p>To determine the effect of fixation on Bcd-GFP fluorescence, we imaged living Bcd-GFP and Histone-RFP embryos at blastoderm stages, then fixed the embryos within 3 min of live imaging, and subsequently re-imaged under the same microscopy settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g008">Figure 8A–D</xref>). We found that fixation increases the overall brightness by about 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g008">Figure 8E–F</xref>), possibly as a result of increased transparency of fixed material mounted in a glycerol-based medium. However, rescaling live or fixed Bcd-GFP gradients by a factor of 3 reveals qualitatively different gradient shapes in the anterior 25% of the egg, wherein fixed gradients exhibit an additional increase in relative intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). This remaining difference could be accounted for if newly synthesized Bcd-GFP is not immediately visible but becomes fluorescent after fixation. This phenomenon can be attributed to the well-known process of GFP maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Cubitt1">[42]</xref> and refs therein). To test whether delayed maturation can affect the appearance of Bcd gradients detected by fluorescent protein fusions, we imaged transgenic embryos expressing protein fusions of Bcd with either the rapidly maturing GFP derivative Venus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Nagai1">[43]</xref> or the more slowly maturing mRFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Campbell1">[44]</xref>. We found that after 3-fold rescaling, live and fixed Bcd-Venus gradients exhibited similar appearances, consistent with the rapid attainment of fluorescence by Venus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g008">Figures 8H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s013">S13A–C</xref>). In contrast, rescaled live Bcd-mRFP gradients showed poor correspondence with fixed gradients along the majority of the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g008">Figures 8H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s013">S13D–F</xref>). This result supports the view that delayed maturation can alter the appearance of the Bcd protein gradient. In addition, by incorporating delayed maturation into a simulation of gradient formation (see below), we could qualitatively recapture the stable nuclear gradients observed in live embryos at late blastoderm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s014">Figure S14</xref>). We note that previous work has determined that gradients of equivalent shape are observed upon quantification of GFP fluorescence and anti-GFP immunostaining in the same embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Dubuis1">[45]</xref>. Moreover, the distribution of Bcd protein detected by anti-Bcd antibodies does not differ between wild-type and embryos in which Bcd-GFP is the only source of Bcd protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Houchmandzadeh1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>A maturation-based explanation supports the idea of protein movement away from anterior mRNA. With delayed maturation, immature fluorescent protein synthesized at the anterior would tend to attain fluorescence while en route toward the posterior. As a result, in a live embryo, the fraction of immature eGFP would be higher in the anterior than the posterior, and allowing additional time for eGFP to attain fluorescence would then disproportionately increase anterior fluorescence compared to posterior, as we observe by fixation.</p>

<title>A Spatially Distributed Source Is Necessary to Account for Observed Protein Gradient Dynamics</title>
<p>Diffusion represents a simple plausible mechanism of protein transport away from the anterior mRNA source, and diffusion-based models such as the SDD model provide a straightforward mathematical framework for describing gradient establishment. Previous modeling efforts have treated the site of synthesis either as an anteriorly localized point source <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Houchmandzadeh2">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Wu1">[49]</xref> or as conjectured anterior domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Alves1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Sample1">[53]</xref>. Having characterized the actual distribution of <italic>bcd</italic> RNA, we asked whether that distribution is a necessary component of gradient establishment by performing numerical reaction-diffusion simulations of gradient formation. We compared our measured nuclear gradients to protein distributions predicted to arise from either a realistic mRNA distribution or an anterior point source. We find that the combination of a non-monotonic time course for nuclear gradient amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g007">Figure 7D</xref>) and a relatively stable length constant between n.c. 8 and 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g007">Figure 7B</xref>) precludes a classical SDD-type model in which the biophysical parameters of translation rate S, degradation rate τ, and diffusion D are kept constant at all times. Therefore, to reproduce the measured nuclear concentrations, our simulations utilized an “extended SDD” model which allowed some subset of these parameters to change in time (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the measured <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution for the source, we found excellent fits between predicted and observed nuclear protein gradients from n.c. 7 to n.c. 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g009">Figure 9A–B</xref>), as determined by a χ<sup>2</sup>-error measure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s015">Figure S15</xref>). Conversely, if the model assumes a point-source geometry at the anterior of the embryo, an equivalent search through the parameter space of extended SDD models fails to adequately reproduce our observed Bcd protein data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). In particular, at early time points, the point source causes anterior protein levels to rise inappropriately high to attain a good overall fit. Additionally, the disperse source allows the model to better predict the late decrease in gradient amplitude. Indeed, estimates of total protein based on available measurements suggest that total Bcd decreases between n.c. 13 and n.c. 14 despite the doubling of nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Simultaneously with the global decrease in protein levels, we see a degradation of disperse mRNA. Our simulation can account for the observed drop in protein distribution only if we use the realistic mRNA geometry during this decay period, rather than a point source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g009">Figure 9B, C</xref>). These numeric results demonstrate that realistic mRNA distributions significantly outperform the point source geometry in reproducing the observed protein gradient dynamics.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prior work demonstrating the precision in Bcd-GFP nuclear gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref> prompted us to examine two aspects underlying the formation of the Bcd gradient. First, we adapted a novel mRNA labeling methodology to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo to examine global <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Raj1">[25]</xref>. Second, we quantified the formation of the nuclear Bcd-GFP gradient in fixed embryos during the entire period from fertilization to cellularization. A comparison of mRNA and protein gradient dynamics reveals that protein movement must occur away from the anteriorly localized source. Further, by analyzing numerical simulations of protein gradient establishment, we find that simple SDD models fail to account for the observed protein gradient dynamics. In contrast, extended SDD models utilizing the measured mRNA source distribution account for the data well, thus implicating a role for the disperse <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution in gradient formation.</p>

<title>A Sensitive FISH Method Captures Global <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA Particle Dynamics</title>
<p>Our method enabled us to quantify the global <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particle distribution as a function of developmental time. The detection of dim particles even in the far posterior of the embryo demonstrates the improved sensitivity of our protocol. In addition, the high degree of spatial resolution allows us to document the characteristics of individual particles over developmental time. The method is sufficiently sensitive that we can successfully discriminate mRNA degradation at n.c. 14 from particle dissolution by the beginning of blastoderm stages.</p>
<p>Until n.c. 7, we see intensity distributions clearly separated from the noise peak (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s004">Figure S4</xref>), yielding robust estimates of particle counts with very low deviations (∼10%) across embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). As the particles disassemble after n.c. 10, the weakest particles (possibly single <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA molecules) move closer to the detection threshold, which could, in principle, lead to a significant number of missed particles. Therefore our counting results for late embryos should be strictly interpreted as lower bounds on the actual number of particles in late embryos. However, the fact that the total particle light is approximately conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), and that we can clearly identify an explicit mRNA degradation event during n.c. 14, strongly argue for the possibility that even in later embryos we are in fact recovering most of the particles and their cumulative intensity.</p>
<p>The biological mechanism(s) mediating mRNA particle movement during embryogenesis are as yet unknown. Previous work has shown that the reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton upon egg activation allows the dispersion of <italic>bcd</italic> away from the oocyte cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Weil2">[30]</xref>. Whether endogenous <italic>bcd</italic> particles continue to localize with other cytoskeletal elements, such as microtubules, during embryogenesis is unknown, although in vitro synthesized mRNA containing the <italic>bcd</italic> 3′ UTR localization signal associates with microtubules when injected into embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Ferrandon1">[32]</xref>. Redistribution of <italic>bcd</italic> RNP binding sites on microtubules might provide a method of scaling mRNA spatial distribution with different egg sizes. Such scaling could then potentially influence the observed scaling of the protein gradient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor3">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is interesting that <italic>bcd</italic> particles containing more mRNAs tend to be localized closer to the anterior than weakly fluorescent particles. Possibly, brighter <italic>bcd</italic> RNP complexes possess greater numbers of protein components required for establishment and/or maintenance of anterior localization, such as Staufen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-StJohnston1">[5]</xref>. A greater content of Staufen (or other factors) would then lead to a greater probability of maintenance at the anterior. If so, then the slight posterior shift we observe may be linked to particle dissolution: as particles dissociate during development, they lose some fraction of localization components and tend to move posteriorly.</p>
<p>We observed weakly fluorescent particles in the posterior at all nuclear cycles. Such particles likely represent <italic>bcd</italic> RNA which failed to localize to the anterior during oogenesis, although we cannot formally rule out that such RNAs were in fact initially correctly localized and became posterior later. The fraction of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA in the posterior 60% is near zero and thus contributes only negligibly to the protein gradient. Nevertheless, the embryo possesses a failsafe mechanism of suppressing <italic>bcd</italic> translation via Nanos activity in the posterior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Wharton1">[36]</xref>. Such a failsafe might buffer the effects of environmental or genetic conditions that result in mislocalization of <italic>bcd</italic>.</p>

<title>The Spatial Distribution of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA Cannot Account for Protein Gradient Dynamics</title>
<p>Our observations of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA are similar to the originally observed, steeply graded mRNA distributions of St. Johnston et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-StJohnston1">[5]</xref>. In contrast, our results do not fully agree with a recent study which suggested that posteriorly directed <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA movement at the cortex accounts for the gradient of Bcd protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Spirov1">[19]</xref>. Our analysis is partially consistent with their findings: during early cleavages, <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA on the embryo surface does not extend far beyond ∼5% EL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g002">Figure 2I–J</xref>), whereas surface particles are relatively dense even at 15% EL during syncytial stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3A, 3C, 3G</xref>). However, the latter change is the result of bulk particle movement from the interior to the embryo surface. Such movement would not have been detected in the study by Spirov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Spirov1">[19]</xref>, which did not succeed in labeling internally localized <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA in either early cleavage stage embryos or unfertilized eggs (Figures 2A–C, 6A–C of Spirov et al. 2009 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Spirov1">[19]</xref>). This is reflected in the apparent increase in total mRNA fluorescence observed in that study between n.c. 3 and 10, a behavior impossible for strictly maternally supplied transcripts, but consistent with the arrival of previously undetected internal <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA at the embryo cortex. Since the amount of mRNA falls to nearly zero too close to the anterior to account for the presence of Bcd-GFP in nuclei at nearly 70% EL, we conclude that the spatial distributions of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA and protein are at no point in time rescaled versions of each other. As we note above, Bcd-GFP is evident in nuclei positioned at 50% EL and beyond beginning at n.c. 8, yet at these positions, the mRNA concentration is essentially zero. Similarly, Bcd-GFP is retained in yolk nuclei after <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA has relocalized cortically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g006">Figures 6E–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s016">S16</xref>). Furthermore, if we suppose that Bcd is unstable so that the local concentration of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA dictates protein concentration (as proposed recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Spirov1">[19]</xref>), then the amount of mRNA at, e.g., 20% EL during n.c. 7 should be the same as the amount of mRNA at 50% EL at n.c. 11, given that nuclear Bcd-GFP concentrations are approximately the same in those locations at those times; however, this is not what we observe.</p>

<title>Modeling Implicates <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA Distribution in Protein Gradient Dynamics</title>
<p>Our observations present a revised description of protein gradient dynamics in which along the entire AP axis, nuclear Bcd concentrations reach their maximum values by n.c. 11. Previous work cited the difficulties of a simple SDD-based model of gradient formation given the apparent slow diffusion coefficient D of Bcd-GFP (∼0.3 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) as measured in the blastoderm cytoplasm by photobleaching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>. More recent measurements by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy have estimated D≈7 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, which in principle would be rapid enough to establish a stable gradient prior to n.c. 9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-AbuArish1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Porcher1">[23]</xref>. The observations presented here, however, indicate that nuclear Bcd-GFP continues evolving beyond that point in a non-monotonic manner. Taken together with recent work suggesting that nuclei function as passive absorbers of local Bcd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Grimm2">[40]</xref>, these results would appear to preclude a classical SDD model with constant parameters in which the Bcd distribution reaches a stable state.</p>
<p>Simple extensions of SDD provide the mathematical framework within which to model protein movements from disperse sources. While such minimally extended models do not explicitly include the role of nuclei and non-diffusive modes of protein transport that might play an important role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Hecht1">[51]</xref>, they nevertheless allowed us to discover parameter sets that successfully predict the observed protein gradient when incorporating the observed, disperse mRNA sources; in contrast, the best fit parameters utilizing only an anterior point source do not match data as well. This result can be understood by noting that while the protein gradient beyond the AP extent of its mRNA source is not influenced much by the geometry of the source, the same does not hold for the anterior part of protein gradient that overlaps with mRNA.</p>
<p>We note that our measurements are limited to nuclei and that we do not explicitly account for cytoplasmic Bcd-GFP. Using currently available estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>, it is likely that total nuclear and cytoplasmic Bcd-GFP continue rising through n.c. 13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s011">Figure S11</xref>). We also note that n.c. 13 and 14 exhibit extended interphases, during which nuclear diameter increases and Bcd-GFP concentrations fall as a result <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>. These changes in Bcd levels both during and between interphases pose a challenge to understanding the transcriptional readout of Bcd concentrations. The well-documented dependence of Bcd target gene expression on Bcd levels implies that the readout process must be insensitive to such global changes in nuclear Bcd concentration. The nature of the underlying readout process, and how it achieves the observed reproducibility and accuracy of transcriptional regulation, will be the subject of future experiments.</p>

Embryos were mounted in Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences). For high resolution imaging, we used a 100× HCX PL APO CS NA 1.46 oil immersion objective on a Leica SP5 laser-scanning confocal microscope with 514 nm excitation wavelength at 2048×2048 pixels (linear dimension of 75.7 nm) and z-spacing of 420 nm, and obtained one anterior and one posterior stack of each embryo. Low resolution images of the midsagittal plane were taken with a 20× HC PL APO NA 0.7 oil immersion objective at 1024×500 pixels.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>FISH Image Analysis</title>
<p>To correct for drift of the microscope stage in the xy-plane, we first realigned the z-slices by starting at the midsaggital plane (z = 0) and shifted successive slices such that the pixel-wise cross-correlation in raw intensity between slice z and z+1 was maximized. To normalize for changes in optical medium with depth z, we selected 10<sup>5</sup> small image patches from each posterior z-slice, computed the mean and variance in raw intensity from each patch, and fit a linear relation between the two; if noise in the image were purely uncorrelated Poisson shot noise, the slope would yield a conversion factor between the raw microscope signal and the photon counts. We then normalized every z-slice by this factor, which changed slowly and systematically with z. Neither realignment nor normalization crucially affect our reported results.</p>
<p>We next filtered each z-slice by a balanced circular difference-of-Gaussians filter with center radius size of 1.5 pixels and surround size 2.5 pixels, roughly matched to the size of single <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particle, and found the local maxima in the filtered images that exceed the detection threshold. These are <italic>candidate particles</italic>. If the detection threshold is too low, the number of candidate particles in the posterior stack rapidly increases due to false detections of noise and autofluorescence, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s004">Figure S4</xref> (red line). We pick for the threshold a value just above this rapid increase and find that after normalization, a single threshold value can be chosen for all embryos.</p>
<p>Each candidate particle is then processed in turn: starting with the brightest unprocessed candidate C in the z-stack, successive nearby z-slices are examined for other candidates that appear at the same x-y location due to the axially extended PSF of the microscope (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s003">Figure S3</xref>); these candidates are considered as shadows of C, not independent particles. By identifying candidates and their shadows on successive planes, we find that the average light intensity profile of the mRNA particle in the axial (z) direction is approximately Gaussian, with decay length of about 1 slice. Given our detection and microscopy settings, we therefore expect to observe 1–2 shadows for each true mRNA particle. Next, we proceed by fitting the light intensity of each candidate particle as a 2D elliptical Gaussian profile plus constant background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In detail, we clip 9×9 pixel patches centered on the candidate and fit a light intensity model I(x,y) = offset+amplitude * Gaussian(x−x<sub>c</sub>, y−y<sub>c</sub>, r<sub>x</sub>, r<sub>y</sub>, theta), where x<sub>c</sub> and y<sub>c</sub> are the light intensity center coordinates, r<sub>x</sub> and r<sub>y</sub> are orthogonal ellipse axes, with r<sub>x</sub> inclined by angle theta to the horizontal. If within the 9×9 patch other candidates are identified, we clip out a larger patch and simultaneously fit all nearby candidates to properly resolve their radii and amplitudes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Each candidate particle in the list has thus been concisely described by parameters (x<sub>c</sub>, y<sub>c</sub>, r<sub>x</sub>, r<sub>y</sub>, offset, amplitude, number of shadows).</p>
<p>Since the threshold is set as low as possible to capture all mRNA signal, the candidates might include false positive detections. To eliminate these, we require that (i) r<sub>x</sub>, r<sub>y</sub> be above 0.7 and below 2.5 pixels, (ii) the amplitude to exceed the background offset, and (iii) the number of shadows be at least 1. Detection threshold and number of shadows are the most stringent criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s004">Figure S4</xref>, blue and cyan lines), while (i), (ii) are far less restrictive. Candidates passing these criteria are considered as mRNA particles, which exhibit stereotyped, circular shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>); their intensity is proportional to amplitude * r<sub>x</sub> * r<sub>y</sub>. We find a very good linear correspondence between the intensity and difference-of-Gaussians filter value for each particle, and the results are robust to the choice of either of these intensity measures as the thresholded variable. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g004">4C–D</xref> report the statistics of particle counts and intensities (distributions are normalized to unit area).</p>
<p>To extract the spatial distributions, we must translate the x<sub>c</sub>, y<sub>c</sub> location of each particle detected at 100× into the projection along AP axis. Using image manipulation, we register the 20× and 100× images of midsaggital plane and extract automatically the coordinates of the AP axis, of length L, from 20× images. This allows us to compute for each particle its x/L relative coordinate, and to construct distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g003">Figure 3D–F</xref>. In 4A we similarly compute the density of mRNA particles per unit area in midsaggital plane in thin slices parallel to embryo surface at depth d/L.</p>

DAPI-stained embryos were mounted in Aqua-Poly/Mount and imaged using a 20× HC PL APO Gly 0.7 NA objective on a Leica SP5 laser-scanning microscope with excitation wavelengths of 405 nm (DAPI), 488 nm (eGFP), and 561 nm (mRFP). Image stacks were obtained at 2048×2048 pixels (linear dimension 445 nm) with z interval of 3.5 µm spanning approximately 75% of embryo z-thickness. Custom software employed smoothened DAPI and RFP images to identify nuclei by thresholding in individual z slices, as well as embryo edges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor2">[11]</xref>, resulting in 3d nuclear masks. For embryos at blastoderm stages, a watershed was applied to separate closely spaced objects. 3d masks were checked in parallel with GFP, RFP, and DAPI images to ensure detected objects consisted only of nuclei; inappropriate objects were discarded and each independent set of connected pixels was designated a nucleus. The mean GFP and RFP pixel intensities and centroid position for each nucleus were calculated. Histone-GFP and Histone-RFP mean nuclear intensities attenuate at similar rate as function of depth beneath the embryo surface. Assuming that all nuclei contain the same DNA content and therefore the same concentration of Histone-RFP, we used the attenuation in mean RFP intensity to apply a corrective factor to nuclei (as performed previously using anti-Histone antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Liberman1">[55]</xref>). We calculated autofluorescent background by comparing to OregonR embryos, observing that nuclei at 85%–95% EL in Bcd-GFP expressing embryos contain the same mean GFP intensity as fixed OregonR embryos imaged under the same conditions.

<title>Simulations of Bcd Gradient Establishment</title>
<p>We performed numerical reaction-diffusion simulations of the extended SDD model on a 3d 10 µm grid. We adopted the embryo geometry from the BDTNP map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Fowlkes1">[56]</xref>, which represented our solution domain with no-flux boundary conditions. In the interior, we solved<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000596.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000596.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the concentration of Bcd protein, and D, τ, and ρ are (nominally time-dependent) diffusion, degradation, and synthesis rates. The source ρ was taken to be a collection of measured <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA particle intensities; the positions of the particles were readjusted to undo the axial compression caused by the imaging protocol. We kept the source geometry unchanged for nuclear cycles for which we do not have explicit measurements. The total source strength was kept constant according to the observed constant total intensity with developmental time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). We extracted the temporal snapshots after time increments of 8 min each for n.c. 1 to 9, 9 min for n.c. 10, 10 min for n.c. 11, 12 min for n.c. 12, and 20 min for n.c. 13 and 14. The obtained concentration profiles were projected along the AP axis. As the units of measurement are arbitrary, the simulation gradients were rescaled with a single scale parameter to match as closely as possible the measurements for n.c. 7–12; the goodness of fit was defined as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000596.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>Thus, models that have small <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000596.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> match the data better. We then asked how closely we can reproduce the observed gradients (without any assumption about the gradient equilibration and without any reference to previously measured D and τ parameters) within the classic SDD model, where D, τ are constant and ρ is given by the measurement, assuming continuous translation from the source. As expected from the non-monotonic temporal dependence of the gradient amplitude reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g007">Figure 7D</xref>, no combination of parameters for the classic SDD model fits the data well.</p>
<p>The most straightforward extension of the SDD model is to allow some subset of translation rate, degradation rate τ, and diffusion constant D parameters to vary in time. To guide our exploration of such extended SDD models, we first noted that protein gradients at different times are rescaled versions of each other, i.e. the length scale is approximately constant from n.c. 8 onwards (relative change is less than 10% from n.c. 8 till n.c. 14), while the gradient amplitude increases by ∼3-fold from n.c. 8 to the time it reaches its peak in n.c. 12, and decreases to about 3/4 of the value in n.c. 14. Simultaneously satisfying both constraints, i.e. preserving the decay length and properly scaling the gradient amplitude as a function of time, is challenging in the framework of such extended SDD models. Decrease in gradient amplitude at later times can be generated in models in which the source turns off at n.c. 12, but if diffusion still remains active, the gradients are very flat at low x/L, inconsistent with the data. Models in which the decrease in gradient amplitude after n.c. 12 is generated by turning on degradation later yield gradients that match the data reasonably at low x/L, but do not preserve the exponential profile with a conserved decay constant across developmental time; even models in which degradation is present during the whole developmental time, but can accelerate to a higher value in blastoderm stages, do not fit the data well. Furthermore, to account for low gradient amplitudes at n.c. 7 and 8, the source needs to be turned on late, i.e. for most of the models around n.c. 5 or 6.</p>
<p>With these observations in mind we carried out an exhaustive search for D, τ, and the start and end of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA translation, to find the set of parameters minimizing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000596.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> error (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s015">Figure S15</xref>); the source term is set to 0 before the start and after the end of translation. A well-fitting model could only be found if additionally the diffusion constant was allowed to change during developmental time. The best match to our data is obtained for models where (i) the source is active only during n.c. 6–12, (ii) degradation is essentially constant with τ∼100–140 min, and, (iii) the diffusion constant (initially set to D∼3 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) decreases sharply to 0 at n.c. 11–12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g009">Figure 9C–D</xref>) (a decrease to a small value, e.g. 0.3 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, instead of 0 yields an even better fit). The <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000596.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of this model is approximately one half of the classic SDD with realistic source.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of the source geometry on the protein gradients, we replaced our measured source by a point source localized at the anterior pole, and repeated the parameter search by varying D, τ, and the start and stop times for translation. The best fit in this scenario deviates substantially from the measured gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g009">Figure 9D</xref>), mostly because simulations tend to overestimate the steepness of the gradient close to x/L = 0. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000596.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of this model is 2 times larger than the best extended SDD model with a realistic source.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of GFP maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s014">Figure S14</xref>), <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000596.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in equation (1) represented immature Bcd-GFP and we used an additional reaction-diffusion equation for the mature species without the source (ρ) term, but including a conversion term <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000596.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the immature to mature species with rate <italic>k</italic>.</p>
<p>We emphasize that we employ these simulations for the express purpose of exploring the potential of disparate mRNA geometries to impact protein gradient formation. Our simulations represent coarse-grained descriptions of all processes that might impact protein production, stability, and diffusion. Multiple events could influence protein movement, such as advective transport, nuclear import/export dynamics, and/or changes in numbers or affinities of Bcd binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Coppey1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Hecht1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Sample1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Lucchetta1">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-OchoaEspinosa1">[58]</xref>. As such, our model does not distinguish between these, and thus it does not explicitly support the notion that Bcd movement occurs only via thermally driven random molecular motion.</p>
<p>Likewise, within our model, protein production and stability are bound by two assumptions: first, that translation occurs from particles in proportion to their measured fluorescence intensities; and second, that nuclear Bcd-GFP gradients at all times reflect rescaled versions of the underlying cytoplasmic gradient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Gregor1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Grimm2">[40]</xref>. Because we observe nuclear accumulation of Bcd-GFP beginning at n.c. 6, it is unsurprising that we obtained better fits in simulations where protein production does not begin immediately upon fertilization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s015">Figure S15</xref>). However, absent additional data between n.c. 1 and 5, we cannot advocate that translation of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA necessarily begins at a later time point, although this would be consistent with previous proposals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Salles1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Similarly, at late blastoderm, simulating an apparent gradient decay while preserving the gradient shape requires that both production and effective diffusion decrease (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000596.s015">Figure S15</xref>). However, we do not conclude that either production or diffusion actually slow over time, as our model does not explicitly incorporate any mechanisms that could in principle affect the distribution of protein among nuclei (e.g., the geometric increase in the number of nuclei, Bcd trapping within local nuclear neighborhoods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Hecht1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000596-Sample1">[53]</xref>, or the possibility that the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio of Bcd in an equilibrated nucleus could change over time).</p>

<p>Particle detection criteria. Each panel shows a histogram of the balanced difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filter values used to detect candidate particles (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) from n.c. 3 to late n.c. 14. High values on <italic>x</italic>-axis correspond to particle candidates at very high contrast and thus high signal-to-noise ratio; low values correspond to dim particle candidates barely different from the background. Each line denotes analysis of one embryo. Red lines: the histograms for embryo posteriors. Essentially no candidates are detected for which the filter value exceeds ∼150 (this was used as the detection threshold for all embryos in our method; note the log scale on the <italic>x</italic>-axis). For smaller values of the threshold the number of candidates would explode as the detection algorithm starts picking up noise (note the sharp rise for small filter values). Blue lines: the histograms for embryo anteriors. For low filter values, the same explosion in noise detections is observed as in the posteriors. However, there is a clear excess of signal at high filter values due to true mRNA particle detections (the peak in the histograms above ∼150). Cyan lines: the histogram of filter values for embryo anteriors for only those particle candidates that are detected on at least 2 <italic>z</italic>-slices. This is one of the additional criteria used in our particle detection procedure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) that clearly excludes the explosive growth in false positives for low filter values but retains all detections at high filter values (note the overlap of blue and cyan curves for high filter values).</p>

(A) The starting and stopping times of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA translation, T<sub>Src</sub><sup>off</sup> and T<sub>Src</sub><sup>on</sup> (<italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axes, respectively, in nuclear cycles), are varied for 4 scenarios, where diffusion is either always on or drops to zero in n.c. 11, 12, or 13 as denoted in each quadrant of (A). For each choice of these three timing parameters, we look for the best values for parameters D and τ. (B) D and τ search for T<sub>Diff</sub><sup>off</sup> = 12, T<sub>Src</sub><sup>on</sup> = 7, T<sub>Src</sub><sup>off</sup> = 13. The best fits are obtained with D = 3.1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s and τ = 100 min; these values are used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000596-g009">Figure 9</xref>.</p>
