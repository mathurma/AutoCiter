<p>The formation of a p45-p75 heterodimer overrides p75â€™s inhibition of nerve regeneration by stopping p75 homodimers from forming and creating a complex with the Nogo receptor.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The p75 neurotrophin receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is required as a co-receptor for the Nogo receptor (NgR) to mediate the activity of myelin-associated inhibitors such as Nogo, MAG, and OMgp. p45/NRH2/PLAIDD is a p75 homologue and contains a death domain (DD). Here we report that p45 markedly interferes with the function of p75 as a co-receptor for NgR. P45 forms heterodimers with p75 and thereby blocks RhoA activation and inhibition of neurite outgrowth induced by myelin-associated inhibitors. p45 binds p75 through both its transmembrane (TM) domain and DD. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we have determined the three-dimensional NMR solution structure of the intracellular domain of p45 and characterized its interaction with p75. We have identified the residues involved in such interaction by NMR and co-immunoprecipitation. The DD of p45 binds the DD of p75 by electrostatic interactions. In addition, previous reports suggested that Cys257 in the p75 TM domain is required for signaling. We found that the interaction of the cysteine 58 of p45 with the cysteine 257 of p75 within the TM domain is necessary for p45–p75 heterodimerization. These results suggest a mechanism involving both the TM domain and the DD of p45 to regulate p75-mediated signaling.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Injuries to the brain and spinal cord often result in paralysis due to the fact that the injured nerves cannot regrow to reach their normal targets and carry out their functions. At the injury sites, there are proteins released from the damaged myelin that bind the Nogo receptor (NgR) on the nerve and inhibit its regeneration. The NgR needs to form a complex with the p75 neurotrophin receptor in order to mediate this inhibitory signal. Here we found that p45, a homologue of p75, can also bind to p75 and block its inhibitory activity when overexpressed. To perform its function, p75 needs to dimerize through both its transmembrane and intracellular domains, facilitating the recruitment of several proteins. Our structural and functional studies show that p45 binds specifically to conserved regions in the p75 transmembrane and the intracellular domain and that this blocks p75 dimerization along with its downstream signaling. Thus, this study demonstrates that altering the oligomerization of p75 is a good strategy to override p75's inhibitory effects on nerve regeneration, and it opens the door for the design of specific p75 inhibitors for therapeutic applications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The neurotrophin receptor p75 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily and has four extracellular cysteine rich domains, a single transmembrane (TM) domain, and an intracellular domain (ICD) comprising a juxtamembrane and a death domain (DD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Dechant1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Yamashita1">[5]</xref>. Depending on co-receptor partners and cellular contexts, p75 may play seemingly opposing effects in multiple systems. For example, p75 interacts with Trk receptors to promote neurotrophin-dependent nerve growth. In contrast, p75 has been shown to play a role in apoptosis when binding to pro-neurotrophins and with the co-receptor sortilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Nykjaer1">[4]</xref>. In addition, p75 inhibits nerve growth mediated by myelin-associated inhibitors via functioning in part as a co-receptor for the GPI-linked neuronal Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Fournier1">[6]</xref> or another non-NgR molecule that is yet to be identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Zheng1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Benson1">[8]</xref>. Elucidation of the mechanisms that modulate p75-mediated signaling may increase our understanding of neural development and nerve injury.</p>
<p>Upon nerve injury in adult mammals, factors at the injury site such as myelin-associated inhibitors inhibit regeneration of injured axons, resulting in permanent disability. Axon regeneration is blocked by the presence of multiple types of nerve growth inhibitors, such as myelin-associated inhibitors from damaged myelins, chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans, and repulsive axon-guidance molecules expressed by reactive glial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Filbin1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Schweigreiter1">[12]</xref>. The structurally dissimilar myelin-associated inhibitors Nogo66, MAG, and OMgp inhibit axon growth by binding to the NgR, a GPI-linked protein, which then transduces the inhibitory signal into the cell by binding to co-receptors with intracellular signaling domains, such as p75 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Wong1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Wang1">[14]</xref> or TROY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Shao1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Park1">[16]</xref>. LINGO-1 also plays a role in NgR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Mi1">[17]</xref>. Downstream from their receptor binding, these myelin inhibitors trigger inhibition of axonal growth through the activation of the small GTPase Rho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Yamashita2">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Conrad1">[21]</xref> in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Sivasankaran1">[22]</xref>. Targeting this complex has been described to lead to the promotion of neurite outgrowth, oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation, and inhibition of cell death.</p>
<p>p45 is highly homologous in sequence to p75. It is also called neurotrophin receptor homologue 2 (NRH2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Murray1">[25]</xref>, neurotrophin receptor alike DD protein (NRADD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Wang2">[24]</xref>, or p75-like apoptosis inducing DD protein (PLAIDD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Frankowski1">[23]</xref>. P45 displays strong sequence similarity to p75 in the TM, juxtamembrane, and DD regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Kanning1">[26]</xref>. P45 contains a truncated and short extracellular domain (ECD) with no neurotrophin binding domain.</p>
<p>It has been shown previously that p45 associates with p75 and with TrkA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Frankowski1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Murray1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Kim1">[27]</xref>. In addition, p45 participates in the trafficking of sortilin to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Kim1">[27]</xref>. However, its role in other p75-regulated signaling pathways has not been studied. In this study, we have explored the modulation of p75/NgR signaling. The results indicate that p45 heterodimerizes with p75 and, thereby, impedes the formation of p75 homodimer that is required for the p75/NgR complex formation and its downstream activation of RhoA GTPase. In addition, we found that p45 binds p75 through both the TM and the ICDs. Furthermore, we showed that a cysteine–cysteine interaction within the TM domain of p45 and p75 is required for stabilization of their heterodimer formation. The results reveal a new mechanism of modulating p75-mediated inhibitory signaling via heterodimer formation with a member of the TNFR superfamily such as p45.</p>

<title>p45 Forms a Stable Complex with p75 and Is Up-Regulated upon Nerve Injury</title>
<p>p45 contains a DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Because the function of DDs is to bind the DD of other members of the DD superfamily in order to transduce signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Park2">[28]</xref>, we investigated whether p45 can interact with other members of the DD superfamily, such as p75, FADD, TNFR1, and Fas. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, p45 can be co-immunoprecipitated with p75 or FADD when co-expressed in 293 cells, but not with caspase-8, Fas, or TNFR1. Recently we characterized the interaction of p45 with FADD and its role upon spinal cord injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Sung1">[29]</xref>. In the present study, we focus on the interaction of p45 with p75.</p>

V5-tagged TNFR1, human Fas, mouse Fas, p75, FADD, or Caspase-8 was transfected into CrmA/Flag-p45/293 stable cells. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-V5 antibodies. (C) P7 cerebellum extracts were immunprecipitated with anti-p75 ECD antibody (9651) or anti-p45 ECD antibody (6750) followed by immnuoblotting with anti-p75 antibody (Buster). T, total lysate. (D) Western blotting analysis of p45 and p75 expression in the brain, spinal cord, and DRG of P0 and adult mice. (E) Increased expression of p45 and p75 in the spinal cord and sciatic nerve following sciatic nerve injury. (Top) Spinal cord sections were immunostained with anti-p45 or -p75 antibodies. p45 and p75 immunoreactivities were markedly increased in the ipsilateral side as compared to the contralateral side. Higher magnification indicated that expression of p45 and p75 is increased in motor neurons. (F) Longitudinal sections of crushed and uncrushed sciatic nerves were immunostained with antibodies against p45, p75, or neurofilament. The levels of p45 and p75 were markedly increased in the distal (D) portion of sciatic nerves as compared to the proximal (P) end and the uncrushed (UC) nerve.</p>

<p>p45 and p75 share a high degree of amino acid similarity in their TM domain (94%), including conserved cysteine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Vilar1">[30]</xref>, and the ICD (50%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). However, the ECD of p45 is short and has no binding sites for neurotrophins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). p45 and p75 are expressed in both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Kanning1">[26]</xref>. We found that p75 and p45 form an immunocomplex in cerebellum extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The expression level of p45 is high in embryonic but is significantly reduced in adult tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). However, p45 is up-regulated after sciatic nerve injury in the spinal cord and sciatic nerve in a similar fashion as p75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g001">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Because p45 shares a similar protein sequence with p75 and has similar up-regulated expression patterns with p75 after injury, we decided to investigate whether p45 regulates signaling mechanisms involving p75.</p>

<title>p45 Interferes with p75/NgR Signaling</title>
<p>p75 mediates nerve growth inhibition by myelin-associated inhibitors via functioning in part as a co-receptor for GPI-linked neuronal NgR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Fournier1">[6]</xref>. Because p45 and p75 form a stable complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), we investigated whether p45 interferes with or enhances the formation of the complex between p75 and NgR and subsequent signaling through the p75/NgR complex. When HEK293 cells were co-transfected with p75 and Flag-tagged human NgR (Flag-hNgR) expression constructs followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-p75ICD antibodies, we found that p45 markedly reduced the levels of complex formation between p75 and NgR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and it does in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As a control, p45 is not able to bind to NgR directly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To further characterize the domains of p45 involved in such inhibition, we made several deletion constructs of p45 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s012">Table S1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s002">Figure S2</xref>, both p45 intracellular and TM domains are necessary for p45 inhibition of p75/NgR complex formation.</p>

<title>p45 interferes with the p75-NgR interaction and signaling.</title>
<p>(A) Lysates from HEK293 cells co-transfected with vectors expressing p45, p75, and Flag-tagged human NogoR (Flag-hNgR) were immunoprecipitated with anti-p75 antibodies and probed with anti-Flag antibodies. The results showed that p75 and hNgR form a complex and presence of p45 reduces the formation of p75/hNgR complex. (B) Co-transfection with varying amount of p45-expressing vectors markedly reduced p75/hNgR complex formation in a concentration-dependent fashion. (C) Quantification of the increase of RhoA activity after MAG-Fc treatment. In wild-type (WT) CGN cultures, when treated with MAG-Fc, the RhoA activity increased by 50%. However, in CGN cultures derived from Thy1-p45 transgenic mice, the increase in RhoA activity induced by MAG-Fc treatment is completely abolished. The value is expressed as percent over control. The value is derived from three independent experiments. * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Student's <italic>t</italic> test.

<p>We examined the possibility that p45 would antagonize signaling through the p75/NgR complex. Previous results demonstrated that p75 is required for MAG-induced RhoA activation through NgR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Yamashita4">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Dubreuil1">[31]</xref>. RhoA activation is necessary for neurite outgrowth inhibition mediated by myelin-associated inhibitors. Thus, we examined whether overexpression of p45 blunts signaling through the p75/NgR complex. Postnatal day 7 (P7) cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) that express low levels of endogenous p45 were transfected with full-length, capped p45 RNAs containing poly(A) tails generated by an <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription system. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s003">Figure S3A</xref>, the level of p45 protein was markedly elevated 24 h following RNA transfection. The cultures were then serum-starved and treated with Fc or MAG-Fc proteins. The level of activated RhoA was measured. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s003">Figure S3B</xref>, overexpression of p45 blocks MAG-Fc–induced RhoA activation. We also quantitatively measured RhoA activation using the G-LISA kit (Cytoskeleton Inc.) on CGN cultures from wild-type mice and Thy1-p45 transgenic mice that consistently overexpress p45 under a Thy1 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Sung1">[29]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, MAG-Fc treatment of the WT CGNs induced 50% increase in the RhoA activity, whereas the MAG-Fc–induced RhoA activation is completely abolished in Thy1-p45 CGNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s012">Table S1</xref>). These results suggest that p45 is capable of effectively blocking RhoA activation through the p75/NgR complex. We then examined whether overexpression of p45 prevents neurite outgrowth inhibition induced by Nogo66, MAG, or CNS myelin. P7 CGNs were transfected with p45 RNAs, plated onto dishes previously coated with different substrates, and allowed to grow overnight. The cultures were double immunostained with antibodies against p45 (green) and neurotubulin (TuJ1, red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The neurite length of control CGNs and transfected CGNs that display increased p45-immunoreactivity over control CGNs was measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, neurite outgrowth inhibition elicited by Nogo66 is alleviated by p45 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s012">Table S1</xref>). Similarly, p45 overexpression significantly promotes neurite outgrowth that was otherwise inhibited when cultured on dishes coated with CNS myelin or MAG-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).

<title>Dimerization of p75DD in Solution</title>
<p>To understand the mechanism by which the p75–p45 interaction regulates p75-dependent signaling, we first characterized biophysically the ICD domain of p75. Because the DD of p75 is a protein–protein interaction motif and often is involved in functionally essential homo- and hetero-associations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Sandu1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Huang1">[40]</xref>, we studied the oligomerization behavior of p75ICD comprising residues 290–418. We used gel filtration chromatography of purified p75ICD to analyze the oligomerization state of p75ICD in phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. Purification of p75ICD from bacteria yielded two peaks in the elution profile of gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, black lines) with the presence of some high molecular weight aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, asterisk). After running SDS-PAGE of the peak fractions in reducing and nonreducing conditions, we found that the elution fraction I corresponds to a covalently disulfide bond dimer and fraction II to a monomer molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). When we purified p75ICD with the presence of DTT, a single peak was observed that eluted between the monomer and dimer peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The same behavior is observed in the presence of iodoacetamide, which blocks free cysteines, in the lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The estimated molecular weight of this fraction from the gel filtration yields a mass of 35 kDa (p75ICD MW is 16 kDa), suggesting the presence of a dimer. We carried out an analytical ultracentrifugation analysis of purified p75ICD in the presence of DTT, using equilibrium sedimentation and velocity experiments of recombinant p75ICD in the same buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Our ultracentrifugation confirms that p75ICD behaves in solution as a single species with a molecular weight of 30.7 kDa, close to the theoretical dimer of p75ICD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g003">Figure 3C</xref> legend). Altogether, we conclude that p75ICD is a noncovalent dimer that during purification or in oxidative conditions dimerizes through a disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Recently the crystal structure of a covalent disulfide p75ICD dimer, purified from bacteria in oxidative conditions (in the presence of DTNB), has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Qu1">[41]</xref>. The dimer is mediated by a covalent disulfide bond through Cys379. We think that the dimer found in this work is the same dimer, because when we made p75-C379A mutant, gel filtration gives a monomer peak (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Whether this covalent disulfide dimer is formed in the reducing conditions encountered inside cells and what its biological function is need to be further investigated.</p>

<title>p75ICD Dimer Interface Mapping by NMR</title>

The appearance of only one peak suggests a slow monomer–dimer equilibrium for NMR time scale measurements. This pattern of change is indicative of a weak binding that we can estimate from plotting changes in the chemical shift of interface residues. We obtained a K<sub>d</sub> of ∼100 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Such low binding affinities are typically observed for DD-type interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Bang1">[44]</xref>. Residues with the most pronounced chemical shift changes—that is, L360, E363, Q367, H370, D372, F374, T375, C379, H376, E377, A383, L384, L385, and W388, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g004">Figure 4A</xref>)—were then mapped onto the reported NMR structure of p75ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Liepinsh1">[45]</xref>. These residues are all located on one side of the DD, in particular within helices α3 and α4. Together with the presence of only one TROSY cross-peak per <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H moiety, these results suggest the formation of a symmetrical p75-DD homodimer. Because helices α3 and α4 contain charged amino acid residues, the homodimer formation may be in part due to electrostatic interactions. Recently the crystal structure of an asymmetrical dimer of p75-DD has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Qu1">[41]</xref>. In that structure, R404 from monomer A interacts with S373, H376, and E377 of monomer B. In our NMR titration study, chemical shift changes of R404 are not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), although changes in the chemical shift of S373 (small) and E377 and H376 (big) are clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). These results suggest that in solution the symmetrical dimer is favored, although we cannot exclude the possibility that p75ICD with different conformations is present in solution.

<p>To further characterize and confirm the homodimer interface in the full-length p75, we made p75 mutant constructs containing amino acid replacements at different residues, which showed high concentration-dependent chemical shift changes in the NMR studies of p75ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The emphasis of the amino acid replacements was charge changes due to the potential electrostatic nature of the interaction (D372R, H376E, and E377R; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Wild-type or mutant p75 constructs were co-transfected with a Flag-tagged construct that contained only the TM domain and the ICD of p75 (Flag-ΔECD-p75) in HEK293 cells. The presence of the p75 dimers was measured by co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody and detection of full-length p75 with an anti-p75 antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g003">Figure 3G</xref>, wild-type p75 forms a dimer with Flag-ΔECD-p75. In comparison to wild-type p75, the p75 mutant E377R shows a significant decrease in dimer formation, suggesting the importance of this residue and the negative charge in the homodimer interface. In contrast, the mutant H376E has a stronger binding than wild-type p75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). The role of H376E mutation in dimer formation suggests that the dimer formation could be dependent on the ionization of H376 and then on the pH of the solution. The fact the mutation H376E favors the dimerization suggests that an electrostatic interaction plays a role in homodimerization.</p>

<title>NgR Interaction Prefers the Presence of p75 Dimers Stabilized by DD and Cys257</title>
<p>Very little is known about how p75 and NgR interact from a structural point of view. To shed light on this and to understand how p45 modulates p75/NgR signaling, we first investigated how p75 and NgR interact with each other. We used the following p75 constructs: (1) p75 dimerization mutants E377R, D372R, and H376E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g004">Figure 4</xref>), which exhibit a significant reduction or increase of p75 homodimer formation, and (2) p75-C257A, a mutant in the TM domain of p75, which although able to form dimers, is not functional upon NGF binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Vilar1">[30]</xref>. When co-transfected, mutants E377R and D372R showed less interaction with NgR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, mutant H376E, which promotes p75 homodimer formation, displayed a significant increase in its capability to bind NgR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s012">Table S1</xref>). We then determined whether C257 plays a role in the interaction with NgR. When co-transfected with NgR, the p75-C257A/NgR interaction was markedly impaired, although some interaction was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s012">Table S1</xref>). When we performed the co-immunoprecipitation of NgR with p75-wt and ran a nonreducing SDS-PAGE, we found the majority of p75-wts that were co-immunoprecipitated with NgR were in the form of dimers, whereas NgR co-immunoprecipitated a small and similar amount of p75-wt and p75-C257A in the form of monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This suggests that NgR and p75 form a complex that is better stabilized with p75-wt than with p75-C257A. In addition, because p75-C257A is still able to form dimers as inferred by crosslinking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Vilar1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Sykes1">[46]</xref>, these results suggest that p75-wt dimers mediated by C257 have a preferred conformation for binding to NgR.</p>

<title>NMR Solution Structure of p45ICD</title>
<p>Our data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and previous published data from other authors have mapped the interaction between p45 and p75 to the TM and the ICD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Kim1">[27]</xref>. To map the binding interface of p45 and p75 ICDs, first we solved the three-dimensional solution structure of mouse p45ICD by NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The NMR studies showed that p45ICD contains a flexible domain at the N terminus (residues 75–140) that could not be assigned because they display limited chemical shift dispersions, and a folded domain at the C terminus (141–218) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s007">Figure S7</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g006">Figure 6A</xref> presents the three-dimensional NMR structure of the folded DD domain obtained from the experimental restraints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s013">Table S2</xref>). The regions with a secondary structure are the best defined and typical for a DD, and p45DD is composed of six α-helix disposed in a specific orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) comprising residues 141–147 (α1), 154–167 (α2), 169–180 (α3), 182–190 (α4), 200–207 (α5), and 212–218 (α6). A DALI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Holm1">[47]</xref> search revealed p75DD as the closest structural relative with an rmsd of 2.7 Å, followed by other members of the DD family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s014">Table S3</xref>). The DD of p75 and p45 share many structural features and the same arrangement of all the six α-helices, which is not surprising as p75DD and p45DD are homologues. Only the length of the loop between α1 and α2 is longer in p45DD because of an insertion of four amino acid residues in this segment. When compared with p75DD, the longer loop reorients α1 in respect to α2 and α3 and brings residue E153 of the loop in close neighborhood to other negative charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Together with some additional amino acid residue differences, this small structural reorientation changes significantly the charge distribution around helix α3 of p45DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The negative charged region of p45DD is formed by E153, E160, E170, E173, and D178. In the equivalent region of p75DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), the negative charged E363, E369, D372, and E377 are located in a more balanced environment surrounded by positive charged residues R358, H370, and H376, which are positively charged depending of their specific pk<sub>a</sub>.</p>

<p>Another interesting feature of the sequence of p45DD is the presence of the RxDΦ motif (x, any residues; Φ, a hydrophobic residue) at the beginning of helix α6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), which is typically observed in death effector domains (DEDs), such as the DED from PEA-15, FADD, Caspase-8, and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Carrington1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Hill1">[49]</xref>. In DEDs, this motif has been suggested to stabilize the DED fold, because it participates in a salt-bridged network between the arginine side chain and the aspartic acid side chain of the RxDΦ motif, and a glutamic acid side chain located in the helix α2 (for instance, R72, D74, and E19 in FADD-DED) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Carrington1">[48]</xref>. Such a charged network is also present in the three-dimensional structure of p45DD between residues R211, D213, and E160, as indicated by the large downfield shift of the Hε for R211 of p45, indicative of a charged interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, the asterisk indicates the downshift of R211). A similar shift has been observed for R72 of FADD-DED <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Carrington1">[48]</xref>. The presence of this salt bridge is an unexpected feature of p45DD, because this motif is not found in any other DD. p75DD has a similar RxDΦ sequence, RADI (highlighted in black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), and from this argument, Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Park3">[50]</xref> has suggested that p75DD is a DED, not a DD. However, in our hands, we did not see a large shift of the arginine of p75 by NMR, like in p45 and in PEA, suggesting that maybe this arginine is not forming a salt bridge. In fact, in the amino acid sequence of p75, the analogue residue for E160 involved in the salt bridge in p45 is a His residue (H217) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Nevertheless, the possibility that p45 and p75 DDs are actually DEDs or a chameleon between DD and DED should be considered in future research.</p>

<title>Mapping the p75DD/p45DD Interface Interaction by NMR</title>
<p>We then started the characterization of the p75ICD–p45ICD interaction.

To further characterize the interaction between p45DD and p75DD in the corresponding full-length proteins, p45 point mutations at some residues with significant chemical shift changes were constructed (i.e., H164E, E173R, C177H, D178A, and D178R).

Wild-type p45 formed a complex with p75.

NMR experiments with purified p45 mutants showed that they were well folded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s009">Figure S9</xref>). These data are consistent with the structural studies and suggest that p45 forms a complex with p75 through its helix α3 of the DD. Next, the amino acid residues in p75ICD that interact with p45ICD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s004">Figure S4</xref>) were characterized. In the chemical shift perturbation experiment, p45ICD is titrated against 10 µM of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled p75DD. Chemical shift changes on p75DD are observed in amino acid residues located close to and on helix α3 of p75DD (i.e., L360, E363, Q367, H370, D372, F374, T375, H376, E377, A378, A383, L384, L385, W388), indicating helix α3 is the binding site for p45DD on p75DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The effect on the interaction between p45 and p75 by some of the amino acid replacements located in this side of p75DD (D372R, H376E, and E377R) supports the NMR-derived interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). A comparison of the p45DD binding site on p75DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) with the p75DD homodimer binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) shows that the two sites overlap. The presence of an overlapping binding site on p75 suggests that p45 is binding to a monomeric p75 by forming a heterodimer. We tried to purify a stable complex between p75ICD and p45ICD by gel filtration, but we were unsuccessful. It could be possible that p45ICD interaction inhibits the formation of p75 dimers or multimers, but the interaction is too weak to yield sufficient p75/p45 heterodimers.</p>

<title>p45DD Forms a Heterodimer with p75DD by Breaking the p75DD Dimer</title>
<p>The presence of a partially overlapping binding site on p75DD for homodimerization with p75DD and heterodimerization with p45DD suggests that p45DD may break a p75DD dimer by competition. To get insights into this potential mechanism, the p45ICD-induced chemical shift perturbations of p75ICD were measured at high (dimeric) and low (monomeric) concentrations of p75ICD. p45ICD binds p75ICD even at high p75ICD concentrations, where p75ICD is mainly homodimeric (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s006">Figure S6</xref>). As demonstrated above, A378 is participating in the homodimer interface of p75DD because chemical shift differences between low and high concentrated p75ICD were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s010">Figure S10</xref>). However, the addition of p45ICD at low concentrations of p75ICD did not result in any chemical shift changes of A378, indicating that A378 is not part of the p45–p75 binding site. In contrast, the addition of p45ICD at a high (dimeric) concentration of p75ICD generated chemical shift perturbations of the <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H moiety of A378 to values identical to p75ICD at a low (monomeric) concentration in absence of p45ICD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Our explanation of these findings is as follows. Although A378 is participating in p75DD homodimer formation, it is not involved in p45DD binding. However, the presence of p45 breaks the p75 dimer and forms a p45–p75 heterodimer and thus shifts A378 from a dimeric environment to a monomeric environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s010">Figure S10</xref>).</p>
<p>Complementary information about the breaking of a p75 homodimer into a p45–p75 heterodimer can be extracted by the p75ICD- and p45ICD-dependent chemical shift perturbations of T375. T375 has different chemical shifts at high and low concentrations of p75ICD, indicative of its participation in the p75DD homodimer formation. However, upon the addition of p45DD, the chemical shifts of T375 move to a new position that is independent of the p75ICD concentration (at least at the concentration window studied here; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s010">Figure S10</xref>). This result suggests that T375 is involved in both p45DD and p75DD binding. Furthermore, the data indicate that p45 is able to compete with the p75DD homodimer by the formation of a p45DD–p75DD heterodimer. Other residues of p75 showed similar behavior, suggesting that p45DD is able to break the relatively weak p75DD homodimer by forming a heterodimer p45DD–p75DD.</p>

<title>p75 and p45 Heterodimerize Through Their TM Domain by p75–C257/p45–C58 Interaction</title>
<p>The results from above suggest that the p45 modulation of p75 signaling is increased with the presence of the TM domain of p45. The TM domain of p75 self-associates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Vilar1">[30]</xref>. Because the TM domain of p45 is highly homologous to p75-TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), we asked if p45-TM was able to bind p75 through its TM. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted in HEK293 cells transfected with p75 wt and p45, and analysis in nonreducing SDS-PAGE showed a band recognized by both p75 and p45 antibodies and with a molecular weight corresponding to a heterodimer p75–p45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). This band was lost when p75-C257A was co-transfected with p45. These results suggest that p75 and p45 can form a heterodimer through C257 from p75 and another cysteine residue from p45. Due to the homology in the TM domain, we mutated the cysteine equivalent in p45, Cys58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g007">Figure 7E</xref>, p45-C58A did not form a complex with wt p75. Only when the blot was exposed longer did we see an interaction between p45 and p75, presumably by interaction through their intracellular DDs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The presented biophysical and biological characterization of p45 and p75 interactions shows that a p45–p75 heterodimer is formed, using both the TM and the ICDs. p45 binding to p75 inhibits RhoA activation and increases neurite outgrowth. In light of these data, the following mechanistic model of p45 action is proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g008">Figure 8</xref>). NgR binding to p75 recruits intracellular proteins that activate RhoA signaling. In the presence of p45, however, p45–p75 heterodimers are formed, stabilized by the Cys257–Cys58 interaction within the TM domain and enhanced by the interaction of cytoplasmic domains. In this heterodimer conformation, the interaction of NgR with p75 is impaired and this translates into diminished RhoA signaling.</p>

<title>Model illustrating p45 inhibition of p75/NgR signaling.</title>
<p>p75 is a constitutive dimer in the membrane, stabilized by the Cys257 at the TM domain, where it can bind to NgR complex and activate RhoA signaling and axonal growth collapse. When p45 binds to p75 through both the TM domain (Cys257–Cys58) and DD interactions, p75 downstream signaling is inhibited.</p>

<p>p45 interaction with p75 has been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Frankowski1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Kim1">[27]</xref>. However, a prominent role of the TM domain in that interaction was not suggested. The interaction between p45 and p75 is decreased by a deletion of the p75ICD, but not entirely blocked, suggesting that the TM domain also has a prominent role in the p75/p45 interaction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g003">figure 3C</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Kim1">[27]</xref>). It is also interesting to note that p45 has been suggested previously to interact with TrkA and modulate its activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Murray1">[25]</xref>. In that publication, the authors made several deletion constructs of p45 and suggested that the TM domain of p45 was needed for the p45–TrkA interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Murray1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Esposito1">[51]</xref>. That observation, together with our data, suggests that the TM domains of neurotrophin receptors are starting to be recognized as very important for their function.</p>
<p>One important question that remains to be answered is where and how in the cell the p45/p75 heterodimer could be formed. It is difficult to imagine that p45 could break a covalently formed p75 homodimer, however free monomeric p75 is present in the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Vilar1">[30]</xref>. One possibility is that the heterodimer is formed in the ER during the translation and maturation of both proteins. Kim et al. have shown that p45 is involved in the trafficking of sortilin to the plasma membrane, indicating that the p45/sortilin interaction takes place in the ER membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Kim1">[27]</xref>. The p75/p45 interaction could also occur in the ER membrane during receptor maturation. This implies that it requires the synthesis of new proteins for p45 activity, and only when new p75 and p45 molecules are synthesized will they have the opportunity to form the heterodimers. Such a situation is plausible because both p75 and p45 are up-regulated upon nerve injury and they are expressed in the same cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s011">Figure S11</xref>). In that situation, at the plasma membrane, it could be possible to have different oligomers of p75—namely, p75 monomers, p75 homodimers, and p75/p45 heterodimers. The function of those species may be different, contributing to the complexity of p75 signaling.</p>
<p>We showed that p75ICD exists in a monomer–dimer equilibrium mediated by electrostatic interactions, and we postulate that p75 dimerization is pH-dependent or promoted by the presence of counterions, like phosphate in our buffer. This could reconcile the contradictory results reported by previous studies of p75ICD structure. NMR structural studies detected only the monomeric p75ICD species at a pH in the range of 6–7 and in plain water with no counterions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Liepinsh1">[45]</xref>, solution conditions in which p75ICD will not be favored to self-associate. In contrast, X-ray structures of p75ICD revealed a dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Qu1">[41]</xref>, but the buffers used for crystallization were at or above pH 7.0 and contained 1.1–1.4 M sodium malonate or sodium citrate, as stabilizing counterions. Thus, we conclude that p75 dimerization is dependent on the pH and the presence of counterions.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare the homo- and hetero-dimeric interactions found here with other protein oligomerizations that involve DDs and DEDs. Although DDs and DEDs were first identified in proteins that mediate programmed cell death, they are now recognized to act as protein interaction domains in a variety of cellular signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Park2">[28]</xref>. In the DD subfamily, low sequence homology produces diverse interaction surfaces, enabling binding specificity within a subfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Ferrao1">[52]</xref>. Protein–protein interactions of DDs have been thereby thought to be predominantly homotypic among different adaptors, as shown here for p75DD homodimer formation, although some examples of heterotypic interactions have been demonstrated (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Park2">[28]</xref>), including the p45–p75 presented here. These results suggest that DDs employ diverse mechanisms for interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Xiao1">[53]</xref>. They can be classified into three types of interactions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Ferrao1">[52]</xref>). Type I interaction is exemplified by the procaspase-9 CARD:Apaf-1 CARD complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Qin1">[54]</xref>, whereas the type II interaction is represented by the Pelle DD:Tube DD complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Xiao1">[53]</xref>, and the type III interaction is proposed to exist in the Fas DD:FADD DD complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Wang3">[55]</xref>. p75 and p45 DD interaction appears symmetrical based on chemical shift data, but one cannot exclude an asymmetrical interaction that uses the same regions of the interface; as p75 is a homodimer and p45 and p75 binding sites overlap only in parts, the p45–p75 interaction could not be totally symmetric. Because p75DD interacts with itself through residues located between helices α-3 and the loop connecting α-3 and α-4, they belong to a type III interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Carrington1">[48]</xref>. The asymmetric type I, II, and III interactions between DDs are conserved in all current structures of oligomeric DD signaling complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Wang3">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Park4">[57]</xref>. These interactions likely represent the predominant mechanism of DD polymerization.</p>
<p>Here, p45DD acts as an inhibitor of those interactions, shutting off or modulating the p75 signal strength. Interestingly, both p45DD and p75DD are promiscuous and can interact also with other proteins through their DD. Although p75DD is able to interact with downstream targets, such as the CARD of RIP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Khursigara1">[58]</xref>, p45DD appears to interact with FADD, thereby reducing FADD-mediated cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Sung1">[29]</xref>. Recently the regions of p75DD involved in the three different p75 signaling paradigms has been mapped by mutagenesis—namely, apoptosis, NF-κB activation, and Rho signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Charalampopoulos1">[59]</xref>. For p75/p45 heterodimers, p45DD will occupy the region very close to where the CARD domain of RIP-2 is binding to p75DD, according to previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Charalampopoulos1">[59]</xref>. Strikingly, RIP-2 binding to p75 is necessary for Rho-GDI release and RhoA inhibition. The data suggest that p45DD binding to p75 will release RhoGDI and inhibit RhoA activation. This is in agreement with our data that p45 binding to p75 inhibits RhoA activity.</p>
<p>Recently it has been described that p75 could adopt two different conformations, a symmetrical dimer, stabilized by a cysteine disulfide bond, and an asymmetrical dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Qu1">[41]</xref>. The authors proposed that p75 could be in equilibrium between both conformations unless oxidant conditions inside the cell promote the formation of the disulfide bond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Qu1">[41]</xref>. Our NMR data suggest that the symmetrical conformation is the predominant form at least in solution, because interaction between residues from helix 3 and helixes 5–6 are not seen in our conditions. Further investigation will be needed to understand which conformation belongs to the active receptor.</p>
<p>The fact that p45 is able to bind and to block the symmetrical interface suggest a well-designed and potent p75 inhibitor. Apart from the p75 signaling, p45 might play additional roles of an inhibitory nature. In particular, because the DD of p45 appears to be important for p45/p75 interaction and several members of the TNFR family contain DDs such as TNF-R1 or CD95, which have been shown to play important roles in SCI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Demjen1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Davis1">[61]</xref>, it is intriguing to speculate whether p45 may antagonize the activity of some of these receptors upon SCI by binding to their DD domains as well. Thus, the promiscuous structural nature of p45 may facilitate functional recovery after SCI by inhibiting multiple signaling pathways that are detrimental for neuronal survival and nerve regeneration.</p>
<p>In summary, p45 presents an example of a new antagonizing mechanism by which an interaction mediated by the TM and cytoplasmic domains is able to inhibit p75 disulfide dimer formation and function. Such knowledge provides a new glimpse into our understanding of the multiple distinct activities and signaling capabilities of p75.</p>

<title>Structure Calculation</title>
<p>We observed 2,130 NOEs in the NOESY spectra, leading to 1,065 meaningful distance restraints and 372 angle restraints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s013">Table S2</xref>). For the structure calculation, the program CYANA was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Guntert1">[67]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Guntert2">[68]</xref>, followed by restrained energy minimization using the program INSIGHT. CYANA initially generated 100 conformers, and the 20 conformers with the lowest energy were used to represent the three-dimensional NMR structure. The 20 refined conformers showed small residual constraint violations that are compatible with the observed NOEs and the short interatomic distances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s013">Table S2</xref>). Similar energy values were obtained for all 20 conformers. The quality of the structures is reflected by the RMSD values of 0.65 Å relative to the mean coordinates of p45 residues 141–218 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001918.s013">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001918-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The bundle of 20 conformers representing the NMR structure is deposited in the PDB database under accession no. 2IB1.</p>

<title>Transfection and Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Constructs containing NgR, full-length p45 or p75, as well as deletion and amino-acid point mutants were transfected into HEK293 cells by TransFectin transfection reagents (BioRad). Transfected cells were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% DOC, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies described in the text. Samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blots. For quantitative analysis, gel images were analyzed by Image J program (NIH). Statistical analyses and data graph were done using Prism software.</p>

<title>RNA Transfection and Neurite Outgrowth Assay</title>
<p>Full-length p45 RNA with capping at the 5′ end and poly(A) sequences was transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> using the mMessage-mMACHINE kit (Ambion). RNA was transfected into CGNs with the TransMessenger transfection reagent (Qiagen). We found that this protocol achieves 50%–70% transfection efficiency. Neurite outgrowth assay using CGNs was carried out as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Wang1">[14]</xref>.</p>

<title>RhoA Assay</title>
<p>CGN culture was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Wong1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001918-Wang1">[14]</xref>. Briefly, p5–p7 cerebella were isolated from WT and Thy1-p45 mice. Neurons were plated on Poly-D-Lysine–coated six-well tissue culture dishes at the density of 5 million cells per well. Cells are allowed to grow for 48 h and then starved in basal medium eagle (BME, Life Technologies) for 7 h before being treated with preclustered MAG-Fc at the concentration of 2 µg/ml for 15 min. Preclustered human IgG was used as the control. The preclustering is achieved by incubating the MAG-Fc with an anti-human-Fc antibody at a 2:1 molar ratio in BME for 30 min in 37 °C. Cells are then lysed on ice according to the manufacturer's suggestion, and the RhoA assay was performed following the instructions of the G-LISA (absorbance based) kit. The RhoA activity is measured by reading the 490 nm absorbance using a 96-well plate reader. We have also used the Millipore (Upstate) RhoA assay kit for a pull-down of activated RhoA by Western blotting analysis.</p>

<p>p45 does not bind to NgR. A plasmid expressing V5-tagged p45 or V5-tagged p75 were co-transfected in 293T cells with a plasmid encoding for Flag-NgR. Western blots show that p75 and NgR interact upon co-transfection and co-immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody (M2). However, p45 does not co-immunoprecipitate with Flag-NgR, suggesting p45 modulates p75/NgR signaling through p75, not directly interacting with NgR.</p>

<p>Insights into p45–p75 heterodimer formation from NMR. (A) NMR analysis of p45-DD and p75-DD interaction suggests a heterodimer formation. A378, red colored lines represent the cross-peak of A378 in the [<sup>15</sup>N,<sup>1</sup>H] TROSY spectrum at a high concentration of p75ICD (homodimer), and the corresponding cross-peak at a low concentration (monomer) of p75ICD is represented by green dashed lines, respectively. Upon p45ICD addition to a highly concentrated p75ICD sample, the cross-peak of A378 colored as blue lines shifted to the position of the monomer. In contrast, upon p45ICD addition to the sample with low p75ICD concentration, the cross-peak of A378—represented as blue dashed lines—did not shift. These findings indicate that A378 is not part of the p45–p75 interface and that p45 breaks the p75 homodimer. T375, the cross-peaks of T375 in the [<sup>15</sup>N,<sup>1</sup>H]-TROSY spectra at high and low p75ICD concentrations and in the presence and absence of p45ICD are displayed with the same color code as for A378. The addition of p45ICD at high p75ICD concentrations results in a shift of the cross-peak of T375 (red cross-peak to blue cross-peak). The cross-peak of T375 at low p75ICD concentrations is also shifted upon addition of p45ICD (cross-peak represented by green dashed lines to cross-peak represented with blue dashed lines). Because the position of the cross-peak of T375 in the presence of p45 is independent of the p75ICD concentration, T375 appears to be part of the p45–p75 interface as well as part of the p75–p75 interface.</p>
