<abstract>
<p>After decades of using urea as denaturant, the kinetic role of this molecule in the unfolding process is still undefined: does urea actively induce protein unfolding or passively stabilize the unfolded state? By analyzing a set of 30 proteins (representative of all native folds) through extensive molecular dynamics simulations in denaturant (using a range of force-fields), we derived robust rules for urea unfolding that are valid at the proteome level. Irrespective of the protein fold, presence or absence of disulphide bridges, and secondary structure composition, urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of quasi-native proteins, but with a density lower than that of the fully unfolded state. The presence of urea does not alter the spontaneous vibration pattern of proteins. In fact, it reduces the magnitude of such vibrations, leading to a counterintuitive slow down of the atomic-motions that opposes unfolding. Urea stickiness and slow diffusion is, however, crucial for unfolding. Long residence urea molecules placed around the hydrophobic core are crucial to stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Our simulations indicate that although urea does not favor the formation of partially open microstates, it is not a mere spectator of unfolding that simply displaces to the right of the folded←→unfolded equilibrium. On the contrary, urea actively favors unfolding: it selects and stabilizes partially unfolded microstates, slowly driving the protein conformational ensemble far from the native one and also from the conformations sampled during thermal unfolding.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The delicate equilibrium between the folded and functional structure of a protein and its unfolded state is highly dependent on environmental variables such as the solvent. For example the co-solvent urea is a well-known protein denaturant that displaces the equilibrium towards unstructured and non-functional conformations of proteins. However the molecular mechanism behind its ability remains an enigma and the interpretation of the experimental data is still ambiguous. By analyzing a set of representative proteins through extensive molecular dynamics simulations in urea, we provide a robust and consensus picture of the first stages of urea-driven protein unfolding and elucidate the role of urea in accelerating protein unfolding. Our results suggest that urea, thanks to its stickiness and slow diffusion, benefits from the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and stabilizes partially open-states, slowly driving the protein toward unfolding.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Urea is a protein denaturant that has been used for decades in the study of protein folding/unfolding; however, after many years of research the ultimate reasons of the denaturing properties of urea remain elusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Kauzmann1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-England1">[2]</xref>. The dominant paradigm for unfolding (the “direct” mechanism) claims that the denaturant properties of urea are related to its capacity to interact with exposed protein residues more strongly than water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Soper1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>. However, the nature of such a preferential interaction is not so clear. Thus, while some authors suggest that it is mostly electrostatic and related to the formation of direct hydrogen bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Klimov1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-OBrien1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Lim1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Berteotti1">[17]</xref>, others claim that preferential dispersion is the leading term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Hua1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>. It is also unclear whether the major destabilizing effect of urea is related to interaction with the backbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Auton1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Klimov1">[7]</xref> or with side chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Canchi1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Stumpe3">[12]</xref>. In the latter case, there is also discussion regarding the preferential side chains: polar and charged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-OBrien1">[9]</xref> or apolar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-TiradoRives1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Stumpe1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Stumpe3">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>We recently combined multi-replica molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and direct NMR measures of ubiquitin to characterize the “urea unfolded ensemble” of this model protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>. Our results suggest that urea stabilizes flexible over-extended conformations of the protein, which are unlikely to be sampled in the “unfolded” state of aqueous proteins. Extended conformations of the protein with exposed hydrophobic surfaces are more urea-philic than the native globular state, due mostly to extensive London dispersion interactions (the attractive contribution in Van der Waals interactions between instantaneous dipoles) between apolar side chains and urea molecules in the first solvation shell of unfolded conformations. We believe that our results in reference 15 clarify the molecular basis of the effect of urea on the thermodynamics of the folded←→unfolded equilibrium, but unfortunately, they do not provide information on the kinetic role of urea in the unfolding process. In other words: does urea actively induce protein unfolding? Or, on the contrary, does it passively stabilize the unfolded state by selectively binding to unfolded conformations? To analyze this point, we should characterize the effect of urea in the first stages of thermochemical unfolding, when the protein structure is still close to the native conformation and internal residues are not fully exposed. Clearly, a study of this nature presents many difficulties, the most important being that the effect of urea on early stages of unfolding might be dependent on the native structure. Therefore, to obtain conclusions of general validity, all representative protein folds should be addressed. Also, results can be force-field-dependent, so if we aim to obtain robust conclusions, we should perform simulations with a variety of force-fields.</p>
<p>Given the typical kinetics of the folding/unfolding transitions of small globular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Mayor1">[18]</xref>, microsecond (µsec) long simulations should trace the first stages of these processes. In the current work, we investigate the first stages of urea-driven protein unfolding using µsec-long atomistic simulation; to gain universality, we used 30 proteins representative of all protein folds, while to protect our conclusions from force-field-related uncertainties, we used several of the most popular force-fields. The results derived from this study provide a robust and complete picture of the role of urea in destabilizing folded states of proteins, and more importantly, on the molecular mechanisms by means of which urea contributes to accelerating protein unfolding.</p>

<title>Protocol validation using three ultra-representative proteins</title>
<p>We first validated our protocol using three ultra-representative proteins (in bold in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003393-t001">Table 1</xref>), one for each of the main classes in the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Murzin1">[19]</xref>). We monitored the protein stability in three environments: i) in chemical unfolding conditions, in 8M urea and with a mildly high temperature (T = 368K) to speed up the observable effects; ii) in thermal unfolding condition, in water with the same high temperature; this control allowed us to distinguish the effect of urea and temperature on protein unfolding; iii) in water at room temperature as final control. Four force-fields were used (OPLSAA - ON2; CHARMM - C22; AMBER99 - P99 and P99SBILDN) for each system (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for the description of the force-fields used), collecting in total 36 simulations of 1-µsec length each.</p>

<p>Analysis of the trajectories in water at room temperature for the 3 ultra-representative proteins confirmed that current force-fields can accurately represent the native conformation of soluble proteins in the µsec range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Rueda1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Meyer1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Shaw1">[22]</xref>, reproducing the global and local structure of proteins well. The structures in the last segment of the trajectory (and the corresponding ones collected just after equilibration) showed, in general, little structural drift from the experimental conformation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g001">Figure 1</xref>, Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s002">Figures S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s003">S2</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s009">Table S1</xref>). This was noted in the small values of root mean squared deviation (RMSD) from native structure at the end of the simulation (typically around 1.5 Å), and the good preservation of the fold structure (average TMscore around 0.8), the shape descriptors (radius of gyration, RadGyr and solvent accessible surface area, SASA) and the secondary structure (SS) composition. We found only one significant discrepancy: simulation of 1CQY using the C22 force-field showed a non-negligible transition in the 100-ns time scale, leading to the sampling of conformations that were 3 Å away from the experimental structure; see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s002">Figures S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s003">S2</xref>.</p>

<p>Root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) from the starting conformation, radius of gyration (RadGyr), TMscore, solvent accessible surface area (SASA), native secondary structure index (S2) and native contacts index (S3) were calculated in water, urea and hot water in the four force-fields (OPLSAA - ON2; CHARMM - C22; AMBER99 - P99 and last-modified P99SBILDN). Average values and relative standard deviations are calculated in the last 10 ns of the simulation.

<title>Control simulation of thermal unfolding (hot water)</title>
<p>The mild high temperature applied in the simulations in hot water (below water boiling point: T = 368K) significantly enhanced the global fluctuations of the protein (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s003">Figures S2</xref>), while advances in the unfolding were still moderate. Thus, after 1 µsec of MD in hot water, the RMSD from experimental structures reached the range 5–7 Å, and shape descriptors (RadGyr and SASA) indicated a moderate increase in the size of the protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g001">Figure 1</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s010">Table S2</xref>). The fold-architecture started to be corrupted (TMscore values around 0.5), with a moderate loss of native contacts (S3) and native secondary structure (S2 - see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g001">Figure 1</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s011">Table S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Detailed analysis of the 12 simulations (three proteins and four force-fields) provides interesting information on the behavior of the force-fields. In general, the overall picture at the beginning of thermal denaturation of proteins was quite robust to force-field changes. However, we found two clear discrepancies. First, C22 appeared to facilitate unfolding in hot water (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s003">Figure S2</xref>), yielding more flexible structures than those obtained with the other force-fields. Second, in P99SBILDN the 1CQY protein remained fully preserved at the end of the high temperature trajectory. Five independent replicas of the same system with different starting geometries and velocities failed to detect significant unfolding for 1CQY with P99SBILDN. This observation points to a potential problem of over-stabilization of the folded structure for this all-β protein.</p>

<title>The differential effect of urea in the early stages of chemical unfolding</title>
<p>We first analyzed the impact of high concentrations of urea on the three ultra-representative proteins. Overall, and contrary to previous suggestions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Hua1">[13]</xref>, in the microsecond scale the unfolding efficiency of urea did not change dramatically from that in hot water simulation. In the same simulation period, proteins in urea display RMSD values that were marginally larger than in hot water (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g001">Figure 1</xref> and Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s010">Table S2</xref>), and TMscore, S2 (secondary structure) and S3 (native contacts) values at the end of the simulations in urea were not much different to those obtained in hot water (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g001">Figure 1</xref> and Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s010">Table S2</xref>), except for a certain enlargement in the disruption of β-sheets when urea was added (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s011">Table S3</xref>).</p>
<p>We found a significant correlation (r = 0.701; p-value&lt;2.2 10<sup>−16</sup>) between the time that each native contact remained lost in water and in urea at the same temperature (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s004">Figure S3-A</xref>). This observation suggests that urea does not attack specific parts of the protein, but rather benefits from the intrinsic breathing movements of the protein at high temperature. However, the role of urea in guiding unfolding is reflected by the different nature of the structural deformations that occurred in hot water and urea simulations. Thus, the latter sampled conformations that were slightly more extended (higher RadGyr) and clearly more exposed (higher SASA) than those sampled in hot water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g002">Figure 2</xref>). It is worth noting (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g002">Figure 2</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s004">Figure S3</xref>) that in urea-driven unfolding the solvent-accessible surface (SASA) corresponding to apolar residues increased dramatically, a behavior reminiscent of the surfactant action, while this increase was moderate in hot water simulations. The urea-induced increase of the apolar-exposed area was not accompanied by a dramatic enlargement of RadGyr or to a large decrease in the structural indexes, thereby suggesting that the exposure of the hydrophobic core occurs through the creation of small cavities (filled with urea) and the exposure of apolar side chains, without a dramatic extension of the protein or an explosion of the hydrophobic core.</p>

<p>Values are reported for apolar and polar residues in hot water and urea, for the three ultra-representative proteins in all force-fields. SASA is normalized for each protein using the average value calculated in the water simulations (to take into account the structure rearrangements and the mobility in water), while the structure index is used to follow the unfolding process (from 1 - fully native folded protein - towards 0). The color marks the density. For more detailed pictures for each protein see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s004">Figure S3</xref>. Note that in urea the increase in SASA is larger than that in water, mostly due to the exposure of apolar moieties, similarly to the action of surfactant.</p>

<p>A second major difference between the unfolding yielded by hot water and by urea was revealed by the analysis of the dynamics of the protein. Intuition suggests that proteins will show greater fluctuation (at the same temperature) in the presence of a denaturant like urea. This is certainly true for a fully unfolded protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>, but not during early stages of unfolding, when the protein is still close to its native state, as noted in the values of RMSD calculated in various time-windows (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s004">Figure S3-B</xref>). The explanation of this apparently counterintuitive finding is that urea solutions are more viscous, thus reducing the fastest movements of the proteins, including the oscillations of side chains (66% of side chains were stiffer in urea than in water). This reduction causes a slow down of the atomic-motions, which in fact opposes unfolding. However, the slower mobility of urea and its sticky nature may explain the longer life time of lost contacts (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s013">Text S1</xref>) in urea (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003393-t002">Table 2</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s005">Figure S4-C</xref>), a feature that clearly favors unfolding (see below).</p>

<p>Regarding differences related to force-fields, we detected the same discrepancies as in hot water. C22 simulations showed more mobility and distortions (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s003">Figure S2</xref>), but conformations were still similar to those obtained with other force-fields. With the P99SBILDN force-field, the full-β protein 1CQY remained stable when simulated at high temperature in the presence (but also absence) of urea. Five 1-µsec replicas of this trajectory failed again to detect any significant unfolding of this protein, a finding that suggests caution in the use of P99SBILDN (a force-field refined to reproduce folded structures) in unfolding studies of full-β proteins. Given our observation, the P99SBILDN force-field was not considered in the rest of the study.</p>

<title>Proteome-level study of urea unfolding</title>
<p>After the validation of our protocol, we extended the chemical unfolding simulations to a larger set of proteins, to avoid any bias in the conclusion due to the native structure. We performed 1 µsec of simulation in urea at high temperature (T = 398K) for 30 proteins covering all the major protein folds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003393-t001">Table 1</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s001">Dataset S1</xref>). Each system was simulated in three force-fields (C22, ON and P99), excluding P99SBILDN as reported above, and collecting in total 90 simulations. To have a more realistic picture of the native state, instead of using the crystal structure, we used as control 0.1 µsec-long simulations in water at room temperature for all the 90 systems. The analysis described here reveals some common robust trends that illustrate the effect of urea during the early stages of protein unfolding.</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Global denaturation</title>
<p>As anticipated from simulations in the small set of ultra-representative proteins, urea led to an enlargement of the protein and to a deviation from its native structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g003">Figure 3</xref>), without reaching, however, full unfolding in any of the 90 simulations in urea at high temperature. On average, our simulations produced RMSD values (from experimental native conformation) around 4 Å larger than those found at the end of the control simulation in water, while for these proteins a fully unfolded structure should yield ΔRMSD values above the range 20 Å <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref> and a random structure above 10 Å <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Maiorov1">[23]</xref>. Only a few proteins lost their fold integrity and native contacts after 1-µsec simulations in urea at high temperature, as noted in the reductions beyond 0.5 in the TMscore and in native contact (S3 structural index) around 0.2–0.3. However, in general, the urea-induced disruption of core structural elements was moderate (reduction of TMscore around 0.3–0.4 and S3 indexes around 0.4–0.6 at the end of the trajectory; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The selected force-fields showed a consistent representation of unfolding and in general the urea- labile or resistant proteins defined among the entire set matched in all of them. For example, all force-fields detected minuscule advances in unfolding (as determined by the set of metrics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g003">Figure 3</xref>) for 1GND(d), 2HVM(j), 1CSP(n), 1OPC(α) and 1KTE(e), whereas the same force-fields detected significant progresses in others (for example 1CQY-m, 1BSN-t, 1OOI-z, 1K40-x or 1SP2-δ). Only in a few cases was there apparent large discrepancy between force-fields (example 1FVQ) and these corresponded to simulations where structural alterations were already seen in the reference simulations (example C22 for 1FVQ). In summary, despite the stochastic nature of unfolding and the uncertainties implicit to the force-field, the general picture of urea unfolding detected here is robust.</p>

All the proteins studied here (for all force-fields) quickly recruited urea into the first solvation shell (in agreement with osmometric experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Courtenay1">[24]</xref>), where the water/urea ratio reached values in the range 3–3.5 water/urea molecules, while the background ratio was around 6 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003393-t003">Table 3</xref>). However, this enrichment was smaller than that found for a fully unfolded protein (0.9 for unfolded ubiquitin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>), thereby suggesting that the most urea-philic groups remained buried in the interior of the protein. Urea did not preferentially solvate any residue (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and showed preferential binding to the backbone rather than to the side chains during the first stages of unfolding. Although larger in size, urea has a higher affinity than water to interact with residues placed in narrow cavities near the hydrophobic core (see below). Long residence urea molecules placed in these cavities led to a partial exposure of the hydrophobic core of the protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g003">3</xref>).</p>

<title>The energetics of protein-urea interaction</title>
<p>The nature of the interaction between urea and proteins has been the subject of intense discussion (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1"><italic>Introduction</italic></xref>). Our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref> suggest that in the fully unfolded state there are many urea-protein hydrogen bonds, mostly with the backbone, but that the main factor responsible for the urea-philicity shown by proteins is the differential dispersion interaction of bulk and protein-bound urea. However, these conclusions for the unfolded state might not be valid when the protein is still compact during the early stages of unfolding. Analysis of current data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003393-t004">Table 4</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s012">Table S4</xref>) shows that already in these early stages of unfolding 30% of the protein-solvent hydrogen bonds are with urea, and the ratio is even higher (36%) when considering only stable contacts. In 2/3 of the cases, urea acts as a hydrogen donor when H-bonding to the backbone, and, in general, urea-protein H-bonds display longer life times than water-protein ones, a feature that appears to be crucial to stabilize partially exposed residues (see below). Nevertheless, the formation of these H-bond interactions (mostly electrostatic in nature) is not the driving force that explains the urea-philicity of the nearly-native conformation, since the migration of urea from background to the first solvation shell (FSS) of the protein does not alter global electrostatics (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s006">Figure S5-B</xref>), but improves the van der Waals interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Hua1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>.

<p>Urea diffuses quite slowly (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s006">Figure S5-C</xref>) and limits protein fluctuations, which leads to an apparent paradox: a denaturant that slows down the dynamics of proteins compared to the equivalent simulations in water (see also Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s005">Figure S4-B</xref>). However, analysis of trajectories show that such a paradox does not exist. Urea migration to the protein surface was slower than that of water, but once it reached the surface, urea remained for longer periods (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), especially when located in cavities near the hydrophobic core of the protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g005">Figure 5</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s007">Figure S6-A</xref> for examples). Interestingly, the positions of long-lasting urea interactions are consistent among all four force-fields and seems associated with a sizeable improvement in van der Waals interactions and electrostatic energies and with the formation of strong long-living H-bonds (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g005">Figure 5</xref>, Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s007">Figure S6-A</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s012">Table S4</xref>). These findings demonstrate that even if H-bonding is not the driving force behind the urea-philicity of proteins, it is important to stabilize urea molecules at specific positions at the protein interior.</p>

<p>As noted above, residues that are very mobile in urea are also highly mobile in water at high temperature (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s005">Figure S4-A</xref>). Furthermore (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s005">Figure S4-C</xref>), with the exception of C22 simulations, there was a slight but significant (r&gt;0.2; p-value:&lt;2.2 10<sup>−16</sup>) correlation between oscillating residues in urea simulations and in native simulations (water at 300K). Interestingly, long-residence urea molecules were typically bound to rigid regions of the protein adjacent to mobile residues, i.e. they are located at putative hinge-points at the interface between the more rigid core of the protein and flexible loops or tails (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003393-g006">Figure 6C</xref> and Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s007">Figure S6-C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MD simulations with additive potentials and explicit solvent have become very popular to explore chemical unfolding of protein. There is little doubt that the use of the technique has produced sizeable advances in the field, but we cannot ignore some potential caveats in the beginning of this discussion. First, for computational reasons we (and most authors in the field) are using classical non-polarizable force-fields, which might not be accurate enough to deal with a complex process such as unfolding. Previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-TiradoRives1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Bennion1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Klimov1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Stumpe4">[25]</xref> have however demonstrated that urea/water/protein effective parameters are able to reproduce a variety of experimental observables, such as mass densities and radial distribution functions of urea/water solutions derived from neutron scattering experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Stumpe4">[25]</xref>, the experimental water/urea transfer free energies of tripeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Stumpe1">[10]</xref>, and the urea density around unfolded proteins found by vapor pressure osmometry measures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-TiradoRives1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Canchi1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Stumpe1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Hua1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Courtenay1">[24]</xref>. Furthermore, our recent work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref> has demonstrated that unbiased MD simulations in 8M urea reproduce very accurately the unfolded ensemble as determined from a variety of spectroscopic techniques (including SAXS and NMR) under the same conditions. Thus, despite their simplicity current force-fields reproduce reasonably well urea/water/protein mixtures. We should remember that since we are exploring a microsecond-long process, no direct experimental data is available for comparison and accordingly caution is required. This move us to use a consensus approach, running the simulations with different force-fields to extract those results that seem robust to force-field changes.</p>
<p>A second reason of concern is related to the stochastic nature of unfolding, where individual trajectories can show different degree of unfolding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Hua1">[13]</xref>. Again, by comparing different trajectories we tried to define robust findings, but we cannot ignore that the experimental result is the averaging a near-Avogadro number of trajectories. A third reason of concern, common to many experimental studies, is the generality of the results, i.e. how general are the results obtained with a few model proteins. To convince ourselves on the general validity of our results we repeated the unfolding studies for a large number of proteins representative of all prevalent folds. Despite the obvious caveat of any theoretical study, this approach provided a picture of unprecedented, to our knowledge, completeness and robustness of the early stages of urea unfolding.</p>
<p>Under our simulation conditions (8M urea at T = 368 K), we detected clear signals of unfolding in the microsecond range, but progress in denaturation was smaller than that reported for model proteins of reduced stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Hua1">[13]</xref>. Overall, the advance in unfolding of proteins at T = 368 after 1 µsec of MD is not dependent on the fold, nor secondary structure composition, and was similar for proteins with and without disulphide bridges in the native form. No dramatic differences in the advance of unfolding were found between water and urea simulations performed at the same temperature; however, unfolding paths in the presence or absence of urea differed, since the partially unfolded structures sampled in hot water maintained the hydrophobic residues hidden in the core of the protein, while such residues were more accessible in presence of urea.</p>
<p>Urea solutions are more viscous than pure water, which in our simulation reduced high-frequency movements in the protein, generating an unexpected slow down of the atomic-motions. Urea residence times around protein residues were large, especially when urea molecules diffuse close to the hydrophobic core or to the interface between rigid and thermally mobile regions (hinge points). We consider that the sticky nature of urea and its preferential placement at hinge points is crucial for unfolding, since it favors the rapid trapping of residues that become exposed as a consequence of stochastic thermal motions. The stabilizing effect of urea on exposed residues slowly biases the trajectory towards the unfolded state, by decreasing the chances of microscopic refolding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Stumpe3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Lindgren2">[26]</xref>. The effect of stabilization of exposed residues is especially productive in terms of unfolding when residues are apolar, since in this case urea (but not water) traps very efficiently the residue, increasing the accessibility of other apolar residues in the vicinity. The ensuing greater recruitment of urea in the region leads to a cooperative effect resulting in the acceleration of protein unfolding. Our data shows that, similar to the unfolded state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Hua1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>, it is the van der Waals interactions that drive the accumulation of urea on the surface of the folded protein. However, the role of H-bonding cannot be dismissed, as these bonds are crucial for the stabilization of long-living urea interactions near hinge points, which in turn are required to bias intrinsic protein dynamics towards unfolding. Clearly, “direct” effects not only are the main factors responsible for the urea-mediated stabilization of the unfolded state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>, but are also relevant in guiding the first steps of urea unfolding.</p>
<p>Microscopic unfolding events are related to stochastic thermal motions, which are in principle similar to those that occur spontaneously in water at room temperature. However, urea is not a mere passive spectator that simply stabilizes the small percentage of unfolded protein coexisting within the native ensemble and leading to a displacement in the folded←→unfolded equilibrium towards the denatured state. On the contrary, urea has a dual function: i) it takes advantage of microscopic unfolding events, decreasing their chances of refolding, and favoring further unfolding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Stumpe3">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Lindgren2">[26]</xref>; and ii) among these microscopic unfolding events it selects and stabilizes microstates with exposed hydrophobic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-TiradoRives1">[4]</xref> (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003393.s008">Figure S7</xref>). These effects lead to a slow divergence in the temperature-unfolding pathways in water and urea, and, as shown for ubiquitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Candotti1">[15]</xref>, to distinct unfolded states. Consequently, concepts such as folded and unfolded states or folding and unfolding pathways need to be revisited and reformulated considering the nature of the denaturant used.</p>

<title>Simulation details</title>
<p>For the small set of ultra-representative proteins, three sets of simulations corresponding to water at room temperature (T = 300 K), hot water (T = 368 K), and urea at high temperature (T = 368 K) were carried out. For each condition, we performed 1 µsec simulations using four force-fields: three general purpose ones (OPLSAA -ON2- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Jorgensen3">[34]</xref>; CHARMM -C22- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-MacKerell1">[35]</xref>; AMBER99 -P99- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Wang1">[36]</xref>), and a last-generation force-field able to accurately reproduce folded proteins (P99SBILDN, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003393-Piana1">[37]</xref>).
