<abstract>
<p>Protein subcellular localization is a major determinant of protein function. However, this important protein feature is often described in terms of discrete and qualitative categories of subcellular compartments, and therefore it has limited applications in quantitative protein function analyses. Here, we present Protein Localization Analysis and Search Tools (PLAST), an automated analysis framework for constructing and comparing quantitative signatures of protein subcellular localization patterns based on microscopy images. PLAST produces human-interpretable protein localization maps that quantitatively describe the similarities in the localization patterns of proteins and major subcellular compartments, without requiring manual assignment or supervised learning of these compartments. Using the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as a model system, we show that PLAST is more accurate than existing, qualitative protein localization annotations in identifying known co-localized proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAST can reveal protein localization-function relationships that are not obvious from these annotations. First, we identified proteins that have similar localization patterns and participate in closely-related biological processes, but do not necessarily form stable complexes with each other or localize at the same organelles. Second, we found an association between spatial and functional divergences of proteins during evolution. Surprisingly, as proteins with common ancestors evolve, they tend to develop more diverged subcellular localization patterns, but still occupy similar numbers of compartments. This suggests that divergence of protein localization might be more frequently due to the development of more specific localization patterns over ancestral compartments than the occupation of new compartments. PLAST enables systematic and quantitative analyses of protein localization-function relationships, and will be useful to elucidate protein functions and how these functions were acquired in cells from different organisms or species. A public web interface of PLAST is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plast.bii.a-star.edu.sg" xlink:type="simple">http://plast.bii.a-star.edu.sg</ext-link>.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Proteins are fundamental building blocks of cells. They perform a variety of biological functions, many of which are essential to the vitality and normal functioning of cells. Proteins have to be located at the appropriate regions inside a cell to perform their functions. Therefore, when proteins change their locations, they may acquire new or different functions. However, the relationships between the locations and functions of proteins are difficult to analyze because protein locations are often represented in distinct and manually-defined categories of subcellular regions. Many proteins have complex or subtle differences in their localization patterns that can be hardly represented by these categories. Here, we present an automated analysis tool for generating quantitative signatures of protein localization patterns without requiring manual or automated assignments of proteins into distinct categories. We show that our tool can identify proteins located at the same subcellular regions more accurately than existing categorization-based methods. Our tool allows comprehensive and more accurate studies of the relationships between protein localizations and functions. By knowing where proteins are located and how their locations were changed, we may discover their functions and better understand how they acquire these functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proteins have to be localized at the appropriate subcellular compartments to perform their functions. Using high-throughput protein labeling and imaging techniques, several proteome-wide studies have found that protein localization and function are strongly correlated to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Huh1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Uhlen1">[4]</xref>. However, unlike sequence, structure, expression level, or other protein features, subcellular localization has limited applications in quantitative analyses of protein functions, such as predictions of protein functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Friedberg1">[5]</xref> and studies of protein function evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Kellis1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Stuart1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>One of the main difficulties is that protein subcellular localization is often described or represented in terms of discrete, qualitative categories of subcellular compartments, such as the Gene Ontology (GO) categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Ashburner1">[8]</xref>. Although automated image processing algorithms have been useful in extracting quantitative descriptors for protein localization patterns, the resulting descriptors are often being converted back into these discrete categories using supervised classification or unsupervised clustering methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Boland1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Huh2">[13]</xref>. These discrete representations have several limitations. First, they cannot fully describe the continuous and complex spatial distributions of proteins that are localized across multiple compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Karniely1">[14]</xref> and/or distribute non-uniformly within the same compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Wojcik1">[15]</xref>. Second, they are often assigned based on manual and/or visual inspections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Huh1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Matsuyama1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Uhlen1">[4]</xref>, which are prone to bias and imprecision. Third, they only allow simple qualitative comparisons of protein localization patterns, which are often insufficient to distinguish complex or subtle changes. Despite all these limitations, discrete categories of subcellular compartments are still commonly used because they can be easily interpreted by humans.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, we have developed an automated analysis framework for converting raw image descriptors into quantitative signatures (or “profiles”) of protein subcellular localization patterns. We refer to this framework as Protein Localization Analysis and Search Tools (PLAST). First, we measure a large number of unbiased image descriptors that capture different spatial properties of protein localization patterns, and use a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Vapnik1">[16]</xref> to reduce the contributions of non-informative descriptors. The resulting profiles allow PLAST to maintain continuous representations of protein localization patterns throughout its analysis workflow, and do not require supervised learning of pre- or manually-defined categories of subcellular compartments. Second, PLAST is fully automated and designed to systematically quantify protein localization patterns at the proteome scale. Third, PLAST allows quantitative comparisons of complex protein localization patterns based on standard dissimilarity or distance measurements. Last, PLAST produces human-interpretable protein localization maps that quantitatively describe the similarities in the localization patterns of proteins and major subcellular compartments. These maps can be thresholded to make “hard” compartment-to-protein assignments at user-desired significance levels. Therefore, PLAST allows researchers to quantify and rank a set of proteins according to their localization dissimilarities to a given protein or organelle, much like searching for proteins with similar sequences in the GenBank or UniProt databases.</p>
<p>An important application of PLAST is to study changes in protein localization and function during evolution. Gene duplication is a main source of new genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Kellis1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Ohno1">[17]</xref>. A fundamental question in evolutionary biology is how duplicate genes acquired new or altered biological functions. Change in protein subcellular localization, or “protein relocalization”, is a possible mechanism for duplicate genes to achieve functional divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-ByunMcKay1">[18]</xref>. This is supported by observations that protein localization may be easily changed just by single amino-acid substitutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-ByunMcKay1">[18]</xref>, relocalization is sufficient to alter the functions of some enzymes even in the absence of any mutation in their catalytic sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Heilmann1">[19]</xref>, and many gene families encode proteins with different subcellular localizations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Kolega1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Liscovitch1">[21]</xref>. Two different models of protein relocalization have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Marques1">[22]</xref>. The “neolocalization” model suggests that duplicates relocalize and adapt to previously unoccupied compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Rosso1">[23]</xref>, whereas the “sublocalization” model suggests that duplicates develop more specific localization patterns over their ancestral compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Rosso2">[24]</xref>. Based on these models, neolocalized duplicates are expected to occupy higher total numbers of compartments than their ancestors; and conversely, sublocalized duplicates are expected to occupy similar total numbers of compartments as their ancestors. However, both neo- and sublocalized duplicates are expected to show more diverged subcellular localization patterns and occupy lower ratios of shared compartments as they evolve. PLAST allows us to compare and test these two models by quantitatively measuring the degree of spatial divergence between duplicates and the number of compartments occupied and shared by them.</p>
<p>Here, we describe the key components of PLAST, and show that PLAST is, on average, more accurate than existing, qualitative protein localization annotations in identifying known co-localized proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAST can reveal protein localization-function relationships that are not obvious from these annotations. We found that PLAST can 1) identify similarly-localized proteins that participate in closely-related biological processes but do not necessary form stable complexes with each other or localize at the same organelles, and 2) reveal an association between spatial and functional divergences of proteins during evolution.</p>

<title>Overview of PLAST</title>
<p>PLAST can be generally applied to microscopy images of proteins labeled with fluorescent protein fusion tags, fluorophore-conjugated antibodies, or other labeling techniques. PLAST has five major steps: cell segmentation, feature extraction, protein localization profile (“P-profile”) construction, P-profile dissimilarity computation, and compartment mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). First, we automatically segment cells from microscopy images. To avoid segmentation bias that may be introduced by protein-to-protein variations in expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Newman1">[25]</xref>, we do not use fluorescent signals from the labeled proteins. Instead, we have developed a segmentation algorithm based on differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination and fluorescent nuclear stains (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s004">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). Other segmentation algorithms based on fluorescent whole-cell stains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-DeSolorzano1">[26]</xref> may also be used in this step.</p>

The accuracies shown were estimated using a multi-class SVM classifier and 5-fold cross validation, and averaged over all UCSF categories.</p>

<p>Second, we extract a large number of quantitative image descriptors (or “features”) from the segmented cells. We have designed several new image features based on subcellular regions and local structures of protein distribution patterns (<bold>Local structure features</bold>). We also extract standard intensity, texture, and moment features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Boland1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Boland2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Loo1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Third, we have generalized a SVM-based drug profiling algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Loo1">[27]</xref>, which was originally designed to compare the same proteins under perturbed and control conditions, to compare different proteins under the same cellular conditions. For each protein, this method removes the contributions of non-informative features by finding an optimum SVM hyperplane that can separate cells labeled for the protein from a fixed set of reference cells (<bold>P-profile<sub>SVM</sub> construction</bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s005">Fig. S2A</xref></bold>). We used the unit vector orthogonal to the hyperplane as a quantitative profile representing the spatial localization signature of the protein. As an alternative, we also construct profiles by averaging each feature value across all cells. We denote these two profile types as “P-profile<sub>SVM</sub>” and “P-profile<sub>mean</sub>”, respectively.</p>
<p>Fourth, we measure and store the pairwise dissimilarity scores (<italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic>) between the P-profiles of all proteins into a database. Lower <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> values correspond to more similar subcellular localization patterns. To compare the localization patterns of a protein to a group of proteins, such as those that constitute a subcellular organelle or compartment, we compute the mean of all the pairwise <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> values between the protein and each of the group members (<bold>P-profile dissimilarity score</bold>). If the protein is part of the group, the <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> to itself will be excluded from the calculation.</p>
<p>Fifth, we map a comprehensive catalog of major subcellular compartments to each of the proteins in our database. For each protein, we estimate the probability distribution of <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> between the protein and the compartments that are not specifically occupied by the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). Then, we standardize the <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> values between the protein and all compartments based on this distribution (<bold>Compartment assignment</bold>). The resulting z-scores (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) constitute a localization map of all the proteins, and allow us to use the same significance thresholds to assign compartments to proteins.</p>

<title>Subcellular localization profiles of the yeast proteome</title>
<p>To assess the performance of PLAST, we used the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) as a model system due to the availability of a genome-wide GFP-fusion-protein image dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>, the “UCSF dataset”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Huh1">[1]</xref> and a large number of known protein complexes in this organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Cherry1">[28]</xref>. The dataset covers ∼75% of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteome. We extracted 623 quantitative features from ∼20 single cells per yeast strain, and constructed P-profiles for all the strains (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s005">Fig. S2A</xref></bold> and <bold>B</bold>). After quality control (<bold>Quality control</bold>), we obtained P-profiles for 4066 open reading frames (ORFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the correspondence between P-profiles and compartment categories manually assigned by UCSF via visual inspections (“UCSF categories”), we clustered P-profiles using an affinity propagation algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Frey1">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g001"><bold>Fig. 1D</bold></xref> and <bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s006">Fig. S3</xref></bold>) and determined the enrichments of UCSF categories and GO biological processes in each of the 20 identified clusters. We found that PLAST divides most “cytoplasmic”, “nuclear”, or “mitochondrial” proteins into ∼4 to 6 clusters that are enriched in proteins involved in different biological processes (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s007">Fig. S4</xref></bold>). Thus, PLAST can reveal protein subcellular localization patterns that are not obvious under manual inspections.</p>
<p>Previously, two other analysis frameworks were also developed to quantify and classify the same image dataset according to UCSF categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Chen1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Huh2">[13]</xref>. We found that P-profiles can achieve higher mean classification accuracy than these two previous frameworks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g001"><bold>Fig. 1E</bold></xref>). The increase in accuracy mostly came from better detections of categories with small numbers of ORFs, such as “early Golgi”, “bud neck” and “microtubule”, which were completely missed by these two other frameworks (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s005">Fig. S2C</xref></bold>). These improvements were likely due to our better cell segmentation algorithm that does not rely on the fluorescence intensities of the GFP-tagged proteins (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s004">Fig. S1</xref></bold>), and our SVM-based profiling algorithm that reduces the contributions of non-informative features.</p>

<title>Performance in identifying co-localized proteins</title>
<p>Proteins must localize in close proximity to interact physically. We next studied to what extent PLAST can be used to search for physically interacting proteins. We first made use of two high-quality protein-protein interaction datasets obtained from affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Yu1">[30]</xref>. AP-MS can identify components of larger complexes that may not necessary directly interact with each other, whereas Y2H screening can identify direct and sometimes more transient interactions between components from different complexes or pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Yu1">[30]</xref>. We found that AP-MS interactors have significantly lower median and mean intrapair <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> values than Y2H interactors (P&lt;0.001, two-sided permutation test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>). These results show that PLAST is better in detecting stable protein complexes than transient interactors.</p>

<p>To further test the ability of PLAST in searching subunits of stable protein complexes, we used a comprehensive catalog of 197 protein complexes with different subunit numbers and subcellular localization patterns (<bold>Datasets</bold>). Identifying subunits of complexes that localized at multiple compartments, such as ribosome and proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Wojcik1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Tschochner1">[31]</xref>, is expected to be very challenging.

We systematically measured the precision, recall and F1 scores, which are commonly-used criteria for information retrieval performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-vanRijsbergen1">[32]</xref>, for different numbers of query proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>). We also ranked proteins based on their similarities in UCSF or SGD GoSlim localization annotations (<bold>Subunit search based on UCSF or SGD GOSlim annotations</bold>). These two annotations are not independent from each other, because a large fraction of SGD GoSlim annotations are based on UCSF annotations. We performed paired t-tests between the maximum F1 scores obtained from different profiling/annotation methods for all the protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g002"><bold>Fig. 2D and E</bold></xref>). The resulting test statistic is only weakly correlated to protein complex size (R = −0.136, P = 0.056; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s008">Fig. S5</xref></bold>). Overall, we found that predictions based on P-profiles<sub>SVM</sub> have significantly higher maximum F1 scores than other methods (P&lt;3.3×10<sup>−6</sup>, Bonferroni-adjusted, one-sided paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g002"><bold>Figs. 2C and E</bold></xref>). Therefore, in the subsequent analyses, we will be using P-profiles<sub>SVM</sub> to represent protein subcellular localization patterns. Notably, some of the “false positives” selected by PLAST may also interact with the query proteins. For example, RNA polymerase II subunit (Rpb2) and ubiquitin activating enzyme (Uba1) were previously found to be physically associated with proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Gillette1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-McGrath1">[34]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>). Thus, our estimated performances of PLAST are conservative. Our results show that, at least for most of the tested protein complexes, P-profiles are more accurate than existing localization annotations in associating subunits of the same protein complexes together.</p>

<title>Construction of a subcellular localization map</title>
<p>To generate a human-interpretable localization map of the yeast proteome, we used another catalog of cellular compartments as “landmarks” of the subcellular space in a yeast cell. This catalog consists of known protein components of 23 major organelles and 50 large protein complexes (<bold>Catalog of subcellular compartments</bold>). For each protein, we systematically queried the P-profile database for the <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> scores between the protein and all the compartments. We assumed that the probability distribution for these <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> scores could be modeled by a mixture of Gaussian distributions, in which the component distribution with the highest mean <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> value was the distribution for non-specifically localized compartments. We estimated the mean and standard deviation of this “null” distribution and standardized all the <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> scores based on the estimated values (<bold>Compartment assignment</bold> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref>). We found that the null distributions for most proteins are dominant (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s009">Fig. S6</xref></bold>), indicating most proteins are localized only at small subsets of components in our catalog. The resulting z-scores (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) constitute the final localization map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s010">S7</xref></bold>, <bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s001">Dataset S1</xref></bold>), and allow us to assign compartments to different proteins using the same Bonferroni-adjusted P-value thresholds.

<title>Spatially-associated proteins tend to participate in related biological processes</title>
<p>We identified several general trends from this localization map. First, compartments involved in similar or related biological processes tend to be spatially associated to similar sets of proteins. We performed a hierarchical clustering of all the compartments based on the localization map, and found that functionally-related compartments tend to be grouped into the same clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref><bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s010">S7</xref></bold>). For example, we obtained two clusters of compartments that are related to cellular bud/cytoskeleton and endomembrane system, respectively. These two clusters are also closest to each other, and form a larger supercluster in the dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>). Similarly, we obtained separate clusters for ribosomal subunits, polysome, and degradation compartments, which together also form a larger supercluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>). These protein machineries are known to work together to regulate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Brengues1">[35]</xref>. The spatial associations of these functionally-related compartments suggest that PLAST, which is based on microscopy images, can identify spatially-associated proteins that participate in closely-related biological processes or pathways but do not necessary form stable complexes with each other or localize at the same organelles. Most affinity-purification-based methods, such as the aforementioned AP-MS method, would have difficulties in relating these proteins together.</p>
<p>To perform hard assignments of compartments to proteins, we used a Bonferroni-adjusted threshold of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>&lt;1.0×10<sup>−12</sup>. We studied all the compartments that had been assigned to at least one protein, and found that, on average, ∼90% of the proteins assigned to a compartment are not known components of the compartment. We wonder to what extent these “non-components” may perform similar biological functions as other known components of the compartment. For each compartment, we systematically identified significantly enriched GO biological processes among all its known components, and among all its non-components assigned by PLAST. Interestingly, we found 22 compartments whose non- and known components are significantly enriched with at least one common biological process (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>&lt;0.05, FDR-adjusted, hypergeometric test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g003"><bold>Fig. 3C</bold></xref> and <bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s002">Dataset S2</xref></bold>). For example, several translation factors (eIF1A, eIF4B, and eIF4G) and synthases (glycyl-tRNA and glutamyl-tRNA synthases) were assigned to cytosolic ribosomes; and several splicing factors (Prp11, Prp39, Prp45, and Prp5), topoisomerase (Top2), and transcription initiation factor (Tfc8) were assigned to RNA polymerase II (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s002">Dataset S2</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we also found that the non-components assigned by PLAST to cytosolic ribosome were also significantly enriched with ORFs that were experimentally found to co-purify with cytosolic ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Fleischer1">[36]</xref> (P&lt;0.001, hypergeometric test; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s011">Fig. S8</xref></bold>). Importantly, some of these non-components have uncharacterized functions or not known to be functionally associated with their corresponding compartments. Therefore, our localization map provides a repertoire of potentially novel components of the biological processes or pathways performed at major subcellular compartments in the budding yeast.</p>

<title>Most proteins are localized at multiple compartments</title>
<p>The second general trend is that most proteins are localized at multiple compartments. To perform a fair comparison between PLAST and UCSF annotations, we used a more relaxed Bonferroni-adjusted threshold of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>≤2.5×10<sup>−4</sup>, which assigns major organelles, namely cytoplasm and nucleus, to similar numbers of proteins as UCSF annotations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Huh1">[1]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>). However, among proteins with assigned compartments, the median and mean numbers of compartments assigned to a protein by PLAST (∼13.0 to 14.5) are significantly higher than UCSF (∼1) and SGD GOSlim annotations (∼2.0 to 2.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). We observed the same trends even if we used a reduced set of 22 major compartments for compartment mapping by PLAST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). Many of the compartments that we used as landmarks are located in the cytoplasm, therefore it is not surprising that PLAST would also assign them to proteins that are localized at the cytoplasm. On average, PLAST assigned 14.9 compartments to cytosolic proteins, but only 1.9 compartments to non-cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>). Nevertheless, in all cases, PLAST and SGD GoSlim assign significantly more compartments than UCSF annotations (P&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>). This is likely due to the inefficiency of human scorers to separate complex composite patterns into individual compartments, and therefore analyses of protein localization based on UCSF annotations may be inaccurate.</p>

<title>Duplicates with different divergence times occupy similar numbers of compartments</title>
<p>An important application of PLAST is to study spatial and functional divergences of proteins during evolution. Individual cases of neo- and sublocalization (<bold>Introduction</bold>) have been reported in yeasts and hominoids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Marques1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Rosso2">[24]</xref>, and thus both mechanisms were likely to contribute to protein relocalization. Given that the subcellular localization data for ancestral proteins is not available, we use two different approaches to test the prevalence of neo- and sublocalization models. All our subsequent analyses are based on the compartment assignments from the previous section, and also P-profile<sub>SVM</sub>, which has the best overall benchmark performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g002"><bold>Fig. 2E</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>In the first approach, we studied duplicates with different divergence times. We assumed that the localization patterns of more recently duplicated gene pairs are more similar to their ancestors. We used a phylogeny of orthologous gene groups estimated for seventeen Ascomycota fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Wapinski1">[37]</xref>. We obtained six sets of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> duplicates with different divergence times (T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>6</sub>), each of which consists of ∼10–400 duplicate pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). We used PLAST to quantify the spatial divergence levels of all the duplicates. Because protein expression may influence protein localization pattern, we also obtained the protein expression levels of all the duplicates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Newman1">[25]</xref>. To treat each divergence time equally, we only used the mean values of all its associated duplicates. A whole genome duplication (WGD) was estimated to occur around ∼100 million years ago after the divergence of <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> (<italic>K. lactis</italic>) in the phylogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Kellis1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Wolfe1">[38]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). We refer to pre-WGD duplicates as “old” duplicates (T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>6</sub>), and all other duplicates as “young” duplicates (T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>3</sub>). We found that old duplicates have significantly larger intrapair <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> values, lower shared compartment ratios, and lower average protein expression levels than young duplicates (P = 0.041, 0.066, and 0.066, two-sided t-tests; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g005"><bold>Fig. 5B–D</bold></xref>). However, we did not observe a significant difference in the total numbers of occupied compartments (P = 0.796, two-sided t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g005"><bold>Fig. 5E</bold></xref>). To test if localization divergence could be predicted based on divergence time or protein expression level, we performed linear regression modeling and found that only divergence time is a significant predictor of both <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> and shared compartment ratio (P&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g005"><bold>Fig. 5F</bold></xref>). Our results are consistent with the expected behaviors of sublocalized duplicates (<bold>Introductions</bold>), and suggest that localization divergence might be more frequently due to sublocalization. One of the limitations of our analysis is that duplicates with different divergence times may undergo different evolutionary paths. Furthermore, we could only obtain small numbers (∼10) of duplicates for some of the divergence times, and thus could not perform meaningful enrichment analyses of protein functions on them.</p>

<title>Large portion of WGD duplicate proteins have diverged localization patterns</title>
<p>In the second approach, we addressed these limitations by studying the large number (∼544) of duplicates generated from WGD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Wolfe1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Gordon1">[39]</xref>. We assumed that the localization patterns of duplicates with lower intrapair <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> values are more similar to their ancestors. Sixty eight percent of these WGD duplicates were detected in T<sub>3</sub> of the phylogeny that we used in the previous section. Based on UCSF annotations, a previous study estimated that ∼24–37% of these WGD duplicates now have diverged localizations and occupy significantly higher numbers of compartments than their ancestors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Marques1">[22]</xref>. Thus, the study concluded that localization divergence might be more frequently due to neolocalization. However, UCSF annotations tend to underestimate the number of compartments localized by a protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>), and we wonder if PLAST can provide additional insights into the localization-function relationships between these duplicate proteins.</p>
<p>To quantify the spatial divergence of WGD duplicates, we determined the <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> for all 326 duplicate pairs that have P-profiles (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s003">Dataset S3</xref></bold>), and also the empirical distribution of <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> for 10,000 randomly selected non-duplicate pairs from the proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A</bold></xref>). As expected, we found that WGD duplicates as a whole have significantly lower <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> values and higher shared compartment ratios than random non-duplicates (both P&lt;0.001, two-sided permutation test for difference in medians and means; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A and B</bold></xref>). However, we did not find significant difference in the total numbers of occupied compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g006"><bold>Fig. 6C</bold></xref>). We refer to protein pairs with <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> less than a certain percentile of the <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> distribution for random pairs as “similarly localized” (SL) pairs, otherwise as “dissimilarly localized” (DL) pairs. We estimated that ∼42–84% of duplicates are now DL pairs (based on 1st- and 20th-percentile thresholds), which are higher than the ∼24–37% estimated based on UCSF annotations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Marques1">[22]</xref>. In the following analyses, we will use a 10th-percent threshold to separate SL and DL pairs. Among the ten biological processes with the highest numbers of duplicates, “cytoplasmic translation” and “signaling” have the lowest and highest DL-duplicate ratios, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g006"><bold>Fig. 6D</bold></xref>).

All of our results could be explained by multi-compartment localizations of ancestral genes. After duplication, different duplicate copies of a gene evolved to develop more specific localization patterns over ancestral compartments. Therefore the total numbers of occupied compartments remain largely unchanged, while the shared compartment ratios are decreasing. Our results suggest that localization divergence was more frequently due to sublocalization.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using PLAST, we demonstrate that protein subcellular localization can be quantitatively compared and analyzed to reveal protein localization-function relationships that are not obvious under qualitative representations of protein localization. First, protein localization in multiple subcellular compartments is common. Second, spatially-associated proteins tend to participate in related biological processes, and we have identified a repertoire of potentially novel components of biological processes performed at major subcellular compartments. Third, ∼42–84% of duplicate proteins now have diverged localization patterns. Fourth, most of these proteins still perform the same molecular functions, but close to half of them have started to involve in different biological processes, likely due to adaptations to more specific or new subcellular compartments. Fifth, duplicate proteins occupy similar numbers of compartments irrespective of their divergence times or spatial divergence levels, and therefore protein relocalization might be more frequently due to sublocalization. The sublocalization model is very similar to an extensively studied model of functional evolution called “subfunctionalization”, where duplicate genes evolved to complement each other by jointly retaining the full functions of their ancestral genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Force1">[44]</xref>. However, the sublocalization model does not preclude further functional evolutions via subfunctionalization or other evolutionary mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Innan1">[45]</xref>. Together, our results underscore the importance and utility of quantitative localization profiles in studying protein localization and function.</p>
<p>How can an ancestral gene, or a gene in general, produce proteins localized in multiple compartments? Several molecular mechanisms are possible. First, the budding yeast <italic>Lachancea kluyveri</italic>, which diverged from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> before WGD, has a single ortholog to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SKI7 and HBS1 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003504-g006"><bold>Fig. 6E</bold></xref>). This pre-WGD ancestral gene is alternatively spliced to generate two different conserved proteins that can perform similar functions as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ski7 or Hbs1, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Marshall1">[46]</xref>. Second, the filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> has a single NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (<italic>idpA</italic>) that has two <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> orthologs (IDH1, IDH2) and three <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> orthologs (IDP1, IDP2, and IDP3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Szewczyk1">[47]</xref>. Interestingly, this gene has two alternative transcription start sites that specify mitochondrial or cytoplasmic and peroxisomal localizations; whereas the <italic>H. sapiens</italic> IDH1 and IDH2 are specifically localized to cytoplasm and peroxisome or mitochondrion, respectively; and the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> IDP1, IDP2, and IDP3 are specifically localized each of these three compartments. Third, several core glycolytic enzymes were also recently found to be targeted to both cytoplasm and peroxisome via alternative splicing and stop codon read-through of the same genes in fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Freitag1">[48]</xref>. Similar transcriptional and/or other post-translational mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Karniely1">[14]</xref> may also produce proteins with multi-compartment localization patterns. Quantitative localization profiles are therefore essential to analyze the complex localization patterns of these proteins.</p>
<p>PLAST has several limitations. First, it only works for proteins that can be fluorescently labeled without affecting their localizations. Second, it does not work well for proteins with very low abundance levels. Third, it has poor detection of yeast two-hybrid interactions, likely due to the more transient nature of these interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Yu1">[30]</xref>. Nevertheless, it can still achieve better overall performances than current protein localization annotations, especially for protein complexes that localized at multiple subcellular compartments. Recent advances in the developments of brighter fluorescent probes and higher-resolution imaging techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Huang1">[49]</xref> may further improve the performance of PLAST.</p>
<p>As more genome-wide protein localization image datasets become available for different organisms or species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Matsuyama1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Uhlen1">[4]</xref>, PLAST can be readily used to compare protein localizations across different levels of a phylogenetic tree. Protein localization maps can be constructed for cells from different organisms or species using a common set of conserved subcellular compartments. Other possible extensions of PLAST include predicting targeting signals or protein-protein interactions based on proteins that have similar subcellular localization patterns. We have implemented the cell segmentation and feature extraction steps of PLAST using a user-friendly and publicly-available bioimage analysis software platform called “cellXpress” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Laksameethanasan1">[50]</xref>, and the P-profile construction and compartment mapping steps using standard R scripts. We have also developed a public web interface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plast.bii.a-star.edu.sg" xlink:type="simple">http://plast.bii.a-star.edu.sg</ext-link>) that allows researchers to query protein localization maps created using PLAST. These resources enable systematic and quantitative analyses of protein localization-function relationships, and will help researchers to elucidate protein functions and the causes of their changes.</p>

We set the rolling ball size to 50 pixels, which is larger than the average diameter of a budding yeast cell in the images.

<p>We noticed non-zero lateral offsets between the DIC and fluorescence images (both GFP and DAPI) in the UCSF yeast GFP dataset.

In the first step, we applied the local structure detection algorithm (see <bold>Local structure identification</bold> above) to identify local structures from the GFP images. A smaller window size (<italic>w</italic>) will extract finer local structures, while a larger window size will extract coarser global structures in the protein localization patterns. For the UCSF yeast GFP dataset, we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and found that the local structures of most yeast cells converged to similar global patterns after <italic>w</italic> = ∼33 (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s015">Fig. S12</xref></bold>). Therefore we only used 16 different window sizes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> pixels) for feature extraction.</p>
<p>In the second step, we extracted six features (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) based on the identified local structures of window size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These features are total GFP intensity, mean GFP intensity, standard-deviation GFP intensity, binary object number, binary object total area, and binary object mean area. We also extracted the same features (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) but based on the cellular regions of the same images. Then, we computed global ratio features (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the local structures using<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003504.e070"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>These features are designed to detect the concentrations of GFP signals in the identified local structures. For the UCSF yeast GFP dataset, this amounted to 6 features per window size×16 window sizes per cell = 96 features per cell.</p>
<p>In the third step, we computed the stepwise ratios (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the same six features between local structures of two consecutive window sizes, namely<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003504.e072"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These ratios are designed to detect changes in the concentrations of GFP signals from finer to coarser local structures (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s015">Fig. S12</xref></bold>). For the UCSF yeast GFP dataset, this amounted to 90 additional features per cell. Therefore, the total number of local structure features was 96+90 = 186.</p>

<title>Quality control</title>
<p>To automatically remove badly or wrongly segmented cells, we used two quality control criteria, namely cell area and solidity (cell area/convex hull area). First, we removed segmented cells that have cell area &lt;300 pixels or &gt;2000 pixels. Then, we removed segmented cells that have solidity value &gt;0.2. There were 33 strains with more than one image set, and for each strain we used only one image set. We removed three yeast strains (YDL125C, YJL026W, YLR109W) that have abnormal image size (58×58 pixels). After feature extraction, there were 15 cells with NaN values, and we replaced these values with the medians across all cells in each of the yeast strains. We obtained ∼20 segmented cells per yeast strain on average. Only one of the yeast strains, namely YHR011W, has less than two cells, and thus the whole strain was removed from further analysis. We also removed 55 strains that have mislocalized proteins due to the GFP tags <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Huh1">[1]</xref>, and 34 strains that have invalid ORFs according to SGD (see <bold>Datasets</bold>).

The evaluation process was repeated five times with different random selections of reference cell sets, and we chose the set of P-profiles with the highest average accuracy in classifying the 2654 ORFs to represent protein subcellular localization (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s005">Fig. S2B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Affinity propagation is an algorithm that identifies representative data points, called “exemplars”, and forms clusters of data points around these exemplars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003504-Frey1">[29]</xref>. It starts by considering all data points as potential exemplars, and exchange messages between data points until convergence of a set of exemplars or clusters. Preferences of data points are used to control the number of selected exemplars. Low or high preference values lead to low or high numbers of clusters, respectively. To cluster P-profiles, we used the same preference values for all data points, and varied the values to determine the optimum number of clusters (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003504.s006">Fig. S3A</xref></bold>).
