        <p>Co-infections alter the host immune response but how the systemic and local processes at the site of infection interact is still unclear. The majority of studies on co-infections concentrate on one of the infecting species, an immune function or group of cells and often focus on the initial phase of the infection. Here, we used a combination of experiments and mathematical modelling to investigate the network of immune responses against single and co-infections with the respiratory bacterium <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic> and the gastrointestinal helminth <italic>Trichostrongylus retortaeformis</italic>. Our goal was to identify representative mediators and functions that could capture the essence of the host immune response as a whole, and to assess how their relative contribution dynamically changed over time and between single and co-infected individuals. Network-based discrete dynamic models of single infections were built using current knowledge of bacterial and helminth immunology; the two single infection models were combined into a co-infection model that was then verified by our empirical findings. Simulations showed that a T helper cell mediated antibody and neutrophil response led to phagocytosis and clearance of <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> from the lungs. This was consistent in single and co-infection with no significant delay induced by the helminth. In contrast, <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> intensity decreased faster when co-infected with the bacterium. Simulations suggested that the robust recruitment of neutrophils in the co-infection, added to the activation of IgG and eosinophil driven reduction of larvae, which also played an important role in single infection, contributed to this fast clearance. Perturbation analysis of the models, through the knockout of individual nodes (immune cells), identified the cells critical to parasite persistence and clearance both in single and co-infections. Our integrated approach captured the within-host immuno-dynamics of bacteria-helminth infection and identified key components that can be crucial for explaining individual variability between single and co-infections in natural populations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Infections with different infecting agents can alter the immune response against any one parasite and the relative abundance and persistence of the infections within the host. This is because the immune system is not compartmentalized but acts as a whole to allow the host to maintain control of the infections as well as repair damaged tissues and avoid immuno-pathology. There is no comprehensive understanding of the immune responses during co-infections and of how systemic and local mechanisms interact. Here we integrated experimental data with mathematical modelling to describe the network of immune responses of single and co-infection by a respiratory bacterium and a gastrointestinal helminth. We were able to identify key cells and functions responsible for clearing or reducing both parasites and showed that some mechanisms differed between type of infection as a result of different signal outputs and cells contributing to the immune processes. This study highlights the importance of understanding the immuno-dynamics of co-infection as a host response, how immune mechanisms differ from single infections and how they may alter parasite persistence, impact and abundance.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hosts that are immunologically challenged by one infection often show increased susceptibility to a second infectious agent, whether a micro- or a macro-parasite. Changes in the immune status and polarization of the response towards one parasite can indeed facilitate the establishment and survival of a second parasitic species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Cox1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Graham1">[3]</xref>. At the level of the individual host, this can be described as an immune system that has to optimize the specificity and effectiveness of the responses against different infections while engaging in secondary but equally important functions, like tissue repair or avoiding immuno-pathology. Systemic cross-regulatory processes and bystander effects by T helper cells (Th) maintain control of these functions both at the systemic and local level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Brady1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Thakar1">[8]</xref>. Concurrent parasite infections are regulated by and affect these mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Cattadori1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Brady1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Figueiredo1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Stewart1">[14]</xref>. They can also influence each other directly, when sharing the same tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Haukisalmi1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Stock1">[16]</xref> or through the immune system via passive effects or active manipulation of the immune components, if colonizing different organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Brady1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Figueiredo1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Stewart1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Empirical work on bacteria-macroparasite co-infections has often found that the development of a Th2 mediated response towards the helminth leads to a reduction of the protective Th1 cytokine response against the bacteria and a more severe bacteria-induced pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Brady1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Fox1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Stewart1">[14]</xref>, although a decrease of tissue atrophy has also been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Khan1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Wang1">[18]</xref>. The suppression of Th1 cell proliferation acts both on the inductors and effectors and is mainly driven by the repression of the IFNγ mediated inflammatory activity during the early stages of the infection. However, the degree of the T helper cell polarization and the kinetics of effectors depend on the type, intensity and duration of the co-infection, over and above the very initial immune status of the host. Since host immunity is both a major selective pressure for parasite transmission and host susceptibility to re-infections, the presence of one infection can have major consequences for the spread and persistence of the second infection. For example, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> induces more severe disease when concurrent with intestinal helminths, suggesting increased host infectiousness and bacterial transmission compared to single infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Stewart1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Understanding how the infection by a second parasite species can influence the network of immune processes and the polarization towards one of the infecting agents requires the quantification of the immune components both at the systemic level and at the local site of infection, and the ability to follow the kinetics of these processes over time. The immunology of co-infection often considers the Th1/Th2 paradigm a tractable simplification of the overall immune response and its main functions. Yet, this approach tells us only half of the story, namely the systemic component. Indeed, organ compartmentalization and tissue specificity create well defined host-parasite environments that contribute to, as well as are modulated by, the immune system as a whole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Holmgren1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Matzinger1">[20]</xref>. This brings us to the questions: what are the key processes and components that capture the essence of immune mediated parasite interactions in co-infections? And, how do these differ from single infections?</p>
      <p>To address these questions we used a combination of laboratory experiments and network-based discrete dynamic modelling, and examined changes in the immune response against single and co-infection with the respiratory bacterium <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic> and the gastrointestinal helminth <italic>Trichostrongylus retortaeformis</italic>, two common infections of the European rabbit (<italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>). Both parasites cause persistent infections that occur with high prevalence and intensity in free-living rabbit populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Cattadori2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Pathak1">[22]</xref>. <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> is a gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the respiratory tract through oral-nasal transmission and usually results in asymptomatic infections. <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> has been largely isolated in wildlife, pets and livestock but rarely in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Gueirard1">[23]</xref> where it is out-competed by the human-specific <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> and <italic>Bordetella parapertussis</italic>, the etiological agents of whooping cough <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Mattoo1">[24]</xref>. Previous empirical and modelling work in a murine system showed that the bacterium induces anti-inflammatory responses by modulating Th regulation, thereby facilitating bacterial establishment and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Thakar1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Pilione1">[25]</xref>. However, hosts successfully counteract the pathogen mediated inhibitions by activating a protective Th1 cell mediated IFNγ response, which leads to bacterial clearance from the lower respiratory tract, but not the nasal cavity, via Fc receptor mediated phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Pilione1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Kirimanjeswara1">[27]</xref>. Our recent laboratory studies of rabbits infected with <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> agree with the general findings of bacterial clearance from the lower respiratory tract but persistence in the nasal cavity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Pathak2">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The gastrointestinal helminth <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> has a direct life cycle and colonizes the small intestine following ingestion of pasture contaminated with infective third stage larvae (L3). The majority of larvae settle in the duodenum where they develop into adults in about 11 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Audebert1">[29]</xref>. A model of the seasonal dynamics of the <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic>-rabbit interaction suggested that acquired immunity develops proportionally to the accumulated exposure to infection and successfully reduces helminth intensity in older hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Cattadori2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Cornell1">[30]</xref>. These results were recently confirmed by challenging laboratory rabbits with a primary infection of <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> where the quick production of antibodies and eosinophils was associated with the consistent reduction but not complete clearance of the helminth by 120 days post challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Murphy1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Based on previous studies on bacteria-macroparasite co-infections and our recent work on the rabbit system, we hypothesized that during a <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic>-<italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> co-infection the presence of helminths will delay bacterial clearance from the respiratory tract but there will be no change in helminth abundance in the small intestine. We predicted a <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> mediated Th2 polarization at the systemic level and a bystander effect in the distal respiratory tract. This will have suppressed IFNγ, resulting in the enhancement of bacterial intensity and deferred clearance in the lower respiratory tract compared to single infection. We also expected the Th2 systemic environment to control helminth abundance but not to change the numbers compared to the single infection. To examine our hypothesis, laboratory data on single infections were used to build discrete dynamic models describing the immune processes generated in response to each infection. The two single infection models were then connected through the cross-modulation of Th cells and the cytokine network at the systemic level, and allowed to reflect changes in these interactions at the local level. The resulting co-infection model and the dynamics of the parasites were finally compared with our laboratory experiment of bacteria-helminth co-infection to confirm the correctness of the model. Lastly, we examined the robustness of the immune networks with respect to the deactivation of single immune nodes by simulated knockout laboratory experiments. In other words, we tested the role of a large number of immune components, how their knockout affected the dynamics of infection and how the system converged into a potentially novel stable state. This allowed us to elucidate the immune key mechanisms and pathways behind the observed dynamics and the relative differences between single and co-infection.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The causal interactions between the immune components activated by <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> and <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> were assembled in the form of two distinct pathogen-specific networks of immune responses. The network of interactions against <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> was based on the infection in the lungs, the crucial organ for bacterial clearance, and constructed following Thakar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Thakar1">[8]</xref> and the current knowledge of the dynamics of <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> infection in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). There is a rich literature on the immunology of gastrointestinal helminth infections and important general features can be identified despite the fact that these mechanisms are often species-specific. The immune network against <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> was built on the knowledge of helminth infections in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Anthony1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Allen1">[7]</xref> and focused on the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine), where the majority of <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> colonization and immune activity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Audebert1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Murphy1">[31]</xref>. Both networks were characterized by two connected compartments: Compartment I represented the immune interactions at the local site of infection, the lungs or duodenum, while Compartment II described the systemic site of T and B cell activation and differentiation, for example, the lymph node.</p>

      <p>The networks were then developed into discrete dynamic models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Assmann1">[32]</xref>. Discrete dynamic modelling has been proven to be a feasible and useful approach to qualitatively characterize systems where the detailed information necessary for quantitative models is lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Assmann1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Glass1">[33]</xref>. For our purpose to examine the pattern of immune responses to single and co-infection at the local and systemic level and, importantly, to highlight key interactions and cells that generated the pattern observed, the framework of the discrete dynamic Boolean model appeared to be a robust and tractable choice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Bornholdt1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Chaves1">[36]</xref>, given that the kinetics and timescales of many of the immune interactions is unknown in the rabbit system. Each node (e.g. immune cell) was categorized by two qualitative states, ON and OFF, which are determined from the regulation of the focal node by upstream nodes given in the network. This regulation is given by a Boolean transfer function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Assmann1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Bornholdt1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Thakar2">[35]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, and Supplement <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002345.s003">Text S1</xref>). The nodes in the ON state are assumed to be above an implicit threshold that can be defined as the concentration necessary to activate downstream immune processes; below this threshold the node is in an OFF state. To follow the dynamical status of the system through time, we repeatedly applied the Boolean transfer functions for each node until a steady state (i.e. clearance of the pathogen) was found. To determine the node consensus activity over time (i.e. the time course of cell concentration or parasite numbers shared by multiple trajectories) we ran the simulations 100 times by randomly sampling timescales and plotted each node activity profile, defined as the proportion of simulations in which the node is in the ON state as a function of time (additional details in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Saadatpour1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Zhang1">[38]</xref>. This procedure is similar to characterizing the consensus behaviour of a population of infected hosts that exhibit individual-to-individual variation.</p>
      <p>To construct the single infection models, we formulated the Boolean transfer functions from the current knowledge of the immune regulatory processes and in case of ambiguity we iteratively modified the transfer function by comparing the simulated dynamic output with our empirical results on single infection and with immune knockout studies (a detailed example is reported in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Finally, to examine the relative importance of the immune components, we perturbed each node by setting their status to OFF and monitored parasite activity up to the time-step required for parasite clearance/reduction in the unperturbed system. Any increase in the infection activity following the knockout of an immune node -which may cascade to the connected downstream nodes- indicated the importance of this node for parasite clearance. Nodes whose deactivation led to long term persistence, represented by parasite activity equal to 1, were classified as essential for clearance. This procedure allowed us to mimic laboratory experiments of single immune component knockouts and to follow the consequences on parasite clearance.</p>

        <title><italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> single infection</title>
        <p>The infection of <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> was simulated by setting the state of the infective larvae node ON and the immune nodes OFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). Ingested larvae were either killed by eosinophils, in a probabilistic manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Abraham1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Brattig1">[41]</xref>, or successfully developed into adults. Adults started to appear after 2 time-steps, mimicking the natural development of infective third stage larvae into adults. Following the infection, IFNγ rapidly peaked after two time steps while IL4 and IL10 activation followed with a delay, in line with empirical findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g005"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Murphy1">[31]</xref>. The initial vigorous expression of IFNγ was driven by dendritic cells, probably as an inflammatory response to the infiltration of microflora and bacteria into the damaged mucosa during the establishment of larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Murphy1">[31]</xref>. This was modelled by turning the activity of the local IFNγ ON if sufficiently stimulated by dendritic cells; the subsequent IFNγ activation occurred through a Th1 cell response. For the interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, the fraction of IFNγ activity that occurred from 0 to 1 was due to a Th1 response while above 1 was caused by dendritic cells. Dendritic cells also activated the Th2 cell mediated expression of IL4 and as this arm of the immune response developed, IFNγ decreased although remained in an active state throughout the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g005"><bold>Fig. 5B</bold></xref>). IL10 expression was relatively low and similar to IL4, as found in our experimental results. Naïve T cell-initiated B cell proliferation stimulated the prompt increase of mucus IgA, IgE and IgG above the activation threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>). The consequent recruitment of neutrophils, along with IgG, led to the reduction but not clearance of adult helminths, consistent with the empirical observation that a few individuals still harboured helminths in the duodenum at 120 days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>). Unlike IgA, whose activity followed the dynamics of <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> abundance, IgG activity remained persistently high. In contrast to the small and short-lived neutrophil peak, the eosinophil activity was higher and lasted longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>).</p>

        <p>The stability of the immune pathways and the reliability of our parsimonious model were explored by systematically knocking out network nodes and examining the effects on the activity of the adult helminth node at the 20<sup>th</sup> time-step, the time point when the unperturbed system reaches equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>). None of the perturbations led to an activity of the adult parasite node of less than 0.3, indicating that <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> persists in the rabbit and this is a robust outcome of the model, which matches our empirical observations. Simulations suggested that the individual knockout of 14 nodes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL13, naïve T cells, dendritic cells, eosinophils and neutrophils led to helminth persistence in all the simulations (i.e. adult activity equal to 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>). Interestingly, deletion of either local or systemic IL4 (IL4I or IL4II) reduced parasite activity, as IL4 contributed to inhibit neutrophils (via the inhibition of the IL12 node). To identify the nodes that may lead to faster reduction or clearance of <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> we constitutively turned ON single nodes. Over-expression of recruited eosinophils, IL5, neutrophils and Th2 cells in the small intestine reduced parasite activity below 0.5 (results not shown). These and the knockout simulations suggested that neutrophils and eosinophils are critically involved in the clearance of <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> infection.</p>

          <title>Network modelling</title>
          <p>To explicitly quantify the interactions between <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> and <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> the two single immune networks were connected and the co-infection network simulated as a single entity without changing the Boolean rules built for the single networks, except for the adjustments necessary for assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g006"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>). The link between networks was established through the cytokines, which maintain the communication between the systemic and local immune processes as well as the cross-interactions between infections. Specifically, we assumed a single unlimited pool of naive T cells and three pools of cytokines: a pool in the lungs, a pool in the small intestine (duodenum) and a systemic pool interacting with both infections. For example, we assumed that only one pool of IL4 and IL12 exists in the systemic compartment although antigen specific cells, polarized towards bacteria or helminths, can produce these cytokines. In other words, IL12 induced by bacterial factors can inhibit IL4 production by helminth-specific Th2 cells. Local cytokine expression can be affected by mucosal immune components, parasite intensity and the systemic cytokine response. These assumptions allowed us to take into account the compartmentalization of the infections (i.e. lungs and duodenum) as well as bystander effects of the immune response and the balance of the immune system as a whole. The dynamics of the simulated immune components and associated parasite activity were then compared with the empirical co-infection results.</p>

          <p>Simulations showed the switch of cytokines from the initial high expression of IFNγ and IL10 to the late increase and long activity of IL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g007"><bold>Fig. 7B</bold></xref>). Antibodies quickly increased, serum IgG remained consistently high while IgA decreased below the threshold after 5 time-steps as bacterial numbers declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g007"><bold>Fig. 7C</bold></xref>). The peripheral neutrophil activity was higher in co-infected compared to single infected hosts, however, their recruitment in the lungs was completely turned off after 14 time steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g007"><bold>Fig. 7D</bold></xref> <italic>vs</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>). These temporal patterns resulted from the inflammatory cytokines produced in response to both <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> and <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> and should be interpreted as a mixed activity against both parasites. Our simulations indicated similarities between <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> single and co-infection, such as the rapid increase in systemic IgA, IgG and neutrophils but also differences, namely, the higher and longer activity of IL4 in the lungs and the longer presence of peripheral neutrophils in dual compared to single infection. Overall, despite a few immunological differences the dynamics and timing of <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> clearance in the lungs of co-infected hosts was similar to that observed in the single infection and driven by phagocytic cells activated by antibodies and Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g007"><bold>Fig. 7A</bold></xref>). The low but non-zero activity of bacteria in the co-infection steady state indicated that the infection was not cleared in a small fraction of the replicate simulations (8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g007"><bold>Fig. 7A</bold></xref>). Specifically, IL4 activated by eosinophils in response to <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> was responsible for the persistence of bacteria in the lungs. During single bacterial infection the IL4 level was relatively low and controlled by the inhibitory effect of IL12, however, during the co-infection this suppressive effect was not observed as a Th2 environment dominated. This model prediction is supported by previous studies that showed a delayed bacterial clearance in case of persistent IL4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Boyd1">[42]</xref>. Knockout perturbation analysis confirmed that IL4 produced by eosinophils was responsible for this occasional bacterial persistence, since the deletion of this node led to the complete clearance of the infection in all the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). Bacterial persistence was also observed when Th1 cells, antibodies, pro-inflammatory cytokines or the activated phagocytes node were individually knocked out. The 15 nodes whose deletion had very little effect in the single infection had a similarly weak effect on bacterial numbers in the co-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref> <italic>vs</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g004"><bold>4B</bold></xref>). Interestingly and contrary to the single infection, the knockout of bacteria-activated epithelial cells did not influence <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> activity since the pro-inflammatory cytokines node, which is downstream of the epithelial cells node, was also activated by the helminths. This between-organ communication was possible by assuming a single pool of cytokines and their free movement among organs, for example via the blood system. Perturbation of any of the 17 helminth-specific nodes had a generally weak effect on bacterial activity.</p>

          <p>The concurrent effect of <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> on <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> infection dynamics was equally examined. Counter to our initial predictions, lower establishment and faster clearance of <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> were observed in co-infected compared to single infected hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g008"><bold>Fig. 8A</bold></xref> <italic>vs</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g005"><bold>5A</bold></xref>). The model showed high activities of IFNγ and IL10 and low expression of IL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g008"><bold>Fig. 8B</bold></xref>). As observed in the single infection, the early peak of IFNγ (having activity &gt;1) was caused by an initial host-mediated inflammatory response, as an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction of the tissue to the establishment of infective larvae. This local activation was then followed by a Th1 mediated IFNγ expression, consistent with the single infection model. A bystander Th1 mediated effect of <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> synergistically contributed to this pattern by enhancing the activity and duration of IFNγ expression in the duodenum. Simulations suggested that the local IL10 expression, higher in the dual compared to the single infection, was a bystander effect induced by the type three secretion system (TTSS) of <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> through Treg cells. Also, the early IL4 expression was suppressed by the Th1 mediated IFNγ phenotype activated both by the helminth, during the initial establishment, and the bacterial co-infection. Mucus IgG remained consistently active from time step 3 while mucus IgA was at the highest between 5 and 10 time steps but decreased thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g008"><bold>Fig. 8C</bold></xref>). Recruited peripheral neutrophils but not eosinophils were higher in the dual infection compared to single helminth infection simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g008"><bold>Fig. 8D</bold></xref>).</p>

          <p>To provide a parsimonious mechanism that could explain the rapid helminth clearance, the immune nodes of the co-infection network were systematically knocked out and the helminth activity examined at the 20<sup>th</sup> time-step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g004"><bold>Fig. 4D</bold></xref>). Similar to the single infection, the deactivation of key nodes, for instance B cells, dendritic cells or T cells, resulted in helminth persistence in all the simulations (adult activity equal to 1). Unlike in the single infection, knockout of resident eosinophils or the IL12II node did not lead to helminth persistence. This was because the induction of downstream processes, such as the activation of IL4 or IFNγ was now performed through the complementary effect of the bacterial nodes and their bystander effects. Interestingly, the single knockout of 92% of the nodes, including bacterium-specific nodes, increased helminth activity, compared to the unperturbed co-infection model, but did not lead to helminth persistence in every simulation. From a modelling perspective, the network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g006">Fig. 6</xref> represents a sparse causal model of co-infection dynamics. In other words, all these nodes or nodes downstream of the targeted nodes contribute to, but are not required for, <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> clearance. The knockout of effector nodes namely, recruited eosinophils or neutrophils and cytokines like IL5 or IL13, resulted in helminth long term persistence, supporting the hypothesis that a co-operative mechanism including leukocytes, antigen-specific antibodies (IgG and IgE) and Th2 mediated IL5 and IL13 are critical in helminth clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Bancroft1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Behm1">[49]</xref>. The role of IL5 and IL13 is mostly in the recruitment of eosinophils while neutrophils are recruited by pro-inflammatory cytokines and Th1 mediated IFNγ. Though antibodies recognize the helminth, in this model they do not form complexes, rather, they attract leukocytes bearing Fc-receptors leading to the recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils.</p>
          <p>A comparison between single and dual infection offers insights into the contribution and balance of these two leukocytes to <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> dynamics. In the single infection, when neutrophils are only transiently activated, the recruited eosinophils were relatively more important to parasite reduction, although they were not sufficient to clear the infection. In the co-infection, the robust and early activation of recruited neutrophils -which decreased following helminth reduction- and the activation of recruited eosinophils -which are important in reducing the number of infecting larvae and are required for neutrophils to successfully reduce the helminths- highlighted the synergistic role of these cells in the observed fast clearance of <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic>. To explicitly study the bacterial components inducing these two leukocytes, we switched the nodes to ON one at a time and found that dendritic cells and Th1 cells, activated by bacteria, led to a significant increase in neutrophil activity (results not shown). Counter to this, no bacterial nodes significantly contributed to eosinophil production. Switching ON the type III secretion system node transiently increased eosinophil activity, compared to the unperturbed system, as expected from the role of TTSS in the induction of Th2 related cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Pilione1">[25]</xref>. However, this had a very short lived effect since TTSS was neutralized by antibodies. In summary, simulations suggest that strong inflammatory responses generated by the bacteria led to an early increase of neutrophils which contributed to a prompt and more effective helminth reduction.</p>

        <title>Empirical co-infection experiment</title>
        <p>A <italic>B. bronchiseptica-T. retortaeformis</italic> co-infection experiment was carried out and the empirical results were used to validate the co-infection dynamic model. A statistical analysis was also performed between the single and co-infection trials to further reinforce our modelling outputs. However, while the statistical findings provide an insight into the relationships among the immune components, no mechanistic understanding or dynamic outcomes can be established between these variables and parasite abundance. The network-based discrete dynamic models allowed us to establish such connections and causal interactions between the various components. Overall, we found that the parsimonious dynamic model correctly predicted the observed dynamics of concurrent <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> and <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> co-infection.</p>

          <p>The bacterial colonization of the respiratory tract of co-infected rabbits was similar to single infection. <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> abundance in the lungs increased in the first 7 days post challenge and decreased thereafter, as seen in the dynamic model; by 90 days bacteria were completely cleared from the lungs and trachea but persisted in the nasal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g009"><bold>Fig. 9A</bold></xref>). Based on the <italic>a priori</italic> measurement of optical density with a spectrophotometer, individuals received a dose similar to the single infection however, the <italic>a posteriori</italic> quantification of bacteria on blood agar plates suggested that an inoculum of 10,600 CFU/ml was administered, five times less than the single infection dose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Pathak2">[28]</xref>. If we consider the second measure correct, the lower dose did not affect replication and the colony numbers quickly reached values comparable to single infection by 3–7 days post challenge. Specifically, the average number of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract was analogous to the single infection but significantly higher numbers were observed in the nasal cavity during the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g009"><bold>Fig. 9A</bold></xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002345-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Confirming the model simulations, IFNγ quickly increased, peaked by 3 days post challenge and quickly decreased thereafter. IL10 followed a similar pattern with a small delay while IL4 slowly increased and peaked 60 days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g009"><bold>Fig. 9B</bold></xref>). Serum antibodies showed a trend similar to that of the single infection, in accordance with our dynamic model. IgG rapidly increased and remained high throughout the experiment while IgA rapidly decreased although a second peak was observed around week twelve, this second peak was based on much fewer individuals and, probably, it was not biologically relevant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g009"><bold>Fig. 9C</bold></xref>). Peripheral leukocytes concentration reflected the response to both infections specifically, neutrophil numbers showed a robust peak at week three while eosinophil numbers increased between two and five weeks post-infection, both in agreement with the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g009"><bold>Fig. 9D</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g010"><bold>Fig. 10D</bold></xref>).</p>

It is important to note that a low or negative cytokine Ct value (cycle threshold scaled over the controls) identifies high mRNA expression and vice versa, thus in the models low Ct values are translated as high cytokine activity. The remaining variables were not significant, although this should not be interpreted as a complete lack of variability between the two infections. Indeed, as highlighted in the network model these variables play a secondary but still necessary role in generating immune differences between infections.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Co-infections affect the immune responses but how the systemic processes interact and influence the kinetics at the local sites of infection is still unclear. The majority of studies on the immunology of co-infection have focused on either one of the infecting species or a restricted class of cells or immune processes, and often concentrated on the early stage of the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Brady1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Figueiredo1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Stewart1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Jackson1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Geiger1">[52]</xref>. These studies have been extremely useful in highlighting not only the similarities across systems but also the specificity of some of these mechanisms and how they differ from single infections. Yet, there is a need for a comprehensive understanding of these processes as a whole individual response, how systemic and localized processes interact and how they dynamically evolve during the course of the co-infection. We used a combination of laboratory experiments and modelling to examine the dynamic network of immune responses to the respiratory bacterium <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> and the gastrointestinal helminth <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic>. Our aim was to identify the parsimonious processes and key cells driving parasite reduction or clearance and how they changed between single and co-infections.</p>
      <p>We confirmed the initial hypothesis of immune mediated interactions between the two parasites, however, our initial predictions were only partially supported. The most unexpected result was the faster clearance of <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> in co-infected compared to single infected individuals, which was observed in the model simulations and confirmed in the empirical data. Neither did we expect to find that <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> infection in the lungs was not significantly altered by the concurrent helminth infection, despite the increase in local IL4 expression observed in both the simulations and the experiment. We found a small difference in bacterial clearance between single and co-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref> <italic>vs</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g007"><bold>Fig. 7A</bold></xref>) and we were able to explain that this was driven by the differential recruitment of phagocytes, particularly macrophages induced by IFNγ during co-infections, as compared to the single infection. However we found that <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> enhanced individual variability in the immune response to <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> infection by occasionally reducing the overall efficacy of the Th1 immune response, through eosinophil produced IL4, and preventing bacterial clearance in the lungs, a pattern observed in 8% of the simulations. The helminth mediated delay or absence of bacterial clearance from the lower respiratory tract was indeed our original hypothesis and interestingly the model indicated that this is still a possible outcome of the interaction between these parasites. This implies that heterogeneities in the host immune response are not exceptional events and can have major effects on the dynamics of infection and persistence. Our model was able to capture this variability because of the large number of simulations; in other words a large group of infected individuals were examined compared to our much smaller sample tested in the laboratory. Follow-up experiments using a much larger number of animals or replication of the same experiment a few times may lead to the experimental observation of this behaviour. The empirical findings also showed that <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> infection resulted in a significant increase of bacterial numbers in the nasal cavity compared to single infection, particularly after the initial phase of the infection. At the host population level these findings support the hypothesis that co-infections can increase individual variability to infections by altering bacterial intensity and prevalence, and this can have major consequences for the risk of transmission and disease outbreak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Graham2">[53]</xref>. Overall, our dynamic models indicated that the clearance of <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> in single and co-infection was mainly driven by phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages and neutrophils activated by antibodies. Deactivating nodes that affected bacterial recognition (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines, epithelial cells or antibodies) or phagocytosis (e.g. Ag-Ab complex or macrophages) increased bacterial abundance in single and dual infections, suggesting that these cells are necessary for controlling <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic>.</p>
      <p>The immune network for <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> was less detailed than that for the bacterial network, nevertheless, the model predictions of the activity pattern of the helminth and the immune variables that have been quantified were in agreement with our empirical studies. To our surprise the prediction of no effect of <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> on <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> infection was proven wrong. Simulations suggested that the combined effect of neutrophils, eosinophils and antibodies (IgG and IgE) led to helminth expulsion. Neutrophils and eosinophils were activated through antigen-specific Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively. Th2-mediated differentiation of progenitor eosinophils (i.e. resident eosinophils), modulated by IL5 and IL13, also played an important role in helminth reduction in single infection, as indicated by the perturbation results. Previous studies on murine systems have shown that IL13 can complement IL4 or play an alternative or even stronger role in helminth infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Boyd1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Bancroft1">[43]</xref>. Using our modelling approach we showed that IL5 and IL13 had complementary abilities against helminths and contributed to parasite reduction both in single and co-infection. The strategic role of neutrophils in bacteria-helminth co-infections has been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Finkelman1">[44]</xref>; using a modelling approach not only we confirmed this property but also suggested a non-specific infiltration of effector cells into infected tissues.</p>
      <p>The mixed Th1/Th2 response in the duodenum was driven by different processes. The early IFNγ inflammatory signal observed both in single and co-infection was a host response to the mucosa damage by helminth establishment, and probably bacteria and microflora infiltration from the lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Murphy1">[31]</xref>. This was also complemented by a bystander effect of <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> co-infection, rather than a helminth induced up-regulation of this cytokine to facilitate tissue colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Murphy1">[31]</xref>. This mechanism is supported by our recent studies on cytokine expression in different organs of single and co-infected rabbits at seven days post infection, where we showed that IFNγ was remarkably reduced in the ileum, mesenteric lymph node and spleen, where fewer or no helminths were found, compared to the duodenum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Pathak3">[54]</xref>. The Th2 cell activity was primarily focused on preventing parasite establishment and survival. These findings indicate that these two cytokines are not mutually exclusive but can simultaneously act on different tasks specifically, tissue repair, inflammatory response to microflora infiltration and helminth clearance. Mixed Th1/Th2 phenotypes are not new to parasite infections and the murine-<italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> or <italic>Trichuris muris</italic> systems are well described examples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Xu1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Grencis1">[57]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Model strengths and limitations</title>
        <p>The aim of this study was to develop tractable dynamic models that could capture the interactions of multi-organ, multi-species co-infection immune processes as well as single infection dynamics. We found the discrete dynamic Boolean models a feasible and reliable approach for this task since we lacked accurate spatio-temporal details on the majority of the variables and the kinetic parameters required to develop robust quantitative, differential equation-based models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Bornholdt1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Chaves1">[36]</xref>. Boolean models assume that what matters the most is whether the concentration or level of expression of a node (i.e. immune cell) is higher or lower than an <italic>a priori</italic> fixed threshold. They also use a parameter-free combinatorial description for the change in status of the nodes, thus avoid the need for parameter estimation while being sufficiently flexible. Indeed, Boolean models have been successfully used in a variety of contexts, from signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Zhang1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Li1">[58]</xref> to development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-EspinosaSoto1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Sanchez1">[60]</xref>, immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Thakar1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Thakar3">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Beyer1">[62]</xref> and population-level networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Campbell1">[63]</xref>. Choosing a quantitative modelling approach would have forced us to drastically simplify our system, impose a large number of assumptions on the concentration, transfer function and kinetic parameter of each node, and so we would have not been able to offer robust predictions on the role of many immune components and on how they affect the dynamics of parasite infection in our system.</p>
        <p>Our models were based on the most updated knowledge of the immune components and processes during single infections to <italic>Bordetella</italic> and gastrointestinal helminths. In cases of uncertainty (e.g. whether two co-regulators were independent or synergistic) we tested a number of different assumptions (i.e. Boolean transfer functions) and selected the function that best described our single infection experiments in terms of the: timing of events, node activities and importantly, parasite steady state (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for an example). To overcome the fact that timescales and duration of immune processes were unknown, we generated repeated simulations with various update orders, which essentially allowed us the sampling of various time durations and probing which model output was robust to timing uncertainties. Importantly, the outputs of our simulations were not averages but the quantification of the agreement between runs, for example, the anti-<italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> IgG activity of 1 after step 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g003">Fig. 3C</xref> means that following this time point all runs show an above-threshold concentration of IgG regardless of timing variations. By comparing the features of the curves (e.g. saturating shape, peak occurrence and timing) with our experimental observations we were able to confirm the accuracy of the model in predicting the observed kinetics.</p>
        <p>One of the strengths of our modelling was to make predictions on the dynamics of parasite clearance based on the perturbation of the nodes (i.e. single node knockout). These simulations followed the classical knockout lab experiments where single immune components (nodes) were turned off from the beginning of the simulation and the dynamics of the immune response, as well as parasite clearance, were examined. This approach allowed us to explore the knockout of a large number of immune variables, determine the most important components modulating the immune response and highlight how they differed between single and co-infection. These findings can be tested in the laboratory by performing knockout experiments of the crucial immune variables in different infection settings. For example, we can block neutrophil production or the cytokine IL13 and examine whether helminths persist -as predicted by our knockout simulations- or are slowly cleared in bacteria co-infected rabbits. Similarly, we can test the predicted different response of knocking out IL4 in helminth and bacteria-helminth co-infection, specifically, whether clearance is higher than in un-manipulated individuals in single helminth infection and lower than in un-manipulated co-infected hosts. We should also pay more attention to <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> infection in the nasal cavity and develop dynamic immune models that can explain bacterial persistence as well as possible clearance under different knockout scenarios both in single and co-infection. The most parsimonious hypotheses can then be tested in the laboratory. This is important because our recent work suggested that bacterial shedding during the long lasting chronic phase relies mainly on the infection of the upper respiratory tract, once it has been cleared from the lungs and trachea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Pathak2">[28]</xref>. This has relevant epidemiological implications for bacterial transmission that go beyond the rabbit-parasite system. We can further refine our models and explore the dynamics of the parasite-immune network when the onset of the co-infections is lagged between the parasite species or one parasite is trickle dosed, a dynamic that resembles more closely to the natural conditions. Again, these predictions can be validated through experimental infections of naïve or knockout animals. It is important to underline that our approach can be adapted to a large variety of bacteria-helminth co-infections of many host systems where organ compartmentalization, differences in the time of infection or number of parasite stages are observed.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we showed that network-based discrete dynamic models are a useful approach to describe the immune mediated dynamics of co-infections. These models are robust as well as sufficiently tractable to qualitatively capture the complexity of the immune system and its kinetics over time. Arguably, the main limitation of our modelling approach is that it lacks a fully quantitative component. Yet, this work demonstrated that it is possible to build comprehensive qualitative dynamic models of the local and systemic immune network of single and co-infection that are validated by empirical observations. Importantly, this study is a fundamental starting point towards the future construction of quantitative models based on simplified networks that describe the kinetics and intensities of the causal relationships among key immune components identified in qualitative models. Our approach showed that we can refine the conventional approach of using the Th1/Th2 paradigm, by identifying system-specific functions or cell groups that can capture crucial immune processes during co-infections. While our parsimonious dynamical models were able to capture the patterns of single and co-infection observed in the experiments, we are aware that they are far from complete in describing the immunological complexity of the processes involved and cells activated. Nevertheless, they provide a parsimonious description of the system that can be experimentally tested. Ultimately, we showed that we cannot predict how the immune system reacts to co-infections based on our knowledge of single infection. More needs to be done to clarify the immune mechanisms involved in bacteria-helminth co-infections and how individual hosts balance the immune system as a whole.</p>

          <p>Interaction networks were built from the available literature and adapted to our system. Bacteria, helminth and the components of the immune system (i.e. immune cells and cytokines) were represented as network nodes; interactions, regulatory relationships and transformations among components were described as directed edges starting from the source node (regulator) and ending in the target node. We incorporated regulatory relationships that modulate a process (or an unspecified process mediator) as edges directed toward another edge. The regulatory effect of each edge was classified into activation or inhibition, visually represented by an incoming black arrow or an incoming red blunt segment. Since not all processes involved in natural <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> and <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> infections are known or generally addressed in the rabbit infection model, we extended the set of known interactions following general immunological knowledge on bacterial and helminth infections. We constructed three networks: two networks that describe the respective single infections and one that links the first two and represents a co-infection network. A detailed description of each network is given below.</p>

          <title><italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> single infection</title>
          <p>Infection of the lungs starts with the node Bacteria that leads to a cascade of immune interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002345.s003">Text S1</xref></bold>). This node includes generic virulence factors of the bacteria such as the lipopolysaccharide chain (LPS) required for tissue adherence following recognition of bacteria by epithelial cells. Other bacterial virulence factors, particularly O-antigen and type III secretion system (TTSS), are explicitly included as separate nodes in the network and are involved in the initial immune recognition of the bacteria node. Upon detection, epithelial cells activate pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn activate dendritic cells, often the most important antigen presenting cells. Dendritic cells are also activated by IFNγ. Dendritic cells induce differentiation of naïve T cells (T0) by producing IL4 and IL12. The cytokine profile along with the antigen leads to the activation of T cell subtypes including helper and regulatory T cells. T helper cells are activated in the lymph nodes (Compartment II) and subsequently transported to the site of infection (Compartment I). IL4 is also produced by differentiated Th2 cells; IL4 and IL12 inhibit each other and IL4 also inhibits IFNγ. T regulatory (Treg) cells are stimulated by the type III secretion system of <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> to produce IL10. Th1 cells produce IFNγ which along with pro-inflammatory cytokines activates neutrophils and macrophages. A different subtype of T cells, follicular T helper cells, is known to stimulate B cell activation. To simplify the network we assumed that naïve T cells could play this role. Antigen-specific B cell proliferation leads to the production of antibodies, namely IgG and IgA. IgA production occurs only in the direct presence of antigen unlike IgG that persists after bacterial clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Pathak2">[28]</xref>. IgG and bacteria complexes also induce complement fixation along with bacteria themselves. Activation of complement by bacteria is inhibited by O-antigen. The node “activated phagocytic cells” represents the outcome of the stimulation of neutrophils and macrophages by antibody-antigen complex and complement. These cells induce the node phagocytosis that depletes bacteria.</p>

          <title><italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> single infection</title>
          <p>The network starts with infective larvae that develop into adults with no delay in the larval-adult development, adults appear 2 time steps post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002345.s003">Text S1</xref></bold>). Both parasite stages activate epithelial cells that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which then activate dendritic cells and neutrophils, with the latter able to inhibit adult helminths. Infective larvae stimulate IL13 production by resident eosinophils and these recruit additional eosinophils from the progenitor cells in the peripheral blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Campbell1">[63]</xref>. Eosinophils can kill larvae through a stochastic process described by a uniform distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Walsh1">[64]</xref>. IL5 secreted by Th2 cells is required for the recruitment of additional eosinophils. Infective larvae also directly activate IFNγ by damaging the mucosa tissue and causing a host inflammatory response. This process does not include Th1 cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines activate dendritic cells that stimulate naïve T cells (T0). As described for <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic>, dendritic cells interact with naïve T cells (T0) leading to the activation of T cell subtypes Th1 and Th2 through the production of IL12 and IL4. IL4 is also produced by Th2 cells and IL4 and IL12 inhibit each other. Consistent with the bacteria network, the activation of T helper cells occurs in the lymph nodes (Compartment II) and subsequently transported to the site of infection (Compartment I). In compartment I, IFNγ is produced by Th1 cells and dendritic cells. IL4 and IL10, produced by Th2 cells, have anti-inflammatory properties and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophils. Naive T cells stimulate clonal expansion of B cells and these lead to the production of antibodies such as IgG. While B cells can secrete IgG much longer after antigen removal, IgA production is assumed to be in response to larval establishment and development. The IgE isotype is produced upon signalling from either IL4 or IL13. Among these antibodies IgG inhibits adult helminths while IgE and IgA are involved in activating eosinophils and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines respectively.</p>

          <title><italic>B. bronchiseptica-T. retortaeformis</italic> co-infection</title>
          <p>The co-infection immune network was developed by combining the two single infection networks together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002345-g006"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002345.s003">Text S1</xref></bold>). This network is characterized by three compartments, representing the lungs, the small intestine (duodenum) and the systemic compartment (e.g. the lymphatic system). The connection of the networks and the immune mediated interactions between parasites were represented through the cytokines produced as a single pool. Local cells activated by bacteria and helminths can contribute to cytokine production, which are then transported through the blood and disseminate to other organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Campbell1">[63]</xref>. For example, pro-inflammatory cytokines are systematically detectable when any one of the parasites activates epithelial cells. Similarly, IL4 or IL12 can be produced by <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic>- or <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic>-specific T subtypes or dendritic cells. For the co-infection network, Tregs are induced by bacteria which produce IL10 that can ultimately affect the helminth, since IL10 is not an antigen-specific node. Moreover, there is only a single pool of naïve T cells that induces T cell subtypes against either the bacteria or the helminths, depending on the antigen-specific dendritic cells.</p>

          <title>Discrete dynamic model implementation</title>
          <p>The immune-parasite interaction networks were developed into discrete dynamical models by characterizing each node with a variable that can take the ON state, when the concentration or activity is above the threshold level necessary to activate downstream immune processes, or the OFF state when activity is below this threshold. The evolution of the state of each node was described by a Boolean transfer function (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002345.s003">Text S1</xref></bold>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Assmann1">[32]</xref>. Target nodes with a single activator and no inhibitors follow the state of the activator with a delay. The operator AND was used to describe a synergistic or conditional interaction between two or more nodes that is necessary to activate the target node. When either of the nodes were sufficient for the activation of the target node we used the operator OR. An inhibitory effect was represented by an AND NOT operator. In cases where prior biological information did not completely determine the transfer functions (e.g. there was no information whether two coincident regulatory effects are independent or synergistic), different alternative transfer functions were tested. The transfer functions that reproduced the qualitative features of the single infection experimental time courses, such as the parasite clearance profile, the relative peaks of different cytokines or the saturating behaviour of IgG as compared to IgA, were selected. For example, IL4 is produced by T helper cells during T helper cell differentiation as well as by eosinophils in response to stimulation by nematode antigens or allergens. While IL12 is known to inhibit the production of IL4, there are two possible ways this cytokine may interact with IL4: IL12 can inhibit IL4 produced by T helper cells or IL12 can suppress IL4 production by blocking both the T helper and eosinophil signal. The inhibitory effect of IL4 on the activation of neutrophils is known. The two transfer functions were then examined by comparing the temporal pattern for neutrophils and IL4 from the single <italic>T. retortaeformis</italic> infection model with the experimental observations. The second transfer function did not reproduce the observed low activity of IL4 -compared to the other cytokines- in the duodenum at day 14 post infection and it also led to higher neutrophil activity, compared to the other leukocytes, than the empirical data. Since the first transfer function did not lead to such deficiencies, we chose the first over the second rule. The transfer functions used in the co-infection model were the same as, or the relevant composites of, transfer functions used in each individual infection. Thus, the Boolean transfer functions applied in our model provide a mechanistic understanding of the interactions leading to bacterial or helminth clearance.</p>
          <p>The status of the system across time was simulated by repeatedly applying the Boolean rules for each node until a stationary state (e.g. clearance of the parasite) was found. Since the kinetics and timescales of the individual processes represented as edges are not known, a random order asynchronous update was selected wherein the timescales of each regulatory process were randomly chosen in such a way that the node states were updated in a randomly selected order during each time-step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Assmann1">[32]</xref>. The asynchronous algorithm was: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002345.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>F</italic> is the Boolean transfer function, <italic>t<sub>a</sub>, t<sub>b</sub>, t<sub>c</sub></italic> represent the time points corresponding to the last change in the state of the input nodes <italic>a, b, c</italic> and can be in the previous or current time-step. The time-step (time unit) of our model approximately corresponds to nine days. The randomized asynchronicity of the model does not alter the steady states of the dynamical system but causes stochasticity in the trajectory between the initial conditions and the equilibria (attractors) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Assmann1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002345-Saadatpour1">[37]</xref>, thus it can sample more diverse behaviours as the traditionally used synchronous models. To determine the node consensus activity over time (i.e. shared by trajectories with different update orders) we ran the simulations 100 times and presented the fraction of simulations in which the node was in an ON state at a given time-step in the node activity profile. We confirmed that running the simulations for more than 100 times did not change the activity profiles.</p>
          <p>Our approach of using discrete dynamic modelling allowed us to sample the timescales of interactions and perform replicate simulations as well as provide continuously varying activities of the network nodes over time, which ranged between the lower limit of 0 (below-threshold concentration in all runs) and upper limit of 1 (above-threshold concentration in all runs). However, notice the exception for IFNγ expression higher than one in the helminth infections. While these activities cannot be directly compared to quantitative concentrations, we could compare the qualitative features of the time courses and ask: are they saturating? Do they show single or multiple peaks? We could also compare the relative trends of similar variables. It is important to stress that the empirical data on <italic>B. bronchiseptica-T. retortaeformis</italic> co-infection were not used as inputs to the co-infection model but only to validate the simulated course and intensity of immune responses during co-infection.</p>
