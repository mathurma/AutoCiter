				<article-title>Evolutionary History of a Brain Controlling Brain Size</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global reduction in cerebral cortical volume. The microcephalic brain has a volume comparable to that of early hominids, raising the possibility that some MCPH genes may have been evolutionary targets in the expansion of the cerebral cortex in mammals and especially primates. Mutations in <italic>ASPM</italic>, which encodes the human homologue of a fly protein essential for spindle function, are the most common known cause of MCPH. Here we have isolated large genomic clones containing the complete <italic>ASPM</italic> gene, including promoter regions and introns, from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and rhesus macaque by transformation-associated recombination cloning in yeast. We have sequenced these clones and show that whereas much of the sequence of <italic>ASPM</italic> is substantially conserved among primates, specific segments are subject to high Ka/Ks ratios (nonsynonymous/synonymous DNA changes) consistent with strong positive selection for evolutionary change. The <italic>ASPM</italic> gene sequence shows accelerated evolution in the African hominoid clade, and this precedes hominid brain expansion by several million years. Gorilla and human lineages show particularly accelerated evolution in the IQ domain of <italic>ASPM</italic>. Moreover, <italic>ASPM</italic> regions under positive selection in primates are also the most highly diverged regions between primates and nonprimate mammals. We report the first direct application of TAR cloning technology to the study of human evolution. Our data suggest that evolutionary selection of specific segments of the <italic>ASPM</italic> sequence strongly relates to differences in cerebral cortical size.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The human brain, particularly the cerebral cortex, has undergone a dramatic increase in its volume during the course of primate evolution, but the underlying molecular mechanisms that caused this expansion are not known. One approach shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of brain evolution is the analysis of the gene mutations that lead to defects in brain development. Among the best examples of such defects is the human primary microcephaly syndrome. Primary microcephaly (MCPH) is an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder in which the brain fails to achieve normal growth. The affected individuals have severe reduction in brain size; however, the gyral pattern is relatively well preserved, with no major abnormality in cortical architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-McCreary1">McCreary et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Mochida1">Mochida and Walsh 2001</xref>). Moreover, there are no recognizable abnormalities in the organs other than the central nervous system. The most common cause of MCPH appears to be mutations in the <italic>ASPM</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Roberts1">Roberts et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>The <italic>ASPM</italic> gene encodes a 10,434-bp-long coding sequence (CDS) with 28 exons, and spans 65 kb of genomic DNA at 1q31. <italic>ASPM</italic> contains four distinguishable regions: a putative N-terminal microtubule-binding domain, a calponin-homology domain, an IQ repeat domain containing multiple IQ repeats (calmodulin-binding motifs), and a C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Bond1">Bond et al. 2002</xref>). Though the exact function of the human <italic>ASPM</italic> in the brain needs to be clarified, the homologue in the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> abnormal spindle <italic>(asp),</italic> is localized in the mitotic centrosome and is known to be essential for both the organization of the microtubules at the spindle poles and the formation of the central mitotic spindle during mitosis and meiosis. Mutations in <italic>asp</italic> cause dividing neuroblasts to arrest in metaphase, resulting in reduced central nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Ripoll1">Ripoll et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-do1">do Carmo Avides et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Riparbelli1">Riparbelli et al. 2001</xref>). In the mouse <italic>(Mus musculus)</italic> brain, the <italic>Aspm</italic> gene is expressed specifically in the sites of active neurogenesis. Expression in the embryonic brain was found to be greatest in the ventricular zone, which is the site of cerebral cortical neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Bond1">Bond et al. 2002</xref>). This expression profile suggests a potential role for <italic>Aspm</italic> in regulating neurogenesis.</p>
      <p>Interspecies comparisons of <italic>ASPM</italic> orthologs have shown their overall conservation, but also a consistent correlation of greater protein size with larger brain size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Bond1">Bond et al. 2002</xref>). The increase in protein size across species is due mainly to the increased number of IQ repeats, suggesting that specific changes in <italic>ASPM</italic> may be critical for evolution of the central nervous system.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the <italic>ASPM</italic> gene, we isolated large genomic clones containing the entire <italic>ASPM</italic> gene in several nonhuman primate species. Sequence analysis of these clones revealed a high conservation in both coding and noncoding regions, and showed that evolution of the <italic>ASPM</italic> gene might have been under positive selection in hominoids. These clones could also provide important reagents for the future study of <italic>ASPM</italic> gene regulation in its native sequence context.</p>

        <p>Homologues from chimpanzee <italic>(Pan troglodytes),</italic> gorilla <italic>(Gorilla gorilla),</italic> orangutan <italic>(Pongo pygmaeus),</italic> and rhesus macaque <italic>(Macaca mulatta)</italic> were isolated by transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning in yeast <italic>(Saccharomyces cerevisiae),</italic> the technique allowing direct isolation of a desirable chromosomal region or gene from a complex genome without constructing its genomic library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Kouprina2">Kouprina and Larionov 2003</xref>). The method exploits a high level of recombination between homologous DNA sequences during transformation in the yeast. Since up to 15% divergence in DNA sequences does not prevent selective gene isolation by in vivo recombination in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Noskov1">Noskov et al. 2003</xref>), for cloning purposes, a TAR vector was designed containing short human <italic>ASPM</italic>-gene-specific targeting hooks specific to the exon 1 and 3′ noncoding regions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">“Materials and Methods”</xref>). The TAR cloning scheme for isolating the <italic>ASPM</italic> gene homologues from nonhuman primates is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The yield of <italic>ASPM</italic>-positive clones from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and rhesus macaque was the same as that from the human DNA, suggesting that most homologous regions from nonhuman primates can be efficiently cloned by in vivo recombination in yeast using targeting hooks developed from human sequences.</p>

            <p>The method exploits a high level of recombination between homologous DNA sequences during transformation in the yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>. For isolation, genomic DNA is transformed into yeast spheroplasts along with a TAR vector that contains targeting hooks homologous to the genomic DNA sequence. <italic>CEN</italic> corresponds to the yeast Chromosome VI centromere; <italic>HIS3</italic> is a yeast selectable marker. Recombination between the vector and the genomic DNA fragment results in cloning of the gene/region of interest as YAC. Chromosomal regions with sizes up to 250 kb can be isolated by TAR cloning. For cloning purposes, TAR vector was designed containing a 5′ hook specific to exon 1 and a 3′ hook specific to the 3′ end of the human <italic>ASPM</italic>. Transformation experiments were carried out with freshly prepared spheroplasts for each species. To identify <italic>ASPM</italic>-containing clones, the transformants were combined into pools and examined by PCR for the presence of the unique <italic>ASPM</italic> sequences not present in the vector. The yield of <italic>ASPM</italic>-positive clones from primate species was the same as that from the human DNA (3%). Because the TAR procedure produces multiple gene isolates, six independent TAR isolates for each species were checked. The detectable size of the cloned material corresponded to that predicted if the entire <italic>ASPM</italic> gene had been cloned, i.e., all gene-positive clones contained circular YACs with approximately 65-kb DNA inserts. <italic>Alu</italic> profiles for each species were determined and found to be identical for each species, suggesting that the isolated YACs contained nonrearranged genomic segments. Finally the YACs were retrofitted into BACs, and their restriction patterns were examined by three restriction endonuclease digestions. No differences between <italic>ASPM</italic> clones for each species were found.</p>

        <p>We have compared complete gene sequences from primate species with a 65-kb, full-size human <italic>ASPM</italic> gene. All the analyzed genes are organized into 28 exons encoding a 3,470–3,479-amino-acid-long protein. <italic>ASPM</italic> genes start with an approximately 800-bp-long CpG island, that harbors promoter sequences, 5′ untranslated regions, and the first exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g002">Figure 2</xref>). <italic>ASPM</italic> sequences share a high degree of conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g002">Figure 2</xref>H), and pairwise DNA identity ranges from 94.5% for macaque and gorilla to 99.3% for the human–chimpanzee comparison (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020126-t001">Table 1</xref>). Multiple alignment of the genes revealed a low proportion of indels. Only ten insertions/deletions equal to or longer than 50 bp have been found, all of them located within introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Seven detected insertions were mainly associated with repetitive DNA: two <italic>(AT)<sub>n</sub></italic> microsatellite expansions, three <italic>Alu</italic> insertions, including retroposition of <italic>AluYi9</italic> in the orangutan–gorilla–chimpanzee–human clade, and retroposition of a new macaque-specific <italic>AluY</italic> subfamily similar to human <italic>AluYd2</italic>. Analysis of eight different macaque individuals showed that this particular insertion is polymorphic in the macaque population (data not shown), and thus the insertion appears to be very recent. One macaque-specific 245-bp-long insertion is linked to expansion of a 49-bp-long, minisatellitelike array. The remaining macaque-specific insertion (50 bp) is nonrepetitive. A closer analysis suggests that the insert is not a processed pseudogene of known genes (data not shown).</p>

        <p>Of the two detected deletions, the macaque-specific 72-bp-long deletion appears to be associated with nonrepetitve DNA. The second one, an 818-bp-long deletion in orangutan, was probably caused by homologous <italic>Alu–Alu</italic> recombination (see below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The remaining indels are related to expansion/contraction of a short minisatellite array. It was caused either by a 53-bp expansion in the gorilla–chimpanzee–human clade or by two independent deletions/contractions in the macaque and orangutan lineages.</p>
        <p>An approximately 3-kb-long intronic segment between exons 4 and 5 is present in several copies in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g002">Figure 2</xref>E; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Closer analysis of the human genome confirmed that copies of this region are homologous to 24 segmental duplications located mainly in telomeric regions of Chromosomes 1–8, 10, 11, 16, 19, 20, and Y. Based on the sequence similarity and the presence of an <italic>L1P4 LINE</italic> insertion at the 5′ end, the most closely related are three duplications at 7q11–13. The most similar copy is located on Chromosome 7 and shares 93% identity with the <italic>ASPM</italic> intronic segment. Five duplications are located on Chromosome 1; the closest copy is found 27 Mb away from the <italic>ASPM</italic> gene.</p>
        <p>We looked for several common motifs associated with genomic breakpoints in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Abeysinghe1">Abeysinghe et al. 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g002">Figure 2</xref>F shows the positions of such potentially unstable oligonucleotides. Interestingly, the orangutan-specific deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) has its 5′ breakpoint located just 1 bp upstream of a sequence 100% identical to the chi-like consensus motif GCWGGWGG (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The chi motif is recognized by the RecBCD-mediated recombination pathway in prokaryotes and seems to be associated with rearrangements in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Dewyse1">Dewyse and Bradley 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Chuzhanova1">Chuzhanova et al. 2003</xref>). Both deletion breakpoints in the orangutan deletion are located within 5′ parts of two <italic>Alu</italic> sequences, suggesting that the deletion was created by homologous <italic>Alu–Alu</italic> recombination. Similar homologous recombinations with breakpoints located near chi-like motifs in 5′ regions of <italic>Alu</italic> sequences were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Chen1">Chen et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Rudiger1">Rudiger et al. 1995</xref>).</p>
        <p>In summary, despite the presence of a few indels, coding and noncoding regions of <italic>ASPM</italic> homologues show a marked degree of conservation.</p>

        <p>We have analyzed <italic>ASPM</italic> CDSs from six primate species: human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, rhesus macaque, and African green monkey <italic>(Cercopithecus aethiops)</italic>.

        <p>From the DNA and protein conservation profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g003">Figure 3</xref>I), <italic>ASPM</italic> segments evolve differently along the length of the CDS. N- and C-terminal regions and the region corresponding to exons 5–15 are conserved. In contrast, exons 3 and 4 and the complete IQ repeat domain (positions 1,267–3,225) are more variable. Indeed, nonsynonymous substitutions in hominoid primates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) and in ancestral lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) and nonsynonymous polymorphism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g003">Figure 3</xref>E) are nearly absent in the conserved central (exons 5–15) and C-terminal regions. This pattern indicates different rates of evolution along the ASPM protein, visualized by plots of synonymous Ks and nonsynonymous Ka rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g003">Figure 3</xref>H) and supported by phylogenetic analysis (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g004">Figure 4</xref>). It is notable that the comparison of the primate and mouse proteins also revealed the same pattern of conservative and nonconservative regions along ASPM protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

            <title>Phylogenetic Trees and ω ratio for Complete <italic>ASPM</italic> and Three Selected Segments</title>
            <p>Trees and ω (Ka/Ka) ratios were computed using the ML method for codons implemented in PAML. Branch lengths represent ML distances for codons, i.e., using both synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide sites, and in all branches the ω ratio was set free to vary. All trees are drawn to the same scale. Branch labels mark the ω ratios for corresponding branches. Values in square brackets show ω for additional cDNA sequences whenever available. Default values and branch lengths were calculated from genomic copies. Selected tested hypotheses are listed. ω<sub>H</sub> stands for the ω rate in the human lineage, ω<sub>C</sub> in the chimpanzee lineage, ω<sub>CH</sub> in the common human–chimpanzee ancestral lineage after the gorilla divergence, ω<sub>G</sub> in the gorilla lineage, and ω<sub>0</sub> in all other branches. Single asterisks indicate <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 3.84; double asterisks indicate <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 6.63.</p>
            <p>(A) Phylogeny for the complete <italic>ASPM</italic> CDS. In addition to testing different ω values in the human lineage, we also tested the hypothesis that the complete gorilla–chimpanzee–human clade evolved at a constant rate, different from the rest of the tree (compared to the one-ratio model, boxed).</p>
            <p>(B) The <italic>ASPM</italic> phylogeny derived from a conserved segment from exon 5 to the beginning of the IQ domain (amino acids 676–1,266). The branch connecting the human and chimpanzee common ancestor with the gorilla–chimpanzee–human common ancestor had no substitutions, therefore the ω ratio could not be calculated.</p>
            <p>(C) IQ domain (amino acids 1,267–3,225). We also tested the hypothesis that the gorilla and human lineages evolved at the same ω rate, different from the rest of the tree (compared to the one-ratio model, boxed).</p>
            <p>(D) Phylogeny of eight primate sequences from a 1,215-amino-acid-long segment of exon 18 (amino acids 1,640–2,855). We also tested the hypothesis that the gorilla and human lineages evolved at the same ω rate, different from the rest of the tree (compared to the one-ratio model, boxed).</p>

        <p>Analysis of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratio (ω = Ka/Ks) revealed an elevated value in the human branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). According to the likelihood ratio test, the human ω rate is significantly different from the rate in the rest of the tree (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Also the model that the complete gorilla–chimpanzee–human clade is evolving at one ω rate different from that in the rest of the tree is well supported (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Because <italic>ASPM</italic> consists of regions with different degrees of sequence conservation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g003">Figure 3</xref>), we separately analyzed a conserved region (exons 5–15 plus a small part of exon 16) and a variable IQ repeat domain. As can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) the conserved region has all branches shorter, indicating overall a slower rate of evolution. In the human lineage, the ω ratio equals zero; however, the test for whether the human branch has a different (lower) ω rate than the rest did not yield significant values. In contrast, the tree based on the variable IQ repeat domain exhibits ω values greater than one for the human and gorilla branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). The likelihood ratio test supports the model in which human and gorilla lineages evolved under a significantly higher ω ratio than the rest of the tree. Similar results were obtained for exon 18 with additional sequences from two New World monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g004">Figure 4</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g004">4</xref>D, different sequences from African green monkey, gorilla, and chimpanzee individuals result in different ω values for their corresponding terminal branches. One chimpanzee sequence also produced an ω ratio greater than one for exon 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). It is worth noting that neither codon bias nor selection on third codon positions seemed to influence the synonymous rate Ks strongly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Therefore, the high Ka/Ks ratios in human and gorilla are likely to be products of adaptive evolution.</p>
        <p>Sequencing of two CDSs in African green monkey, three in gorilla, and three in chimpanzee allowed us to look for <italic>ASPM</italic> polymorphism in those species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020126-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). Human polymorphism data from <italic>ASPM</italic> mutant haplotypes are not representative of wild-type variation so were not used in these comparisons. For African green monkey, five synonymous and five nonsynonymous changes were found between two sequences. The gorilla and chimpanzee CDSs in particular showed an apparently high degree of replacement polymorphism. Gorilla polymorphism included 35 point mutations (15 silent mutations and 21 replacements). Chimpanzee sequences differed in five synonymous and 11 nonsynonymous sites. In order to interpret this seemingly high level of observed polymorphism, intraspecific diversity was compared to interspecific diversity using the McDonald and Kreitman test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-McDonald1">McDonald and Kreitman 1991</xref>). In the case of chimpanzee polymorphism compared to divergence with human, we could not reject the null hypothesis that polymorphism and divergence between species were significantly different (William's adjusted G statistic = 0.083, chi-square with 1 d.f., not significant; values based on PAML-generated Ka and Ks values using the free ratio model). Gorilla polymorphism was compared to divergence between the gorilla common ancestor and the human–chimpanzee common ancestor. In this case we can reject the null hypothesis (William's adjusted G statistic = 122.45, chi-square with 1 d.f., <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) to conclude that the pattern of gorilla polymorphism is therefore different from the divergence pattern. Indeed gorilla polymorphism is less than variation resulting from divergence: within species, the ω ratio is 1.43 for gorillas compared to 2.2 for the divergence between the gorilla common ancestor and the human–chimpanzee common ancestor. Intraspecific variation, although seemingly unusual in showing so many replacement substitutions in both chimpanzee and gorilla, is less than or in line with what we have observed for <italic>ASPM</italic> divergence between species. Therefore, relaxation of selection cannot explain the high nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratios among African hominoids, further supporting the idea that adaptation has occurred in <italic>ASPM.</italic></p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we applied TAR cloning technology to investigate molecular evolution of the <italic>ASPM</italic> gene, which is involved in determining the size of the human brain and in which mutations lead to MCPH. The <italic>ASPM</italic> homologue in the fruit fly is essential for spindle function, suggesting a role for this gene in normal mitotic divisions of embryonic neuroblasts. Complete gene homologues from five primate species were isolated and sequenced. In agreement with the predicted critical role of <italic>ASPM</italic> in brain development, both coding and noncoding regions of <italic>ASPM</italic> homologues showed a marked degree of conservation in humans, other hominoids, and Old World monkeys. The differences found in noncoding regions were small insertions/deletions and lineage-specific insertions of evolutionarily young <italic>Alu</italic> elements into introns.</p>
      <p>Analysis of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratios indicates different rates of evolution along the ASPM protein: part of ASPM evolved under positive selection while other parts were under negative (purifying) selection in human and African ape lineages. Such “mosaic” selection has been previously described for other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Endo1">Endo et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Crandall1">Crandall et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Hughes1">Hughes 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Kreitman1">Kreitman and Comeron 1999</xref>). When our work was completed, the paper by Zhang supporting accelerated evolution of the human ASPM was issued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Zhang1">Zhang 2003</xref>). However, because the author did not analyze the gorilla gene homologue, he concluded that accelerated sequence evolution is specific to the hominid lineage. Our finding that selection on <italic>ASPM</italic> begins well before brain expansion suggests that the molecular evolution of <italic>ASPM</italic> in hominoids may indeed be an example of a molecular “exaptation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Gould1">Gould and Vrba 1982</xref>), in that the originally selected function of <italic>ASPM</italic> was for something other than large brain size. </p>
      <p>In the case of <italic>ASPM,</italic> rapidly evolving residues are mainly concentrated in the IQ repeat domain containing multiple IQ motifs, which are calmodulin-binding consensus sequences. While there is no direct evidence yet, it is likely that the function of human <italic>ASPM</italic> is modulated through calmodulin or calmodulinlike protein(s). Previous interspecies comparisons of ASPM proteins have shown a consistent correlation of greater protein size with larger brain size mainly because of the number of IQ repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Bond1">Bond et al. 2002</xref>). For example, the <italic>asp</italic> homologue of the nematode <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> contains two IQ repeats, the fruit fly<italic>—</italic>24 IQ repeats, and the mouse—61 IQ repeats, and there are 74 IQ repeats in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Bond1">Bond et al. 2002</xref>). <italic>ASPM</italic> homologues in the nonhuman primates examined here contain the same number of IQ repeats as human, supporting the idea that repeat expansion occurred prior to the anthropoid divergence (which gave rise to New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and hominoids) and possibly even earlier in primate evolution. IQ motifs are seen in a wide variety of proteins, but the ASPM proteins in primates are unique, because they have the largest known number of IQ repeats. Given the proposed role of <italic>ASPM</italic> in regulating divisions of neuronal progenitors, both the number of repeats and the particular amino acid substitutions in the IQ repeats may be strongly related to brain evolution.</p>
      <p>Human <italic>ASPM</italic> gene mutations which lead to MCPH provide a direct link between genotype and phenotype. <italic>ASPM</italic> is yet another example on the growing list of positively selected genes that show both accelerated evolution along the human lineage and involvement in simple Mendelian disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Clark1">Clark et al 2003</xref>). However, <italic>ASPM</italic> is unique because its distinctive pattern of accelerated protein evolution begins several million years prior to brain expansion in the hominid lineage. Absolute brain size in orangutans (430 g in males; 370 g in females) is barely different from that in gorillas (530 g in males; 460 g in females) and common chimpanzees (400 g in males; 370 g in females) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Tobias1">Tobias 1971</xref>), yet accelerated <italic>ASPM</italic> evolution began in the common ancestor of gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans, approximately 7–8 million years ago. Only much later did brain expansion begin in hominids, starting at 400–450 g roughly 2–2.5 million years ago and growing to its final current size of 1350–1450 g approximately 200,000–400,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Wood1">Wood and Collard 1999</xref>). Therefore genotypic changes in <italic>ASPM</italic> preceded marked phenotypic changes in hominoid brain evolution, at least at the level at which they have currently been studied. The molecular changes in <italic>ASPM</italic> may predict the existence of differences in early neurogenesis between orangutans, on the one hand, and gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans, on the other, which may manifest as more subtle differences in brain anatomy than gross changes in brain volume.</p>
      <p>How might evolutionary changes in the ASPM protein affect cerebral cortical size? One potential mechanism might be that changes in ASPM induce changes in the orientation of the mitotic spindle of neuroblasts. Normally, neural precursor cells can have mitotic spindles oriented parallel to the ventricle or perpendicular to the ventricle. Mitoses in which daughter cells are oriented next to one another at the ventricular zone are typically “symmetric” in that a single progenitor cell generates two progenitor cells, causing exponential expansion of the progenitor pool. In contrast, mitoses that generate daughter cells that are vertically arranged are typically “asymmetric” so that one daughter cell becomes a postmitotic neuron, whereas the other daughter cell remains as a progenitor, causing only a linear increase in cell number. Control of this proliferative symmetry can cause dramatic alterations in cerebral cortical size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Chenn1">Chenn and Walsh 2002</xref>), and so changes in ASPM could regulate cortical size by making subtle changes in spindle orientation. Alternatively, evolutionary changes in ASPM may not themselves have led to increase in the size of the brain, but instead perhaps ASPM might be essential to insure faithful DNA replication and proper chromosome segregation. In rodents, a surprising number of cerebral cortical neurons are aneuploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Rehen1">Rehen et al. 2001</xref>). Perhaps directed selection of specific domains of ASPM helps insure faithful chromosome segregation to allow a larger number of cerebral cortical neurons to be formed without an unduly high incidence of chromosome aneuploidy.</p>
      <p>Functional genomics studies are clearly needed to elucidate the exact nature of the molecular mechanisms affected by <italic>ASPM</italic> gene evolution in hominoids. Here, we have demonstrated the utility of TAR cloning for evolutionary sequence comparisons among humans and other primates. In addition, the <italic>ASPM</italic> TAR clones isolated in these studies could provide valuable reagents for studying <italic>ASPM</italic> gene regulation in its natural sequence context. Overall, we anticipate this technology will be extremely useful in studying the evolution of other genes that may be responsible for uniquely human traits.</p>

          <p>To isolate the full-size <italic>ASPM</italic> gene from the human <italic>(Homo sapiens),</italic> chimpanzee <italic>(Pan troglodyte</italic>s<italic>),</italic> gorilla <italic>(Gorilla gorilla),</italic> orangutan <italic>(Pongo pygmaeus),</italic> and rhesus macaque <italic>(Macaca mulatta)</italic> genomes, a TAR vector containing two unique hooks was constructed. Two targeting sequences were designed, 131 bp 5′ and 151 bp 3′, from the available human genomic sequence of <italic>ASPM</italic> (positions 155,758–155,888 and 92,922–93,071 in the BAC RP11–32D17 [GI:16972838]). The targeting sequences were PCR amplified from the genomic DNA using two specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>). PCR products were cloned into a polylinker of the basic TAR vector pVC604 as <italic>Apa</italic>I–<italic>Sal</italic>I and <italic>Sal</italic>I–<italic>Xba</italic>I fragments. Before transformation experiments, the TAR cloning vector was linearized with <italic>Sal</italic>I to release targeting hooks. Genomic DNA samples were prepared from chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and rhesus macaque fibroblast culture cell lines (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, New Jersey, United States) in agarose plugs. Spheroplast transformation experiments were carried out as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Kouprina1">Kouprina and Larionov (1999</xref>). To identify clones positive for <italic>ASPM</italic>, yeast transformants were examined by PCR using diagnostic primers specific for exon 2 and exon 27 of <italic>ASPM</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>). Integrity of yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) and the issue of their stability during propagation in yeast were examined. DNA was isolated from ten subclones carrying the <italic>ASPM</italic> YACs for each primate, and their size was analyzed by <italic>Not</italic>I digestion followed by CHEF. Each subclone carried a YAC of similar size, indicating that these clones were stable in yeast. <italic>Alu</italic> profiles of the clones were checked by <italic>Taq</italic>I digestion of 1 μg of total yeast DNA isolated from transformants. Samples were run by electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with an <italic>Alu</italic> probe.

      <p>Selection operating on codon usage may increase the ω ratio by lowering the rate of synonymous substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Sharp1">Sharp and Li 1987</xref>, 1989). Therefore, we tested the correlations between the CAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Sharp1">Sharp and Li 1987</xref>) and the rate of synonymous substitutions (Ks). We found no significant association between the tested variables. Moreover, interspecies comparisons disclosed that CAI is nearly identical for all compared species, and no CAI increase over other species was detected for human or gorilla (data not shown). On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between CAI and both protein and DNA identity. A partial correlation analysis revealed that the significant positive linear correlation between Ka and CAI was merely caused by the strong negative correlation of Ka with DNA and protein identity. When we controlled for identity, the correlation between Ka and CAI disappeared (data not shown). These results may indicate that at positively selected sites, protein changes are preferred over optimization of codon usage, and thus mutations causing amino acid replacements do not immediately produce optimal codons. It should be noted that selection on codon usage seems to be generally relaxed in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Duret1">Duret and Mouchiroud 2000</xref>). Mammalian codon usage as well as the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions can be potentially biased by selection favoring a high GC content (or even saturation by G and C) at the third codon positions (GC3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Bernardi1">Bernardi and Bernardi 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Aota1">Aota and Ikemura 1986</xref>). However, <italic>ASPM</italic> is an AT-rich gene (GC content 36.4%–37%) and, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Bernardi1">Bernardi and Bernardi 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020126-Aota1">Aota and Ikemura 1986</xref>), the third codon positions are also AT-rich (GC3 content, 30.6%–31.4%) and thus far from saturation. In summary, neither the codon bias nor selection on the third codon seems to strongly influence the synonymous rate Ks. Therefore the high Ka/Ks ratio in human and gorilla is likely to be the product of adaptive evolution.</p>
