        <p>Regulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling is critical in vertebrate development, as several members of the TGF-β family have been shown to act as morphogens, controlling a variety of cell fate decisions depending on concentration. Little is known about the role of intracellular regulation of the TGF-β pathway in development. E3 ubiquitin ligases target specific protein substrates for proteasome-mediated degradation, and several are implicated in signaling. We have shown that Arkadia, a nuclear RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, is essential for a subset of Nodal functions in the embryo, but the molecular mechanism of its action in embryonic cells had not been addressed. Here, we find that Arkadia facilitates Nodal signaling broadly in the embryo, and that it is indispensable for cell fates that depend on maximum signaling. Loss of Arkadia in embryonic cells causes nuclear accumulation of phospho-Smad2/3 (P-Smad2/3), the effectors of Nodal signaling; however, these must be repressed or hypoactive as the expression of their direct target genes is reduced or lost. Molecular and functional analysis shows that Arkadia interacts with and ubiquitinates P-Smad2/3 causing their degradation, and that this is via the same domains required for enhancing their activity. Consistent with this dual function, introduction of Arkadia in homozygous null (−/−) embryonic stem cells activates the accumulated and hypoactive P-Smad2/3 at the expense of their abundance. <italic>Arkadia</italic>−/− cells, like <italic>Smad2−/−</italic> cells, cannot form foregut and prechordal plate in chimeras, confirming this functional interaction in vivo. As Arkadia overexpression never represses, and in some cells enhances signaling, the degradation of P-Smad2/3 by Arkadia cannot occur prior to their activation in the nucleus. Therefore, Arkadia provides a mechanism for signaling termination at the end of the cascade by coupling degradation of P-Smad2/3 with the activation of target gene transcription. This mechanism can account for achieving efficient and maximum Nodal signaling during embryogenesis and for rapid resetting of target gene promoters allowing cells to respond to dynamic changes in extracellular signals.</p>

        <sec id="st1">
          <title/>
          <p>In development, cells respond to secreted signals (called morphogens) by turning on or off sets of target genes. How does gene activity adjust quickly in response to rapidly changing extracellular signals? This should require efficient removal of old/used signaling effectors (signal-activated transcription factors) from the promoters of target genes to allow new ones to assume control. We previously discovered Arkadia, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and showed that it is an essential factor for normal development. (Ubiquitin ligases trigger the addition of ubiquitin residues to proteins, typically marking them for degradation.) Here, we show that Arkadia is required for high activity of the major signaling pathway, TGF-β/Nodal. Arkadia has a dual role to degrade Smads, the TGF-β signaling effectors, and enhance their transcriptional activity. This coupling of degradation with activation provides a mechanism to ensure that only effectors “in use” are degraded, allowing the new ones to proceed. It is possible that very similar mechanisms operate in other pathways to establish dynamic regulation and efficient signaling, while their failure may be associated with developmental abnormalities and disease, including cancer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling controls a diverse set of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and specification of fate in vertebrate and invertebrate species. Disruption of signaling leads to developmental abnormalities and disease, including cancer. Activin and Nodal TGF-β ligands have been shown to act as morphogens in vertebrate development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b004">4</xref>]. For example, in the mouse, Nodal is required for gastrulation, including development of the anterior primitive streak and the formation of the germ layers, endoderm and mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b006">6</xref>]; for maintenance of pluripotency in the epiblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b008">8</xref>]; and for the specification of the anterior-posterior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b010">10</xref>] and left-right axes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b011">11</xref>]. Loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>Nodal</italic> gene, including enhancer deletions, lead to a reduction of <italic>Nodal</italic> RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b012">12</xref>] and reveal that the highest level of Nodal signaling is required during gastrulation for the induction of the anterior primitive streak. This contains the precursors of the mammalian equivalent of the amphibian Spemann's organizer, and it gives rise to the anterior endoderm, the node, and the mesendoderm (notochord and prechordal plate), all of which are required for subsequent patterning of the vertebrate embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b006">6</xref>]. Complementary experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, where increasing amounts of <italic>Nodal</italic> RNA are injected, show that it functions as a dose-dependent inducer and that the highest level induces Spemann's organizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b013">13</xref>]. The dynamic changes in the concentration of ligands, to elicit different cellular responses, demand that the responding cells have rapid turnover of the signaling-effectors and frequent refreshing of target gene promoters. Therefore, how TGF-β is regulated, and particularly, how signaling is terminated in the nucleus after gene transcription, is key in understanding cell fate decisions and patterning in vertebrate development.</p>
      <p>TGF-β signals bind to cognate serine/threonine kinase receptors leading to phosphorylation and activation of the Smad family of signal transducers. Two different Smad signaling branches have been described. Ligands, like Activin, Nodal, Gdf1, Vg1, and TGFβ1 are transduced by the receptor-activated Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b015">15</xref>]. The phosphorylated form of Smads (phospho-Smads [P-Smads]) complex with Smad4 and together translocate into the nucleus, where they function as transcription factors in association with DNA-binding partners such as FoxH1, Mixer, Jun/Fos, Runx, ATF3, and E2F4/5, etc., which provide target gene specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b015">15</xref>]. In the mouse, loss-of-function mutations affecting core components of the Nodal signal transduction pathway give patterning and cell fate defects similar to that of <italic>Nodal</italic> itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b020">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>Extracellular cofactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b021">21</xref>], antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b023">23</xref>], and proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b025">25</xref>] have been shown to regulate Nodal activity during mouse development. However, little is known about the role of intracellular regulation in cells receiving Nodal. Intracellular regulators of the pathway include negative regulators such as inhibitory Smads (Smad6/7) that block TGF-β signaling by competing with Smads for association with the receptors or by targeting receptors for ubiquitin-mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b028">28</xref>]; in the nucleus, Ski and SnoN incorporate in the Smad DNA-binding complex to prevent them from binding to the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP and repress transcription by recruiting histone deacetylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b030">30</xref>]. More recently, a phosphatase, PPM1A/PP2Ca, has been identified and is shown to de-phosphorylate P-Smad2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b031">31</xref>] and abrogate their signaling activity. Furthermore, proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitin-modified core components of the TGF-β signaling cascade has been shown to play a major role in controlling signaling output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b032">32</xref>]. Poly-ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins is one of the most prominent turnover mechanisms in the cell. Ubiquitination of protein substrates involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions. E3 ubiquitin ligases are the critical components responsible for the recognition of specific substrates for ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b033">33</xref>]. They are generally classified into the HECT- and RING-domain classes and exhibit substrate specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b035">35</xref>]. Several ubiquitin ligases are known to reduce signaling by mediating the degradation of individual components of the pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b036">36</xref>]. However, ligases that terminate signaling by degrading activated Smads (P-Smads) have not been identified.</p>
      <p>One of the important unanswered questions is how long the activated Smads transcribe target genes and how the promoters are refreshed to allow rapid intracellular responses to dynamic changes in concentration of ligands. Both de-phosphorylation of P-Smads followed by cytoplasmic recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b037">37</xref>] and proteasome-mediated degradation of P-Smads have been proposed to terminate signaling in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b038">38</xref>]. However, there was no explanation for how “used” versus “unused” activated effectors could be distinguished by these mechanisms. An obvious mechanism to limit the time that an effector works is to link its turnover with its ability to drive transcription.</p>
      <p>We have shown previously that Arkadia, a nuclear RING-domain ubiquitin ligase, enhances Nodal signaling and is essential for the induction of the organizer/node [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b040">40</xref>]. In somatic tumor cell lines, Arkadia has been shown to enhance TGF-β signaling by ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Smad6/7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b042">42</xref>]. However, we show here that Arkadia functions by a different mechanism in embryonic cells. Specifically, we find that Arkadia directly ubiquitinates and degrades P-Smad2/3 and that this is coupled with their high activity. The link between activity and degradation provides a mechanism to ensure that only “used” P-Smad2/3 effectors are degraded and that signaling is terminated at the end of the cascade and not before. Therefore, Arkadia can account for rapid resetting of actively transcribed promoters, forcing transcription to rely only on fresh P-Smads and allowing cells to respond to dynamic changes in signaling. Similar mechanisms may operate in other signaling pathways in development to achieve peak efficiency and dynamic responses of cells during development.</p>

        <title>Arkadia Enhances Signaling in All Major Nodal-Dependent Developmental Events</title>
        <p>The phenotype of <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos consists of loss of anterior primitive streak derivatives (node, notochord, prechordal plate, and anterior definitive endoderm [ADE]/foregut) leading to anterior patterning defects including head truncations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b040">40</xref>]. We have shown previously that while <italic>Arkadia</italic> or <italic>Nodal</italic> heterozygous (+/−) mice are normal, a small number of double heterozygotes for <italic>Arkadia</italic> and <italic>Nodal</italic> recapitulate the <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b040">40</xref>]. This suggested a functional interaction between Arkadia and Nodal. To investigate the extent of Arkadia's role in Nodal signaling, and in additional Nodal-dependent developmental events, we generated <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos with only one wild-type copy of the <italic>Nodal</italic> gene (<italic>Akd−/−</italic>, <italic>Nodal+/−</italic>). The majority of <italic>Akd−/−</italic>, <italic>Nodal+/−</italic> embryos that were analyzed (<italic>n</italic> = 19/33) exhibited phenotypes never observed in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos. Using whole mount in situ hybridization, we performed marker analysis to define whether these phenotypes are Nodal-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Before gastrulation, Nodal signaling is responsible for anterior-posterior axis specification via the induction of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) domain at the distal tip of the mouse embryo and its migration to the prospective anterior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b043">43</xref>].

However, <italic>Akd−/−</italic>, <italic>Nodal+/−</italic> embryos have incomplete AVE-specific gene expression, as they are rarely able to induce an AVE (one out of seven) that expresses <italic>Hex</italic> (none out of two; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), <italic>Cerl</italic> (one out of three; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref>F), or <italic>Lefty1</italic> (none out of two; unpublished data). Furthermore, in the <italic>Akd−/−</italic>, <italic>Nodal+/−</italic> embryos, the <italic>Cerl</italic>-expressing embryo AVE domain remains distal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref>F) and the <italic>Brachyury</italic> domain remains proximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), indicating that when the AVE is induced it cannot migrate to the anterior. In addition, more than 50% of the <italic>Akd−/−</italic>, <italic>Nodal+/−</italic> embryos examined at mid-streak stage have a constriction between the embryonic and extraembryonic compartments. This phenotype, which is not observed in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos, is thought to be due to a failure of the AVE to migrate and define the anterior-posterior axis, leading to failure of primitive streak elongation and mesoderm formation along the embryonic-extraembryonic boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b046">46</xref>]. These new phenotypes in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos carrying only one <italic>Nodal</italic> wild-type allele indicates that Arkadia is also involved in AVE formation and suggests that it enhances Nodal signaling at pre-gastrulation stages.</p>
        <p>During gastrulation, Nodal is responsible for the formation and patterning of endoderm and mesoderm. Cardiac mesoderm is considered an anterior mesodermal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b047">47</xref>], and <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos form heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>]. In contrast, all <italic>Akd−/−</italic>, <italic>Nodal+/−</italic> embryos fail to form morphologically visible heart (<italic>n</italic> = 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref>L), as it is also shown by loss of <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> expression; one of the earliest markers of myocardial differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b048">48</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref>G−1I), <italic>Shh</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref>J) marks the mesendoderm, the midline of the neural tube (floor plate), and the gut endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b049">49</xref>]. In <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos, <italic>Shh</italic> expression is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>] due to the absence of mesendoderm and foregut, but it is present in the midgut and hindgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref>K). <italic>Akd−/−</italic>, <italic>Nodal+/−</italic> embryos, however, have a severe reduction in <italic>Shh</italic> expression indicating not only loss of mesendoderm but also of all endoderm (<italic>n</italic> = 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref>L), as confirmed by histological analysis (unpublished data). These new phenotypes seen in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos carrying only one <italic>Nodal</italic> wild-type allele indicate that during gastrulation, Arkadia is involved in the formation of the entire endoderm and anterior mesoderm and suggest that this is mediated by its ability to enhance Nodal. As Arkadia facilitates Nodal signaling broadly, before and during gastrulation, it is likely to be a regular partner factor of the Nodal signal transduction pathway.</p>

        <title>Arkadia Acts Downstream of the Receptors and Destabilizes the Phosphorylated Forms of Smad2/3</title>
        <p>To find at what position within the Nodal signaling cascade Arkadia functions, we compared the level of the receptor-activated (phosphorylated) signaling effector P-Smad2 in embryos and embryonic stem (ES) cells by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We examined 20 wild-type and 20 <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos at 8.5 days post-coitum (dpc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and unpublished data) and three wild-type and three <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> blastocyst-derived ES cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). We found that while the total levels of Smad2 protein remain the same, P-Smad2 was always at least two times higher in all <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos and ES cells compared to the wild-type samples. Similarly, the other Nodal signaling effector P-Smad3 was found to be elevated in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic>ES cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, in embryonic cells, P-Smad2/3 are more abundant in the absence of Arkadia than in its presence. As the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 depends on the kinase activity of the ligand-activated receptors, the data suggest that in the absence of Arkadia the receptors are more active or that P-Smad2/3 are more stable after their phosphorylation.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We examined the activity of the receptors by stimulating <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> and wild-type ES cells with Activin A ligand (Activin) and comparing Smad2 phosphorylation over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">2</xref>D). Although <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic>cells start with higher basal levels of P-Smad2 compared to wild-type, Smad2 phosphorylation peaks 1 h after Activin addition in all ES cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">2</xref>D), indicating normal receptor kinase activity in the presence or absence of Arkadia. Interestingly, after peak stimulation in wild-type ES cells, P-Smad2 decreases to basal levels within 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">2</xref>D), but in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> ES cells P-Smad2 is maintained at peak levels (&gt;90%) for at least 6 more h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The data suggest that after receptor phosphorylation, Smad2 is more stable or maintains the phosphorylation longer in the absence of Arkadia. The total Smad2 levels do not change during the course of the experiment, indicating that the increased stability is associated with only the phosphorylated fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">2</xref>D). To examine the possibility that other factors, such as a receptor inhibitor, is induced specifically in wild-type cells causing reduction of Smad2 phosphorulation, we repeated the above experiment in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide). The decay of P-Smad2 was found, as before, to be slower in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that differences in protein stability rather than synthesis account for the increase in P-Smad2 levels.</p>
        <p>To exclude the possibility that the receptors generate the differences in P-Smad2 levels, we blocked all the TGF-β receptors with the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, H7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">2</xref>F) or used SB431542 selective inhibitor of Alk receptors (SB), which blocks the receptors that specifically phosphorylate Smad2/3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). We found that in wild-type cells treated with two different concentrations (5 or 25 μM of H7), P-Smad2 levels declined 40% and 60%, respectively, within 30 min and they diminished to 30% after 90 min. In <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> ES cells, however, even after 90 min, with the highest amount of inhibitor, P-Smad2 levels were not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). The data indicate that the receptors are not responsible for generating the increase of P-Smad2 in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> cells and suggest that this is caused by P-Smad2 stabilization. The total Smad2 protein levels do not change during the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), but as the fraction of P-Smad2 is most likely small, differences within this fraction may not be visible when the total levels are examined. All of the above experiments were reproducible in three different <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> ES cell lines (unpublished data) and the same results were obtained for the other Nodal/Activin effector, P-Smad3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). Collectively, the data suggest that Arkadia acts downstream of the receptors and destabilizes the phosphorylated forms of Smad2/3.</p>

Cytoplasmic retention of P-Smad2/3 can result in both inability to activate target genes and increased stability. As in the absence of Arkadia, P-Smad2/3 are more stable and less transcriptionally efficient; it is possible that they are cytoplasmic and Arkadia regulates their nuclear localization. We therefore examined in three different wild-type and three <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> ES cell lines the localization of P-Smads using Western blots of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>G) or by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>H) with antibodies against P-Smad2 or Smad2/3. We did not find evidence that P-Smads are cytoplasmic in the absence of Arkadia. On the contrary, the Western blots revealed that P-Smad2 accumulates in the nucleus of <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic>cells. Furthermore, as P-Smad2/3 complex with Smad4 to translocate to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b015">15</xref>], an increase of Smad4 in the nucleus of <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> ES cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). Therefore, we conclude that Arkadia destabilizes P-Smad2/3 without affecting Smad4 complex formation and nuclear localization. Furthermore, as Arkadia is nuclear, the data suggest that Arkadia regulates P-Smad2/3 stability in the nucleus.</p>

        <title>Arkadia Interacts Directly with P-Smad2/3</title>
        <p>Arkadia is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and could be destabilizing P-Smad2/3 directly by poly-ubiquitinating them, leading to their proteasome-dependent degradation. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether Arkadia interacts specifically with phosphorylated Smads. We used HEK293T (293T) cells stably expressing moderate levels of full-length Arkadia, tagged either with Flag on the N-terminus and Myc on the C-terminus, or with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N-terminus (GAkd). We performed immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">3</xref>B), -Myc, or -GFP (unpublished data) antibodies and Western blotted with anti-P-Smad2, -Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), or -P-Smad3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The results show that with Activin stimulation, Arkadia coIPs with the phosphorylated endogenous Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) and Smad3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). However, when the cells are treated with the SB receptor inhibitor, which eliminates Smad2/3 phosphorylation, Arkadia does not coIP unphosphorylated Smad2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and unpublished data). Furthermore, we examined the interaction of Arkadia with other phosphorylated Smads (Smad1/5/8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A) or with Smad4 (unpublished data) and found no evidence of interaction.

        <p>To test how direct this interaction is, we performed the IP in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) using in vitro transcribed/translated (recombinant) Arkadia protein labeled with S<sup>35</sup> and phosphorylated Flag-tagged Smad2 isolated by IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B) from 293T cells stimulated with constitutive active Alk4 (Alk4*). The data show that phosphorylated flag-Smad2 protein can IP recombinant full-length Arkadia but not the N-terminal portion (1–510 amino acids [aa]), or the luciferase control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). The data suggest that Arkadia interacts directly with P-Smad2/3 via a C-terminal domain.</p>
        <p>Arkadia is a 989-aa protein and its C-terminal half (516–989 aa) contains a highly conserved domain of 100 aa (889–989 aa), which includes the RING-ubiquitin ligase activity-domain at the C-terminal region (947–965 aa), a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (903–909 aa), and a conserved domain (889–903 aa), termed here NRG, of unknown function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg003">Figure S3</xref>C). To understand the interaction of Arkadia with P-Smad2/3, we mapped further the responsible domain. We used transient transfections of 293T cells to test the ability of various deletions of Arkadia (all GFP-tagged; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) to IP P-Smad2/3. The data show that the last 100 aa of Arkadia containing the NRG, the NLS, and the RING (G-NRG-RING, 889–989 aa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) are sufficient for the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Deletion of the C-terminal end of Arkadia (GAkdR*) that eliminates one of the Zinc-binding fingers of the RING domain (965–989 aa) does not affect the interaction with P-Smad2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). However, deletion of the NRG completely abrogates the interaction with P-Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). To confirm that the NRG domain is necessary for the interaction with P-Smad2/3 within the context of the full-length Arkadia protein, we generated an internal partial deletion of only the first eight residues of the NRG (GAkdNRG*) and showed that it diminishes the interaction with P-Smad2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). As judged by fluorescence from the GFP tag, all of the above mutant Arkadia proteins are localized in the nucleus and are expressed at comparable levels to full-length Arkadia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg004">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that loss of the interaction of the various Arkadia deletion constructs is not due to instability or differential localization. Collectively, the above data indicate that Arkadia interacts directly with P-Smad2/3 via its 100-aa C-terminal portion and that within this domain, a 14-aa NRG motif is essential for this interaction. As the 293T cells that we used for the IPs do not express <italic>FoxH1</italic> (unpublished data), one of the major P-Smad2/3 transcription partners in early embryogenesis, we conclude that the interaction of Arkadia with P-Smad2/3 may not depend on a particular partner.</p>

        <p>As P-Smad2/3 interact with Arkadia, it is possible that they are substrates of Arkadia ubiquitination. To address this, we examined the ubiquitination status of P-Smad2 in the presence or absence of Arkadia expression. We used <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts lines (MEFs) to exclude any endogenous Arkadia activity and introduced Flag-Smad2 and Alk4* to obtain phosphorylated Flag-Smad2, in the presence of full-length or mutant forms of Arkadia. Western blot analysis of the IPs with anti-P-Smad2 antibodies showed the existence of higher molecular weight forms of P-Smad2 associated specifically with the presence of full-length Arkadia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">4</xref>B and S4) suggesting poly-ubiquitination. Probing with ubiquitin antibodies confirmed that these modifications contain ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">4</xref>B and S4). Furthermore, these blots show that P-Smad2 is not ubiquitinated in the presence of mutant Arkadia proteins lacking either ubiquitin ligase activity (GAkdR*) or the P-Smad2 interaction domain (GAkdNRG*; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">4</xref>B). Therefore, Arkadia ubiquitinates P-Smad2 in vivo, and this depends on both its ubiquitin ligase activity and the P-Smad2/3 interaction domain, suggesting that Arkadia ubiquitinates them directly.</p>

Note the presence of higher molecular weight P-Smad2 corresponding to protein modifications, including ubiquitin chains as shown by the presence of HA-ubiquitin tags (A) or ubiquitin (B). These are present only in cells transfected with full-length Arkadia and not with GFP (A and B) or mutant forms GAkdR* (A) and GAkdNRG* (B), which disrupt the ubiquitin ligase activity and the interaction with P-Smad2, respectively.</p>

P-Smad2 protein levels decrease specifically in cells expressing Arkadia, and this does not occur when the proteasome is inhibited or when the RING domain is mutated (GAkdR*), indicating that the degradation is mediated via the proteasome and the ubiquitin ligase activity of Arkadia. (E) Graphical representation of relative endogenous P-Smad2 levels normalized against the housekeeping gene Tubulin shows approximately a 2.5-fold reduction of P-Smad2 in Arkadia-expressing MEFs in the presence of DMSO when compared to MG132.

        <p>To verify that P-Smad2/3 ubiquitination is directly dependent on Arkadia, we performed the assay in vitro by adding all the components of ubiquitination separately along with recombinant full-length Arkadia, the C-terminal part of Arkadia containing the RING and the NRG, or N-terminal Arkadia. In this reaction we added the phosphorylated Flag-Smad2 obtained by IP as shown before (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B), and examined by Western blot, with anti-P-Smad2 antibody, whether or not it becomes modified by the ubiquitination reaction. We found that the full-length and C-terminal Arkadia are capable of poly-ubiquitinating in vitro Flag-P-Smad2, only when all the ubiquitination components were present, while the N-terminal Arkadia does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figures 4</xref>C and S5B). In addition, the Flag-P-Smad2 substrate does not become ubiquitinated without the addition of recombinant Arkadia, indicating that the IP is not contaminated with ubiquitin ligases from the cells. Collectively, the data show that P-Smad2/3 are ubiquitinated directly by Arkadia in vivo and in vitro, and therefore, they are qualified substrates of Arkadia ubiquitination.</p>

        <title>Arkadia Mediates Proteasome-Dependent Degradation of P-Smad2</title>
        <p>Poly-ubiquitination of proteins usually leads to degradation via the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b035">35</xref>]. Consistent with this, our data show that P-Smad2/3 are unstable in the presence of Arkadia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g002">Figure 2</xref>), but it was unknown whether this instability is mediated by the proteasome. To address this, we transfected <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> MEFs with full-length Arkadia or Arkadia lacking ubiquitin ligase activity under ligand stimulation and examined with an anti-P-Smad2 antibody the stability of transfected P-Flag-Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figure 4</xref>D) or endogenous P-Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figure 4</xref>E) in the presence or absence of MG132 proteasome inhibitor. We found that P-Smad2 levels are reduced specifically in the presence of full-length Arkadia and that MG132 can inhibit this. Therefore, Arkadia, via its ubiquitin ligase activity, is sufficient to induce P-Smad2 proteasome-dependent degradation.</p>
        <p>In the above experiments, the degradation of P-Smad2 was achieved by the transfection of exogenous Arkadia in −/− MEFs. To examine whether endogenous Arkadia is necessary for proteasome-dependent degradation of P-Smad2, we compared its decay in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> and wild-type ES cells in the presence or absence of MG132. For this we first stimulated the ES cells with Activin (1 h), then added SB inhibitor to prevent further phosphorylation of Smad2 and examined its decay at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). We found that MG132 protects P-Smad2 in wild-type ES cells but has very little effect in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). Therefore, Arkadia, by direct poly-ubiquitination, most likely mediates degradation of P-Smad2 by the proteasome.</p>

        <title>Arkadia Is Necessary and Sufficient to Enhance P-Smad2/3 Transcriptional Activity</title>
        <p>We showed above that loss of Arkadia leads to the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of P-Smad2/3. But do these higher levels correspond to an increase in target gene transcription? Analysis of <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> and compound <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic>, <italic>Nodal+/−</italic> embryos showed that Nodal signaling is defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g001">Figure 1</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b040">40</xref>]) suggesting that Smad2/3 target gene transcription is compromised. We examined the transcriptional activity of P-Smad2/3 in three <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> and three wild-type ES cell lines. To estimate the relative levels of P-Smad2/3 transcriptional activity, we used two different target gene luciferase reporters, <italic>0.9-P1,</italic> (hereafter termed <italic>Pitx2-luc</italic>) regulated by P-Smad2/3 and its partner factor FoxH1, and <italic>9xCAGA</italic>–<italic>luc,</italic> a Smad3 specific reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b053">53</xref>]. Although the <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> ES cell lines always have a higher amount of P-Smad2 protein compared to wild-type, they have on average 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) lower luciferase from the wild-type cell line with the lowest activity (WT 3 designated as reference = zero). Stimulation with Activin did not change significantly the luciferase reporter expression (unpublished data); indicating that under standard culture conditions ES cells exhibit ligand-saturated signaling (autocrine signaling). In addition, real-time PCR showed that the expression of the endogenous <italic>Nodal</italic> gene, which like the <italic>Pitx2</italic>-<italic>luc</italic> luciferase reporter is regulated by FoxH1/Smad2/3 binding sites (known as ASE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b012">12</xref>], is reduced by about 70% in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Together, these observations suggest that Arkadia is necessary for efficient target gene expression and suggest that in its absence, the stable and high levels of P-Smad2/3 are hypoactive or prevented from activating their target genes. Therefore, although Arkadia degrades P-Smad2/3, it is necessary for efficient P-Smad2/3 transcriptional activity.</p>

GAkd expression doubles <italic>Pitx2-luc</italic> reporter activity in <italic>Akd−/−</italic> ES cells and the enhancement is 50% higher than the average level (Av) of wild-type ES cells (horizontal line). The values are normalized against GFP-transfected <italic>Akd</italic>−/− cell line 3, which has the lowest signaling.</p>

            <p>(E) Super-activation is abolished when mutant Arkadias, GAkdR*, and GAkdNRG* are transfected, indicating that the enhancement requires Arkadia ubiquitin ligase activity and an interaction with P-Smad2/3.</p>

        <p>To address whether Arkadia is sufficient to activate P-Smad2/3, we performed gain-of-function experiments in ES cells. We introduced full-length Arkadia (GFP-tagged; GAkd) in three −/− ES cell lines and showed that it enhances the expression of the luciferase reporters on average 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>C) and 230% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>D) above the level of a GFP-expressing plasmid. Interestingly, in wild-type ES cells, Arkadia does not significantly change the reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">5</xref>D) even after Activin stimulation (unpublished data). This indicates that endogenous Arkadia is adequate to activate all P-Smad2/3 generated by the receptors. Together, these results suggest that Arkadia is necessary and sufficient to enhance P-Smad2/3 target gene transcription.</p>

        <title>Arkadia Enhances and Degrades P-Smad2/3 via the Same Domains</title>
        <p>According to the above data, Arkadia has two functions: to destabilize P-Smad2/3 and enhance their activity. As it is possible that different domains mediate the two opposing functions, we used the −/− ES cell functional assay to identify domains that are essential for Arkadia to enhance reporter activity. We found that Arkadia constructs with ubiquitin ligase domain mutations (GAkdR* and GAkdR2*) or Arkadia without the P-Smad2/3 interaction domain (NRG deletion, GAkdNRG) fail to enhance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>E); suggesting that like the degradation of P-Smad2/3, activation also requires a direct interaction with Arkadia and its ubiquitin ligase activity. Examination of several N-terminal deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) showed that the C-terminal half (516–989 aa) of Arkadia is the minimum region sufficient to enhance the reporter efficiently (unpublished data). Furthermore, loss of the P-Smad2/3 activation, but not the degradation properties of Arkadia, is expected to convert it to a repressor of signaling. However, none of the deletions and mutations of Arkadia separated the two functions. Together, the above data suggest that Arkadia activates and degrades P-Smad2/3 via the same domains and that the two functions are most likely coupled.</p>

        <title>Enhancement of P-Smad2/3 by Arkadia Occurs at the Expense of Their Abundance</title>
        <p>To test whether the activation of the hypoactive P-Smad2/3 by Arkadia occurs at the expense of their levels, we examined the relationship between levels of endogenous P-Smad2 and the degree of enhancement after expression of Arkadia in −/− ES cells. To visualize levels of endogenous P-Smad2, we isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) pure populations of cells transfected with GAkd or enzymatically (ubiquitin ligase) inactive Arkadia (GAkdR*) or control GFP constructs. A portion of the cells was used for luciferase assays and the rest was used to examine endogenous P-Smad2 and total Smad2 levels in Western blots. As before, Arkadia enhances signaling only in −/− ES cells in a ubiquitin-ligase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g006">Figure 6</xref>A); and this phenomenon was accompanied by an 80% reduction in the level of P-Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), confirming that activation of the hypoactive P-Smad2 is followed by its degradation.</p>

Note that expression of full-length Arkadia results in super-activation and a reduction of around 80% of P-Smad2, only in <italic>Akd</italic>−/− ES cells, which have an accumulation of P-Smad2 (compare P-Smad2/Smad2 ratio). The phosphorylated Smad2 fraction is small as the ES cells are not stimulated (i.e., transfected with Alk4*), and therefore, the degradation of P-Smad2 is not reflected in the total level of Smad2. The graph represents P-Smad2 levels normalized against PCNA.</p>

We conclude that in wild-type cells endogenous Arkadia must be in excess and sufficient to activate all available P-Smad2/3 in the nucleus. The fact that P-Smad2 is not eliminated and signaling is never repressed by the overexpression of Arkadia suggests that only a fraction of P-Smad2 interacts with and gets degraded by Arkadia, i.e., nuclear P-Smads and perhaps those engaged in transcription. The above data confirm the dual role and coexisting functions of Arkadia, suggesting that Arkadia enhances P-Smad2/3 activity at the expense of their levels.</p>

        <title>Super-Activation by Arkadia in −/− ES Cells Is a Transient Phenomenon</title>
        <p>An interesting observation is that in −/− ES cells, Arkadia expression not only restores the transcriptional deficit but it enhances reporter activity on average 50% (line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>C) or 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>D) above the maximum level that can be achieved in wild-type ES cells. The simplest explanation for this phenomenon is that the extra activity most likely reflects the accumulated levels of the hypoactive P-Smad2/3 that is being simultaneously activated by the expression of Arkadia. As this enhancement exceeds the maximum that can be achieved in wild-type ES cells even under ligand stimulation conditions, we termed it super-activation. According to this hypothesis, Arkadia expression in −/− ES cells will eventually “consume” (activate and degrade) the accumulated P-Smad2/3, releasing their activity to produce a transient super-activation of target genes. Subsequently, target gene transcription will be reduced to basal levels similar to that of wild-type cells.</p>
        <p>We tested this prediction by comparing the percentage of enhancement by GAkd over that of the GFP control at different time points after transfection in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> ES cells. The results indicate that maximum super-activation occurs as early as 9 h post-transfection and coincides with the appearance of GFP fluorescence, declines after 15–18 h, and disappears after 30 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>F). GFP fluorescence remained high throughout the experiment and past 48 h (unpublished data) and does not account for the loss of super-activation at 30 h. The above data suggest that in −/− ES cells Arkadia releases the activity of the hypoactive and stable P-Smad2/3 pool causing target gene transcription above wild-type levels (super-activation), and as this is a transient phenomenon, it occurs at the expense of P-Smad2/3 abundance. Therefore, Arkadia functions by a mechanism that consumes P-Smad2/3 as it activates them.</p>

However, this expression cannot be assessed in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos because they lack a node and mesendoderm, which are essential for establishing left-right asymmetry. Using tetraploid chimeras (TC), we have previously shown that restoration of <italic>Arkadia</italic> expression in the extraembryonic lineages is sufficient to rescue the node and notochord formation in an embryo that consists entirely of <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>]. We therefore generated TC embryos by injecting <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> ES cells in tetraploid wild-type blastocysts. The rescue of node formation in the <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> TC embryos is shown with the appearance of <italic>Nodal</italic> expression around the node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>D), which is absent in <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>E).

Furthermore, the expression of <italic>Nodal</italic> in the node of the TC embryos is not reduced (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">7</xref>D) and is consistent with previous findings that this expression does not depend on Smad2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b057">57</xref>]. This confirms that Arkadia is required specifically for the expression of Smad2/3 target genes in vivo. Therefore, in the absence of Arkadia, Nodal target gene expression is reduced broadly in many cells and tissues throughout early embryogenesis, before and during gastrulation, and can account for the developmental defects observed in the −/− embryos. In addition, the effect of Arkadia on <italic>Nodal</italic> gene expression can explain its non-cell autonomous functions in the <italic>Arkadia</italic>−/− TC embryos where wild-type VE (expressing Nodal) can rescue node formation, and those reported in the literature for <italic>Xenopus</italic> assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b040">40</xref>].</p>

        <title>Arkadia Phenocopies Smad2 and Is Required for Foregut and Prechordal Plate Formation</title>
        <p>According to the biochemical and functional data in ES cells, Arkadia interacts with P-Smad2, and this interaction is essential for the full expression of target genes. It is therefore expected that <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos and ES cells will have similar defects and exhibit the same phenotypes with those of <italic>Smad2</italic>−/− cells. The phenotype of mice with conditional <italic>FoxH1</italic> or <italic>Smad2</italic> deletion exclusively in the epiblast shows that they cannot form ADE/future foregut or prechordal plate (the most anterior mesendoderm). Furthermore, injection of <italic>FoxH1</italic>−/− or <italic>Smad2</italic>−/− ES cells in wild-type blastocysts shows that the −/− cells cannot colonize tissues such as the gut and the prechordal plate, indicating a cell autonomous requirement for these factors in these chimeras (mosaic embryos) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b059">59</xref>]. It is therefore expected that <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos and ES cells will have the same defect and exhibit the same phenotypes with those of <italic>Smad2</italic>−/− cells. Expression of <italic>Hex,</italic> an ADE/foregut marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b044">44</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>M and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">7</xref>N) and <italic>Shh,</italic> a prechordal plate marker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg006">Figure S6</xref>), show that although <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> TC embryos develop node and mesendoderm, they exhibit a deficit in these tissues. Consistent with the role of the ADE and the prechordal plate in maintaining and patterning the head folds, we observed that the <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> TC exhibit reduction of the head folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>J, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">7</xref>L, and 7N) that can also account for the reduction of <italic>Pitx2</italic> expression in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>L).</p>
        <p>The requirement for Arkadia expression within the cells that form the ADE/foregut and the prechordal plate was addressed in mosaic chimeras generated either by injection of wild-type ES cells into <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>O) or by <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> ES cells into wild-type blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>P) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>]. In both types of chimeras, the embryo consists of a mixture of wild-type (unstained) and <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> cells (β-galactosidase stained) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>]. We found that mosaic chimeras (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 100) exhibit normal morphology, as long as wild-type cells colonize the foregut and the prechordal plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>O and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">7</xref>P). Therefore, like Smad2, Arkadia is required cell autonomously for ADE/foregut and prechordal plate formation. The above data show that Arkadia loss-of-function phenocopies that of Smad2 in embryonic cells, supporting a functional interaction between the two factors.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>An important unanswered question is how the promoters of target genes are cleared and refreshed from transcription factors that are activated by signal transduction pathways to allow rapid intracellular responses to dynamic changes in the concentration of extracellular ligands. We show here that Arkadia terminates signaling at the level of transcription, by linking the ubiquitination/degradation of P-Smad2/3 to their transcriptional activity. Therefore, this mechanism enhances transcription but limits the time that the effector works by inducing its turnover. This represents the first example of coupled activation and degradation of signaling effectors, as well as a critical role for this mechanism in development. It is possible that very similar mechanisms operate in other pathways to establish dynamic regulation and efficient signaling, while their failure may be associated with disease.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>P-Smad2/3 Turnover</title>
        <p>Experiments using somatic tissue culture cell lines showed that Arkadia might enhance TGF-β signaling by degrading the Smad6/7, which are known to inhibit Smad2/3 phosphorylation mainly by mediating the degradation of the receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b042">42</xref>]. If this is the case, then embryos and ES cells should have reduced levels of P-Smad2/3 in the absence of Arkadia. Contrary to this prediction, all <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos and ES cells have at least 2-fold higher P-Smad2/3 levels compared to wild-type. Therefore, Arkadia must enhance signaling via a different mechanism during early development.</p>
        <p>In vivo, in ES cells, MEFs, and embryos, loss of Arkadia causes P-Smad2/3 stabilization and accumulation in the nucleus and makes them resistant to proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that Arkadia directly or indirectly is associated with their stability and degradation. Destruction of P-Smad2 had been shown previously to occur in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b038">38</xref>], but a nuclear ubiquitin ligase that interacts specifically with the phosphorylated form of Smad2/3, as well as the role of proteasome-mediated turnover of P-Smads during development, remained unknown. We present here a number of experiments indicating that Arkadia, a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with P-Smad2/3 and directly ubiquitinates them leading to their degradation by the proteasome. These include IP experiments showing that Arkadia interacts specifically with the phosphorylated forms of Smad2/3 via the conserved NRG domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">3</xref>B), and in vitro ubiquitination assays showing that Arkadia directly poly-ubiquitinates P-Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figures 4</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">4</xref>C and S5). Furthermore, introduction of Arkadia in −/− cells causes P-Smad2 poly-ubiquitination and decreases its abundance in a proteasome-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figure 4</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">4</xref>E). However, as Arkadia is nuclear, it most likely degrades nuclear P-Smads.</p>

        <title>Signaling Termination at the End of the Cascade</title>
        <p>One of the major questions is how effector activity is terminated after target genes have been activated and not before. This should involve a mechanism to distinguish between effectors actively engaged in transcription and those that are fresh and unused. A modification or a change of conformation of the effectors when they interact with the target-gene promoter complex may allow recognition by a critical component of the termination mechanism (referred to subsequently as the terminator). In this case, absence of the terminator should lead to a prolonged, persistent response to signaling, as the unhindered effectors will continue to transcribe. On the other hand, excess terminator could cause repression of signaling if it degrades and deactivates the effectors prematurely, i.e., as soon as they bind to the promoter. A more precise and efficient mechanism would involve degradation of the effectors after they activate at least one round of transcription. This requires a terminator directly involved in transcription by the effectors or an even more stringent mechanism, where initiation of transcription is linked with the destruction of the transcription factor: a “suicide” model. In this case, absence of the terminator will pause transcription, while its overexpression will not degrade/deactivate the effectors prematurely to repress target gene transcription. We show here that Arkadia fulfils the criteria of such a termination mechanism as it degrades P-Smad2/3 and enhances their target gene transcription via the same domains.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s3c">
        <title>P-Smad2/3 Activation</title>
        <p>Does Arkadia directly activate P-Smad2/3? In the absence of Arkadia, P-Smad2/3 are stable and accumulate in the nucleus, but they are repressed or hypoactive as target gene transcription is reduced and in some cases lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Introduction of Arkadia in −/− ES cells not only restores signaling but super-activates P-Smads, meaning that the expression of the reporter reaches levels higher than those that can be achieved in wild-type ES cells under maximum ligand stimulation conditions. The above findings suggest that the extra activity is not generated by receptors or ligands, but by the release of activity from the pools of the accumulated hypoactive P-Smad2/3. Consistent with this hypothesis, super-activation by Arkadia in −/− ES cells is a transient phenomenon, as it depends on the excess P-Smad2 that is used up. Therefore, Arkadia degrades and spends P-Smad2/3 to activate their transcriptional activity. These observations suggest that P-Smad2/3 is reminiscent of fuel, which in the absence of Arkadia is stable and can be stored, while in its presence it is “ignited” and “burns,” releasing activity. These observations suggest that phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by the receptors is not sufficient for their transcriptional activity and that they require an additional step mediated by the function of Arkadia as a coactivator in the nucleus.</p>
        <p>We have shown previously that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap assay, injection of Arkadia RNA enhances the ability of Nodal but not that of Smad2 RNA to induce mesendoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b040">40</xref>]. This appears inconsistent with our current data, however; as in the animal cap there is no ligand to phosphorylate Smad2, it remains a mystery how Smad2 RNA injection alone induces mesoderm and mesendoderm. Furthermore, the amount of Smad2 RNA required for this is very high and most likely does not represent physiological signaling conditions. More importantly, we show here that Arkadia recognizes P-Smad2 and not Smad2, and therefore it is not surprising that in the Smad2-injected animal caps Arkadia does not induce mesendoderm.</p>
        <p>While the exact mechanism of how P-Smad2/3 are activated by Arkadia remains unknown, it is important to point out that Arkadia does not degrade P-Smads directly, it only modifies them by ubiquitination and is the proteasome that degrades them. Although the role of ubiquitin modification in mediating proteasome degradation is well established, it has become apparent that addition of ubiquitin onto proteins may also affect their properties. Recent studies have suggested a direct role of ubiquitin modifications and of the proteasome in transcriptional activation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b063">63</xref>]). It is possible, however, that Arkadia interacts with, and degrades simultaneously, P-Smads and a closely linked repressor. Future studies will determine the mechanism of P-Smad2/3 activation and how this is coupled with immediate degradation. In conclusion, by linking P-Smad2/3 activation with degradation, Arkadia provides a way to achieve rapid resetting of P-Smad2/3 target gene transcription in development and allows efficient and dynamic responses to Nodal/TGF-β signaling events.</p>

        <title>Nodal Expression and the Induction of the Node/Organizer</title>
        <p>We had shown previously that <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryos do not develop anterior primitive streak and its derivative tissues: ADE/future foregut, mesendoderm (prechordal plate and notochord), and node [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these abnormalities were not understood. Specifically, we had shown that the formation of the node is restored in chimeric embryos consisting of tetraploid wild-type extraembryonic lineages (such as VE) and exclusively <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryonic tissues derived from −/− ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>]. This indicates that the development of the node in the embryonic lineages requires Arkadia expression and function within a different lineage (extraembryonic). As Arkadia is nuclear and unlikely to be secreted, this effect was presumed to be mediated by a downstream-secreted factor. Here we show that Arkadia increases directly the transcription of P-Smad2 target genes, which include the <italic>Nodal</italic> gene itself, particularly in the VE and early epiblast when node precursors are induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that in the <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> TC, the wild-type VE provides sufficient Nodal to partially restore the overall level of Nodal in the <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> epiblast, thus bringing it up to the threshold required for node formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>D and unpublished data). Therefore, organizer/node induction requires high levels of Nodal, which can be achieved with a considerable contribution from the VE.</p>

        <title>Arkadia in Foregut Development</title>
        <p>While the node may be rescued, to what extent expression of Arkadia in the extraembryonic lineages is sufficient to restore normal development in the <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> embryo of the TC? We show here that these embryos cannot form the most anterior derivatives of the primitive streak, such as ADE/foregut and prechordal plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>), and exhibit laterality defects, including delayed turning and heart looping ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>] and unpublished data). This is consistent with our findings that Arkadia is required for efficient P-Smad2/3 target gene transcription. Specifically, the reduction of <italic>Nodal</italic> expression in the left LPM along with its known target genes <italic>(Lefty2</italic> and <italic>Pitx2)</italic> can account for the left-right axis defects. The Nodal target genes that are responsible for foregut and prechordal plate development remain unknown. However, the development of these tissues must depend on the expression of Arkadia within these cells or their precursors. This was shown by the analysis of chimeric embryos consisting of a mixture of wild-type and <italic>Arkadia−/−</italic> cells, which revealed that the −/− cells could not contribute to these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>O and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">7</xref>P).

        <title>How Is Maximum Nodal Signaling Achieved?</title>
        <p>Our data show that Arkadia is essential for the development of tissues that depend on very high Nodal signaling such as ADE/foregut, and that its introduction in −/− ES cells can boost signaling above levels obtained by just high concentrations of ligand “super-activation.” This latter phenomenon is presumably generated by the simultaneous activation of the accumulated P-Smad2/3, which has been stabilized and reached higher than normal levels in the absence of Arkadia. It is possible that such a mechanism may be responsible for maximizing Nodal signaling in the embryo. However, it would require the transient absence of Arkadia in the precursors of the ADE/foregut. Although Arkadia RNA is present broadly in the embryo, protein analysis is needed to reveal whether super-activation occurs in the embryo.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we reveal a novel ubiquitin-mediated mechanism of TGF-β signaling regulation that depends on Arkadia, involves the activation of P-Smad2/3 signaling effectors downstream of receptor-phosphorylation, and couples their high activity with turnover and signaling termination. As the TGF-β/Nodal signaling pathway has been linked to cancers and genetic diseases, the identification of key molecular players such as Arkadia would be useful for the development of new drug targets and therapeutic intervention.</p>

Flag-P-Smad2 was obtained with IP from 293T cells. Beads bound to Flag-P-Smad2 protein were washed with RIPA buffer and incubated for 1 h by constant rotation at 4 °C with radiolabeled recombinant proteins in 1 ml of RIPA buffer. Protein-bead complexes were then washed four times with RIPA buffer (200 × bed volume) and re-suspended in 2 × Laemelli buffer. The presence of radiolabeled Arkadia protein in pull-downs was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Assays were carried out in 20 μl of ubiquitination assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH7.7], 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT) containing 15 μg of GST-ubiquitin (Boston Biochem, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bostonbiochem.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bostonbiochem.com</ext-link>), 1 μg of E1 (Boston Biochem), 1.5 μg of E2 (GSTUbcH5b and GST-UbcH5c; Boston Biochem), 0.6 μl of Energy Regeneration Solution (Boston Biochem), and Flag-P-Smad2 immunoprecipitated from 293T cells.
