            </abstract><abstract>
                <p>Mitochondrial shape is determined by fission and fusion reactions catalyzed by
                    large GTPases of the dynamin family, mutation of which can cause neurological
                    dysfunction. While fission-inducing protein phosphatases have been identified,
                    the identity of opposing kinase signaling complexes has remained elusive. We
                    report here that in both neurons and non-neuronal cells, cAMP elevation and
                    expression of an outer-mitochondrial membrane (OMM) targeted form of the protein
                    kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit reshapes mitochondria into an interconnected
                    network. Conversely, OMM-targeting of the PKA inhibitor PKI promotes
                    mitochondrial fragmentation upstream of neuronal death. RNAi and overexpression
                    approaches identify mitochondria-localized A kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1)
                    as a neuroprotective and mitochondria-stabilizing factor in vitro and in vivo.
                    According to epistasis studies with phosphorylation site-mutant dynamin-related
                    protein 1 (Drp1), inhibition of the mitochondrial fission enzyme through a
                    conserved PKA site is the principal mechanism by which cAMP and PKA/AKAP1
                    promote both mitochondrial elongation and neuronal survival. Phenocopied by a
                    mutation that slows GTP hydrolysis, Drp1 phosphorylation inhibits the
                    disassembly step of its catalytic cycle, accumulating large, slowly recycling
                    Drp1 oligomers at the OMM. Unopposed fusion then promotes formation of a
                    mitochondrial reticulum, which protects neurons from diverse insults.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Mitochondria, the cellular powerhouse, are highly dynamic organelles shaped by
                    opposing fission and fusion events. Research over the past decade has identified
                    many components of the mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery and led to the
                    discovery that mutations in genes coding for these proteins can cause human
                    neurological diseases. While it is well established that mitochondrial shape
                    changes are intimately involved in cellular responses to environmental
                    stressors, we know very little about the mechanisms by which cells dynamically
                    adjust mitochondrial form and function. In this report, we show that the
                    scaffold protein AKAP1 brings the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA to the outer
                    mitochondrial membrane to protect neurons from injury. The PKA/AKAP1 complex
                    functions by inhibiting Drp1, an enzyme that mechanically constricts and
                    eventually severs mitochondria. Whereas active, dephosphorylated Drp1 rapidly
                    cycles between cytosol and mitochondria, phosphorylated Drp1 builds up in
                    inactive mitochondrial complexes, allowing mitochondria to fuse into a
                    neuroprotective reticulum. Our results suggest that altering the balance of
                    kinase and phosphatase activities at the outer mitochondrial membrane may
                    provide the basis for novel neuroprotective therapies.</p>

            <p>Opposing fission and fusion events determine the shape and interconnectivity of
                mitochondria to regulate various aspects of their function, including ATP
                production, Ca<sup>++</sup> buffering, free radical homeostasis,
                mitochondrial DNA inheritance, and organelle quality control. In addition,
                fragmentation of neuronal mitochondria is necessary for their transport to and
                proper development and function of synapses. Moreover, mitochondrial fission is an
                early step in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, and inhibiting fission can block
                or delay apoptosis in a variety of cell types, including neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Chen1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Suen1">[3]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Fission and fusion processes are catalyzed by large GTPases of the dynamin
                superfamily. Mitochondrial fission requires dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which,
                similar to the “pinchase” dynamin, is thought to mechanically constrict
                and eventually sever mitochondria. Normally a largely cytosolic protein, Drp1 is
                recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) by a poorly characterized
                multiprotein complex that includes the transmembrane proteins Fis1 and Mff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Hoppins1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-GandreBabbe1">[6]</xref>.
                Mitochondrial fusion is carried out by the concerted action of OMM-anchored GTPases
                (mitofusin-1 and -2 in vertebrates) and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1), a GTPase localized
                to the intermembrane space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Hoppins1">[4]</xref>. A properly controlled fission/fusion balance appears to
                be particularly critical in neurons, since mutations in mitochondrial fission/fusion
                enzymes are responsible for common neurological disorders in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Zuchner1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Waterham1">[10]</xref>. All
                mitochondria-restructuring enzymes are essential for mammalian development, as mice
                that lack Drp1, Opa1, or either of the two mitofusins die during early embryogenesis
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Davies1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Wakabayashi1">[14]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Our understanding of the signaling events that regulate this group of organelle
                shaping GTPases is limited. Drp1, in particular, is subject to complex
                posttranslational modification by ubiquitylation, sumoylation, nitrosylation, and
                phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Cho1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Santel1">[16]</xref>. Highly conserved among metazoan Drp1 orthologs, the two
                characterized serine phosphorylation sites are located 20 amino acids apart,
                bordering the C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED). Since the numbering differs
                between Drp1 orthologs and splice variants, we will refer to these sites by the
                kinase first shown to target them, rather than their sequence number.
                    Ser<sub>CDK</sub> (Ser616 in human, Ser635 in rat splice variant 1) is
                phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependant kinase 1/cyclin B complex, leading to
                fragmentation of the mitochondrial network during mitosis. Phosphorylation of
                    Ser<sub>PKA</sub> (Ser637 in human, Ser656 in rat splice variant 1) is mediated
                by both PKA and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI).
                Three laboratories, including ours, found that Ser<sub>PKA</sub> phosphorylation by
                PKA promotes mitochondrial elongation presumably through Drp1 inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Cereghetti1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Chang1">[19]</xref>, whereas a

            <p>We previously showed that Bβ2, a neuron-specific and OMM-targeted regulatory
                subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), sensitizes neurons to various insults by
                promoting mitochondrial fission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Dagda1">[21]</xref>. Here, we identify outer mitochondrial PKA as the
                opposing fusion and survival promoting kinase. Evidence for a model is presented in
                which the multifunctional scaffold protein AKAP1 recruits PKA to the OMM to
                phosphorylate Drp1 at Ser<sub>PKA</sub>. Phosphorylation traps Drp1 in large, slowly
                recycling complexes, allowing mitochondria to fuse into a neuroprotective
                reticulum.</p>

                    Mitochondria were visualized by transfection with mitochondria-targeted GFP or
                    by live-staining with the fluorescent dye MitoTracker Red. Application of the
                    adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin either alone or in combination with the
                    phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor rolipram resulted in the conversion of

                    striatum and hippocampus of rats; the left hemisphere received injections with a
                    control lentivirus encoding mitochondrial (m)GFP (targeted via the N terminus of
                    cytochrome oxidase VIII). After 7–14 d, mitochondrial shape was assessed
                    by automated morphometry of confocal z-stacks from perfusion-fixed brain
                    sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000612-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).
                    Compared to mGFP, lentiviral delivery of AKAP1 into the hippocampus and striatum
                    induced robust mitochondrial fusion as indicated by two independent metrics,
                    form factor, which measures elongation of individual mitochondria, and
                    cumulative area:perimeter ratio, which measures mitochondrial interconnectivity
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000612-g003">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Thus,
                    neuroprotection by PKA/AKAP1 is associated with mitochondrial elongation both in
                    vitro and in vivo.</p>

                <p>PKA/AKAP1 could maintain elongated mitochondria by inhibiting fission or
                    promoting fusion reactions. The mitochondrial fission enzyme Drp1 was previously

                    Especially at lower forskolin/rolipram concentrations, recruitment of the PKA
                    holoenzyme to mitochondria via wild-type AKAP1 significantly enhanced Drp1

                <p>Next, we investigated the role of Drp1 phosphorylation in AKAP1-mediated

                <p>Furthermore, PKA/AKAP1-induced mitochondrial elongation was nearly abolished when

                <p>We confirmed an epistatic relationship between AKAP1 and Drp1 Ser<sub>PKA</sub>
                    in primary hippocampal neurons. Substitution of endogenous with

                    These experiments indicate that PKA/AKAP1 inhibits mitochondrial fission by

                    To examine whether Drp1 may instead be the critical prosurvival substrate of

                    apoptosis inducer staurosporine, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor previously
                    shown to dephosphorylate Drp1 at Ser<sub>PKA</sub>

                    significantly attenuated apoptosis induced by staurosporine (0.5 µM for 24
                    h) when endogenous Drp1 was replaced with wild-type GFP-Drp1. Replacement with
                    Ser→Ala mutant Drp1, instead, negated the antiapoptotic effect of AKAP1
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000612-g007">Figure 7E,F</xref>).
                    Conversely, AKAP1 knockdown in wild-type GFP-Drp1 expressing cells moderately
                    increased the percentage with apoptotic nuclei compared to scrambled shRNA.
                    Pseudophosphorylated (S→D mutant) Drp1 overcame the proapoptotic effect of
                    AKAP1 shRNA, reducing staurosporine-induced apoptosis to levels comparable to

                <p>How does PKA/AKAP1-mediated phosphorylation stabilize Drp1 oligomers at the OMM?
                        Ser<sub>PKA</sub> phosphorylation was previously shown to inhibit intrinsic
                    GTP hydrolysis by Drp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Chang1">[19]</xref>. Dnm1, the yeast ortholog of Drp1, assembles into
                    fission-competent complexes in its GTP-bound state, but assembly also stimulates
                    GTP hydrolysis, effectively limiting the size of Dnm1 oligomers at the OMM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Lackner1">[28]</xref>.
                    Therefore, an attractively simple hypothesis compatible with our observations is
                    that PKA/AKAP1 phosphorylation of Drp1 attenuates GTP hydrolysis, thereby
                    allowing Drp1 oligomers to grow beyond a size that is compatible with membrane
                    remodeling.</p>
                <p>This hypothesis predicts that GTPase-impaired Drp1 mutants should behave
                    similarly to phospho-Ser<sub>PKA</sub> Drp1. We initially analyzed the widely
                    used dominant-negative K38A mutant of Drp1, which affects a critical Lys residue

                    exclusively in large spherical aggregates that only occasionally overlapped with
                    mitochondria and that did not exchange with one another as detectable by FRAP
                    analysis (unpublished data). Aiming for a milder phenotype, we targeted Thr55 in

                <p>To assess the effect of the T55D mutation on mitochondrial morphology, HeLa cells
                    were transfected with different ratios of wild-type and T55D-mutant GFP-Drp1
                    plasmid (replacing endogenous Drp1 by RNAi from the same plasmid). Drp1 T55D
                    expression resulted in a dose-dependent increase in mitochondrial length,
                    demonstrating that the mutation impairs Drp1's fission activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000612-g009">Figure 9B,C</xref>). Remarkably,
                    GFP-Drp1 T55D also displayed a more pronounced, punctate mitochondrial
                    localization than wild-type Drp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000612-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Quantitative analysis confirmed that GFP-Drp1
                    colocalization with mitochondria (Manders' coefficient) was positively
                    correlated with relative expression levels of Drp1 T55D, as well as with

                        9C</xref>). Further FRAP analysis demonstrated that the T55D substitution
                    dramatically attenuates mitochondrial Drp1 dynamics, again in a dose-dependent
                    manner, slowing turnover by up to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000612-g009">Figure 9D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000612.s010">Video S2</xref>).
                    Similar to phosphorylation at Ser<sub>PKA</sub>, the T55D mutation also
                    increased the propensity of Drp1 to form sedimentable oligomeric structures
                    after intact cell crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000612-g009">Figure 9F</xref>).</p>
                <p>Therefore, inhibition of GTP hydrolysis (either by mutation of the GTPase domain
                    or by phosphorylation of Ser<sub>PKA</sub> by PKA/AKAP1) leads to a stable
                    accumulation of Drp1 at mitochondria, likely by interfering with a disassembly
                    step that is required for mitochondrial fission.</p>

                <p>In an effort to provide direct evidence that PKA phosphorylation slows the

                    GFP-Drp1 foci were mostly found to abut mitochondria, seemingly randomly
                    translocating along their length and pivoting around the organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000612-g010">Figure 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000612.s011">Video S3</xref>).
                    Mitochondrial fission events were observed only at sites of GFP-Drp1
                    accumulation, and GFP-Drp1 punctae frequently divided to segregate with the new
                    mitochondrial ends. When PKA was co-expressed, GFP-Drp1 punctae appeared larger
                    and less dynamic, and the frequency of mitochondrial fragmentation events
                    decreased. Foci formed by GTPase-impaired, T55D mutant Drp1 displayed a similar
                    albeit even more accentuated behavior, which correlated with the near absence of

                            to mitochondrial fission and release of Drp1 into the cytosol to
                            complete the cycle. OMM-anchored PKA/AKAP1 phosphorylates Drp1 at

            <p>This report establishes a role for outer mitochondrial PKA and, in particular, the
                PKA/AKAP1 complex in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and the protection
                from neuronal injury. The importance of cAMP/PKA signaling in cell survival is well
                documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Feliciello1">[26]</xref>. Phosphorylation and inactivation of Bad, a pro-apoptotic
                Bcl2-family protein, has been put forward as one of the critical survival promoting
                substrates of mitochondria-localized PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Harada1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Roy1">[33]</xref>. While AKAP1 expression in PC12
                cells was shown to increase Bad phosphorylation at multiple sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Affaitati1">[24]</xref>, our results
                indicate that Bad phosphorylation does not significantly contribute to the
                anti-apoptotic function of AKAP1. Instead, we present evidence that PKA targeting
                via AKAP1 opposes cell death mainly by gating Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission.
                Specifically, inhibition of endogenous PKA via OMM-targeted PKI leads to
                mitochondrial fragmentation and sensitizes neurons to pro-apoptotic stimuli, both of
                which are reversed by blocking the mitochondrial fission machinery. Conversely,
                recruiting PKA to mitochondria via expression of AKAP1 resulted in mitochondrial
                elongation in cell culture and in vivo and protected hippocampal neurons from
                rotenone toxicity. Both mitochondrial elongation and survival enhancement by AKAP1
                required PKA anchoring and Ser<sub>PKA</sub>-phosphorylatable Drp1, indicating a
                critical role for the PKA-Drp1 axis.</p>
            <p>However, our results do not rule out the possibility that PKA may cause mitochondrial
                elongation by promoting mitochondrial fusion events in addition to inhibiting
                mitochondrial division. For instance, a recent report showed that forskolin can
                stimulate mitochondrial fusion in a cell-free assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Schauss1">[34]</xref>.</p>
            <p>AKAP1 is a large, multifunctional adaptor protein with several splice variants and a
                highly conserved N-terminal transmembrane domain that acts as a mitochondrial
                targeting sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Ma1">[35]</xref>. Besides localizing the PKA holoenzyme, AKAP1 also
                interacts with the tyrosine phosphatase PTPD1, and through PTPD1 with the tyrosine
                kinase Src, as well as two Ser/Thr phosphatases, PP1 and PP2B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Cardone1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Abrenica1">[38]</xref>. The C-terminus of AKAP1
                contains Tudor and KH RNA binding domains, which were suggested to localize
                nucleus-derived mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins close to their destination
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Ginsberg1">[39]</xref>.</p>
            <p>A recent study described nuclear aggregation of mitochondria upon overexpressing an
                N-terminal fragment of AKAP1 containing the PKA binding domain. The authors did not,
                however, investigate whether this effect was PKA dependent and instead attributed
                the phenotype to a lack of RNA binding to the missing C terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Rogne1">[37]</xref>. In the present
                study, we consistently observed elongation but rarely nuclear aggregation of
                mitochondria, regardless of whether full-length or C-terminally truncated AKAP1
                (residues 1–524) was expressed. High levels of AKAP1 overexpression did
                sometimes induce nuclear aggregation of mitochondria, which may therefore be
                secondary to exaggerated fusion of the organelle. Mitochondrial remodeling depended
                on an intact PKA binding domain and was phenocopied and reversed by direct OMM
                tethering of PKA and PKI, respectively. Thus, PKA targeting is both necessary and
                sufficient for AKAP1-dependent regulation of mitochondrial morphogenesis.</p>
            <p>Both the PKA and the PTPD1/Src interaction domains are important for maintenance of
                mitochondrial membrane potential by AKAP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Livigni1">[40]</xref>. Hence, either mitochondrial
                recruitment of PTPD1/Src or an as yet undefined structural role of AKAP1 may explain
                why mitochondrial fission inhibitors rescue hippocampal neurons from omPKI
                expression but not from AKAP1 knockdown.</p>
            <p>Consistent with an essential role for AKAP1 in neuronal survival, a recent report
                demonstrated that ischemia induces expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Seven
                In-Absentia Homolog 2 (Siah2), which targets AKAP1 for rapid proteasomal degradation
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Carlucci1">[41]</xref>. Our
                study predicts that the hypoxia-induced loss of PKA anchoring at the OMM leads to
                disinhibition of Drp1 and contributes to the massive mitochondrial fragmentation
                that is a hallmark of ischemic brain injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Barsoum1">[42]</xref>.</p>
            <p>We have identified a conserved PKA phosphorylation site in the GTPase effector domain
                of Drp1 as the principal mediator of PKA/AKAP1-induced mitochondrial remodeling.
                AKAP1-mediated redistribution of PKA was shown to augment Drp1 Ser<sub>PKA</sub>
                phosphorylation, and mitochondria of cells expressing
                Ser<sub>PKA</sub>Ala-substituted Drp1 were unresponsive to cAMP and PKA/AKAP1. As to
                a mechanism, Drp1 activation via AKAP1 silencing was associated with accelerated
                cycling of the fission enzyme between cytosolic and mitochondrial pools. Conversely,
                Drp1 inhibition via cAMP or PKA recruitment or overexpression resulted in the
                accumulation of stable Drp1 oligomers at mitochondria and in an extension of the
                lifetime of mitochondrial Drp1 foci. Because Ser<sub>PKA</sub> phosphorylation
                decreased the K<sub>cat</sub> of GTP hydrolysis and because a mutation that
                stabilizes the GTP bound form of Drp1 mimicked the effects of PKA phosphorylation on
                localization and dynamics of the fission enzyme, modulation of Drp1's GTP cycle
                emerges as a probable mechanism for the mitochondria-stabilizing and neuroprotective
                actions of PKA/AKAP1.</p>
            <p>A previous FRAP study demonstrated that the apoptosis inducer staurosporine causes
                accumulation of slowly recycling mitochondrial YFP-Drp1 complexes, which colocalize
                with Bax and Bak. Since the arrest of Drp1 cycling occurs after mitochondria have
                fragmented but before they release cytochrome C, this phenomenon may be related to
                the proapoptotic christae remodeling activity of Drp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Wasiak1">[43]</xref>. Given that the pan-kinase
                inhibitor staurosporine actually inhibits Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser<sub>PKA</sub>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Cribbs1">[18]</xref>,
                mitochondrial accumulation of Drp1 during apoptosis likely occurs by a mechanism
                distinct from the one reported here, such as Drp1 sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Wasiak1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Zunino1">[44]</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-FigueroaRomero1">[45]</xref>).</p>
            <p>Seemingly at odds with our findings, another study previously suggested that
                calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser<sub>PKA</sub> promotes
                translocation of the fission enzyme to mitochondria, a conclusion largely based on
                overexpression of phosphorylation site-mutant Drp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Cereghetti1">[17]</xref>. Confirming and extending
                the findings of that report, we found that pseudophosphorylated
                (S<sub>PKA</sub>D-mutant) GFP-Drp1 partitions mostly with the cytosolic fraction
                (&gt;90%), oligomerizes less readily than wild-type Drp1, and only
                infrequently forms mitochondrial punctae (unpublished data), which is essentially
                opposite to the phenotype of Drp1 phosphorylated by PKA. Because Asp substitution of
                Drp1 Ser<sub>PKA</sub> at most incompletely reproduces the inhibitory effect of
                    Ser<sub>PKA</sub> phosphorylation on in vitro GTP hydrolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Cereghetti1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Chang1">[19]</xref>, we propose that
                the supposedly phosphomimetic substitution of Ser<sub>PKA</sub> with an acidic
                residue locks Drp1 into a partially inhibited state, arresting the enzyme at a
                different stage of its subcellular translocation cycle.</p>
            <p>Enhanced colocalization or cofractionation of Drp1 with mitochondria has previously
                been interpreted as evidence for Drp1 activation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Cereghetti1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Han1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Wang1">[46]</xref>). Our data and those of Zunino et
                al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Zunino1">[44]</xref> argue
                that Drp1 regulation is more complex, in that mitochondria-associated pools of Drp1
                may sometimes be inactive. Similar considerations apply to higher order oligomeric
                assembly of Drp1, which is clearly required for its function as a mechanoenzyme
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Lackner1">[28]</xref>. The
                crosslinking and particle tracking data presented here indicate that excessive
                oligomerization of Drp1 into particles unable to constrict and sever mitochondria
                occurs as a consequence of Ser<sub>PKA</sub> phosphorylation or mutation of the
                GTPase domain.</p>
            <p>In support of a model in which PKA/AKAP1 fuses mitochondria by accumulating Drp1 in
                inactive superstructures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000612-g010">Figure
                    10C</xref>), recent studies on the mechanism of action of dynamin suggest that
                the endocytosis motor assembles into relatively short oligomers (3 to 4 rungs of a
                spiral) before GTP hydrolysis-driven disassembly leads to membrane destabilization
                and scission. In contrast, disassembly of larger dynamin oligomers (assembled in the
                absence of GTP) does not effectively mediate membrane scission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Bashkirov1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Pucadyil1">[48]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Outer mitochondrial PKA-induced super-oligomerization of Drp1 could inhibit cell
                death by several, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. For instance, mitochondrial
                networks resulting from unopposed fusion can sustain higher metabolic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Mitra1">[49]</xref>, are relatively
                resistant to Bax insertion and cytochrome C release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Brooks1">[50]</xref>, and may also be more effective
                at sequestering cytotoxic calcium and reactive oxygen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Frieden1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Neuspiel1">[52]</xref>. More directly, PKA-mediated
                depletion of the cytosolic Drp1 pool could potentially interfere with pathological
                Drp1 activation by sumoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Wasiak1">[43]</xref> and nitrosylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Cho1">[15]</xref> and compete with Drp1 recruitment
                into Bax/Bak positive foci during apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000612-Karbowski1">[53]</xref>. The interplay between
                multi-site phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications of Drp1 in the
                regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis and cell death is undoubtedly complex and
                will require further attention.</p>
