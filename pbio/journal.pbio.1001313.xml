        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The transition to flowering is the most dramatic phase change in flowering plants and is crucial for reproductive success. Such a transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is controlled by seasonal changes in day length. Studies originally performed in the 1930s were the first to suggest that day length is perceived by a plant's leaves; by contrast, flower formation takes place in the shoot apical meristem (the tip of the shoot that gives rise to plant organs, such as leaves and flowers). The term “florigen” was later proposed to describe a mobile floral stimulus that moves from leaves to the shoot apical meristem to induce flowering. It is only recently that FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and its orthologs in various other plant species, was identified as being florigen, but how florigen is transported in plants remains completely unknown. Here, we report that a novel ER membrane protein, FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (FTIP1), interacts with FT in companion cells of the phloem (a specialized type of parenchyma cell in the phloem of the plant's vascular system) and mediates FT protein movement from companion cells to sieve elements (the conducting cells of the phloem), thus affecting FT transport to the shoot apical meristem in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. To our knowledge, this study reveals the first regulator that is required for florigen transport and offers new insights into possible florigen transport mechanisms in other flowering plants.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The transition to flowering, which is crucial for the reproductive success, is the most dramatic phase change in flowering plants. Plants are able to adjust the timing of this transition in response to environmental conditions, such as photoperiod, temperature, and availability of nutrients. Classic experiments on the photoperiodic control of flowering in various plants have demonstrated that plant response to day length begins with the perception of photoperiod in leaves, followed by the transmission of a floral stimulus into the shoot apical meristem (SAM), where flowers are generated instead of leaves. Such mobile floral stimulus moving from leaves to the SAM was proposed as “florigen” in the 1930s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Chailakhyan1">[1]</xref>. Since then, tremendous efforts have been made to understand the molecular nature of this signal. Recent findings have suggested that the proteins encoded by <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and its orthologs in other plant species are part of the long-sought florigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Corbesier1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Lin1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>FT</italic> encodes a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein family and acts as a crucial regulator that relays flowering signals from the photoperiod pathway to floral meristem identity genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which is a long-day (LD) facultative plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Kobayashi1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Kardailsky1">[10]</xref>. Under LDs, <italic>FT</italic> mRNA expression is activated by the CONSTANS (CO) transcriptional regulator in the vascular tissues of leaves and displays circadian rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Wigge1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-SuarezLopez1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Takada1">[14]</xref>. It has been suggested that long-distance movement of FT protein from leaves to the shoot apex through the phloem system plays a role in floral induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Corbesier1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Mathieu1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Jaeger1">[5]</xref>. In the SAM, FT interacts with the bZIP transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD), which in turn activates the downstream floral meristem identity genes such as <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<italic>AP1</italic>) to initiate flower development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Wigge1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Abe1">[9]</xref>. Despite the remarkable progress in elucidating FT function, it is so far completely unknown whether and how FT protein transport is regulated. As the abundance of native FT protein is too low to be detectable, it has been hypothesized that simple diffusion of FT protein from companion cells to sieve elements might not be sufficient for transporting FT to the SAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Giakountis1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we show that an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (FTIP1), is required for FT protein transport in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Loss of function of <italic>FTIP1</italic> exhibits late flowering under LDs, which is partly due to the compromised FT movement to the SAM. FTIP1 and FT have similar mRNA expression patterns and subcellular localization, and they interact in vivo in phloem companion cells. Furthermore, FTIP1 is required for FT export from companion cells to sieve elements, thus affecting FT transport through the phloem to the SAM. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of florigen transport and demonstrate that FT protein moves in a regulated manner and that FTIP1 is involved in mediating the export of FT protein from phloem companion cells to induce flowering.</p>

        <title><italic>FTIP1</italic> Regulates Flowering Time under LDs</title>
        <p>To understand how FT function is regulated, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that interact with FT. Approximately 3 million yeast transformants were screened and 66 colonies were identified on the selective medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s014">Table S1</xref>), among which a partial sequence belonging to an unknown protein with three C2 domains and one phosphoribosyltransferase C-terminal domain (PRT_C) was isolated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The corresponding gene (At5g06850) was therefore named <italic>FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1</italic> (<italic>FTIP1</italic>). We isolated two T-DNA insertional alleles, <italic>ftip1-1</italic> (Salk_013179) and <italic>ftip1-2</italic> (Salk_088086), from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Resource Center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The full-length <italic>FTIP1</italic> transcript was undetectable in either homozygous mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Both <italic>ftip1-1</italic> and <italic>ftip1-2</italic> flowered late under LDs, but not under short days (SDs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g001">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001313-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that <italic>FTIP1</italic> plays a role in mediating the effect of photoperiod on flowering. We transformed <italic>ftip1-1</italic> with a genomic construct (<italic>gFTIP1</italic>) harboring a 5.1-kb <italic>FTIP1</italic> genomic region including 2.1 kb of the upstream sequence, the 2.4-kb coding sequence, and 0.6 kb of the downstream sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Most <italic>ftip1-1 gFTIP1</italic> T1 transformants exhibited similar or slightly late flowering time as compared to wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>FTIP1</italic> is responsible for promoting flowering particularly under LDs.</p>

        <title>Gene Expression and Subcellular Localization of FTIP1</title>
        <p>We tested <italic>FTIP1</italic> expression in various tissues of wild-type plants using quantitative real-time PCR and found its highest expression in leaves and stems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To examine the detailed expression pattern of <italic>FTIP1</italic>, we generated a <italic>FTIP1:β-glucuronidase (GUS)</italic> reporter construct in which the same 2.1-kb <italic>FTIP1</italic> upstream sequence included in <italic>gFTIP1</italic> for the gene complementation test was fused to the <italic>GUS</italic> reporter gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). We created 23 independent <italic>FTIP1:GUS</italic> lines, most of which showed similar GUS staining patterns.

Notably, in developing seedlings during the floral transition occurring 7 d after germination, <italic>FTIP1:GUS</italic> and <italic>FT:GUS</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Takada1">[14]</xref> shared similar GUS staining patterns in vascular tissues of cotyledons and rosette leaves, although the former had a relatively broad and intensive staining pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). A cross-section of a primary leaf vein revealed that <italic>FTIP1:GUS</italic> expression was specifically located in the phloem including companion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which is similar to the <italic>FT:GUS</italic> expression pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Takada1">[14]</xref>.

        <p>Given that <italic>FTIP1</italic> functions in flowering time control, we investigated whether its expression is regulated by known flowering genetic pathways. <italic>FTIP1</italic> expression was not regulated by photoperiod and did not exhibit an obvious circadian rhythm under LDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s004">Figure S4A</xref>,E). Similarly, vernalization treatment did not affect <italic>FTIP1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), and GA treatment did not affect <italic>FTIP1</italic> expression and the flowering phenotype of <italic>ftip1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s004">Figure S4C</xref>,D). In addition, <italic>FTIP1</italic> expression was also not altered in several mutants tested in known flowering genetic pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s005">Figure S5</xref>). These observations imply that flowering signals may not regulate <italic>FTIP1</italic> function through affecting its mRNA levels.</p>
        <p>Next, we examined the subcellular localization of FTIP1 through monitoring the signal of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused with FTIP1 under the control of <italic>FTIP1</italic> or <italic>SUC2</italic> promoter, respectively. Both constructs could rescue the late flowering phenotype of <italic>ftip1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, we could not detect fluorescent signal from either <italic>SUC2:FTIP1:GFP ftip1-1</italic> or <italic>FTIP1:FTIP1:GFP ftip1-1</italic> transgenic lines, indicating that FTIP1 protein might be present at very low abundance in plant cells. Alternatively, we transiently expressed <italic>35S:FTIP1:GFP</italic> with various fluorescent protein-tagged organelle markers in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf epidermal cells and found that FTIP1:GFP was mostly colocalized with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g003">Figure 3B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s006">Figure S6</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Nelson1">[17]</xref>. We did not observe FTIP1:GFP signals in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, at the cell wall, FTIP1:GFP colocalized with callose deposition stained with aniline blue, which marks the position of plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
        <p>To precisely localize FTIP1, we performed immunoelectron microscopy on an <italic>FTIP1:4HA:FTIP1 ftip1-1</italic> transgenic line, in which <italic>FTIP1:4HA:FTIP1</italic> was able to rescue the flowering defect of <italic>ftip1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The result revealed that 4HA:FTIP1 was specifically localized in phloem companion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) and plasmodesmata between companion cells and sieve elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g003">Figure 3E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s007">Figure S7</xref>), where the ER membrane runs through.</p>

        <title>FTIP1 Interacts with FT in Phloem Companion Cells</title>
        <p>Several pieces of evidence, including the initial identification of FTIP1 as an FT interacting partner, similar tissue expression pattern of <italic>FTIP1</italic> and <italic>FT</italic>, and similar late-flowering phenotype exhibited by <italic>ftip1</italic> and <italic>ft</italic> mutants specifically under long days, point to a possible role of FTIP1 in mediating FT function in the control of flowering time. Thus, we further carried out a detailed analysis of the interaction between FTIP1 and FT. As revealed in our yeast two-hybrid screening, a truncated FTIP1 protein devoid of the PRT_C domain interacted with FT in both yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g004">Figure 4A–C</xref>), whereas no interaction was detected using the full-length FTIP1 (unpublished data). Since the PRT_C domain of FTIP1 was predicted to be a membrane-targeted domain according to a protein topology analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s001">Figure S1</xref>), the full-length FTIP1 protein might not be in the membrane-bound state in yeast cells or under in vitro conditions and thus might undergo inappropriate folding, which prevents its interaction with FT. Alternatively, in yeast two-hybrid assay the full-length FTIP1 protein might be membrane-bound and unable to reconstitute a functional transcription factor in the yeast nucleus to drive the reporter gene expression.</p>

        <title>FTIP1 Controls the Export of FT Protein from Phloem Companion Cells to Sieve Elements</title>
        <p>The findings on the interaction between FT and FTIP1, and FTIP1 localization to ER and plasmodesmata prompted us to hypothesize that FTIP1 may regulate FT export from phloem companion cells. To this end, we first examined whether FTIP1 affects FT transport to the SAM during the floral transition. We generated a <italic>SUC2:FT:GFP</italic> transgenic line as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Corbesier1">[2]</xref>. As this transgenic allele could significantly rescue the late-flowering phenotype of the <italic>FT</italic> null mutant, <italic>ft-10</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001313-t001">Table 1</xref>), we further crossed this <italic>SUC2:FT:GFP</italic> allele with <italic>ftip1-1</italic> and <italic>35S:FTIP1</italic>. Confocal analysis of the distribution of FT:GFP fusion protein revealed that in 11-d-old seedlings, which were undergoing the floral transition, FT:GFP was clearly detected in the inner cone-like region of the SAM in wild-type background, but not in <italic>ftip1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, the distribution of free GFP protein was comparably undetectable in the inner region of the SAM in wild-type and <italic>ftip1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s009">Figure S9A</xref>), indicating a specific effect of FTIP1 on FT:GFP distribution in the SAM during the floral transition.

The fragments labeled with a, b, and c indicate amplicons in real-time PCR analyses shown in (<bold><italic>B</italic></bold>).

(B) Examination of steady-state levels of <italic>FT</italic> or <italic>FT:GFP</italic> mRNA in wild-type and <italic>ftip1-1</italic> backgrounds. Amplification of fragment a, which detects the amplicon in both native <italic>FT</italic> and transgenic <italic>FT:GFP</italic> transcripts, shows that native <italic>FT</italic> expression is downregulated in <italic>ftip1-1</italic> versus wild-type, whereas total <italic>FT</italic> expression (including minor native <italic>FT</italic> and major transgenic <italic>FT:GFP</italic> expression) remains unchanged in <italic>SUC2:FT:GFP ftip1-1</italic> versus <italic>SUC2:FT:GFP</italic>. Although the former indicates that FTIP1 affects the steady-state levels of native <italic>FT</italic> expression, the latter implies that FTIP1 does not directly affect <italic>FT</italic> mRNA stability. Amplification of fragment c, which only detects the amplicon in transgenic <italic>FT:GFP</italic> transcripts, further supports that FTIP1 does not directly affect <italic>FT</italic> mRNA stability as transgenic <italic>FT:GFP</italic> expression is not changed in <italic>ftip1-1</italic>. Amplification of fragment b, which only detects the amplicon in native <italic>FT</italic> transcripts, shows that native <italic>FT</italic> expression is also downregulated in <italic>SUC2:FT:GFP</italic> transgenic plants. 9-d-old seedlings grown under LDs were harvested for expression analysis by quantitative real-time PCR.

This <italic>SUC2:FT:9myc</italic> transgenic allele substantially rescued the late-flowering phenotype of <italic>ft-10</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001313-t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that FT:9myc retains the biological function of endogenous FT protein. Signals corresponding to FT:9myc could be specifically detected by anti-myc antibody in the phloem of the transgenic plants harboring <italic>SUC2:FT:9myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g005">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Quantitative analysis of labeling density of FT:9myc in companion cell-sieve element complexes showed that although all sections from <italic>SUC2:FT:9myc</italic> and <italic>SUC2:FT:9myc ftip1-1</italic> displayed FT:9myc labeling in companion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, lower right panel), there was an approximate 3-fold enrichment of labeling density in <italic>ftip1-1</italic> over wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, lower left panel). More importantly, we detected FT:9myc labeling in sieve elements in nearly 80% of the wild-type sections, whereas only 4% of <italic>ftip1-1</italic> sections displayed FT:9myc labeling in sieve elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, lower right panel). In addition, the labeling density of FT:9myc in sieve elements was much higher in wild-type than in <italic>ftip1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, lower left panel). Thus, in the absence of FTIP1, FT:9myc accumulated in companion cells and its transport to sieve elements was compromised. In agreement with this result, <italic>SUC2:FT:9myc ftip1-1</italic> displayed later flowering than <italic>SUC2:FT:9myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001313-t001">Table 1</xref>). As <italic>ftip1-1</italic> also delayed flowering in <italic>SUC2:FT</italic> and <italic>SUC2:GFP:CO</italic> where <italic>CO</italic> directly promotes the endogenous <italic>FT</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001313-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-An1">[12]</xref>, it seems that FTIP1 similarly affects the promotive effect of untagged FT protein on flowering as other FT fusion proteins used in this study. These observations support that FTIP1 regulates FT export from phloem companion cells to sieve elements, thus affecting FT transport through the phloem to the SAM. Consistent with this conclusion, the early-flowering phenotype caused by expression of <italic>FT</italic> or <italic>FT:GFP</italic> under the control of the <italic>KNAT1</italic> promoter, which is active in the SAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-An1">[12]</xref>, was not affected by <italic>ftip1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001313-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Unlike other flowering promoters, overexpression of <italic>FTIP1</italic> surprisingly caused late flowering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s011">Figure S11</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001313-t001">Table 1</xref>). Confocal analysis showed that the expression of FT:GFP protein in the inner region of the SAMs of 11-d-old seedlings was substantially lower in <italic>35S:FTIP1</italic> than in wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). In the primary leaf vein, FT:GFP driven by the <italic>SUC2</italic> promoter was exclusively detected in phloem companion cells in wild-type background, whereas in <italic>35S:FTIP1</italic>, the distribution of FT:GFP signals was detected in both phloem companion cells and xylem parenchyma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). However, the free GFP driven by the <italic>SUC2</italic> promoter remained in phloem companion cells of <italic>35S:FTIP1</italic> as compared to wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). These observations demonstrate that that ectopic expression of <italic>FTIP1</italic> specifically deregulates the transport of FT:GFP protein out of the phloem system, an effect previously shown for a viral movement protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Itaya1">[19]</xref>.

        <title><italic>FTIP1</italic> Is Involved in Feedback Regulation of <italic>FT</italic> mRNA Expression</title>
        <p>During the floral transition, FT interacts with FD in the SAM to promote the expression of <italic>AP1</italic> and other flowering genes such as <italic>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1</italic> (<italic>SOC1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Wigge1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Abe1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Yoo1">[20]</xref>. As expected, the expression of these genes was downregulated in <italic>ftip1-1</italic> in which FT transport is defective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s012">Figure S12A</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>FT</italic> expression was also downregulated in <italic>ftip1-1</italic>, whereas the expression of <italic>CO</italic>, a direct upstream activator of <italic>FT</italic>, was not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s012">Figure S12</xref>). As FTIP1 protein is not localized in the nucleus, it is unlikely that FTIP1 directly controls <italic>FT</italic> transcription. To address whether FTIP1 could regulate the stability of <italic>FT</italic> transcripts, we compared the levels of <italic>FT</italic> transcripts generated from the native and <italic>SUC2:FT:GFP</italic> transgenic loci. Although steady-state levels of native <italic>FT</italic> expression were downregulated in <italic>ftip1-1</italic>, total <italic>FT</italic> expression including native <italic>FT</italic> and transgenic <italic>FT:GFP</italic> expression remained unchanged in <italic>SUC2:FT:GFP ftip1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). In addition, the abundance of FT:GFP fusion protein remained unchanged in wild-type and <italic>ftip1-1</italic> backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>FTIP1</italic> may not be directly involved in regulating <italic>FT</italic> mRNA or protein stability. Meanwhile, we observed downregulation of native <italic>FT</italic> expression in <italic>SUC2:FT:GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>) and reduced <italic>FT:GUS</italic> staining in <italic>SUC2:FT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). These results are in agreement with the observation in a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Corbesier1">[2]</xref> implying that an excessive accumulation of FT protein in phloem companion cells caused by the <italic>SUC2</italic> promoter might directly or indirectly result in a reduction in native <italic>FT</italic> mRNA expression through a negative feedback loop. This may explain the observed downregulation of native <italic>FT</italic> expression in <italic>ftip1-1</italic>, where defective export of FT protein causes accumulation of FT protein in phloem companion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results have demonstrated that FTIP1 and FT share similar mRNA expression patterns and subcellular localization, and that they interact in vivo in phloem companion cells. During the floral transition, the FT:GFP accumulation at the SAM is compromised in <italic>ftip1</italic> mutants, which eventually exhibit late flowering under LDs. Consistently, FTIP1 is required for FT:9myc export from phloem companion cells to sieve elements, thus affecting the flowering time of <italic>SUC2:FT:9myc</italic>. In addition, overexpression of <italic>FTIP1</italic> causes the transport of FT:GFP out of the phloem system, which also results in late flowering. These observations suggest that FT protein moves from phloem companion cells to sieve elements in a regulated manner and that a subtle regulation of FTIP1 activity is indispensable for the export of FT protein from phloem companion cells to induce flowering.</p>
      <p>We envisage that in addition to FTIP1 and FT, florigen transport should involve other relevant regulators. First, although the transport of FT:9myc protein from phloem companion cells to sieve elements in <italic>ftip1-1</italic> is significantly compromised, it is not completely abolished. This implies either that there is a basal level of diffusion of FT protein or that FT transport also depends on other regulators that share a redundant function with FTIP1 in mediating FT export from phloem companion cells. Furthermore, previous examinations of the spatial distribution of FT:GFP fusion protein in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice have shown that FT:GFP accumulates in the rib zone beneath the SAM in a conical shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Corbesier1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Tamaki1">[3]</xref>, indicating that the movement of FT protein from phloem to the rib zone is not a simple diffusion process. As <italic>FTIP1</italic> is clearly not expressed in the whole SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>), regulation of FT protein transport from the phloem stream to the rib zone might also involve other regulators. The requirement of other regulators for FT protein transport is supported by the genetic analysis showing that <italic>ft</italic> mutants display much later flowering than <italic>ftip1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001313-t001">Table 1</xref>). Potential candidates for these regulators include <italic>FTIP1</italic> homologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s013">Figure S13A</xref>) because some combinations of <italic>ftip1</italic> with loss-of-function mutants of <italic>FTIP1</italic> homologs show much later flowering than any single mutant (unpublished data).</p>
      <p>Second, the late-flowering phenotype of <italic>ft</italic> mutants is further enhanced by <italic>ftip1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001313-t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that <italic>FTIP1</italic> may be required for transporting other flowering molecules in addition to FT. A potential candidate could be <italic>TWIN SISTER OF FT</italic> (<italic>TSF</italic>), which encodes another phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein with very high sequence similarity with FT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Yamaguchi1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Jang1">[22]</xref>. Mutation of <italic>TSF</italic> further enhances the late flowering of <italic>ft</italic> mutants, and the resulting double mutants fail to accelerate flowering in response to LD conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Yamaguchi1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Jang1">[22]</xref>. The expression domain of <italic>TSF</italic> also overlaps with that of <italic>FTIP1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Yamaguchi1">[21]</xref>. Furthermore, loss of function of <italic>FTIP1</italic> does not further delay flowering of <italic>ft-10 tsf-1</italic> under LD conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001313-t001">Table 1</xref>). These data support that TSF functions redundantly with FT and could be another molecule whose transport is affected by <italic>FTIP1</italic>.</p>
      <p>As both FTIP1 and FT proteins are localized to ER, regulation of FT movement by FTIP1 across the border between companion cells and sieve elements might be partly mediated by a continuous ER network within plasmodesmata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Martens1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Fitzgibbon1">[24]</xref>. In plasmodesmata, the ER becomes appressed to form the central axial desmotubule surrounded by the plasma membrane continuum between adjacent cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Maule1">[25]</xref>. Although it has been suggested that the desmotubule is not the main route for plasmodesmatal transport, some molecules are known to be transported through this channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Cantrill1">[26]</xref>. In contrast, the space between the desmotubule and the plasma membrane, which is referred as the cytoplasmic sleeve, is the proposed place where the general trafficking of molecules and ions occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Maule1">[25]</xref>. Because FTIP1 possesses a membrane-targeted PRT_C domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and is localized to plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g003">Figure 3C,E,F</xref>), it is likely that the C-terminus of FTIP1 is anchored to the desmotubule. How FTIP1 is oriented in plasmodesmata is an important question as its N-terminus, which is included in the region that interacts with FT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001313-g004">Figure 4A–C</xref>), might face either the cytoplasmic sleeve or the interior of the desmotubule. Further addressing this question will help to identify the route where FT protein passes through plasmodesmata and other possible factors involved in FT transport. Based on the size of FT:GFP, the route through the cytoplasmic sleeve might be possible for FT transport as the current understanding is that molecules larger than 27 kDa do not move readily through desmotubule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Martens1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The presence of C2 domains and a transmembrane domain in FTIP1 and its close homologs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> makes them topologically resemble synaptotagmins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s013">Figure S13A</xref>) that constitute a family of membrane-trafficking proteins widely found in plants and animals. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the synaptotagmin SYTA has been shown to regulate endosome recycling and movement protein-mediated trafficking of plant virus genomes through plasmodesmata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Lewis1">[27]</xref>. Our finding on the function of FTIP1 in mediating FT export from phloem companion cells to sieve elements, together with the proposed SYTA function, implies that synaptotagmin-like proteins may serve as essential regulators that mediate the transport of macromolecules in plants. Another <italic>FTIP1</italic>-like gene, <italic>QUIRKY</italic> (<italic>QKY</italic>; At1g74720), has been suggested to contribute to plant organ organogenesis mediated by the receptor-like kinase <italic>STRUBBELIG</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001313-Fulton1">[28]</xref>, implying a role of <italic>QKY</italic> in intercellular signaling. As FTIP1-like proteins are highly conserved in the angiosperms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001313.s013">Figure S13B</xref>), further investigation of <italic>FTIP1</italic> and its homologs might shed light on the conserved mechanisms underlying which flowering plants regulate cell-to-cell communication to coordinate the growth and development.</p>

        <title>GST In Vitro Pull-Down Assay</title>
        <p>The cDNA encoding FT was cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Pharmacia) and introduced into <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen). Transformed cells were cultured until the OD<sub>600 nm</sub> reached 0.6, and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.6 mM to start induction. After overnight induction at 16°C, cells were collected and homogenized with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-100, and 10 mM PMSF). The soluble GST fusion proteins were extracted and immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for subsequent pull-down assays. The FTIP1 N-terminal fragment containing the three C2 domains (N501) was cloned into pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was added to the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega) to synthesize myc-FTIP1(N501) protein. The resulting fusion protein was then incubated with the immobilized GST and GST fusion proteins. Proteins retained on the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected with anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).</p>
