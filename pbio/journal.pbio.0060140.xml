        <p>Gene duplication was prevalent during hominoid evolution, yet little is known about the functional fate of new ape gene copies. We characterized the <italic>CDC14B</italic> cell cycle gene and the functional evolution of its hominoid-specific daughter gene, <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>. We found that <italic>CDC14B</italic> encodes four different splice isoforms that show different subcellular localizations (nucleus or microtubule-associated) and functional properties. A microtubular <italic>CDC14B</italic> variant spawned <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> through retroposition in the hominoid ancestor 18–25 million years ago (Mya). <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> evolved brain-/testis-specific expression after the duplication event and experienced a short period of intense positive selection in the African ape ancestor 7–12 Mya. Using resurrected ancestral protein variants, we demonstrate that by virtue of amino acid substitutions in distinct protein regions during this time, the subcellular localization of CDC14Bretro progressively shifted from the association with microtubules (stabilizing them) to an association with the endoplasmic reticulum. CDC14Bretro evolution represents a paradigm example of rapid, selectively driven subcellular relocalization, thus revealing a novel mode for the emergence of new gene function.</p>

          <p>Many new gene copies emerged by gene duplication in human and ape (hominoid) ancestors. However, little is known with respect to their functional evolution. We used a combination of evolutionary analyses and cell biology experiments to unveil the adaptive evolution of the hominoid-specific <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> gene, which arose as a reverse-transcribed copy of a messenger RNA of its “parent,” the <italic>CDC14B</italic> cell cycle gene. We first show that the <italic>CDC14B</italic> parental gene encodes different splice isoforms that differ with respect to their subcellular localization and functional properties. One of these isoforms, which is associated with microtubules throughout the cell cycle (stabilizing them and potentially contributing to their organization), spawned <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> in the common ape ancestor 18–25 million years ago. In the African ape (human/chimp/gorilla) ancestor, around 7–12 million years ago, intense positive selection then led to rapid relocalization of the CDC14Bretro protein from microtubules to a new cellular location—the endoplasmic reticulum. This radical subcellular shift likely reflects the evolution of a new function of CDC14Bretro in the African ape lineage. In contrast, CDC14Bretro retained the ancestral (parental) localization and function in Asian apes (orangutans and gibbons). Our study not only adds to the rare known cases of ape-specific genes for which selectively driven substitutions could be tied to functional protein change and adaptation, but, more generally, reveals a novel mode that may underlie the emergence of new gene function: rapid, selectively driven subcellular adaptation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gene duplication has been important for the evolution of phenotypes specific to species and evolutionary lineages by providing the genetic raw material for the emergence of genes with new or altered functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b001">1</xref>]. Duplicate gene copies are commonly generated through duplication of gene-containing chromosomal segments (segmental duplication; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b002">2</xref>]), or by reverse-transcription of mRNAs from parental source genes (termed retroduplication or retroposition), generating intronless gene copies (retrocopies) of the parent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b004">4</xref>]. However, although both of these mechanisms were shown to have generated a significant number of gene copies during recent primate evolution on the lineage leading to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b007">7</xref>], little is known with respect to their functional evolution and impact on phenotypes typical to humans and their close evolutionary primate relatives.</p>
      <p>Indeed, only a relatively small number of functionally preserved segmentally duplicated genes or functional retrocopies (retrogenes) that emerged in hominoids (humans and apes) have been pinpointed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b012">12</xref>]. Although some of these genes revealed striking signatures of positive selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b010">10</xref>], selectively driven substitutions could only rarely be tied to functional protein change and adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b008">8</xref>]. Even in primates in general, few cases of new duplicate genes exist where amino acid substitutions resulting from positive selection were experimentally demonstrated to lead to functional adaptation of the encoded protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b014">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>In a previous survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b006">6</xref>], we identified an interesting retrogene, termed <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> (denoted <italic>CDC14B2</italic> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b006">6</xref>]), which originated by retroduplication (from Chromosome 9 to 7) from its parent, <italic>CDC14B</italic>, in the hominoid ancestor around 18–25 million years ago (Mya) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b015">15</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). <italic>CDC14B</italic> and its paralog <italic>CDC14A</italic> were recently shown to represent the mammalian counterparts of the single, dual-specificity phosphatase gene <italic>CDC14</italic> from yeast, a key regulator of late mitotic events, which is particularly important for mitotic exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b016">16</xref>]. Although both paralogs can rescue <italic>CDC14</italic> deletion mutants of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</named-content> (fission yeast), <italic>CDC14B</italic> was shown to be the functional ortholog of <italic>CDC14</italic> from budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b017">17</xref>]. Prompted by the potential functional implications of an additional <italic>CDC14</italic> family member for the phenotypic evolution of hominoids, we set out to characterize the functional evolution of the <italic>CDC14B</italic> daughter gene, <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>.</p>

          <p>(A) Exon and protein structures of <italic>CDC14B</italic> splice variants. Color code of coding exons (exons not drawn to scale): exons shared by all variants are colored in dark blue; exons colored in yellow, light blue, green, and red are specific to transcripts <italic>CDC14B1</italic>, <italic>CDC14B2</italic>, <italic>CDC14B3</italic>, and <italic>CDC14Bpar</italic>, respectively, as indicated by the schematic representation of splicing patterns. The basic protein structure and sequence encoded by the different splice variants is indicated (only the protein sequence that differs between the splice variants is color-coded to indicate the relationship with the alternative splicing patterns of the coding exons). The retroduplication event of the <italic>CDC14Bpar</italic> transcript that gave rise to the <italic>CDC14B</italic> retrogene (<italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>) is illustrated.</p>
          <p>(B–E) COS7-cells (from African green monkeys—no endogenous <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> gene) transfected with <italic>CDC14B</italic>-DsRed fusion constructs (i.e., CDC14B signals in red) are shown. Microtubules were stained using an anti-beta tubulin antibody (green) and the nucleus was stained using DAPI (blue). Merged images: CDC14B1 (nucleoli) and −2 (nuclear speckles) localize to the nucleus (violet) and CDC14B3 and CDC14Bpar co-localize with microtubules (yellow). We obtained very similar results when using HeLa or LN229 (glioblastoma) cell lines (both carrying an endogenous <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> gene, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, there appear to be no cell line–specific effects with respect to the observed subcellular localization patterns. Scale bars (white) = 10 μm.</p>

        <title>The Human <italic>CDC14B</italic> Parental Gene Encodes Four Different Alternative Splice Variants</title>
        <p>To understand the origin of <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>, we first characterized the transcript that gave rise to <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>, because two <italic>CDC14B</italic> splice variants have been analyzed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b019">19</xref>] (we have termed them <italic>CDC14B1</italic> and <italic>CDC14B2</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). To this end, we aligned the <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> sequence to the genomic locus of its parental gene on Chromosome 9. This procedure revealed a previously undescribed exon structure, indicating a transcript (the “parent”—termed <italic>CDC14Bpar</italic>—that gave rise to <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>) with a previously unknown 3′ splicing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). A fourth 3′-end splice variant (<italic>CDC14B3</italic>) is annotated (Ensembl database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b020">20</xref>]) and supported by expressed sequence tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Thus, the human <italic>CDC14B</italic> gene encodes at least four different alternative splice variants.</p>

        <title>Expression of the <italic>CDC14B</italic> Splice Variants and the <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> Daughter Gene</title>
        <p>Spatial expression analyses revealed that these variants are widely expressed, as reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR products specific to <italic>CDC14Bpar</italic>, <italic>B1</italic>, <italic>B2</italic>, and <italic>B3</italic> were found in all of the 12 tissues tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> is specifically expressed in the adult brain (in all eight regions tested) and testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> transcripts were also detected specifically in the human embryonic forebrain, including the dorsal telencephalon, which contains the primordium of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> likely evolved a specific function in the embryonic/adult brain and/or testis since the duplication event in the hominoid ancestor.</p>

This suggests that it may be expressed at low levels in these (and perhaps other) tissues in some individuals.</p>

        <p>To date the origin of its brain-/testis-specific expression, we performed RT-PCR experiments using brain, testis, and liver RNA preparations from chimpanzees and gibbons. Like in humans, we detected <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> expression in brain and testis from these two apes but not in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that brain- and testis-specific expression was acquired soon after the duplication event in the common hominoid ancestor, although additional ape tissues need be analyzed in the future to confirm this hypothesis.</p>

        <title>Positive Selection of <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> in the African Ape Ancestor</title>
        <p>To trace the functional evolution of <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>, we first analyzed its coding sequence evolution in a phylogenetic framework. The evolution of <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> appears to have been shaped mainly by purifying selection, as indicated by the generally low nonsynonymous (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>) to synonymous (<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>) substitution rate (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). In sharp contrast, the internal branch leading to the last common ancestor of African apes (human, chimpanzee, and gorilla) reveals a strikingly different pattern, with 12 nonsynonymous and 0 synonymous substitutions, which is indicative of accelerated protein evolution driven by positive Darwinian selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b021">21</xref>]. A conservative maximum likelihood analysis ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b022">22</xref>]; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for details) confirms that the excess of nonsynonymous relative to synonymous substitutions is statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, we found that the nonsynonymous substitutions are nonrandomly distributed in the sequence.

        <p>Interestingly, the nonsynonymous substitutions that occurred in the 5′ end of <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> during the period of positive selection in the African ape ancestor entailed the origin of a new methionine start codon that allowed the original start codon to be lost in humans and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Analysis of the full-length transcript revealed no other possible in-frame ATG start codon, suggesting that the new downstream start codon is indeed used for initiation of translation. This new methionine start codon disrupts the KKIR motif (replacing the isoleucine residue by a methionine), which was reported to be crucial for the nuclear localization of CDC14B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b017">17</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that the N-terminal substitutions that occurred during the phase of positive selection were associated with a change in subcellular localization of CDC14Bretro in the African ape ancestor. To obtain the necessary background information for testing this hypothesis, we first sought to assess the subcellular localization of CDC14Bpar relative to the other 3' splice variants of the <italic>CDC14B</italic> parental gene, because it represents a novel protein variant with a previously uncharacterized subcellular localization.</p>

        <p>Protein localization experiments of the CDC14B splice isoforms with fluorescent reporters fused to their C termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) show that whereas CDC14B1 (nucleoli) and CDC14B2 (nuclear speckles) localize to the nucleus in interphase cells as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b017">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), CDC14Bpar and the other previously uncharacterized variant CDC14B3 show highly structured filaments throughout the cell, reminiscent of microtubules (MT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figures 1</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">1</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg001">S1</xref>). Microtubular staining of transfected cells revealed that these two CDC14B isoforms indeed co-localize with MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). We note that CDC14B1 shows microtubular association in a small proportion of cells, consistent with a previous report that found microtubular co-localization of this variant in 14% of transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b017">17</xref>]. This study also showed that a CDC14B1 mutant protein with an altered KKIR motif shows increased microtubular association.</p>
        <p>Together, these results suggest that all CDC14B splice variants have the inherent capacity to co-localize with microtubules, and that in addition to the N terminus, the C-terminal part of CDC14B is crucial for the subcellular localization of the different splice isoforms. In the case of CDC14Bpar and CDC14B3, their specific C-terminal sequences apparently override the nuclear localization signal. This notion is supported by a CDC14Bpar recombinant protein that lacks the C-terminal domain; this truncation mutant localizes to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thus, we reasoned that the seven amino acid substitutions that occurred during the phase of positive selection in the C terminus of CDC14Bretro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g004">Figure 4</xref>) might—in addition to the substitutions in the N terminus (see above)—also have contributed to a potential subcellular localization shift in African apes. Prompted by these observations, we proceeded to directly test the hypothesis of a subcellular localization shift of CDC14Bretro in the African ape ancestor.</p>

        <p>To this end, we reconstructed the ancestral sequences of the last common ancestor of great apes and African apes, representing the <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> variants before (node B) and after (node A) the period of positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g004">4</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). Subcellular localization experiments of the proteins expressed from these resurrected genes showed that CDC14Bretro from node B co-localizes with MTs during interphase, similar to the parental protein CDC14Bpar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g003">Figure 3</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg004">S4</xref>). In sharp contrast, CDC14Bretro from node A did not localize to microtubules, but rather displayed a new localization pattern with nonfilamentous fluorescent signals around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg004">S4</xref>).</p>

Thus, except for some small differences between individual extant CDC14Bretro variants, the localization patterns before and after the phase of positive selection have been largely preserved in the Asian and African apes, respectively. This is consistent with the evidence for purifying selection in these lineages (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−2</sup> for both African and Asian apes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The evidence of functional preservation by purifying selection further supports functionality of <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>, in addition to our original evidence of the conservation of its open reading frame by purifying selection (the paucity of non-neutral insertion/deletions; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b006">6</xref>]). We note, however, that the evolution of <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> in the descendant ape lineages has generally been less constrained than that of its parent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg006">Figure S6</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−2</sup>), which may be indicative of (further) functional adaptation and/or some relaxation of selection at certain sites of the CDC14Bretro protein in apes. Although <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> appears to have accumulated particularly many amino acid substitutions on the gibbon lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g004">4</xref>), the synonymous substitution rate was high on this lineage as well (as also reflected by the low <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> ratio). This suggests that CDC14Bretro function was generally selectively preserved by purifying selection, consistent with the preservation of the ancestral MT localization (see above, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

        <p>Proteins that are targeted to enter the lumen of the ER have well-described signal peptides with characteristic properties. These include a stretch of 5–15 hydrophobic amino acids that is preceded by a positively charged (basic) amino acid, which allow the protein to pass through the hydrophobic ER membrane. Visual inspection and in silico prediction programs of the N-terminal sequences of CDC14Bretro from African apes reveal no evidence of such signal peptides that could target the protein to the ER or secretory pathway (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). This suggests that CDC14Bretro from African apes localizes to the cytosolic face of the ER, thus probably binding to substrates and/or protein interaction partners on the ER membrane. We conclude that CDC14Bretro evolved a dramatically altered subcellular localization during the cell cycle in the African ape ancestor ∼7–12 Mya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b015">15</xref>], shifting from the ancestral microtubular association to a new localization on the cytosolic face of the ER—a process likely driven by positive selection.</p>

        <title>Substitutions Responsible for the Subcellular Shift of CDC14Bretro in African Apes</title>
        <p>To elucidate which substitutions that occurred during the period of positive selection were responsible for the subcellular shift in the African ape ancestor, we generated hybrid constructs of the ancestral <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> gene variants. Hybrid proteins, where the N and C termini correspond to the node B sequence but the phosphatase core domain corresponds to that of node A (hybrid BAB), show microtubular localization very similar to that seen for the node B protein in ∼53% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g006">Figure 6</xref>). A hybrid protein where the N and C termini correspond to the node A sequence and the core domain to that of node B (ABA) loses the filamentous microtubular association in the majority (∼80%) of cells, although some association with MTs is retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, positively selected substitutions in the N- and C-terminal parts of CDC14Bretro have contributed to the shift in subcellular localization in the African ape ancestor, consistent with our original hypothesis (which was based on the excess of amino acid replacements in the termini). In addition, substitutions in the core domain also affected the capacity for microtubular localization.</p>

        <p>Consequently, these results confirm that CDC14Bretro did not “simply” gain an N-terminal signal peptide that could target it to the ER lumen (see above), but was rather shaped by substitutions throughout the protein that lead to a localization on the cytosolic face of the ER. The finding that substitutions in the phosphatase domain of CDC14Bretro from African apes have contributed to the subcellular shift may suggest that the change in subcellular localization was associated with the acquisition of a new function. We note that the subcellular localization of many enzymes depends on their catalytic activity/substrate binding (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b024">24</xref>]).

        <p>The resurrected node B protein as well as CDC14Bretro from orangutan and gibbon show high stabilization capacity; as high (node B protein), or almost as high (orangutan, gibbon), as that of CDC14Bpar. The somewhat lower capacity of the orangutan and gibbon variants may be due to small, lineage-specific affinity changes. In contrast, CDC14Bretro from node A and its extant descendants have completely lost the ability to stabilize MTs, consistent with the absence of detectable microtubular localization and their likely new functional role on the ER.</p>
        <p>As predicted from the localization experiments (loss of MT association), the hybrid construct ABA shows complete loss of MT stabilization activity. In spite of its microtubular association in ∼53% of cells (see above), hybrid construct BAB loses MT stabilization capacity in most (∼85%) of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These results suggest that the localization and MT stabilization capacities are, to some extent, decoupled. The termini seem to be crucial for MT localization, while the core domain is necessary for MT stabilization. Thus, there seems to be a complex interplay of the different parts of the protein; both the protein termini and the core domain are needed for effective MT association and stabilization of the ancestral CDC14B variants. Together, the MT localization and stabilization analyses substantiate the view that most or all of the substitutions that occurred throughout the protein during the period of positive selection in the African ape ancestor were likely adaptive and required for the subcellular/functional shift of CDC14Bretro.</p>

        <p>In this study, we set out to characterize the <italic>CDC14B</italic> cell cycle gene and, in particular, the functional evolution of its daughter gene <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>. We found that <italic>CDC14B</italic>, which has, as yet, not been characterized in detail, encodes four different splice isoforms that differ with respect to their subcellular localization (nucleus or microtubule-associated) and functional properties (microtubular stabilization capacities) as a consequence of their 3′ splicing patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g007">7</xref>). This result has important consequences, as future studies of CDC14B need to take the presence of different isoforms into account and assess their functional roles separately. We have begun here to functionally characterize one of the novel splice variants, <italic>CDC14Bpar</italic>, and we find that it encodes a protein that is associated with MTs throughout the cell cycle. CDC14Bpar reorganizes from MTs in interphase to the spindle pole during mitosis and possesses a strong microtubular stabilization capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figures 1</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g003">3</xref>G–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g003">3</xref>I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, the CDC14Bpar isoform may be involved in mitotic microtubule dynamics and organization.</p>
        <p><italic>CDC14Bpar</italic> spawned a new retroduplicate gene copy, <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>, which was fixed in the common hominoid ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). It adopted or evolved brain and testis expression soon after the duplication event. A shift toward an enlarged neocortex and enhanced cognitive capacities relative to other primates occurred in the hominoid ancestor, presumably driven by selection for increased social complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b025">25</xref>]. Conceivably, the fixation of <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>—like that of another hominoid-specific retrogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b008">8</xref>]—might have been associated with the evolution of the more complex ape brain. In this context, it is interesting that we detected <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> expression in the early human embryonic brain, which might point to a role of this gene in neural development.</p>
        <p>But what functional role might it have obtained in the hominoid brain and/or testis? Our functional analyses—demonstrating conservation of ancestral MT localization and stabilization patterns of CDC14Bretro from the great ape ancestor and the extant Asian apes—suggest that until the evolutionary separation of African and Asian apes ∼12 Mya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b015">15</xref>], CDC14Bretro may have been functionally preserved (and advantageous) to provide increased dosage of the CDC14Bpar parental isoform during the cell cycle of these tissues. In the African ape ancestor, a radical shift toward a new localization on the ER then occurred. The subcellular/functional shift of CDC14Bretro was perhaps facilitated by the evolution of increased brain (testis) expression of CDC14Bpar, which might have released selective pressure to retain a second <italic>CDC14B</italic> gene copy with similar functional properties in the African ape ancestor. Although CDC14Bretro apparently retained its phosphatase function (all sites required for its phosphatase activity have remained unchanged), it very likely changed its substrate and/or protein interaction partners after relocalizing to the ER.</p>
        <p>The new function of CDC14Bretro from African apes on the ER may be unrelated to the cell cycle, although we note that a cell cycle–related function of CDC14Bretro might not be so unlikely, in view of a growing body of work revealing important ties of the ER and the cell cycle (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b026">26</xref>]). However, the precise new role of CDC14Bretro on the ER of the African ape brain and testis warrants further experimental scrutiny. In any event, the signature of positive selection driving this subcellular/functional adaptation suggests that it is a function that has been beneficial to African apes.</p>
        <p>More generally, our study reveals a new mode with respect to how new gene copies may obtain new functional roles. A recent study indicated that new genes that emerge through a complex combination of segmental duplications and genomic rearrangements (including exon gain/loss) may evolve new localization patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b027">27</xref>]. Our work here reveals that subcellular shifts of new duplicate proteins may occur through rapid and adaptive protein evolution, driven by intense positive selection. But how frequently has the process of subcellular adaptation occurred during evolution?</p>
        <p>It has been shown in various individual molecular studies that proteins from the same family may show different subcellular localization patterns in mammals (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b028">28</xref>]). Indeed, a recent global survey (using yeast as a model system) suggests that protein subcellular adaptation represents a rather common mechanism through which duplicate genes may functionally diversify [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b029">29</xref>]. Thus, we believe that in addition to changes in gene expression and/or biochemical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b030">30</xref>], rapid and selectively driven adaptation to new subcellular compartments—as exemplified by the new hominoid CDC14Bretro protein—may represent a widespread mechanism underlying the evolution of new gene function.</p>

        <p>The phylogenetic tree of the <italic>CDC14B</italic> coding sequences was reconstructed using a maximum likelihood procedure (DNAML) as implemented in the Phylip package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b031">31</xref>]). The topology of the <italic>CDC14B</italic> sequences in the tree reflects the accepted species phylogeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b015">15</xref>]. Other reconstruction methods, such as Bayesian phylogeny reconstruction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (as implemented in the MrBayes program, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b032">32</xref>]), yield identical topologies.</p>
        <p><italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> ratios in the phylogenetic tree were estimated using the codeml free-ratio model as implemented in the PAML4 package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html" xlink:type="simple">http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b033">33</xref>]. To test if the observed excess of nonsynonymous substitutions in the lineage leading to African apes was a consequence of positive selection, we first compared a one-ratio model (that assumes an equal <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> ratio for all the branches in the phylogeny) to a two-ratio model, where an additional <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> value is allowed on the African ape lineage. The two models were compared using the likelihood-ratio test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b034">34</xref>], and the two-ratio model was found to fit the data significantly better (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup>) than the one-ratio model. To test whether the <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> value of the branch of the common African ape ancestor was significantly different from 1, we compared its likelihood to that of a model where <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> on this lineage was fixed to 1. In addition, we tested statistical significance of the excess of amino acid substitutions in the N- and C-terminal sequences compared to the core domain of CDC14Bretro from the African ape ancestor using Fisher's exact test (nine amino acid substitutions at 139 sites of the termini, 3/338 sites in the core domain). To test for purifying selection (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> &lt; 1) on the descendant African ape (since their last common ancestor) and Asian ape lineages, respectively, we compared the likelihood of models where <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> was fixed to 1 to models where <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> was estimated from the data. To test for <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> rate differences between <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> from African apes (since their last common ancestor)/Asian apes and <italic>CDC14Bpar</italic>, we compared models where the rate was the same for the two groups to models where the rates were allowed to be different (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
        <p>The ancestral sequences for nodes A and B were reconstructed using a maximum likelihood procedure (one-ratio model, M0) as implemented in codeml (the same sequences are obtained using other standard codeml models such as the free-ratio model). Posterior probabilities for all reconstructed codons of these sequences are high (<italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.99). The same sequences are also obtained using other procedures such as maximum parsimony (unpublished data). We note that posterior probabilities for all reconstructed sites throughout the tree are high (<italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.95).</p>
