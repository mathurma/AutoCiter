        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Females of many animal species store sperm after mating, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms of sperm storage and maintenance are largely unknown. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> females store sperm in the seminal receptacle and the paired spermathecae. Each spermathecal cap is lined with large secretory cells. There has been little direct evidence about the functions of these cells because we have not had the tools to manipulate the cells in otherwise wild-type females. Here, by creating transgenic tools to ablate the spermathecal secretory cells (SSCs) at different times relative to mating, without affecting any other cells, we show that SSCs are required to recruit sperm to the spermathecae but not to retain them there. We further show that SSC products act elsewhere in the reproductive tract in at least two ways. First, the SSCs are required to maintain sperm stored in the other storage organ, the seminal receptacle. Second, the SSCs are required to sustain normal egg laying. In the absence of SSCs, fertilized eggs develop and occasionally hatch as larvae inside the female. These results could have implications for understanding the evolution of sperm storage and live birth, as well as for studying and manipulating insect fertility.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Females of many animal species store sperm after mating, in specialized organs of the reproductive tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Neubaum1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Heifetz1">[2]</xref>. In addition to sperm, seminal proteins are transferred to females during mating. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, seminal proteins perform multiple functions that advance the male's reproductive interests. These functions include promoting sperm storage, decreasing the female's receptivity to subsequent courters, and stimulating egg production and ovulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Avila1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Wolfner1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Female reproductive interests do not necessarily coincide with those of their mates. A coevolutionary arms race can therefore ensue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Chapman1">[5]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the coevolutionary pressure on female reproductive functions is apparently quite strong: seminal fluid decreases female lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Chapman2">[6]</xref> and does so to a greater extent when females are experimentally prevented from coevolving with males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Rice1">[7]</xref>. Of course, males and females do share some reproductive interests, such as successful production of offspring, and therefore evolutionary pressure also exists to coordinate their reproductive functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Wolfner2">[8]</xref>. Although it has been appreciated that molecular interactions—both antagonistic and cooperative—between male and female products are key to understanding insect fertility and its evolution, much more progress has been made in characterizing the composition and functions of seminal fluid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Avila1">[3]</xref> than in characterizing female reproductive secretions.</p>
      <p>A potentially major role of female secretions is in sperm storage. Insect females typically have multiple specialized sperm storage organs, to which sperm are recruited after copulation and in which sperm can be maintained for weeks or, in the case of queens of social insect species, years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Gillott1">[9]</xref>. Female <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have three such organs located at the anterior of the uterus: a long tubular seminal receptacle and a pair of spermathecae. Each spermatheca is mushroom shaped, with a duct that extends from the uterus to a cuticular cap. The seminal receptacle houses up to 80% of stored sperm, whereas the spermathecal caps house the remainder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Neubaum1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Gilbert1">[10]</xref>. Each spermathecal cap is lined with large glandular cells containing prominent secretory organelles that open into the lumen where sperm are stored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Allen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Filosi1">[12]</xref>. Despite considerable divergence in sperm-storage organ anatomy, such cells are found lining or adjacent to the spermathecae of a wide range of insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Gillott1">[9]</xref>. The position of these spermathecal secretory cells (SSC) suggested they might have a role in sperm storage, yet direct in vivo evidence has been lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Gillott1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Filosi1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-BlochQazi1">[13]</xref>. Indeed, the most direct evidence for a role in sperm storage comes from a 1975 study of boll weevils with surgically removed spermathecal glands: sperm did not enter the spermatheca in such females, although because sperm motility was greatly diminished it cannot be concluded whether the glands are necessary just for sperm viability or also for recruitment into storage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Villavaso1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The SSC might also contribute to sustained levels of egg production and fertilization, by secreting proteins that alter female reproductive physiology or by modulating the activities of male seminal proteins. Sex peptide, a seminal protein, binds to sperm tails and during storage is gradually cleaved to an active form that stimulates egg production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Peng1">[15]</xref>. Sex peptide is also required for release of sperm from storage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Avila2">[16]</xref>. In the female, the sex peptide receptor is expressed in neurons that mediate a decrease in courtship receptivity and an increase in egg laying after mating, and it is required for these changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Yapici1">[17]</xref>. The sex peptide receptor is also expressed in the SSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Yapici1">[17]</xref>, suggesting that sex peptide acts directly on these cells.</p>
      <p>Other genes expressed specifically in the SSC have not been comprehensively identified, although some such genes have emerged from transcriptional profiling studies of: (1) somatic tissues of males versus females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Arbeitman1">[18]</xref>, (2) dissected whole spermathecae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Allen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Prokupek1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Prokupek2">[20]</xref>, and (3) virgin versus mated females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Lawniczak1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-McGraw1">[23]</xref>. One notable class of genes revealed by these studies is those encoding proteases. Protease-encoding genes are over-represented among those induced in females by mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Lawniczak1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-McGraw1">[23]</xref>, and among those highly expressed in the spermathecae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Allen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Prokupek1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Prokupek2">[20]</xref>. Proteases are especially interesting due to their potential for interactions with seminal proteins. Such interactions could be antagonistic, for example by degradation of seminal proteins, or cooperative, for example by regulated cleavage of seminal proteins to their active forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Wolfner2">[8]</xref>. Male-female coevolution would be expected to lead to rapid divergence of female-expressed protease-encoding genes, and indeed such genes show elevated rates of coding-sequence evolution in several species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Prokupek1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Kelleher1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Swanson1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To address how the SSC contribute to female postmating physiology, we have developed tools that allow us to manipulate these cells in a precise spatiotemporal manner. To develop these tools, we first identified the regulatory regions controlling transcription of two protease-encoding genes that are expressed exclusively in the SSC. The gene <italic>CG17012</italic>, which encodes a serine-type endopeptidase, is expressed exclusively in the SSC, in both unmated and mated females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Arbeitman1">[18]</xref>. We hereafter refer to <italic>CG17012</italic> as <italic>Spermathecal endopeptidase 1</italic> (<italic>Send1</italic>). <italic>CG18125</italic>, which also encodes a serine-type endopeptidase, is expressed exclusively in the SSC and its transcription is upregulated 76-fold 3–6 h after mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Lawniczak2">[27]</xref>. We hereafter refer to <italic>CG18125</italic> as <italic>Spermathecal endopeptidase 2</italic> (<italic>Send2</italic>). Identifying these genes' regulatory regions allowed us to create drivers and reporters for manipulating and monitoring the SSC.</p>
      <p>We show that the SSC are required to recruit sperm to the spermathecae, but not for maintaining them there. Moreover, we show that the SSC act at a distance in the reproductive tract, in that they are required for maintaining sperm motility in the seminal receptacle. We also show action at a distance with respect to egg laying, in that females lacking SSC are ovoviviparous. Fertilized eggs develop, and indeed sometimes hatch into larvae, inside the uterus. This phenotype is reminiscent of two species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> that retain developing eggs, <italic>D. sechellia</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Markow1">[31]</xref>. Our results therefore not only reveal the functions of a poorly understood reproductive tissue, but also shed light on the evolution of live birth.</p>

        <title>Construction of SSC-Expressed Driver and Reporter Genes</title>
        <p>For each of the SSC-expressed genes, <italic>Send1</italic> and <italic>Send2</italic>, we created a driver carrying ∼4 kb of upstream sequence and ∼4 kb of downstream sequence, flanking the coding sequence of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4, which can activate transgene expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> through its cognate UAS sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Brand1">[32]</xref>.

        <title>Precise Ablation of the SSC before and after Mating</title>
        <p>The potential for redundancy among spermathecae-expressed serine proteases is high. Protease-encoding genes are over-represented among those induced in females by mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Lawniczak1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-McGraw1">[23]</xref>, and among those highly expressed in the spermathecae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Allen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Prokupek1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Prokupek2">[20]</xref>. Moreover, some spermathecae-expressed serine proteases are recently duplicated paralogs with high levels of amino acid identity. Consistent with redundancy, we did not observe any effects on female fecundity or fertility when we used <italic>Send1-GAL4</italic> to drive RNAi efficiently targeting <italic>Send1</italic> or <italic>Send2</italic> transcripts (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>To fully understand how SSC-expressed proteases contribute to female reproductive function might require the simultaneous knockdown or knockout of many genes. As an alternative approach, we used the <italic>Send1-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Send2-GAL4</italic> drivers to ablate the SSC at different times, thereafter eliminating their ability to secrete any products into the spermathecal lumen. As the SSC are terminally differentiated adult cells, we used the drivers to express a modified form of the apoptosis-promoting protein Hid (Hid<sup>Ala5</sup>) that is effective in postmitotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Bergmann1">[34]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We assayed the timing and effectiveness of cell-death induction using the nRFP reporters, as well as direct visualization of apoptotic cells by TUNEL (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). For all assays with <italic>Send1-GAL4</italic>, we mated females on day 4 posteclosion, to ensure that the majority of their SSC had been ablated. Note that occasionally a few SSC remain at day 4. We use this lack of complete penetrance to our advantage because it creates some mosaic females who have one of the two spermathecae lacking SSC whereas the other still has SSC.

Indeed, out of 17 SSC-ablated females, 16 had at least one empty spermatheca, and eight of these had both spermathecae empty.

        <p>It was previously shown that glucose dehydrogenase, which is secreted from the proximal and distal ends of the spermathecal duct, promotes recruitment of sperm into the spermathecae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Iida1">[37]</xref>.

        <title>Products of the SSC Are Required to Maintain Sperm Stored in the Seminal Receptacle</title>
        <p>At 24 h postmating, sperm storage in control females appears very similar to that observed at 7 h postmating. In SSC-ablated females, however, sperm dynamics in the seminal receptacle are aberrant. Whereas in control females, sperm are found throughout the tubular receptacle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g002">Figure 2K</xref>), in many SSC-ablated females, sperm have lost motility and clumped together in one part of the receptacle, leaving the rest of it largely empty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g002">Figure 2L</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001192.s002">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001192.s003">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001192.s004">S2</xref>). This result suggests that the products of the SSC travel to, and act in, the seminal receptacle. Consistent with this inference, Anderson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Anderson1">[38]</xref> found that females lacking entirely the spermathecae and female accessory glands lose fertility within a few days after mating. The loss of fertility is apparently caused by loss of motility of sperm stored in the females' seminal receptacles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Anderson1">[38]</xref>. A similar conclusion was reached by Allen and Spradling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Allen1">[11]</xref>, who used a different mutation that causes loss of the spermathecae and accessory glands. Our results localize the source of at least one motility-maintaining factor to the SSC.</p>
        <p>At 6 to 9 d postmating, sperm storage in control females still appears very similar to that observed at 7 h or 24 h postmating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g002">Figure 2M–2P</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001192.s002">Table S1</xref>).

Although rare females contain a few sperm in their spermathecae (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g002">Figure 2Q</xref>), most do not (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g002">Figure 2R–2T</xref>). As at 24 h postmating, clumps of sperm in the seminal receptacle are also seen in some females (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g002">Figure 2Q–2R</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001192.s002">Table S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Loss of the SSC after Mating Does Not Reduce Long-Term Sperm Retention or Maintenance</title>
        <p>The existence of a few sperm in the spermathecae of some SSC-ablated females approximately 1 wk postmating suggests that the SSC are not required to retain sperm in the spermathecae once they have been stored there. However, as described above, there is a correlation between sperm recruitment to the spermathecae and the existence of residual, nonablated SSC. It could be that the same residual SSC function that recruited the sperm to the spermathecae is sufficient to retain them there. To test definitively whether the SSC are required to retain sperm in the spermathecae, we eliminated the SSC after sperm were stored in the spermathecae. We did so by ablating the SSC after mating using <italic>Send2-GAL4</italic> in combination with <italic>UAS-hid<sup>Ala5</sup></italic>.</p>
        <p>At 7 h postmating, sperm storage in control <italic>+/UAS-hid<sup>Ala5</sup>; Send1-nRFP/+; MKRS/+</italic> females does not appear different to that of their <italic>+/UAS-hid<sup>Ala5</sup>; Send1-nRFP/+; Send2-GAL4/+</italic> sisters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g003">Figure 3A–3B</xref>). As noted above, SSC ablation is complete in the latter females within one more day. If the SSC are required for long-term sperm retention in the spermathecae, then SSC-ablated females should lose the sperm they had stored in the spermathecae. However, this is not the case. At 6–8 d postmating, SSC-ablated females retain as many sperm in their spermathecae as do their control sisters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g003">Figure 3C–3D</xref>). Moreover, sperm clumping in the seminal receptacle is not observed in these SSC-ablated females, implying that whatever SSC products are required to maintain sperm motility need only be supplied up to or around the time of mating, not continually.</p>

        <title>Products of the SSC Are Required to Sustain Egg Laying</title>
        <p>Because females whose SSC are ablated prior to mating do not store sperm in their spermathecae and lose sperm motility in their seminal receptacles, we next asked whether this impaired sperm storage affects fecundity or fertility. Females with SSC ablated prior to mating lay as many eggs on days 1 to 3 postmating as their control sisters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, after day 3, their egg laying is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Notably, after day 3 an individual SSC-ablated female tends to lay vastly different numbers of eggs on successive days. Indeed, 10 out of 18 SSC-ablated females had one day in which 0 or 1 egg was laid, followed immediately by a day with greater than ten eggs laid. By contrast, only one out of 15 control females had any day in which 0 or 1 was laid.</p>

        <p>The alternation of low and normal levels of egg laying in SSC-ablated females suggests that the SSC play some role in either ovulation or oviposition. To determine which is the case, we dissected SSC-ablated females that had not laid an egg in the previous 24 h. Strikingly, SSC-ablated females are ovoviviparous: a large proportion of such females (eight out of 16) had a late-stage embryo or live first-instar larva stuck in the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001192.s005">Video S3</xref>). This result implies a defect in ejecting eggs from the uterus (oviposition) rather than egg production and release (ovulation). However, those females with stuck eggs did not appear to have a “log jam” of eggs in the oviduct, suggesting either: (1) that inability to eject a fertilized egg signals back to the ovary to halt or slow ovulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Holzworth1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Thomas1">[40]</xref>; or (2) that ovulation is independently slowed by SSC loss.</p>
        <p>A simple, mechanical explanation for the stuck-egg phenotype is that the SSC produce a lubricant that coats the uterus, allowing eggs to pass easily. An alternative explanation is that products of the SSC are required before or around the time of mating to trigger cellular and physiological changes in the reproductive tract that are required for full reproductive maturity. Consistent with the latter explanation, females whose SSC have been ablated postmating, using <italic>Send2-Gal4</italic>, do not show any difference from control sisters in the number of eggs laid on each of days 1 to 8 postmating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001192-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This result implies that proper egg laying after day 3 postmating requires SSC function earlier in adulthood. The earlier function could be the production of a secretion, such as a lubricant, that is long-lived. However, multiple lines of evidence support the existence of posteclosion and postmating developmental programs by which the female reproductive tract achieves full maturity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Kapelnikov1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Kapelnikov2">[42]</xref>. The triggering of such a program by one or more SSC gene products could explain not only the egg-laying defect but also the loss of sperm motility in the seminal receptacle in females with <italic>Send1</italic>-driven, but not <italic>Send2</italic>-driven, ablation of the SSC.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Work prior to ours had suggested several possible functions for the secretory cells of the spermathecae, including recruitment and maintenance of sperm, yet direct <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence was lacking because of the absence of tools for precisely manipulating these cells. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, it had been observed that females lacking the spermathecae and accessory glands lose fertility, despite having normal seminal receptacles, but this effect could not be ascribed to any particular cell population within the missing organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Allen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Anderson1">[38]</xref>. Our cell-specific drivers enabled us to determine that the SSC contribute to reproductive function in multiple ways, some expected and some not. The SSC do indeed produce one or more products required for recruiting sperm into storage, although they are not required to maintain sperm in the spermathecae once recruited. In contrast, the SSC are not required for sperm to reach the seminal receptacle, but they are required to maintain sperm motility there, consistent with the lost fertility of females lacking spermathecae and accessory glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Allen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Anderson1">[38]</xref>. In addition to their action at a distance in the seminal receptacle, the SSC also act at a distance in sustaining egg laying. The impairment of egg laying in SSC-ablated females manifests as an unanticipated phenotype: ovoviviparity. SSC-ablated females retain fertilized eggs, which develop inside the uterus and, in some cases, hatch as larvae inside the mother.</p>
        <p>Our findings have relevance to two evolutionary patterns observed in the genus <italic>Drosophila</italic>. First, all <italic>Drosophila</italic> species that have been examined have a pair of spermathecae and a single seminal receptacle, yet there are at least 13 independent <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineages in which females use only the seminal receptacle to store sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Pitnick1">[43]</xref>. In species that do not store sperm in the spermathecae, the spermathecal caps are small and weakly sclerotized, but are surrounded by large cells that are presumably their SSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Pitnick1">[43]</xref>. Our finding that the SSC act at a distance in the female reproductive tract might explain why these species retain their spermathecae, despite not using them to store sperm.</p>
        <p>Second, the ovoviviparity observed in SSC-ablated females suggests that transitions to live birth might require fewer evolutionary steps than once thought. In a surprising recent discovery it was found that two species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are ovoviviparous: even when exposed to ample substrate for oviposition, females of <italic>D. sechellia</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba</italic> retain fertilized eggs, which develop internally, in contrast to those of all other examined <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, which are laid immediately after fertilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Markow1">[31]</xref>. Our SSC-ablation results suggest that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> uterus is “preadapted” to support internal embryo development, in that eggs stuck there are capable of hatching into perfectly viable larvae.</p>
        <p>The genetic tools we have developed will be useful for further dissection of the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying female reproductive function. Insect reproductive secretions are of particular interest because of their relevance to the fertility of agricultural pests and human disease vectors. To date, attention has focused on male secretions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Fernandez1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Catteruccia1">[47]</xref>, because of the far greater knowledge of male seminal proteins than of products of the female reproductive tract, but recent studies in malaria-vector mosquitoes have begun to counter this bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Rogers1">[48]</xref>. Reproductive secretions are also highly relevant to the study of beneficial insects, as evidenced by recent work characterizing the seminal-fluid and spermathecal-fluid proteomes of honey bees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Baer1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001192-Collins1">[51]</xref>. Increased knowledge of the regulation and functions of spermathecal secretions will add a new dimension both to insect-control efforts and to the maintenance of healthy breeding populations of agriculturally important insects.</p>

As assayed by quantitative RT-PCR with a <italic>Gadph2</italic> internal standard, <italic>Send1</italic> transcript levels in virgin and mated females were reduced to 10.2% and 9.4% of wild-type levels, respectively; <italic>Send2</italic> transcript levels in mated females were reduced to 1.5% of wild-type levels.</p>

Females were incubated at 29°C for 3 h postmating and transferred to 25°C for 21, 28, or 40 h. Lower reproductive tracts, including the spermathecae, were dissected in cold PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 for 1 h at 25°C. Tissues were then permeabilized for 5 min in a 1% Triton-X, 0.1% sodium citrate buffer at room temperature. Reproductive tracts were incubated with the TUNEL reagent (Roche) for 2 h at 37°C then washed in PBS, fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs) and maintained at 4°C.</p>
