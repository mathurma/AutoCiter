One property that has been proposed to contribute to protein functional robustness is “designability,” the number of sequences that encode a protein's structure. Using simple lattice models in which proteins are modeled as chains of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues on lattices, Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b001">1</xref>] has shown that different proteins could have vastly different designabilities. Proteins with more designable structures (i.e., proteins that have more sequences that encode their structures) were proposed to be structurally more robust to mutation and thermal stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b003">3</xref>]. In line with this hypothesis is the finding that proteins of thermophiles exhibited a higher contact trace, a measure that correlates well with the designability, than a sample of mesophiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>It has been hypothesized that protein structures of higher designability tend to be more fit because such structures would allow a greater amount of sequence changes associated with a greater diversity of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b005">5</xref>]. To assess designability, we took advantage of the hierarchical nature of the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop" xlink:type="simple">http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b006">6</xref>]. In this database, structures with highly similar sequences are grouped into families, families sharing a relatively close common ancestor based on high structural similarity are grouped into superfamilies, and superfamilies sharing an overall structural similarity are in turn grouped into folds. It is clear that in such a classification scheme, the number of sequences is always greater than or equal to the number of families, which are greater than or equal to the number of superfamilies, which is greater than or equal to the number of folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020040-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Since a direct relationship exists between the number of sequences and the number of families in protein folds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b002">2</xref>], a rough estimate of fold designability had been defined as the number of families within a fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b007">7</xref>]. This estimate of designability assesses the ability of a fold to withstand mutations based on the level of diversity of associated sequences derived under various functional constraints in its past history. In this work, we compared family counts within folds and the degree to which the structures appeared in eukaryotic proteomes. We subsequently show that families belonging to ancient folds with greater numbers of families tend to be more sequence divergent and more widespread throughout the human, mouse, and yeast proteomes, consistent with the hypothesis that more designable folds should be more fit.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020040-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020040.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>SCOP Hierarchy</title><p>Four levels of SCOP are shown: fold, superfamily, family, and sequence (dark blue rectangles).

Preliminary work also suggests that the majority of disease-causing mutations tend to be located in structural domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b015">15</xref>]. Protein designability was subsequently estimated by counting the number of families in each domain fold and taking the minimum count. In other words, we assessed the designability of proteins by the fold estimated to be least designable. Using this measure, it was shown that disease proteins tended to have folds with fewer families than non-disease proteins, suggesting that disease propensity of proteins was related to protein designability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we continue to investigate the concept of fold designability and its connection to hereditary diseases. We estimate protein designability based on the average family counts of all folds in a protein and, subsequently, find that many disease proteins contain folds with relatively few families. In particular, disease proteins were again estimated to be less designable than non-disease proteins, using this measure. We also provide evidence using a database of disease properties that proteins predicted to be less designable are associated with diseases occurring with greater frequency. Taken together, this work provides further evidence that designability is a factor important to our understanding of many of our diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Older Folds Have More Families</title><p>A potential problem of estimating designability using family counts is that relatively young folds may not have had enough time to establish families, even though the fold may be encoded by large numbers of sequences. Subsequent investigation revealed that relatively ancient folds appearing in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) have significantly more families than all the SCOP folds in human proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Eukaryotic folds found only in human, mouse, and yeast currently contain only approximately 2.5 families, on average, compared to an average of 13.8 families per fold for all human proteins. Thus, time seems to be a significant factor in determining how many families are found in a fold. To minimize the influence of inadequate time for the procreation of fold families on our estimate of designability, we concentrated subsequent investigations on ancient folds. Results pertaining to all human folds are found in the supplementary materials.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Folds with More Families Tend to Be More Sequence Divergent</title><p>We first compared the sequence divergence among ancient SCOP folds in human proteins against the number of families they contain using protein orthologs in mouse and yeast. Because orthologs were compared, the domains being compared belong to the same family (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In general, it was found that families that belong to ancient SCOP folds with greater numbers of families tended to be more sequence divergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020040-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This trend was also observed when we restricted our analysis to SCOP folds created relatively close to the origin of the human–mouse common ancestor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). A similar trend was observed when all folds were analyzed, although the significance of the trend could not be established (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). These results suggest that family counts in folds are associated with the divergence of these folds.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020040-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020040.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Sequence Divergence and Family Counts of Ancient Folds</title><p>Ancient SCOP folds found in human proteins were compared to those in mouse and yeast orthologs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), and the average divergence was recorded for each fold.

We reason that more designable folds would be more robust to sequence changes associated with a greater diversity of functionality, and thus would be found more often in a proteome in a greater variety of functional contexts. To test if our measure of designability correlates with fold fitness in the eukaryotic proteome, ancient folds from human, mouse, and yeast were binned according to the number of families they contain. For folds in each bin, the number of proteins each fold appeared in was counted and averaged. It was found that ancient folds with greater numbers of families appeared in greater numbers of different proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). This result was not unexpected because, in general, larger numbers of families tend to be encoded by larger numbers of sequences. Do individual families that belong to folds with more families appear more often in the proteome? For all families that belong to folds in each bin, the number of proteins each family appeared in was also counted and averaged.

For each bin, the mean family occurrence (the mean number of proteins in which the SCOP families in these folds appear) for human, mouse, and yeast proteins is shown. As the number of families in a SCOP fold increases, the occurrence of families belonging to these folds in the proteome tends to increase. Significant (MW-test, KS-test: <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05) occurrence differences were found between folds of one and more than ten families in human and mouse. No significant differences were detected in yeast. The differences in mean family occurrence between mammals and yeast tend to be larger for folds with larger numbers of families.

We define “fold promiscuity” as the number of unique “partner” folds in the entire proteome, that a particular fold had appeared with in the context of the same protein. We found that ancient folds with more families also tended to be more promiscuous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020040-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Graphically, if folds were represented as nodes, and edges connected folds if they were found in the same protein, folds with more families would be more hub-like. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that more designable folds are more fit, because they appear in larger numbers of proteins in a greater variety of sequence contexts.

A fold is considered here to be duplicated within the same protein if more than one instance of it exists in that protein. Duplication of folds within a protein allows either for amplification of existing functions associated with such folds or creation of new functions. Folds with different functionality are likely encoded by different sequences. Sequence dissimilarity may also be selected for in folds cooperating to amplify a single function because individual folds must function in different spatial contexts. Indeed, of the 3,468 human proteins that have duplicate folds, less than 7% (230/3,468) have such folds detected with the same BLASTP E-value (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Sufficient dissimilarity may also help sequences avoid aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b016">16</xref>]. More designable folds would allow for a greater variety of sequence change necessary for viable duplications. Examination of our human proteins revealed that ancient folds with more families are reused more often in the same protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020040-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Although statistical significance could not be established, SCOP families (structures that are likely to be closely related) that belong to more folds with more families were observed to be duplicated more often in the same protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).

Three different proteomes belonging to modern human, mouse, and yeast have emerged from the time of the common ancestor of these organisms. Within this fixed timeframe, the proteomes leading up to modern mammals have expanded considerably compared to those leading up to the yeast proteome. In particular, we found that the magnitude of differences between yeast and mammals in terms of fold occurrence, promiscuity, and duplication is much higher for ancient folds with larger numbers of families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg004">Figure S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020040-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020040-g005">5</xref>).

It seems that given the opportunity or need, structures of higher designability can proliferate more throughout proteomes, through events such as horizontal transfer, duplication, and recombination, within a fixed evolutionary timeframe. Taken together, these results provide further evidence that ancient folds estimated to be more robust to sequence or environmental change can be found more often in different contexts within eukaryotic proteomes.</p><p>Although our investigation has focused thus far on the divergence and proliferation of ancient folds, we also detect similar trends when we examined all folds and families within these folds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg003">Figures S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg012">S12</xref>).

Thus, a possible explanation as to why folds with more families are more divergent and widespread within genomes is that these folds tend to be older. To test this hypothesis we compared ancient folds and young folds found only in human and mouse (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) in terms of these attributes. In contrast to what we expected, we found that ancient folds tend to be more conserved than young folds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg018">Figure S18</xref>). No statistically significant differences in terms of occurrence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg019">Figure S19</xref>) and duplication within proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg020">Figure S20</xref>) could be found between young and old folds. Ancient folds were found to be marginally more promiscuous than young folds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sg021">Figure S21</xref>).

In other words, we estimate the number of sequences that encode a fold by its level of divergence achieved in its past history. One confounding factor for this measure is that the number of families found within a fold could depend on the time the fold existed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b018">18</xref>]. We found that ancient folds had significantly more families than relatively young folds found only in mouse and human. Thus, certain relatively young folds may exist, which may be highly designable, may not have had enough time for different families to evolve, and thus would be predicted to be less designable by our measure. Furthermore, since SCOP is largely based on manual annotation of known protein structures, a bias exists in the classification in terms of what sequences have been mapped to structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b019">19</xref>] and how these sequences are classified into folds. It is not known what effect this bias has on the use of family counts to estimate designability. The question arises as to whether family counts reflect what we expect to be properties of more designable structures and whether these properties are observable in nature.</p><p>To ensure adequate time was available for family procreation among folds to be examined, we concentrated our analysis on relatively ancient folds found both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Protein families belonging to ancient folds containing more families were found in larger numbers of proteins. Ancient folds with greater numbers of families were also found in partnership with a more diverse set of other folds, and were duplicated more often within the same protein. In particular, the expansion of families belonging to ancient folds with more families was found to be greater since the time of the yeast–mouse–human common ancestor. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis that folds with more families are more designable. More designable folds would allow for a larger number of sequence changes in a fold, allowing for greater diversity of function. This line of thought concerning protein folds is analogous to recent findings that designability correlates with contact density, which correlates with the mean functional flexibility score of gene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b018">18</xref>]. A fold that can exhibit greater functionality would be at an evolutionary advantage because it can appear in a greater variety of contexts. A strong correlation between fold promiscuity and occurrence suggests that fold recombination occurs nearly randomly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b020">20</xref>]. Other factors such as evolutionary history or the need for functions associated with a fold or fold combinations seem to have also influenced the frequency in which certain folds appear in proteomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b021">21</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sd005">Protocol S5</xref>). Our finding that folds with more families are more abundant and promiscuous in proteomes does reflect the expected increased fitness of more designable folds. It lends to speculation that designability is an important factor affecting how folds are distributed within proteomes and their potential for evolution of new functions via sequence mutations. Although exceptions exist, the assumption that the number of families that belong to a given fold is a good estimate of the fold's evolutionary success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b005">5</xref>] appears to be largely valid.</p><p>Fold designability defines a limit to the divergence associated with folds. Interestingly, we find that sequences belonging to folds with greater numbers of families were more divergent in orthologous proteins. Clearly, selection would affect the divergence of folds. However, if family counts capture the designability of a fold, these results also suggest that designability may have contributed significantly in limiting the divergence of folds. It would be highly interesting to tease apart structural and selective influences on divergence in the future.</p><p>Because older folds have more families, and folds with more families are more widespread and divergent, one might presume that folds are more widespread and divergent simply because they are older. We found that ancient folds were not necessarily more widespread than young folds in terms of occurrence and duplication, but were found to be more promiscuous, perhaps due to greater opportunity for recombination. Ancient folds were also found not to be more divergent than young folds. Abeln and Deane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b022">22</xref>] have also previously noted that old folds do not necessarily have many copies in genomes. The relationship between time and fold divergence is similar to previous findings that older mammalian proteins tend to be more conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b023">23</xref>]. Thus, our analysis revealed that the greater divergence, occurrence, and duplication observed for folds with more families is not simply an artifact of their tendency to be older.</p><p>Our inability to find a relationship between length of folds and the number of families contained within folds may be the result of the limited number of structures known. It also raises speculation that increasing the length of folds does not necessarily increase their designability, perhaps due an increase in the potential for aberrant misfolding and aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>It is worth noting that the associations between family counts, divergence, and fold proliferation in genomes were statistically weakened when we considered all folds instead of just ancient folds. This phenomenon is consistent with the idea that relatively young folds may not have had enough time to procreate families, thus obscuring trends between these attributes.</p><p>Early structural characterization of the human proteome indicated significant differences in SCOP superfamily composition between disease and non-disease proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b024">24</xref>]. In this and a previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b007">7</xref>], it was found that disease proteins tend to have folds with fewer families than non-disease proteins (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020040-sd002">Protocol S2</xref>). One cannot rule out that such a trend is a product of bias in our disease data. Nevertheless, about one third of folds in disease proteins with only one family are relatively ancient folds (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), and it is a mystery why many families have not evolved. Our results do suggest that many disease proteins have structures that have been relatively sequence constrained throughout their evolution. The form of this constraint may have involved the lowering of the fitness of ancestral organisms upon mutation of such structures. If similar constraints are maintained in humans for a sufficient number of proteins, then this may help explain why disease proteins tend to have folds with fewer families. Two-thirds of folds in disease proteins, however, are relatively young (most of which are found only in mouse and human) and thus would be predicted to be relatively less designable by contact-residue–based measure of designability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b018">18</xref>] compared with ancient folds.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that within a database of disease properties, more frequently occurring diseases were associated with proteins containing folds with fewer families. Theoretically, proteins with less-designable folds would be less robust to mutation. Such a characteristic suggests two reasons why proteins predicted to be less designable have been associated with more common diseases. First, proteins with lower structural robustness would be more likely to receive disease-associated mutations. Our results lend to speculation that an increased chance for deleterious mutations in proteins predicted to be less designable have contributed to their association with more frequently occurring diseases. Second, one would also expect the diversity in terms of structure and stability of less-robust proteins to be greater in a population. Such diversity in structure or stability is likely correlated with functional diversity because proteins of different structures usually perform different functions, and proteins of different stabilities would likely have different cellular lifetimes. Such diversity would facilitate the survival of a population in rapidly changing environments because certain members are more likely to contain a mutation adapted to the new environment. These mutations, however, may cause disease directly or increase susceptibility to diseases. For example, over 100 mutations in <italic>G6PD</italic> that increase the risk of hemolytic anemia may provide resistance to malaria outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b026">26</xref>]. In such a scenario, less-designable proteins would become associated with common diseases because members with mutations in these proteins would be more likely to survive. Subsequent population expansion would increase the number of individuals with disease-prone proteins, and bottlenecks would increase the frequency with which these diseases occur in populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b027">27</xref>].</p><p>Analogous to a decrease in designability, an increase in length has been proposed to increase the likelihood of a protein receiving disease-causing mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b028">28</xref>]. Notably, diseases that occur more frequently have also been associated with longer proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b029">29</xref>]. Longer proteins may also possess a greater diversity of mutations in a population, thus conferring functional diversity, especially if the mutations are distributed among different domains that carry out different functions. Like with less-designable proteins, it is possible that certain large proteins have been associated with common diseases because they had a greater chance of possessing a disease-causing mutation that happened to be beneficial in the past.</p><p>What has not been considered so far is the propensity for precursor molecules encoding proteins to undergo disease causing alterations. For example, certain genomic contexts or hotspots have been identified that predispose DNA sequences for mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b031">31</xref>]. If these sequences happen to encode proteins of low designability, then such proteins would be associated with diseases of greater occurrence. For example, the gene associated with Gaucher's disease has pseudogenes that predispose the gene for disease-causing gene conversion events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b032">32</xref>]. The associated protein contains the gycosyl hydrolase fold, a fold with only three known families. Thus, a protein with a fold seemingly constrained against sequence divergence has been associated with the increased potential for mutation associated with pseudogenes. Another example involves the genes <italic>OPN1LW</italic> and <italic>OPNL1MW</italic> encoding red and green photopigment proteins containing the Family AG protein–coupled receptor-like fold (f.13) that has only two known families. Their high sequence similarity and tandem arrangement have been thought to predispose these genes for disease-causing recombination events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b033">33</xref>]. Such associations between folds of low designability and genomic contexts that increase mutation propensity suggest that maintenance of polymorphism in corresponding genes has been selected for, perhaps to ensure differences amongst individuals that confer advantages to the population. This reasoning may help explain why certain duplicate genes are retained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b035">35</xref>]. In the case of vision-related genes, variation in perception may help groups exploit a wider range of niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b037">37</xref>]. What selective advantage Gaucher's disease gene polymorphism would confer remains an open question. Interestingly, recent comparisons between disease and non-disease genes revealed a significant excess of highly polymorphic genes constrained for divergence associated with disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b038">38</xref>]. The association between folds with fewer families with increased mutability in encoding regions may explain in part this observation.</p><p>To what extent intrinsic susceptibility to mutation and selection on populations has contributed to the association of diseases with proteins with few families is not known. The former mechanism suggests that a larger number of disease alleles exists for more common diseases. The latter mechanism suggests that a small number of common disease alleles in the population account for the high frequency of occurrence in human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b027">27</xref>]. Comparisons of disease allele frequencies between common and rare diseases when sufficient data become available may shed more light on this phenomenon. Whatever the dominant mechanism may be, the results of comparing length and fold family counts against disease frequency do suggest a general principle that properties that increase a protein's propensity for disease association would also increase the frequency that the associated diseases would appear in certain populations.</p><p>We must emphasize however, that fewer than 300 proteins with SCOP folds detected from our Ensembl database have been mapped to disease frequency categories. Disease frequency is influenced by many factors, including environmental effects and underlying genotypes. Thus, the disease frequency data we use may not reflect certain populations. Although we have provided evidence for an association between disease and SCOP family counts, the nature of this association is not known for many proteins. The extent to which our explanations hold as to why diseases are associated with proteins predicted to be less designable remains to be assessed. Establishment of principles based on our work would require further investigation on larger datasets accounting for multiple factors that influence disease propensity.</p><p>Throughout this work, we have extensively used family counts as an estimate of fold designability. How many sequences can encode a protein fold depends, not only on the intrinsic constraints imposed by the geometry of the fold, but also on the external environment. For example, high temperatures could restrict the sequence space occupied by folds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b004">4</xref>], whereas the presence of chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b041">41</xref>] and proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b042">42</xref>] could do the opposite. These molecules allow sequences more likely to misfold to exist by preventing or reversing misfolding events (in the case of chaperones) or degrading the fraction of deleterious misfolded sequences (in the case of proteases). Family counts may capture, not only the intrinsic designability of a fold, but also the degree of success of the fold within the multitude of environments and fitness constraints experienced throughout the history of the fold. The use of family counts to estimate fold designability assumes that the past success of a fold implies its future designability.</p><p>A major disadvantage of using family counts is that it is an imprecise measure. It is likely that different proteins with the same folds, and hence the same family count scores, can have vastly different designabilities. Moreover, if the fold is relatively young, the number of families contained in that fold may be too small to reflect its designability. Although residue contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b018">18</xref>], oligomerization states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b043">43</xref>], and molecular interactions are not direct measures of sequence divergence success, these properties are more specific to individual proteins and may help distinguish designability differences between proteins with similar folds. Data on gene mutation frequency and expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b046">46</xref>] may also prove useful in predicting designability. To this day, no comprehensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the relationship between different folds and their ability to withstand environmental stress or mutation. Screening random sequences for ones that fold is one approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b005">5</xref>] to investigate designability. Testing the foldability and functionality of different proteins after mutagenesis in different environments (in vivo or in vitro) is another approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b050">50</xref>]. Such experiments are likely to provide new information important to refining measures of designability and its use to estimate fold fitness. It would be highly interesting to repeat experiments carried out in this work using a greater variety of designability measures.</p><p>In summary, we have provided evidence that family counts can capture characteristics of fold designability. By estimating fold designability, we suggest explanations regarding how folds are distributed in proteomes and their potential for evolution. We have also provided evidence that our measure of protein designability is associated with properties of diseases. The designability concept remains immature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b005">5</xref>], but our work suggests that it may already have practical applications. With further development of this concept, further insights into the evolution of proteins and designability's relation to diseases are anticipated.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Proteomes and disease annotation.</title><p>A total of 34,111 proteins predicted to be encoded in the human genome were obtained from the Ensembl human v23.34e.1 database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020040-b051">51</xref>].

By recording the minimum family count of the folds in proteins, we assessed their designability by assessing the designability of their least designable fold.</p><p>We also assessed protein designability using a measure that ensures most residues that take part in structural domains in the protein chain contribute to the designability score. This was done by measuring designability by the mean number of families across all folds in each protein. In our example, the score for this measure would be (8 + 3 + 7)/3 = 6. The SCOP folds detected in this work, however, do not necessarily cover the entire protein, simply because either no such structure has been solved yet or the non-covered regions may be intrinsically disordered. Thus, we apply this measure to only those proteins that do not have regions longer than 70 amino acids that have not been covered by our SCOP detection methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Fold binning.</title><p>Because of substantial scattering within plots, analysis was conducted using four bins to emphasize trends: Folds containing only one family, more than one family, more than five families and more than ten families.
