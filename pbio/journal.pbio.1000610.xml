                <p>During cognitive tasks electrical activity in the brain shows changes in power in
                    specific frequency ranges, such as the alpha (8–12 Hz) or gamma
                    (30–80 Hz) bands, as well as in a broad range above ∼80 Hz, called the
                    high-gamma band. The role or significance of this broadband high-gamma activity
                    is unclear. One hypothesis states that high-gamma oscillations serve just like
                    gamma oscillations, operating at a higher frequency and consequently at a faster
                    timescale. Another hypothesis states that high-gamma power is related to spiking
                    activity. Because gamma power and spiking activity tend to co-vary during most
                    stimulus manipulations (such as contrast modulations) or cognitive tasks (such
                    as attentional modulation), it is difficult to dissociate these two hypotheses.
                    We studied the relationship between high-gamma power, gamma rhythm, and spiking
                    activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake monkeys while varying the
                    stimulus size, which increased the gamma power but decreased the firing rate,
                    permitting a dissociation. We found that gamma power became anti-correlated with
                    the high-gamma power, suggesting that the two phenomena are distinct and have
                    different origins. On the other hand, high-gamma power remained tightly
                    correlated with spiking activity under a wide range of stimulus manipulations.
                    We studied this relationship using a signal processing technique called Matching
                    Pursuit and found that action potentials are associated with sharp transients in
                    the LFP with broadband power, which is visible at frequencies as low as ∼50
                    Hz. These results distinguish broadband high-gamma activity from gamma rhythms
                    as an easily obtained and reliable electrophysiological index of neuronal firing
                    near the microelectrode. Further, they highlight the importance of making a
                    careful dissociation between gamma rhythms and spike-related transients that
                    could be incorrectly decomposed as rhythms using traditional signal processing
                    methods.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Electrical activity in the brain often shows oscillations at distinct
                    frequencies, such as the alpha (8–12 Hz) or gamma (30–80 Hz) bands,
                    which have been linked with distinct cognitive states. In addition, changes in
                    power are seen in a broad range above ∼80 Hz, called the
                    “high-gamma” band. High-gamma power could arise either from
                    sustained oscillations (similar to gamma rhythms but operating at higher
                    frequencies) or from brief bursts of power associated with spikes generated near
                    the electrode (“spike bleed-through”). It is difficult to dissociate
                    these two hypotheses because gamma oscillations and spiking are correlated
                    during most stimulus or cognitive manipulations. Further, most signal processing
                    techniques decompose any signal into a set of oscillatory functions, making it
                    difficult to represent any transient power fluctuations that occur at the time
                    of spikes. We address the first issue by using a stimulus manipulation for which
                    gamma oscillations and spiking activity are anti-correlated, permitting
                    dissociation. To address the second issue, we use a signal processing technique
                    called Matching Pursuit, which is well suited to capture transient activity. We
                    show that gamma and high-gamma power become anti-correlated, suggesting
                    different biophysical origins. Spikes and high-gamma power, however, remain
                    tightly correlated. Broadband high-gamma activity could therefore be an easily
                    obtained and reliable electrophysiological index of neuronal firing in the
                    vicinity of an electrode.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Neuronal oscillations exist in the brain over a wide range of frequencies, including
                the delta (1–3 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (9–12 Hz), beta
                (12–30 Hz), and gamma (30–80 Hz) bands, and are thought to reflect
                cortical processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Buzsaki1">[1]</xref>. In addition to the modulation of power in some of the
                aforementioned frequency bands, there is often an increase in power in a broad
                frequency range above 80 Hz, called the “high-gamma” band (80–200
                Hz). This increase in high-gamma power has been most consistently observed in
                electrocorticogram (ECoG) studies in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Crone1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-He1">[5]</xref> but is also observed in local field
                potentials (LFPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Liu1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Ray1">[8]</xref>) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Hauck1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Dalal1">[10]</xref>). It has been seen in several
                cortical areas, under diverse stimulus conditions and a range of cognitive states
                (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Crone2">[11]</xref>).</p>
            <p>The functional significance of high-gamma activity and its relationship to gamma
                rhythms that are typically observed at lower frequencies (30–80 Hz) remain
                unclear. One suggested role of the gamma band is to provide communication channels
                between cortical areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Womelsdorf1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Schoffelen1">[13]</xref>. Within this framework, there could be multiple frequency
                bands for communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Buschman1">[14]</xref>, so the high-gamma band could serve as a distinct channel
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Colgin1">[15]</xref>, possibly
                nested within a low frequency rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Canolty1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-He1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Jensen1">[16]</xref>. On the other hand, several
                studies have shown that spiking activity is coupled to power in the high-gamma range
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Liu1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Ray1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Rasch1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Whittingstall1">[19]</xref>. Because
                under many conditions the gamma power and firing rates are correlated (for example,
                during attentional modulation), it is difficult to distinguish between the two
                possibilities described above.</p>
            <p>We addressed this issue by studying the LFP power spectrum in V1 of monkeys while
                manipulating the stimulus size, because increasing the size decreases the firing
                rate but increases the strength of the gamma rhythm (i.e., the two are
                anti-correlated; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Gieselmann1">[20]</xref>), permitting a dissociation. Using a signal processing
                technique called Matching Pursuit (MP) that imposes minimal a priori assumptions on
                LFP decomposition and can simultaneously resolve both transient and oscillatory
                components in the LFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Ray1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Ray2">[18]</xref>, we studied the relationship between spiking activity and
                high-gamma power under conditions when the gamma rhythm was absent (no stimulus),
                weak (small stimulus size), or strong (large size). We found that high-gamma
                activity was strongly correlated with the multiunit spiking, under different
                manipulations of stimulus size and temporal frequency. Our results show that
                multiunit activity can be reliably estimated from the high-gamma power. Further,
                while investigating the role of high-gamma band in communication or coding, it is
                important to account for population spiking activity because it may also modulate
                power in the high-gamma band.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="s2">
            <title>Results</title>
            <p>Recordings were made from an array of 96 electrodes (Blackrock Systems) that was
                chronically implanted in the right hemisphere of V1 in two monkeys. The receptive
                fields were in the lower left visual quadrant at an eccentricity of 3–5°.
                The monkeys performed an orientation change detection task (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s001">Figure S1A</xref>),
                where they attended to a Gabor stimulus <italic>outside</italic> the receptive field
                while a series of gratings of six different sizes and orientations were presented
                inside the receptive field of one of the recording sites (new location for each
                session) for 400 ms with an interstimulus interval of 600 ms (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for further details).
                Analysis was restricted to sites whose receptive field centers were within 0.2°
                from the stimulus center and for which the firing rate was at least 1 spike/s for
                each of the six sizes. This yielded 15 and 104 sites from Monkeys 1 and 2. Unless
                stated otherwise, the results shown below were obtained after pooling the data
                across orientations to increase the statistical power, although similar results were
                obtained when the analysis was performed only on the preferred orientation.</p>
            <p>Four analyses were performed. First, we studied the correlation between firing rates
                and LFP power (as a function of frequency) while varying the stimulus size. For this
                analysis, firing rates and LFP power were averaged over time (between 200 and 400 ms
                after stimulus onset) as well as over stimulus repetitions. Second, we computed the
                correlation between two time-series: firing rates and the average LFP power in
                different frequency bands, both computed in 2 ms bins and averaged over stimulus
                repetitions. Third, we computed the trial-by-trial co-variability in firing rates
                and LFP power in different frequency bands under identical stimulus conditions.
                Finally, we performed a spike-triggered analysis in two dimensions (time and
                frequency) to estimate the temporal and spectral components in the LFP that were
                locked to spikes. Spectral analyses were performed using the MP algorithm (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details) and were
                compared with the more traditional multitaper method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Mitra1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Jarvis1">[22]</xref> in the Supporting Information

                    (radii of 0.3°, 1.14°, and 2.4°, shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s001">Figure

                    broadband increase in power in the first 100 ms after stimulus onset, coinciding
                    with the transient increase in firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The gamma rhythm, represented by
                    a horizontal band at ∼50 Hz in the time-frequency spectrum, appeared after
                    the initial transient and continued until the stimulus was turned off at 400 ms.
                    Consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Gieselmann1">[20]</xref>, gamma rhythm amplitude
                    increased with increasing stimulus size. We also observed an increase in power
                    over a broad frequency range above the gamma range (&gt;60 Hz). However, power
                    in this band showed the opposite trend—it decreased with increasing
                    stimulus size, similar to the decrease observed in the firing rates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows the energy

                    (40–60 Hz, peak at ∼50 Hz) increased with size, beyond the gamma range
                    there was a clear decrease in power with increasing size. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g001">Figure 1D–F and G–I</xref> show the

                <p>Although gamma rhythm and high-gamma activity are usually distinguished solely on
                    the basis of frequency (30–80 Hz versus 80–200 Hz), it is critical
                    to note that these two phenomena have very different spectral profiles and there
                    could be considerable overlap between the frequency ranges. The gamma rhythm is
                    “band-limited,” with a bandwidth of ∼20 Hz, and is visible in
                    the power spectrum as a distinct “bump.” Typically the center
                    frequency of gamma rhythm is between 30 and 80 Hz, but occasionally there is a
                    second peak at higher frequencies also (Monkey 2). In contrast, high-gamma
                    activity is “broadband,” represented by an elevation in power over a
                    broad frequency range without any obvious bumps. Although high-gamma activity is
                    more prominent at frequencies above ∼80 Hz, it can be observed at
                    frequencies as low as ∼50 Hz when gamma rhythm is absent (see the
                        “<italic>spike-triggered average analysis</italic>” section
                    below).</p>

                    change in power (200–400 ms after stimulus onset) from baseline, as a

                    traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g001">Figure 1F and 1I</xref>).
                    To relate the changes in power with stimulus size with corresponding changes in
                    firing rates, we computed the Spearman rank correlation, for each site and at
                    each frequency, between the six power values and firing rate values (one value
                    for each stimulus size, all values computed between 200 and 400 ms after
                    stimulus onset). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g002">Figure 2B</xref>

                    significantly negative in the gamma range but became positive above ∼60 Hz.
                    For Monkey 2, a negative correlation between power and firing rates was observed
                    at both the gamma bands (30–50 Hz and 80–95 Hz). Further, due to a
                    shift in the peak gamma frequency with stimulus size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Gieselmann1">[20]</xref>, power between 50 and
                    80 Hz showed a positive correlation. For both monkeys, the correlation between
                    firing rates and LFP power beyond 100 Hz was consistently positive.</p>

                <p>LFP energy was averaged between 200 and 400 ms to avoid stimulus-induced

                    circumstances, multitaper method is expected to yield similar results, which was
                    indeed the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
                <p>The positive correlation between spiking activity and LFP power above 100 Hz
                    could be due to “spike bleed-through,”—that is, energy
                    associated with action potentials of the neurons near the microelectrode
                    bleeding into the low frequency range. One possibility is that only the neurons
                    very close to the microelectrode, whose action potentials are large enough to be
                    isolated using an amplitude threshold, contribute to the high-gamma power.
                    However, we observed an increase in LFP power above 100 Hz even in sites where
                    the firing rates of isolated neurons were negligible or even decreased after
                    stimulus onset. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g003">Figure 3A</xref>
                    shows the firing rates of 30 and 10 sites in Monkeys 1 and 2, for which the
                    firing rate between 200 and 400 ms was less than 0.5 spikes/s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows the average
                    change in power between 200 and 400 ms from baseline for these sites. These

                    this period. This suggests that high-gamma power reflects the firing of a larger
                    pool of neurons near the microelectrode than those that are resolved from the
                    background.</p>

                    bands described above (colored traces), along with the mean change in firing
                    rate from baseline (black trace, same for all panels), for all sites. The
                    Spearman rank correlation between the two curves is shown at the top left
                    corner. While changes in power in the alpha or gamma band were not well
                    correlated with the changes in firing rate, we observed a strong correlation in
                    the dynamics of high-gamma power and firing rate. We also observed a strong
                    correlation between firing rates and LFP power between 250 and 500 Hz, which is
                    expected because of spike bleed-through in this frequency range. Similar results
                    were obtained for other stimulus sizes, or when gamma range was taken between 40
                    and 70 or 30 and 60 Hz (unpublished data). The right columns of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g004">Figure 4B and 4D</xref> show the
                    changes in power in the four bands for the six stimulus sizes. As expected, we
                    observed dissociation in gamma versus high-gamma power—while the power in
                    the gamma band increased more for a large stimulus than a small one, power in
                    the high-gamma band showed the opposite trend.</p>
                <p>Similar trends were observed when the Spearman correlation was computed between
                    firing rate and power curves obtained from individual sites, although the
                    correlation values were smaller. For power between 250 and 500 Hz, the median
                    ± SE (estimated using bootstrapping) correlation values for Monkeys 1 and
                    2 were 0.74±0.01 and 0.72±0.01. For the high-gamma range, the
                    median correlations were 0.67±0.01 and 0.61±0.02, while for the
                    gamma range the median correlations were 0.56±0.01 and

                    firing rates and power at higher frequencies. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s003">Figure S3</xref>
                    shows similar analysis using the multitaper method. Even with small window size
                    (64 ms), for which the gamma rhythm is not well represented due to poor spectral
                    resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s003">Figure S3B and S3D</xref>), correlations between firing rates and power at
                    high-gamma frequencies and above were smaller than the correlations obtained
                    with MP.</p>
                <p>To account for possible time lags between firing rate and power at different
                    frequency bands, we also computed the Spearman rank correlation after first
                    shifting the firing rate curve by a small duration (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). The correlations varied
                    only slightly as a function of the lag and typically were highest near time zero
                    (no lag).</p>
                <p>Because our stimuli were static gratings, both the firing rates and power in
                    different frequency bands showed a pronounced transient response before reaching
                    a steady state after ∼100 ms. We next asked whether the LFP power above 100
                    Hz could track the changes in firing rate if the rate changed periodically
                    during stimulus presentation. To test this, we used a different dataset in which
                    the temporal frequency of the stimulus was varied in a sinusoidal
                    counter-phasing fashion (i.e., a static grating with contrast varying in a
                    sinusoidal manner; temporal frequency was varied across stimulus presentations).

                    the average LFP power difference (left panel) as well as changes in power in
                    different frequency bands (right panels, colored traces) along with changes in
                    firing rates (right panels, black traces, same for all the panels) of 19 and 66
                    sites from Monkeys 1 and 2 when the temporal frequency of the stimulus was 2.5
                    Hz (contrast profile is shown in red above the top right panel; we get two peaks
                    in the contrast profile per cycle). Firing rates followed the contrast profile
                    and showed a periodic modulation at twice the temporal frequency (5 Hz). The
                    center frequency of the gamma rhythm was dependent on the instantaneous contrast
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Ray3">[23]</xref>.
                    However, the power above the gamma range (&gt;100 Hz) followed the same pattern
                    as the firing rates, with a Spearman correlation of more than 0.85 (shown at the
                    upper-left corner of each plot). Similar trends were observed for a temporal
                    frequency of 5 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g005">Figure 5B and
                        5D</xref>) as well as 10 and 20 Hz for Monkey 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s004">Figure S4</xref>).
                    Beyond 20 Hz, the firing rates did not follow the temporal frequency and the
                    correlation estimates were noisier. These results agree well with our earlier
                    observation that LFP power above ∼100 Hz closely tracks the changes in
                    firing rates. Note that at temporal frequencies of 5 Hz and above, alpha and
                    gamma bands contained harmonics of the stimulus frequencies, which made their
                    estimation of power inaccurate.</p>

                <title>Trial-by-Trial Co-variations in Firing Rates and LFP Power</title>
                <p>In the previous analyses we studied the relationship between LFP power and firing
                    rates under different stimulus conditions (different sizes). Under these
                    circumstances, it is difficult to determine whether the changes in firing rates
                    and LFP power are due to the same biological mechanism, because changing the
                    stimulus may lead to several changes in the neuronal network. A partial way to
                    address this concern is to study the trial-by-trial covariation in firing rates
                    and LFP power in different frequency bands when the stimulus conditions are
                    identical across trials. For this analysis, we first computed the firing rates
                    and LFP power between 200 and 400 ms for each stimulus presentation. LFP power
                    was computed in a 25 Hz band, in steps of 10 Hz. The Spearman rank correlation
                    between firing rate and LFP power at each frequency was computed individually
                    for each site, orientation, and size. Similar analysis was also performed before
                    stimulus onset (−300 to 0 ms). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g006">Figure 6A and 6C</xref> show the median Spearman
                    rank correlation, averaged across days and orientations, for Monkeys 1 and 2.
                    The first column shows the correlation during the baseline period (indicated by
                    a black horizontal line below the <italic>x</italic>-axis; the correlation
                    values were averaged across sizes). The other columns show the correlation
                    during the stimulus period (each column represents a different size, indicated
                    by a colored line below the <italic>x</italic>-axis). Correlation became
                    stronger with increasing frequency during baseline as well as stimulus period.
                    The smallest stimulus (second column) that produced the highest firing rate had
                    the highest correlation, which is expected because correlations are difficult to
                    detect when firing rates are low.</p>

                    and computed their trial-by-trial correlation with firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g006">Figure 6B and 6D</xref>). Correlation
                    values significantly different from zero (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 after
                    Bonferroni correction, rank sum test) are indicated by asterisks. For the alpha
                    band, the correlations were very small and rarely significant (medians averaged
                    over all sizes were 0.03±0.01 and 0.02±0.005 for the two monkeys).
                    For the gamma band, the overall medians were 0.05±0.01 and
                    0.09±0.006, typically not significant for Monkey 1 but significant for
                    Monkey 2. However, for the high-gamma band, the correlations were significant at
                    all sizes for both monkeys, except for the radius of 1.14 (cyan bar) for Monkey
                    1, for which the uncorrected <italic>p</italic> value was 0.02. The overall
                    median correlations were 0.14±0.01 and 0.18±0.006 for the two
                    monkeys. The largest correlations were obtained for power between 250 and 500
                    Hz, with medians of 0.28±0.01 and 0.34±0.007, highly significant
                    for all stimulus sizes. Similar results were obtained during the baseline period
                    (black bars). These results suggest that firing rates are more strongly
                    correlated with LFP power at progressively higher frequencies. Importantly, this
                    correlation can be observed even at frequencies as low as the high-gamma
                    range—that is, ∼100 Hz. These results are consistent with the temporal
                    correlation analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g005">5</xref>,
                    which also showed larger correlations between firing rates and LFP power at
                    higher frequencies.</p>
                <p>The results were similar when the same analysis was done using the multitaper

                        S5</xref>), which is expected because the analysis period was either before

                <title>Spike-Triggered Average Analysis</title>
                <p>The previous two analyses show that LFP power becomes more correlated with
                    spiking activity with increasing frequency, and importantly, this correlation is
                    significant even in the high-gamma range. In this section we characterize this
                    correlation in more detail by studying the LFP around the time when an action
                    potential was recorded. A commonly used measure is the spike-triggered average
                    (STA) of the LFP, which is computed by taking small segments of the LFP around
                    each spike followed by averaging. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figure 7A and 7D</xref> show the mean STA of 14 and 103 sites from which at
                    least 25 spikes were obtained during the baseline period (268 to 132 ms before
                    stimulus onset) for Monkeys 1 and 2. The STA revealed a sharp negative peak at
                    time zero, which is due to the sodium influx into the neuron. For Monkey 2, the
                    STA also showed an oscillatory component at 100 Hz (refresh rate of the
                    monitor). The STA, however, provides no information about the frequency content
                    of the spike-locked events in the LFP. To study the relationship between spikes
                    and LFP in the time-frequency domain, we computed the spike-triggered
                    time-frequency average (STTFA), where we took small 2-D segments from the
                    time-frequency energy spectrum centered on the spikes and averaged those
                    segments (for details and discussion of this method, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Ray2">[18]</xref>). Left panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figure 7B and 7E</xref> show the
                    STTFAs during the baseline period for Monkeys 1 and 2. Note that these STTFAs
                    show a dominant 1/f power spectrum. This is because unlike the STA, for which
                    any signal component not phase locked to the spike cancels out with averaging,
                    the STTFA averages segments of the energy spectrum, which are always positive
                    and hence do not cancel out. The STTFA therefore shows both the component locked
                    to the spikes and the usual 1/f power spectrum that is not locked to the spike.
                    This second component can be estimated by randomizing the times at which the
                    STTFA is computed, irrespective of the occurrence of spikes. The randomized

                        <p>(A) The mean spike-triggered average from spikes taken between 268 and
                            132 ms before stimulus onset, from the 14 sites for which at least 25
                            spikes were obtained. (B) Left panel shows the spike-triggered
                            time-frequency average (STTFA), computed by averaging short 2-D segments
                            of the time-frequency energy spectrum centered on the spikes. The middle
                            panel shows the STTFA computed after first randomizing the spike times
                            (called rSTTFA). The panel in the right shows the relative change in the
                            time-frequency spectrum locked to the spike, computed by taking the
                            difference between log(STTFA) and log(rSTTFA) (called the normalized
                            STTFA, or nSTTFA). (C) The mean energy between −1 to 3 ms of the

                <p>The nSTTFA is not the time-frequency power spectrum of the STA. The power
                    spectrum of the STA (unpublished data) has power at very low frequencies as
                    well, which is expected because it can be approximated by a Gaussian function
                    with a small sigma, whose Fourier Transform also has a Gaussian profile (with a
                    large sigma). However, at lower frequencies the STA power is masked out by the
                    much larger “1/f” noise present in the LFP. The nSTTFA shows the
                    portion of the power locked to the spike that is larger than the 1/f noise.</p>
                <p>We found that most of the energy due to the spiking activity was locked to a
                    narrow time window around the time of the spike, temporally coinciding with the
                    sharp transients shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figure 7A
                        and 7D</xref>. We also observed that the nSTTFA power was visible down to
                    frequencies as low as ∼50 Hz. To quantify this, we averaged the power in the
                    STTFA and rSTTFA between −1 to 3 ms around the time of the spike and
                    plotted the power as a function of frequency. The upper panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figure 7C and 7F</xref> show the
                    power of the STTFA (black trace) and rSTTFA (gray trace) between −1 and 3
                    ms, as a function of frequency. The lower panels show the difference between
                    these two traces (black line), along with the SEM (gray traces). The values that
                    are significantly different from zero are shown in green
                    (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, no Bonferroni correction, <italic>t</italic> test)
                    and red (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 with Bonferroni correction,
                        <italic>t</italic> test). We defined the “cutoff frequency” as
                    the frequency above which 10 consecutive frequency bins were significant at
                        <italic>p</italic> = 0.01 (without correction). This
                    cutoff frequency is crucial because it indicates the frequency limit above which
                    spikes can significantly affect the LFP power. For the two monkeys, the cutoff
                    frequencies were 52 and 48 Hz. Thus, the spike energy can be observed in the LFP
                    power spectrum at frequencies as low as 50 Hz. A visual inspection of the nSTTFA
                    shows that the spike energy was very prominent above ∼100 Hz.</p>
                <p>Similar results were obtained when the analysis was done during the stimulus
                    period. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">Figure 8A and 8D</xref>
                    show the mean STA of 15 sites for Monkey 1 and 94–103 sites for Monkey 2,
                    from which at least 25 spikes could be obtained between 232 and 368 ms after
                    stimulus onset, for the six stimulus sizes. The STA revealed that spikes
                    occurred at preferential phases of the gamma rhythm, which was also observed in
                    the spike-field coherence (SFC; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The STTFA (unpublished data) also
                    showed a band-limited elevation in power in the gamma range with increasing
                    stimulus size, but this was not observed in the nSTTFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">Figure 8B and 8E</xref>). This is expected because
                    the gamma band had elevated power throughout the analysis period, which was also
                    picked up in the rSTTFA and hence was subtracted out in the nSTTFA. Similar to
                    the nSTTFA obtained during the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figure 7B and 7E</xref>, right column), the nSTTFA
                    during the stimulus period showed a prominent burst of power beyond 100 Hz
                    around a small window near time zero. In addition, for Monkey 2 we observed
                    alternating bands of high and low energy in the high-gamma range in the nSTTFA
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">Figure 8E</xref>, middle and
                    right panels), with bands of high energy coinciding with the troughs of the
                    gamma rhythm seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">Figure
                        8D</xref>. This was also expected, because spikes preferentially occurred at
                    the trough of the gamma rhythm (at 0 ms and about ±25 ms) and each
                    high-gamma burst (vertical red/yellow band) reflected this enhancement of
                    spiking activity. Similarly, firing rates were lower than usual during the peaks
                    of the gamma cycle, which were reflected as bands of low energy (vertical blue
                    bands). Also, the degree of phase locking increased with increasing stimulus
                    size for Monkey 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s006">Figure S6C</xref>), which made the high-gamma power
                    fluctuations more prominent. This effect was not observed in Monkey 1, where the
                    degree of gamma phase locking was much weaker and the SFC did not increase
                    significantly with stimulus size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s006">Figure S6A</xref>).</p>

                    frequencies as defined before are indicated by short vertical lines near the

                    for the baseline condition we used spikes before the presentation of all sizes.
                    The cutoff frequencies ranged from 80 to 185 Hz. For Monkey 2, we observed a
                    small but significant increase in energy at very low frequencies, possibly
                    reflecting synaptic events associated with synchronous activity, so the cutoff
                    frequencies were ∼10 Hz (this small peak can also be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Nevertheless,
                    plots 8C and 8F, as well as the nSTTFA plots shown in 8B and 8E, showed a
                    reflection of spiking activity in the LFP that became progressively more
                    prominent between 50 and 300 Hz before reaching a plateau.</p>
                <p>MP algorithm is crucial for this analysis, because it readily accommodates sharp
                    transient-like fluctuations like those associated with spikes. If the
                    time-frequency LFP energy is computed using the multitaper method instead, all
                    functions have a fixed spread in time and frequency (depending on the window
                    length). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s007">Figure
                        S7</xref> shows similar analysis using multitaper method. Even with very
                    short windows, the resolution is much worse than MP because most of the energy
                    associated with spiking is spread out over the width of the window.</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>We show that the broadband increase in power most consistently observed above ∼80
                Hz in the LFP can be dissociated from the band-limited gamma rhythm, which typically
                has a center frequency between 30 and 80 Hz and a bandwidth of ∼20 Hz. Further,
                high-gamma activity is tightly correlated with the firing rates of neurons near the
                microelectrode. When the gamma rhythm is weak or absent, a substantial correlation
                can be observed between the spiking activity and LFP power at frequencies as low as
                ∼50 Hz.</p>
            <p>All the results can be explained as follows: spikes are associated with a sharp
                transient in the LFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figures
                    7A, 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">8A, 8D</xref>),
                which has power in a broad frequency range (including very low frequencies).
                However, at lower frequencies it is masked out by a much larger “1/f”
                noise. Therefore, the energy associated with spiking can only be readily observed
                when it exceeds the 1/f noise (the “cutoff frequency” described above).
                We show that this cutoff frequency is ∼50 Hz and the spike energy becomes more
                prominent with increasing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figures 7C, 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">8C,
                    8F</xref>). This explains the increase in correlation between firing rates and
                LFP power at high frequencies, when computed on a broad timescale (200 ms) with
                different stimulus conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g001">Figures
                    1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g003">3</xref>) as well as on a trial-by-trial
                basis under identical stimulus conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This also explains a tight
                co-variation between the firing rate curve and LFP power curve at higher frequencies
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g005">5</xref>). We also show that spikes that
                are too small to be isolated contribute to the high-gamma power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, high-gamma is a
                useful measure of the average population firing near the microelectrode.</p>
            <p>We emphasize here that the time-frequency components locked to spikes—that is,
                the high-gamma burst shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figures
                    7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">8</xref>, only
                describe the extracellular changes in field potential when an action potential is
                observed and may include not only the changes due to the action potential itself but
                also other changes in the network that might be related to spiking activity (such as
                synaptic input that leads to the spike). In other words, we cannot directly
                associate the time-frequency components shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">8</xref> with specific currents that are associated with
                action potentials. That would require similar analysis on intracellular recordings

                    very fast network oscillations in the range of ∼200 Hz (also called

                    broadband activity.</p>
                <p>Could the broadband high-gamma power reflect many narrowband oscillators
                    operating at many different center frequencies? While this possibility is
                    difficult to rule out completely, several problems arise with this hypothesis.
                    First, the MP algorithm has different types of functions to represent
                    oscillatory and transient signals; the type of function chosen depends on the
                    properties of the signal itself. We found that most of the energy in the
                    high-gamma range is captured by transient functions, which further are tightly
                    coupled to the occurrence of spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">8</xref>), rather than extended oscillations.
                    Second, the time-frequency uncertainty principle limits the number of different
                    frequency bands that can be used over a given period (for example, if
                    computation takes place over 100 ms, the center frequencies must be more than 10
                    Hz apart). In addition, elaborate filtering mechanisms would be required for
                    such coding schemes. Finally, because the LFP power follows a “1/f”
                    spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g001">Figure 1C, F, and
                        I</xref>), the raw power at high-gamma frequencies is extremely small,
                    typically less than 1% of the total signal energy. So if the broadband
                    response is due to multiple oscillators at different frequencies, their power
                    will be too weak to support reliable communication channels.</p>

These

                    fluctuations in the LFP at very low frequencies and over long time periods. In
                    our study, the stimuli were presented in a periodic fashion (400 ms on, 600 ms
                    off), and the average LFP locked to the stimulus onset was dependent on the
                    stimulus size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s008">Figure S8</xref>). In particular, after the stimulus was switched off at
                    400 ms, the evoked response showed a positive deflection whose amplitude
                    depended on the size, followed by a sustained depression that was also dependent
                    on size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000610.s008">Figure
                        S8</xref>). Such slow changes likely reflect network dynamics not directly
                    related to neuronal firing properties, because firing rates returned to
                    spontaneous condition within 100 ms of stimulus offset. It is beyond the scope
                    of this article to determine the neural mechanisms behind such characteristic

                    a straightforward relationship between the overall spiking activity of the

                    been proposed for the generation of gamma rhythms, typically involving a network

                    cells (ING and PING networks; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Whittington1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Cardin1">[43]</xref>, for

                    pyramidal neurons called “chattering cells” have also been reported
                    to be involved in the generation of gamma oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Gray2">[46]</xref>. These network mechanisms
                    (that determine the magnitude of the gamma rhythm) may differ from the
                    mechanisms that produce the majority of local multiunit activity.</p>
                <p>We note, however, that the power in the gamma band between 30 and 80 Hz is not
                    dependent only on the gamma “rhythm,” which may be weak or absent
                    for a variety of stimulus conditions (e.g., low contrast, low spatial frequency,
                    null orientation, small size). For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g001">Figure 1B, 1E, and 1H</xref> show an increase in
                    power in a broad frequency range (&gt;10 Hz), including the gamma range, in the
                    first 100 ms after stimulus onset, before the onset of the gamma rhythm at
                    ∼50 Hz. This broadband power might reflect synaptic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Mitzdorf1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Nunez1">[49]</xref>, spike afterpotentials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Buzsaki3">[50]</xref>, or the spiking activity

                    to dissociate between the band-limited gamma rhythm and the broadband increase

                <p>Several studies have shown that oscillations in different frequency bands of the

                    be correlated with the phase at a lower frequency) and have hypothesized that
                    this coupling could facilitate cortical processing simultaneously at several
                    distinct timescales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Canolty1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Jensen1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Lakatos1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Schroeder1">[53]</xref>. A recent study even

                    hypotheses, especially when one of the rhythms is at a lower frequency such as
                    in the delta or theta range. However, at higher frequencies, such as gamma or
                    high-gamma bands, it is important to distinguish between a “nested gamma
                    rhythm” and possible contributions from phase-locked spikes.</p>
                <p>An important issue here is the way the LFP signal is decomposed for
                    time-frequency analysis. Most analysis techniques (Short Time Fourier Transform,
                    multitaper analysis, etc.) necessarily decompose the LFP into a series of narrow
                    band signals at various frequencies. In MP analysis, we start with an
                    over-complete dictionary of functions that include both oscillatory
                    (narrow-band) as well as transient (broadband) functions and find those that
                    best represent the signal. We find that the LFP has several
                    “broadband” components, such as the transients observed in the first
                    ∼100 ms after stimulus onset or the sharp negativity associated with spikes,
                    which are best described by either delta functions or a Gaussian with a small
                    sigma. However, if such components are decomposed using traditional methods, we
                    obtain a series of oscillatory functions whose amplitude and phase values are
                    correlated (for example, the Fourier Transform of a delta function gives
                    constant amplitude and zero phase at all frequencies). In other words, broadband
                    components associated with spiking, stimulus onset, or eye movements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-YuvalGreenberg1">[54]</xref>, if

                    opposite side of the fixation point. The monkey was cued to attend to the Gabor
                    stimulus outside the receptive field, whose contrast was fixed at a low value to
                    make the task demanding. Stimulus features (size and orientation) at the
                    unattended location inside the receptive field were varied for each stimulus

                    change. To account for saccade latency and to avoid rewarding the monkey for
                    guessing, the monkey was rewarded only for saccades beginning at least 70 ms
                    after the orientation change. Trials were truncated at 8,000 ms if the target

                <p>Only correct trials were used for analysis. Catch trials (trials in which the
                    orientation did not change) were excluded. For each correct trial, only the
                    second stimulus through to the last stimulus before the target were used for
                    analysis, so that the stimulus conditions were identical for the entire dataset.
                    The first stimulus in each correct trial, which typically produced a stronger
                    response, was analyzed separately, and similar results were obtained. For the
                    size study, the average number of repetitions for each combination of size and
                    orientation was 19 (range 6 to 36) for Monkey 1 and 15 (range 7 to 28) for
                    Monkey 2. For the temporal frequency study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g005">Figure 5</xref>), the average number of repetitions
                    per temporal frequency was 82 (range 31 to 169) and 14 (range 6 to 40) for
                    Monkeys 1 and 2.</p>
                <p>Local field potential (LFP) and multiunits were extracted using commercial
                    hardware and software (Blackrock System). Raw data were filtered between 0.3 Hz
                    (Butterworth filter, 1<sup>st</sup> order, analog) and 500 Hz (Butterworth
                    filter, 4<sup>th</sup> order, digital) to extract the LFP, and digitized at 2
                    kHz (16 bit resolution). Multiunits were extracted by filtering the raw signal
                    between 250 Hz (Butterworth filter, 4<sup>th</sup> order, digital) and 7,500 Hz
                    (Butterworth filter, 3<sup>rd</sup> order, analog) followed by an amplitude

                <title>Receptive Field Mapping and Electrode Selection</title>
                <p>Receptive fields were estimated by flashing small Gabor stimuli (SD of
                    0.05–0.1°) on a 9×9 (Monkey 1) or 11×11 (Monkey 2)
                    rectangular grid that spanned the receptive fields of all the electrodes, while
                    the monkeys attended to a Gabor stimulus outside the receptive field. The evoked
                    LFP responses and the multiunit responses at different stimulus locations were
                    fitted separately with a 2-D Gaussian to estimate the receptive field centers
                    and sizes. Receptive fields obtained from multiunit and LFP responses were very
                    similar. As the multiunit activity was more variable across days (and sometimes
                    absent), we used the receptive field estimates from evoked LFP responses for
                    analysis. For Monkey 1, the upper half of the grid did not yield any responses
                    at all. Stable estimates of the receptive field centers (SD less than 0.1°
                    across days) were obtained from 27 electrodes in Monkey 1 and 66 electrodes in
                    Monkey 2. The remaining electrodes yielded weak and inconsistent evoked
                    responses and were excluded from analysis.</p>
                <p>For each recording session only the electrodes with receptive field centers
                    within 0.2° of the stimulus center were used for analysis. For the size
                    study, this yielded 56 electrodes (24 unique electrodes—many electrodes
                    were recorded on multiple sessions) for Monkey 1 and 138 electrodes (66 unique)
                    for Monkey 2. Out of these, we selected electrodes for which the average firing
                    rate between 200 and 400 ms (the period over which analysis was done, see below)
                    was at least 1 spike/s for all stimulus sizes, and the signal-to-noise ratio of
                    the isolation was greater than 1.5. This yielded 15 (11 unique) and 104 (58
                    unique) “spike” electrodes for Monkeys 1 and 2, respectively. For
                    the temporal frequency study, 44 (22 unique) and 90 (59 unique) electrodes had
                    receptive fields within 0.2 degrees of the stimulus center. Out of these, we
                    selected electrodes for which the average firing rate between 200 and 400 ms was
                    at least 1 spike/s at zero temporal frequency, and the signal-to-noise ratio of
                    the isolation was greater than 1.5. This yielded 19 (13 unique) and 66 (42
                    unique) spike electrodes for Monkeys 1 and 2, respectively.</p>
                <p>To account for the multiplicity of some electrodes in our dataset, all analyses
                    were repeated after pooling the data from the same electrode across days.
                    Similar results were obtained.</p>

                    <p>Time-frequency decomposition was performed using the MP algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Mallat1">[59]</xref>. MP is
                        an iterative procedure to decompose a signal as a linear combination of
                        members of a specified family of functions g<sub>γn</sub>, which are
                        usually chosen to be sine-modulated Gaussians—that is, Gabor functions
                        or “Gabor atoms”—because they give the best compromise
                        between frequency and time resolution. In this algorithm, a large
                        overcomplete dictionary of Gabor atoms is first created. In the first
                        iteration the atom g<sub>γ0</sub> that best describes the signal
                            <italic>f(t)</italic> (i.e., has the largest inner product with it) is
                        chosen from the dictionary and its projection onto the signal is subtracted
                        from it. The procedure is repeated iteratively with the residual replacing
                        the signal. Thus, during each of the subsequent iterations, the waveform
                            g<sub>γn</sub> is matched to the signal residue R<sup>n</sup>f,
                        which is the residue left after subtracting the results of previous
                        iterations. Mathematical details of this method are presented elsewhere
                            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Ray2">[18]</xref>.
                        Time-frequency plots were obtained by calculating the Wigner distribution of
                        individual atoms and taking the weighted sum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Mallat1">[59]</xref>.</p>
                    <p>In MP, by choosing a large dictionary of Gabor atoms, we get fewer a priori
                        limitations on decomposition and more free parameters than other methods and
                        are able to detect local patterns in the signal with the best possible
                        compromise between time and frequency resolution. Because the overcomplete
                        dictionary has basis functions with a wide range of time and frequency
                        support, we can represent rhythms (alpha, gamma, etc.) with functions that
                        are extended in time but narrow in frequency, as well as transients (due to
                        spiking or stimulus onset) with functions that are brief in time but broad
                        in frequency. The availability of “broadband” basis functions
                        that can capture the sharp transients associated with spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g008">8</xref>) is critical for the
                        results shown in this article. Further details about this method and its
                        advantages over traditional methods such as Short Time Fourier Transform are

                        Essentially, the multitaper method reduces the variance of spectral

                    <p>We adopted the method used by Womelsdorf and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Womelsdorf1">[12]</xref> based on
                        Spearman-rank correlation to compute the cross-correlation between firing
                        rates and power in different frequency bands. As a measure of the
                        cross-correlation at time lag L, we computed the Spearman-rank correlation
                        between the power between −100 and 500 ms and the firing rates from
                        L−100 to L+500 ms (both quantities were computed with a time
                        resolution of 2 ms; thus, we obtained 300 data pairs). This method is
                        approximate because the power and rate values are not independent across
                        time. However, the Spearman rank correlation analysis avoids assumptions
                        about the underlying distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000610-Womelsdorf1">[12]</xref>. Note that
                        correlation does not change if values are scaled by a constant. For example,
                        scaling down the green traces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000610-g004">Figure 4B and 4D</xref> (for the gamma band)
                        would appear to improve their alignment with the black trace, however it
                        will not change the Spearman correlation. We obtained cross-correlation
                        functions for time lags (L) between −20 and 20 ms. Because the results
                        did not vary greatly as a function of L and were maximum near

                        within 1° of a small central dot (white central dot), while two
                        achromatic odd-symmetric stimuli were synchronously flashed for 400 ms with
                        an interstimulus period of 600 ms. One was a grating of different sizes and
                        orientations, centered on the receptive field of one of the recording sites
                        (red circle; receptive fields of all the electrodes were in the lower left
                        quadrant at an eccentricity of 3–5°); the second stimulus was a

                        the other hemifield. The monkey was cued to attend to the Gabor stimulus
                        outside the receptive field. At an unsignaled time drawn from an exponential
