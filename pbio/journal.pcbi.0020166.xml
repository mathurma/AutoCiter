The data of various retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens are compiled in the publicly available Retroviral Tagged Cancer Gene Database (RTCGD). Integrally analyzing these screens for the presence of common insertion sites (CISs, i.e., regions in the genome that have been hit by viral insertions in multiple independent tumors significantly more than expected by chance) requires an approach that corrects for the increased probability of finding false CISs as the amount of available data increases. Moreover, significance estimates of CISs should be established taking into account both the noise, arising from the random nature of the insertion process, as well as the bias, stemming from preferential insertion sites present in the genome and the data retrieval methodology. We introduce a framework, the kernel convolution (KC) framework, to find CISs in a noisy and biased environment using a predefined significance level while controlling the family-wise error (FWE) (the probability of detecting false CISs). Where previous methods use one, two, or three predetermined fixed scales, our method is capable of operating at any biologically relevant scale. This creates the possibility to analyze the CISs in a scale space by varying the width of the CISs, providing new insights in the behavior of CISs across multiple scales. Our method also features the possibility of including models for background bias. Using simulated data, we evaluate the KC framework using three kernel functions, the Gaussian, triangular, and rectangular kernel function. We applied the Gaussian KC to the data from the combined set of screens in the RTCGD and found that 53% of the CISs do not reach the significance threshold in this combined setting. Still, with the FWE under control, application of our method resulted in the discovery of eight novel CISs, which each have a probability less than 5% of being false detections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>A potent method for the identification of novel cancer genes is retroviral insertional mutagenesis. Mice infected with slow transforming retroviruses develop tumors because the virus inserts randomly in their genome and mutates cancer genes. The regions in the genome that are mutated in multiple independent tumors are likely to contain genes involved in tumorigenesis. As the size of these datasets increases, conventional methods to detect these so-called common insertion sites (CISs) no longer suffice, and an approach is required that can control the error independent of the dataset size. The authors introduce a framework that uses a technique called kernel density estimation to find the regions in the genome that show a significant increase in insertion density. This method is implemented over a range of scales, allowing the data to be evaluated at any relevant scale. The authors demonstrate that the framework is capable of compensating for the inherent biases in the data, such as preference for retroviruses to insert near transcriptional start sites. By better balancing the error, they are able to show that from the 361 published CISs, 150 can be identified that have a low probability of being a false detection. In addition, they discover eight novel CISs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was part of the BioRange programme of the Netherlands Bioinformatics Centre (NBIC), which is supported by a BSIK grant through the Netherlands Genomics Initiative (NGI).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>de Ridder J, Uren A, Kool J, Reinders M, Wessels L (2006) Detecting statistically significant common insertion sites in retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens.

After infecting a host cell, the retrovirus inserts its own DNA into the host cell's genome, mutating the host cell's DNA in the process. The mutation may alter the expression of genes in the vicinity of the insertion or, when inserted within a gene, alter the gene product. When the affected gene is a cancer gene (either a proto-oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene), activation of the proto-oncogene or inactivation of the tumor-suppressor gene can cause uncontrolled proliferation (cell division) of cells. Eventually this may give rise to tumors. Throughout this text, these cancer-causing insertions are referred to as oncogenic insertions.</p><p>A tumor develops when an accumulation of oncogenic insertions causes uncontrolled proliferation of a cell. As a result, the tumor tissue contains many copies of the cell bearing the oncogenic insertions that induced the proliferation, but only a few copies of cells carrying non-oncogenic (random, background) insertions. Consequently, when the DNA of the tumor is analyzed, one will encounter the insertion that induced proliferation in larger proportions than insertions that do not. Regions in the genome that are found to carry insertions in multiple independent tumors are called common insertion sites (CISs). As a result, the locations of the CISs are highly correlated with the location of genes involved in tumor development. Cloning the flanking sequences of the inserted virus to determine the insertion loci, and analyzing these data to find significant CISs, therefore enable the discovery of new candidate cancer genes. This is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020166-sg001">Figure S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>The Data</title><p>Over the last few years an extensive amount of insertional mutagenesis data has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b010">10</xref>]. These data have been compiled in the Retroviral Tagged Cancer Gene Database (RTCGD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b011">11</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://RTCGD.ncifcrf.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://RTCGD.ncifcrf.gov</ext-link>), and contains approximately 4,000 insertions (accessed November 2005). The vast majority of these insertions have been acquired in 20 different screens that each analyzed the insertions using their own definition of a CIS, which sometimes includes manual curation.</p><p>Due to noise in the data, not all insertions are informative. In the idealized case, oncogenic insertions are present in every tumor cell (since these cells are all copies of the cell with the initial oncogenic insertion that induced the tumor), whereas background insertions are only present in a small proportion of the tumor cells. Although this implies that the probability of finding a non-oncogenic insertion is far lower than for an oncogenic insertion, it may still occur that a non-oncogenic insertion is found. This results in non-informative insertions, the noise. Moreover, when a non-oncogenic insertion happens early in the tumor development phase, i.e., co-occurs in the same cell with one or more oncogenic insertions, there will also be many copies of this non-oncogenic insertion in the final tumor. Consequently, the probability of mapping this insertion will increase dramatically. This phenomenon is called <italic>piggy-backing</italic>. Due to piggy-backing, it is required that an insertion at a certain locus occurs in more than one tumor, since this greatly reduces the probability of finding a CIS that is not causal for the tumor.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Modeling Common Insertion Sites</title><p>A CIS is defined as a region in the genome that has been hit by viral insertions in multiple independent tumors significantly more frequently than expected by chance (schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Ideally, CISs are identified because insertions in this region induce an oncogenic mutation that affects nearby cancer genes. Cancer genes may, however, be affected from various regions around or within the gene. It is yet unclear what determines the width of these regions, but it is certain that there does not exist one such width applicable to all cancer genes. This biological variance should be accounted for when evaluating the statistical significance of CISs.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020166-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020166.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic View of Insertion Data</title><p>(A) Schematic view of the mapped data of four tumors.

When the amount of data (insertion sites) increases, as is expected in the near future, these analyses will suffer from an increase in the probability of finding false CISs. To reduce the number of false detections, the window size has to be decreased, such that the method performs at the desired error level. This type of error control is undesirable, since this results in a mismatch between the new, decreased, window size, and the biologically relevant window size (the scale of the putative CIS), and hence may cause CISs to be missed. Therefore, methods for detecting CISs should be capable of keeping control of the probability of detecting false CISs, independent of the scale of the putative CIS.</p><p>The definition of a CIS depends on some expectation of the insertion rate associated with non-CIS regions. For this reason, we have to make assumptions about the background insertion distribution, i.e., the distribution of insertions under the assumption that there is no proliferative selection. In current methods, this distribution is assumed to be uniform, i.e., viral inserts show no preference for specific regions in the genome. Various authors suggest, however, that viral inserts do show local biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b015">15</xref>]. Specifically, it is suggested that murine leukemia virus (MLV) favors integration near transcription start sites (TSSs) due to local recognition of genomic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b015">15</xref>]. When the goal is to identify the regions that are involved in the tumor development process, these so called hot spots should be corrected for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b016">16</xref>].</p><p>Summarizing, we state that, for the detection of CISs in retroviral insertional mutagenesis data, a framework is needed that 1) evaluates significance at any desired (biologically relevant) scale, 2) does so while keeping control of the error (since in the near future a significant increase in these data is expected), and 3) provides the possibility of including a background distribution, enabling compensation for the background bias. In this study, we propose a kernel convolution (KC) framework that meets the criteria outlined above. We apply this framework to the data of all the screens in the RTCGD combined, as if they originated from one screen. This gives us the opportunity to evaluate the method for large amounts of data. Indeed, the method rejects 53% of the CISs that do not reach the significance level in the combined set of screens. While keeping the family-wise error (FWE) under control, the method still revealed eight new CISs that are significant across the different screens. In addition, we provide the nearby putative target genes that may play a role in oncogenesis. Due to its generality, the method can be applied to other types of high-throughput genome-wide data, too; for example, to copy number aberration data or data from insertional mutagenesis screens using transposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b017">17</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Kernel Convolution Framework</title><p>The steps involved in the application of the KC framework can be summarized as follows (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g002">Figure 2</xref>, for details see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). A kernel function is positioned at every insertion in the data. For any position in the genome, an estimate of the number of insertions can be obtained by summing all the kernel functions. Applying a KC effectively smoothes the observed insertion in a region around this insertion. This alleviates the problems associated with the inherent data sparseness, since we use the observed insertion to infer information about its direct neighborhood. Insertions occurring in each others vicinity will produce a higher peak in the estimate of the number of insertions. This models the fact that these insertions may all have an effect on a nearby cancer gene. The kernel width, which controls the smoothness of the estimate of the number of insertions, can be seen as a scale parameter. By varying the scale parameter, CISs of varying widths can be detected. The peaks in the estimate of the number of insertions are indicative for the location of putative CISs. Peaks are significant when they exceed an amplitude threshold. This threshold is determined based on a user-defined <italic>α</italic>-level, and the empirical null-distribution of peak heights, which is obtained by random permutation experiments. In addition to a uniform background distribution, this framework allows the inclusion of any other background model in the computation of the null-distribution, in order to compensate for possible background bias. The probability of detecting false CISs is controlled by applying the Bonferroni correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b018">18</xref>], by correcting the user-defined <italic>α</italic>-level with the number of peaks in the resulting density estimate. This ensures that the expected error is controlled and is always smaller than the <italic>α</italic>-level, for any of the scales used. In contrast to previous methods, CISs can now be detected at any desirable (biologically relevant) scale, while keeping the error under control.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020166-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020166.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Schematic Depiction of the Kernel Convolution Framework</title><p>The insertions are convolved with a kernel function with a width determined by the scale parameter.

Various kernel functions (Gaussian, triangular, rectangular, Barlett-Epanechnikov, etc.) have been proposed for various applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b019">19</xref>]. Although in principle any type of kernel function can be used, we will compare the often-used Gaussian kernel function, the triangular kernel function, and the rectangular kernel function. The Gaussian and triangular kernel functions are “descending” kernels, which have their maximum likelihood at the observed insertion position. In addition, the Gaussian kernel is a smooth function. The rectangular kernel function possesses sharp flanks, which results in a discrete estimation of the number of insertions. Notably, the use of the rectangular kernel function bears resemblance to the approaches used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b009">9</xref>]. It is important to evaluate the performance of some kernel functions independent of any bias or noise. Therefore, we will evaluate the performance of the KC framework with artificially generated insertion data. In the text below, GKC, TKC and RKC will refer to kernel convolution using the Gaussian, triangular, and the rectangular kernel functions, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Scale space.</title><p>Since it is possible for CISs to be present for large scale parameters (broad CISs), but not for small scale parameters (narrow CISs), or vice versa, it is vital to consider the significance of CISs for different scale parameters. We propose a scale space approach in which the scale parameter is varied across a range of values to gain information about the “lifespan” of a CIS, while keeping the FWE at a predefined level. The lifespan is defined as the range of scale parameters for which the CIS is significant (exists). It will be shown that the CISs with a long lifespan (i.e., the CISs that appear for small as well as larger scale parameters) often consist of different narrow CISs that are joined together when increasing the scale parameter.</p><p>Plotting the CISs versus the scale parameter yields scale space diagrams (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g005">Figure 3</xref>). Horizontally, the locus in the genome is plotted; vertically, the scale parameter. A CIS is represented by a horizontal line connecting the start and end positions of the CIS, defined by the intersection of the estimation of the number of peaks with the threshold. The vertical positions of these lines correspond to the scale parameter for which this CIS was found to be significant. The location of genes is also displayed in the scale space diagram, providing the opportunity to identify the genes that could be affected by a detected CIS, the relative location of CISs to genes, and the range across which a gene can be affected by a CIS. To enable comparison with the CISs from the RTCGD, we define a “cross scale CIS” (csCIS) as a unique region in the genome classified as a CIS by <italic>at least</italic> one scale parameter.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Background correction.</title><p>As mentioned before, MLV favors integration near TSS. Consequently, the location of TSS may be a good predictor for integration hot spots. We therefore explore a background model which uses the locations of the 5′ ends of the genes annotated in ENSEMBL for background bias correction. Although it has been shown that the viral insertions prefer integration near the 5′ end of <italic>active</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b016">16</xref>], we used all genes for our background correction, since there is no information available about which genes were active during integration. There are, however, more (unknown) factors influencing the selective behavior of MLV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b016">16</xref>]. This makes it difficult to reliably estimate a background density, since absence of TSSs does not necessarily imply cold spots. Furthermore, the data of the RTCGD consists of insertions from screens with different types of the MLV that may prove to have slightly different preferential site selection. For these reasons, we prefer to use a background model based on both the background (TSS) data and a uniform data distribution, and hence only correct for the presence of hot spots.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Results from Artificial Data</title><p>The performance and robustness of the KC framework in conjunction with either the Gaussian, triangular, or rectangular kernel function, is evaluated using artificial data.

The GKC controls the errors at an average of 5%, whereas the TKC manifests a slightly more conservative behavior, since the error is below 5% for all scale parameters. This becomes even more apparent for the RKC, where the errors remain well below the <italic>α</italic>-level for all but two scale parameters. Equally important is the fact that the error is not constant across the scales, that is, TKC and RKC suffer from a scale-dependent bias, although for the RKC this bias is far more severe than for the TKC.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020166-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020166.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>The <italic>Myc</italic> Locus on Chromosome 15</title><p>(A) The blue line represents the estimated number of insertions as a function of position for a certain region.

Because the rectangular kernel function does not smooth insertions weighed by their distance to the observed insertion, a null-distribution of peak heights results that is discretized to an integer insertion count. A consequence of this is that, when increasing the scale parameter gradually, there will be points in the scale space for which the method suddenly becomes more conservative, because at these transition points an extra insertion is needed before significance is reached when compared with a slightly smaller scale parameter. To a lesser extent, this effect is also present for the triangular kernel function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). The scale-dependent bias is only truly absent when using the Gaussian kernel function, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">Figure 4</xref>A.</p><p>Thus, using the number of peaks to correct for multiple testing proves to keep the FWE below the predefined level of 5%, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">4</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">4</xref>E. However, it is the Gaussian kernel function that is capable of controlling the error at 5%, independent of the scale. The results obtained from simulating CISs from a normal distribution also support these findings, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020166-sg002">Figure S2</xref>.</p><p>It should be noted that FWE is controlled per scale parameter. A range of 12 scale parameters is used so that, if for every scale parameter a <italic>unique</italic> FP error would occur, an average number of combined FPs of 0.6 would be expected. Plotting the average number of csFPs shows that this does not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">4</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">4</xref>E, dotted line). This indicates that the dependency between tests at different scales is high. For this reason, we deem extra correction for the tests over different scales unnecessary, and the resulting error acceptable.</p><p>The scale-dependent bias and consequent conservativeness of the RKC and TKC also has repercussions for the TPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">4</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">4</xref>F). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g005">Figure 5</xref>A we note that among the simulated CISs some borderline cases are present. The case for which only two insertions are present in a region of 500 bp is not detected with 100% accuracy. For the broad CISs with a low number of inserts, the results are similarly mediocre. This is not surprising since for those CISs, the CIS insertion rate approaches that of the background insertion rate. Still, using a triangular or rectangular kernel function seems to perform reasonably well, considering the average number of csTPs approaches one for most of the simulated CISs. However, with the FWE under control, it is the GKC that manages to reach a maximal average number of TPs for most scale parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) and most simulated CISs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), outperforming the TKC and RKC.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020166-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020166.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Results from Simulation Experiments—True and False Positives</title><p>(A,B) Results for the GKC applied to artificial data.</p><p>(C,D) Results for the TKC.</p><p>(E,F) Results for the RKC.</p><p>The horizontal solid lines in (A), (C), and (E) show the 5% significance level, the dotted lines show the average number of csFPs.

This specificity property is evident from the fact that small simulated CISs (light bars) are detected more frequently in the simulations using small scale parameters, whereas the large simulated CISs (dark bars) are mainly detected using larger scale parameters. Notably, the range of scale parameters across which a CIS of a certain width is detected is considerably larger for GKC and TKC than for RKC, which indicates a larger degree of robustness.</p><p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g005">Figure 5</xref>B it can be seen that, when considering only the TPs, the positional accuracy of the GKC and TKC are slightly better than for the RKC. This can best be explained by the fact that these kernel functions optimize the CIS location by using the peaks of the estimated number of insertions, and thereby incorporate the distribution of the insertion data in the detection of CISs, whereas the RKC only uses the two outer insertions of a CIS to position its center.</p><p>The results for a Gaussian distribution of insertions within the CIS are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020166-sg002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020166-sg003">S3</xref>.

The same subset of scale parameters is evaluated as was used for the experiments on artificial data. The CISs are displayed in the scale space, which offers the opportunity to evaluate the lifespan of CISs across multiple scales. For instance, we learn that the locus near the gene to the right of the <italic>Pvt1</italic> gene is only significant for scales larger than 2.5 k bp. It is also possible that CISs are only significant for small scale parameters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020166-sg005">Figure S5</xref> for a region on Chromosome 11). In the scale space diagram, we see that, for the <italic>Myc</italic> locus, it is equally justified to state that there is one, or that there are two, three, or four distinct CISs present, all depending on which scale range is considered.</p><p>The added value of breaking a single large-scale CIS for the <italic>Myc</italic> locus into a number of small-scale CISs can be illustrated by examining the genotype specificity of the CISs at a scale of 10 k bp (four CISs).

When applying this definition to the 962 insertions from the combination of the screens from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b008">8</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b007">7</xref>], we find 94 CISs. We can estimate the number of FPs using a permutation procedure, as detailed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b009">9</xref>]. This results in an estimated number of false detections equal to 11 (12%). Depending on the type of followup experiment, this might still be acceptable. The GKC detects 53 CISs, for which the probability of being a false detection is always lower than 5%.</p><p>The limitations of the definition from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b008">8</xref>] become evident when applying it to the complete set of data (3,947 insertions). This results in the discovery of 451 CISs, but as many as 244 (54%) are estimated to be false detections. Clearly, this definition is unsuitable for larger datasets, such as the one obtained by combining all the data from the RTCGD (also illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g006">Figure 6</xref>B shows that, although our method does not find new CISs when compared with the CISs resulting from the definition in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b008">8</xref>], our method selects the CISs that have a small chance of being false detections. In other words, the KC framework balances the number of detections and the number of false detections more efficiently by controlling the FWE. While the total number of detected CISs is reduced, the set of detected CISs is guaranteed to be TPs with a probability imposed by the <italic>α</italic>-level. This makes the method suitable for scaling to large datasets.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g007">Figure 7</xref> shows the number of CISs for all scale parameters individually, the number of csCISs, and the number of CISs in the RTCGD. From the Venn diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g008">Figure 8</xref>A we learn that the integral analysis using the fully data-driven GKC method results in ten novel CISs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g008">Figure 8</xref>B also shows an example) when compared with the published CISs from the RTCGD. Further analysis of the CISs indicated that six of these novel CISs could only have been discovered when integrally analyzing the data, since the individual insertions occurred in different screens. Two of the CISs consisted of two insertions either at the exact same locus or within a few base pairs (bp) of each other, in different tumors but from the same screen. For some reason these CISs have been omitted from the database by the authors of the screens. The two remaining CISs consisted of insertions occurring in the same tumor and can therefore not be called a CIS. These CISs can easily be removed by preprocessing the data and replacing insertions close together, but within one tumor, by the median insertion. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020166-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the results. We have annotated this CIS table with nearby putative target genes which might play a role in oncogenesis.

This is in accordance with the background bias model used in the analysis: a Gaussian distribution of ±5 k bp does not justify the removal of small CISs (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020166-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).

Current methods do not control the number of falsely detected CISs without changing the scale of the putative CIS, and fail when applied to large datasets. In this paper, this is solved by introducing a KC framework capable of discovering statistically significant CIS, while controlling the FWE for any biologically relevant scale. Because the KC framework controls the error per scale, it is capable of analyzing the data in the scale space, allowing the discovery of narrow as well as broad CISs.</p><p>We evaluated the performance of the KC framework using three often-used kernel functions: the Gaussian, triangular, and rectangular kernel functions. From the results obtained using artificial data, we conclude that the KC framework is capable of keeping the FWE under the desired error level, for a range of different CISs and scale parameters. The GKC, however, performs most robustly, since it is capable of controlling the error in an unbiased fashion across the scales. This is highly desirable when analyzing the data in a scale space. Additionally, the TKC and GKC show better positional accuracy when compared with the RKC.</p><p>To test the performance of the method on a large dataset, we used the GKC to integrally analyze the data from the RTCGD. This resulted in the discovery of CISs that are significant across the screens according to a consistent definition, have a low probability of being false detections, and can be analyzed in the scale space. As a consequence, 53% of the CISs previously published in the RTCGD did not reach significance in the combined dataset. Among the discovered CISs are eight novel CISs, of which six could have only been found when we integrally analyzed the data. Three of those might be attributed to the background bias, but this is based on too little evidence. For these novel CISs, the putative targets have been provided.</p><p>The KC framework is flexible enough to incorporate a background bias correction. Currently, data to base the background model on is lacking. For instance, the effect of <italic>active</italic> genes being favored integration targets cannot be incorporated without the data from experiments assessing which genes are active during integration. Mining data from infected cells that did not yet show proliferative selection, independent from the tumor data, and using these in the background bias correction will circumvent these problems. Still, making some assumptions about the background bias model resulted in the rejection of ten csCISs, but verification whether only true hot spots were corrected should be conducted.</p><p>As an additional benefit, the KC framework excels in visualizing the results, allowing the biologist to inspect the smoothed insertion estimate around interesting loci in the genome. Plotting the CISs in the scale space by means of scale space diagrams yield a valuable visualization tool for the biologist, showing the lifespan of CISs across a range of values of the scale parameter. This enabled the detection of screen-specific biases toward small-scale CISs. Together with the insertion locus relative to the neighboring genes, this provides useful information in determining the target of the insertional mutations.</p><p>Recently, some attention was given to multi-experiment analysis in the detection of significant copy number aberrations across experiments in array-CGH data (STAC algorithm from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b020">20</xref>]). The STAC algorithm is designed for data containing aberrations (either deletions or amplifications) obtained by thresholding the copy number measurements. Next, it detects regions with overlap between stretches of aberrations across different samples. Although this makes it unsuitable to apply to, for instance, insertion data (since insertions only rarely exactly overlap between samples), the KC framework may be applied to copy number data. For this purpose the kernel will need to be tailored to the data type. Investigating the rules that govern the choice of the kernel function for different data types will thus further increase the usability of the KC framework as a multi-experiment analysis tool. To this end, the use of more advanced nonparametric density estimators may be investigated.

Smoothing the observed insertions in a region around the position of insertion models two important phenomena. First, it models the fact that observing an insertion also contains information about its direct neighborhood. Because there is a limited number of observed insertion positions (data sparseness), it is important to exploit this information. Second, the distance across which insertions can act on a specific target gene is not fixed. There may exist multiple regions of varying widths within or around a gene for which an insertional mutation alters the function of the gene. By smoothing the observed insertions, the joint effect of the insertions on the target gene is incorporated in the model.

Since we are estimating the <italic>number</italic> of insertions, rather than a density, we choose to normalize the kernel function such that: <italic>K</italic>(0) = 1, rather than the more common normalization: <inline-formula id="pcbi-0020166-ex002"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020166.ex002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>

Furthermore, in this study, we assume that there is no apparent bias to either the left or the right side of the observed insertion. This constrains the possible kernel functions to symmetrical functions.
				</p><p>Nondescending kernels that have sharp flanks (e.g., rectangular kernels), can only result in discrete (or even integer) estimations of the number of insertions. In this study we show that, although the error is controlled to be below the <italic>α</italic>-level, non-integer estimations of the number of insertions allow a less conservative and more unbiased control of the error across different scales. Nondiscrete estimations of the number of insertions can be obtained by using a descending kernel function (e.g., Gaussian, triangular kernels) that has its maximum likelihood at the observed insertion.

In the KC framework, the correction of the null-hypothesis is achieved by replacing the permutation of the insertion data with a simulation process that incorporates the background insertion distribution. Analogous to recent literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020166-b016">16</xref>], we collected the 5′ end of the 27,602 genes in the Ensembl database as a model of the TSS (Genebuild: March 2005, Assembly: NCBI m34). We used a Gaussian density estimation with a kernel width of 10 k bp (which is equivalent to Gaussian distributions with a standard deviation of ± 5 k bp around the 5′ end of the genes).</p><p>The simulation follows the steps outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g010">Figure 10</xref>. First (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g010">Figure 10</xref>A), a density estimate of the TSS (with kernel width <italic>h</italic><sub>bg</sub>) is computed. Second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g010">Figure 10</xref>B), the simulated background data is acquired by generating a realization of the insertions according to the density estimate from step A. Third (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g010">Figure 10</xref>C), the GKC method is applied to this realization. Now, steps A and B are repeated to yield a distribution of insertion density estimates that follow the background for every location in the genome. Given this distribution of background estimates, the threshold as a function of the genome position can be obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020166-g010">Figure 10</xref>D). For clear hot spots, this threshold will be rather high, ensuring that, in the real data, a very high peak is needed before significance is reached.

For each experiment, 500 artificial datasets were generated to simulate the effect of having different insertion distributions in the background and within the CIS.

To analyze this behavior, the average number of csFPs is computed, which counts an FP at a locus only once even if it occurred across multiple scales.</p><p>The average number of TPs and FPs are computed by taking the mean across the 500 simulations.
