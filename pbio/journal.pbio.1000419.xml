<p>It is widely assumed that active RNA polymerases track along their templates to produce a transcript. We test this using chromosome conformation capture and human genes switched on rapidly and synchronously by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα); one is 221 kbp <italic>SAMD4A</italic>, which a polymerase takes more than 1 h to transcribe. Ten minutes after stimulation, the <italic>SAMD4A</italic> promoter comes together with other TNFα-responsive promoters. Subsequently, these contacts are lost as new downstream ones appear; contacts are invariably between sequences being transcribed. Super-resolution microscopy confirms that nascent transcripts (detected by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization) co-localize at relevant times. Results are consistent with an alternative view of transcription: polymerases fixed in factories reel in their respective templates, so different parts of the templates transiently lie together.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>We were all taught that an RNA polymerase becomes active by diffusing to a promoter, initiating transcription, and then tracking like a locomotive down the DNA template. We test this using tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) to switch on transcription of two human genes which lie far apart on the genetic map and then measure how close the two are in 3D nuclear space. If what we were taught were true, there is no reason to expect the two genes to lie together. What we find—using two different techniques (cutting/ligating nearby sequences, and super-resolution microscopy)—is that the two genes are initially apart; then the parts of the genes being transcribed at a particular moment transiently come into close proximity. Our results are consistent with a model in which genes diffuse to a cluster of polymerases—a transcription factory—with transcripts being made as immobile polymerases reel in their respective templates. The DNA moves, not the polymerase.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is widely assumed that an RNA polymerase transcribes by diffusing to a promoter, binding, and then tracking down the template as it makes its transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Alberts1">[1]</xref>. Accumulating evidence, however, is consistent with an alternative: a promoter diffuses to a transcription factory where it binds to a transiently immobilized polymerase, which then reels in its template as it extrudes a transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Jackson1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Sutherland1">[6]</xref>. Here, we address the question: Are transcribing enzymes mobile or immobile?</p>
<p>Our strategy involves switching on transcription of two genes rapidly and synchronously using tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). This cytokine orchestrates the inflammatory response in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by signalling through nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) to activate a sub-set of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Hoffmann1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Bradley1">[8]</xref>. <italic>SAMD4A</italic>—a 221 kbp-long gene that encodes a regulator of this pathway—is amongst the first few to respond. Microarray analysis reveals that a synchronous wave of transcription initiates within 15 min, before sweeping down the gene (at ∼3 kbp/min) to reach the terminus ∼70 min later (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s001">Figure S1</xref>); no transcripts from the non-coding strand are detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Wada1">[9]</xref>. RNA FISH using intronic probes confirms that almost half the cells in the population respond; essentially no nascent RNA can be detected prior to stimulation, no transcription occurs from the antisense strand, and probes targeting successive introns only yield signal as the wave passes by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Wada1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>TNFAIP2</italic>—a short 11 kbp gene that lies ∼50 Mbp away from <italic>SAMD4A</italic> on chromosome 14—encodes another regulator. It is switched on as rapidly and then repeatedly transcribed over the next 90 min. We use it as an external reference point (or “anchor”) and analyze the contacts it makes with different parts of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> using chromosome conformation capture (3C)—a powerful tool for detecting proximity of two DNA sequences in 3D nuclear space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Miele1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Gndr1">[12]</xref>. If the conventional model for transcription applies, we would not expect the anchor to lie close to any part of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> either before or after adding TNFα, as it lies so far away on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). Even if polymerases on the two genes happened to lie together (for whatever reason), tracking of one down the long gene should increase the distance between transcribed parts of the two genes. But if both genes were transcribed by polymerases transiently immobilized in one factory, the short gene—which would repeatedly attach to (and detach from) the factory as it initiates (and terminates)—should always lie close to just the part of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> being transcribed at that particular moment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Thus, as the polymerase reels in <italic>SAMD4A</italic>, introns 1, 2, 3, etc. should successively be brought into the factory to lie transiently next to the anchor. Results using <italic>TNFAIP2</italic> (and other anchors) are impossible to reconcile with the widely held assumption that polymerases track; rather they are consistent with active polymerases being immobilized in factories.</p>

<title>Distinguishing between tracking and fixed RNA polymerases.</title>
<p>Before adding TNFα, both the long and short gene are not transcribed. Assuming they lie far apart on the same chromosome, they are unlikely to yield detectable 3C products. Ten min after adding TNFα, RNA polymerases (ovals) initiate on both genes. If active polymerases track, it remains unlikely that any part of the two genes will contact each other. However, if the two genes diffuse to one factory (sphere) and are then transcribed by transiently immobilized polymerases, the two promoters will lie close together. After 30 min, the pioneering polymerase on the short gene has terminated and been replaced by others that continuously transcribe it, while the pioneering polymerase on the long gene has only transcribed one-third of the gene. If polymerases track, the two genes are still unlikely to be together. But if polymerases are immobilized in a factory, the parts of the two genes currently being transcribed will lie together and yield a 3C product. After 85 min, the pioneering polymerase reaches the terminus of the long gene. If polymerases track, the two genes will still be apart; if immobilized, the terminus should now contact the short gene.</p>

<title>Some Interacting Partners of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> and Their Transcriptional Activation</title>
<p>As our strategy requires one gene to be used as an anchor, we applied 3C and a variant of “associated chromosome trap” (ACT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Ling1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Wrtele1">[14]</xref> to search for genes that interacted with <italic>SAMD4A</italic>. A number were found, and we chose four that were detected in independent experiments and which were relatively short (&lt;60 kbp): <italic>TNFAIP2</italic>, <italic>GCH1</italic>, <italic>PTRF</italic>, and <italic>SLC6A5</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>We initially verified that all five genes responded to TNFα by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). No intronic RNA (or only low levels in the case of <italic>PTRF</italic>) copied from the five genes was detected before induction, but higher levels were seen within 10 min of TNFα treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s003">S3F</xref>). Intronic RNA copied from further downstream in <italic>SAMD4A</italic> then appeared consistent with pioneering polymerases transcribing its 221 kbp at ∼3 kbp/min. Thus, RNA copied immediately downstream of the transcription start site (<italic>tss</italic>) appeared after 10 min, from ∼34 kbp into intron 1 after 30 min, from intron 3 after 60 min, and from the terminus after 85 min. In contrast, signal from each end of <italic>TNFAIP2</italic> is seen by 10 min. This 11 kbp gene is so short, and synchrony sufficiently poor, that some polymerases in the population are initiating as others are terminating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>GCH1</italic> and <italic>SLC6A5</italic>—both genes of ∼60 kbp—present intermediate patterns; pioneering polymerases reach termini after ∼30 min, before a second (reasonably synchronous) transcription cycle begins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s003">S3F</xref>). Such cycling has now been seen on various mammalian genes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Degenhardt1">[15]</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed an enrichment of RNA polymerase II bound to the <italic>tss</italic> of all five genes within 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s003">S3G</xref>). It also showed that NF-κB bound to promoters within 10 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s004">Figure S4</xref>), as might be expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Ashall1">[16]</xref>. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) also shows that intronic RNA copied from the relevant parts of the genes is present at the appropriate times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Therefore, results obtained with four independent methods (i.e., microarrays, RT-PCR, ChIP, RNA FISH) are in agreement and provide data on when polymerizing complexes are actively transcribing the sequences to be analyzed. These data are summarized in cartoons that accompany the results.</p>

<title>Polymerases initiate rapidly and synchronously on responding genes and elongate at expected rates.</title>
<p>(A) Nascent RNA detected using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Total RNA was isolated from HUVECs 0–85 min after adding TNFα, treated with DNase, and intronic RNA detected. No nascent RNA copied from <italic>SAMD4A</italic>, <italic>TNFAIP2</italic>, or <italic>SLC6A5</italic> is detected at 0 min. For 221 kbp <italic>SAMD4A</italic>, nascent RNA appears at the <italic>tss</italic> after 10 min. As polymerases continue to initiate thereafter (albeit at declining rates), signal is seen at the <italic>tss</italic> between 15 and 85 min; however, many of these polymerases abort within ∼10 kbp of the <italic>tss</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s001">Figure S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Wada1">[9]</xref>). Nascent RNA from region <italic>d</italic> of intron 1 (34 kbp into the gene) is seen only after 30 min. Pioneering polymerases reach this region after 30 min and the slowest by 60 min; after 85 min all have passed by. Similarly, pioneering polymerases only reach introns 3 and 11 after 60 and 85 min, respectively. <italic>TNFAIP2</italic> is 11 kbp, and polymerases in the population can generate intronic RNA from both 5′ and 3′ ends within 10 min (it is then transcribed throughout the 85 min). <italic>SLC6A5</italic>—a 56 kbp gene—yields an intermediate pattern. No signal is again seen at 0 min, and pioneering polymerases generate maximal levels of intronic RNA at the <italic>tss</italic> after 10 min, and the 3′ end after 30 min; then, the cycle repeats between 60 and 85 min. Controls show levels of intronic RNA from two non-responsive, active genes (<italic>GAPDH</italic> and <italic>RCOR1</italic>), and that amplimers do not result from contaminating genomic DNA (using <italic>GAPDH</italic> probes, but replacing RT by <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase). Numbers under each panel (orange) correspond to the relative intensity of bands, corrected for background, and normalized to <italic>GAPDH</italic> levels. (B) Bound RNA polymerase II detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Enrichments relative to input DNA (normalised to <italic>GAPDH</italic> levels) are shown 0 and 10 min after stimulation (light and dark grey bars, respectively). Almost no polymerase is bound to any part of <italic>SAMD4A</italic>, <italic>TNFAIP2</italic>, or <italic>SLC6A5</italic> at 0 min. The <italic>tss</italic> of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> is occupied by polymerases within 10 min of induction; however, levels further 3′ remain low as pioneering polymerases have not yet reached these regions. For <italic>TNFAIP2</italic>, some polymerases bind after 10 min, while others have reached the <italic>3′ end</italic> as the gene is so short. For <italic>SLC6A5</italic>, polymerases bind by 10 min to the <italic>tss</italic> but have not yet reached the 3′ end. <italic>RCOR1</italic> was analyzed as it was used as a control in RNA FISH experiments. Error bars show standard deviations from two independent experiments. **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, Student's <italic>t</italic> test compared to 0 min.</p>

<title>Changing Contacts Between Two TNFα-Responsive Genes on Chromosome 14</title>
<p>Contacts between selected regions of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP2</italic> were monitored by 3C, where the presence of a band after 34 PCR cycles reflects a high contact frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Essentially no contacts are seen between the <italic>tss</italic> of <italic>TNFAIP2</italic> (the anchor) and regions ∼25 kbp upstream or downstream of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> (<italic>a</italic>, <italic>h</italic>) at any time, or between the anchor and any region of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> (<italic>b</italic>–<italic>g</italic>) at 0 min—when no polymerases are engaged on either gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, cartoon). By 10 min (when polymerases are first found on both genes; cartoon), contacts appear between the anchor and <italic>SAMD4A</italic> regions <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Such contacts are soon lost, as new ones appear further 3′ on <italic>SAMD4A</italic>; they seem to steadily “slide” down the long gene. Thus, by 30 min, contacts are with regions <italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic>, by 60 min with region <italic>e</italic>, and by 85 min with regions <italic>e</italic>, <italic>f</italic>, and <italic>g</italic>. (The presence of more than one contact at certain times is consistent with imperfect synchrony amongst the ∼10<sup>6</sup> cells assayed.) Treatment with DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-<italic>β</italic>-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole)—a reagent that inhibits transcription and releases polymerases from the template (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s006">Figure S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Kimura1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Chapman1">[18]</xref>)—reduces contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <italic>grey box</italic>). Similar changing contacts were seen using (i) real-time PCR to quantify selected interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s007">Figure S7</xref>), (ii) the <italic>3′ end</italic> of <italic>TNFAIP2</italic> as an anchor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g003">Figure 3C, D</xref>; the gene is short enough for polymerases to be found at the same times on promoter and terminus in different cells in the population), and (iii) if <italic>Hind</italic>III replaced <italic>Sac</italic>I as the restriction enzyme used for 3C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s008">Figure S8A, B</xref>). In every case, contacts are only seen at times when active polymerases are transcribing contacting sequences. Note that several genes lying within 50 Mbp on either side of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> do not interact with it (e.g., responsive <italic>NFKBIA</italic>, <italic>SAV1</italic>, <italic>IRF9</italic>, <italic>GPR68</italic>, and <italic>PAPLN</italic>; non-responsive <italic>GMFB</italic>, <italic>YY1</italic>, <italic>HIF1A</italic>, and <italic>C14orf2</italic>; and constitutive <italic>RCOR1</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). As a whole, these results are inconsistent with the model involving tracking polymerases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>left</italic>) but are simply explained if the two contacting templates are transiently tethered to polymerases fixed in one factory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>right</italic>).</p>

<title>Changing Contacts Between TNFα-Responsive Genes on Different Chromosomes</title>
<p><italic>PTRF</italic> is a 21 kbp gene that lies on a different chromosome (i.e., 17) from <italic>SAMD4A</italic> (on 14). The pattern of interactions between the two is much the same as those seen between <italic>SAMD4A</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s003">Figure S3D, E</xref>), which is again consistent with the model involving fixed polymerases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>right</italic>).</p>
<p>A more complex pattern of changing contacts is seen between <italic>SAMD4A</italic> and a 60 kbp gene on chromosome 11, <italic>SLC6A5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figure 4</xref>); this pattern suggests that polymerases must be present on both contacting sequences. Thus, as before, no contacts are seen between the <italic>tss</italic> of <italic>SLC6A5</italic> (the anchor) and regions upstream or downstream of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> (<italic>a</italic>, <italic>h</italic>) at any time, or between the anchor and any region of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> at 0 min—when no polymerases are engaged on either gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, cartoon). Again as before, contacts appear between the anchor and <italic>SAMD4A</italic> region <italic>c</italic> (which includes the <italic>tss</italic> and the beginning of intron 1) after 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), when polymerases are first found on both. But after 30 min (when contacts with region <italic>d</italic> were seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), essentially no contacts are found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This is consistent with pioneering polymerases leaving the <italic>tss</italic> of the anchor so that they are now transcribing the <italic>3′ end</italic> of this ∼60 kbp gene, as data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g002">Figure 2</xref> indicate. By 60 min (when a second polymerase is just initiating on the <italic>tss</italic> of <italic>SLC6A5</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g002">Figure 2</xref>), we see a strong (second) contact with the region on <italic>SAMD4A</italic> that its pioneering polymerase is now transcribing (i.e., <italic>e</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This interaction is DRB-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>grey box</italic>), and so depends on continuing transcription. No prominent interactions are seen at 85 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) even though we know <italic>SAMD4A</italic> is still being transcribed. Moreover, the contact seen with region <italic>f</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g002">Figure 3B</xref> is missing, presumably because the second polymerase on <italic>SLC6A5</italic> has left the <italic>tss</italic> used as the anchor and is now transcribing the 3′ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g002">Figure 2</xref>). An almost identical pattern with analogous missing contacts is seen if <italic>Hind</italic>III replaces <italic>Sac</italic>I during preparation of the 3C template (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s008">Figure S8A, C</xref>).</p>

<title>Contacts between two TNFα-responding genes on different chromosomes (14 and 11) follow engaged polymerases.</title>
<p>(A) Positions of 3C primers and the interactions screened (grey and dotted black lines). (B) Contacts between the <italic>tss</italic> of <italic>SLC6A5</italic> (the anchor) and different parts of <italic>SAMD4A</italic>. Contacts/bands are only detected when polymerases are on both contacting partners. (C) Contacts between the <italic>3′ end</italic> of <italic>SLC6A5</italic> (the anchor) and different parts of <italic>SAMD4A</italic>. As in (B), two strong bands are seen, but they are in different positions. We suggest this is because it takes a polymerase 20–30 min to reach the <italic>3′ end</italic> of <italic>SLC6A5</italic> now used as an anchor; then, contacts/bands are again only detected when polymerases are on both contacting partners. Panels (B) and (C) share the same pair of loading and intra-<italic>GAPDH</italic> controls (excluding ± DRB), so the same image is shown in both panels.</p>

<p>If the above explanation is correct, with contacts only being seen if active polymerases are present on both contacting partners, then use of the 3′ end of <italic>SLC6A5</italic> as an anchor should change the pattern as follows. The two bands seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figure 4B</xref> should disappear (as polymerases at the relevant times are on the <italic>tss</italic> and not the <italic>3′ end</italic> now used as the anchor), while the two “missing” bands should reappear (as polymerases have now reached the <italic>3′ end</italic>); they do. For example, comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figure 4B and C</xref> shows that the first missing band/contact (with <italic>d</italic> at 30 min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) reappears in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, as does the second (with <italic>f</italic> at 85 min). Bands/contacts are also sensitive to DRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">Figures 4B,C</xref>, <italic>grey boxes</italic>).</p>
<p>This interpretation is reinforced by an analysis involving 5′ and 3′ anchors on another gene (of similar length as <italic>SLC6A5</italic>) that lie on the same chromosome as <italic>SAMD4A</italic>. Thus, <italic>GCH1</italic> is ∼0.8 Mbp away from <italic>SAMD4A</italic> and responds as rapidly to TNFα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s003">Figure S3F, G</xref>). When its 5′ and 3′ ends are used as anchors, a complex set of changing contacts (and missing bands) is again seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s003">Figure S3A–C</xref>).</p>
<p>We also confirmed that the <italic>tss</italic> of <italic>GCH1</italic> lay next to the <italic>tss</italic> of <italic>TNFAIP2</italic> at 10 min but not at 0 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). This is consistent with responding promoters coming together to the same factory when active. As all other contacts analyzed involve <italic>SAMD4A</italic>, these results also indicate that such reorganization is not peculiar to one long gene.</p>

<title>Nascent RNAs Also Colocalize at the Appropriate Times</title>
<p>If responding regions only lie together when transcribed, their nascent transcripts should also only be together at the appropriate times. To test this we used RNA FISH with pairs of probes each able to detect an intron within a single nascent transcript copied RNA transcript at its transcription site; colocalization of nascent transcripts copied from the two different genes then yields a yellow focus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Wada1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Femino1">[19]</xref>.

<title>Colocalization of intronic RNA demonstrated by RNA FISH.</title>
<p>HUVECs were treated with TNFα for 10, 30, or 60 min, and nascent RNAs copied from test and control pairs of genes detected by RNA FISH. (A–C) Colocalization of nascent RNAs encoded by genes on the same chromosome. The two probes target RNA copied from intron 2 of <italic>TNFAIP2</italic> (red) and intronic region <italic>c</italic>, or <italic>d</italic>, or <italic>e/f</italic> of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> (green); representative images of DAPI-stained nuclei are shown (insets provide magnifications of foci indicated). Red and green foci mark (non-colocalizing) nascent transcripts copied from one (or both) allele, and yellow foci colocalizing ones; <italic>n</italic> gives the number of alleles active in all cells analyzed that have ≥1 green focus plus ≥1 red focus. Numbers in yellow give the fraction of colocalizing red and green foci (where &gt;75% pixels in one focus share red and green signal) expressed as a percentage of <italic>n</italic>; values were significantly different from those seen in (D) with a control gene (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>, Fischer's exact test, one-tailed). The cartoon illustrates the targets of red and green probes (triangles), and the positions of polymerases; red lines between targets indicate that yellow foci were detected (grey lines: no yellow foci detected—see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). (D) Yellow foci were never seen with probes targeting intronic RNA copied from <italic>SAMD4A</italic> and a (non-responsive) control gene (<italic>RCOR1</italic>) that lies between <italic>SAMD4A</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP2</italic>. (E–F) Colocalization of nascent RNAs encoded by genes on different chromosomes. The two probes target RNA copied from intronic region <italic>d</italic> of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> (green) and either intron 1 or 10 of <italic>SLC6A5</italic> (red); only the latter yields yellow foci (the number of yellow foci was significantly different from that seen in (G) with a control gene; <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>, Fischer's exact test, one-tailed). (G) Yellow foci were never seen with probes targeting intronic RNA copied from <italic>SAMD4A</italic> and a (non-responsive) control gene (<italic>EDN1</italic>) that lies on a different chromosome from <italic>SAMD4A</italic>. Bar: 5 µm. (H) Sub-diffraction localization of peaks of red and green signal within yellow foci. Gaussian curves were fitted to the intensities of the red and green signals, and distances between peaks determined with a precision of 15 nm (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details). Dark grey bars illustrate distances obtained from 34 yellow foci seen in images like those in (B) and (F); the mean distance is 62 nm. Light grey bars illustrate similar distances obtained from 10 yellow foci like that in (F). The model shows a red and green point randomly distributed in a 35 nm shell (grey) around an 87 nm diameter factory (orange sphere); simulations using this model yield the distribution indicated (orange line).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We tested the two models illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g001">Figure 1</xref> to address one fundamental assumption of modern molecular biology, namely that a transcribing polymerase tracks along its template as it makes its transcript. <italic>SAMD4A</italic> has a unique set of properties that make it particularly useful for this analysis; it can be switched on rapidly and synchronously by TNFα (with approximately half the cells in the population responding), its length provides sufficient temporal and spatial resolution (it takes ∼70 min to transcribe, and contains many restriction sites that facilitate the use of 3C to discriminate between contacts produced by different parts of the gene), and neither its sense or anti-sense strands encode other transcription units that might complicate analysis. 3C reveals that just the parts of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> being transcribed at a particular moment lie close to just the parts of three other genes being transcribed at that moment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s003">S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s008">S8</xref>). These inter-genic contacts occur infrequently, as expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Osborne1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Dhar1">[26]</xref>. RNA FISH confirmed that the relevant nascent RNAs lie together at the appropriate times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s005">S5</xref>), while “super-resolution” microscopy (allowing measurements below the diffraction limit) showed that the distance between the two transcripts is consistent with them lying within 35 nm of the surface of an 87 nm sphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Such results are difficult—if not impossible—to explain if polymerases track. Rather, they are consistent with an alternative where two responding genes diffuse to an 87 nm factory to be transcribed by immobilized enzymes. Then, as the two genes are reeled in, only parts being transcribed at a given moment will lie transiently together <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Cook2">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>These results beg many questions. For example, we were able to detect interacting sequences at a reasonable frequency simply by assuming the existence of factories dedicated to transcribing genes that respond rapidly to TNFα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000419.s009">S9</xref>). If such specialized factories exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Pombo1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Xu1">[28]</xref>, how many might there be in a nucleus, and how many are accessible to a gene like <italic>SAMD4A</italic>? Fortunately, these questions will soon be answered, as techniques for analyzing all contacts made by any gene in a nucleus have been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-LiebermanAiden1">[29]</xref>. We also note that our results are consistent with others obtained from a recent genome-wide study; after stimulating human cells with estrogen and mapping contacts made by bound estrogen receptor-α (using ChIP, 3C, and “deep” sequencing), contacting partners were often associated with bound RNA polymerase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000419-Fullwood1">[30]</xref>.</p>

A wave of signal initiates at the 5′ end within 15 min (start), and then travels down the gene to terminate after 75–90 min (end).

Note also that probes covering the first thousands of nucleotides from the <italic>tss</italic> yield signal between 15–180 min, and polymerases only seem to escape downstream in a limited interval (i.e., after 15–30 min) to initiate a first, fairly synchronous wave.

Results support the idea that, at 0 min, <italic>SAMD4A</italic> makes few contacts. After 10 min, region <italic>c</italic> contacts many more genes, including partners (highlighted) we study (<italic>TNFAIP2</italic>, <italic>GCH1</italic>, <italic>SLC6A5</italic>, <italic>PTRF</italic>); no such contacts are seen with region <italic>d</italic> (the wave of transcription has not yet reached this region). After 30 min, region <italic>d</italic> now contacts <italic>TNFAIP2</italic> and <italic>SLC6A5</italic> (in accord with 3C data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">4</xref>; note a contact between <italic>SAMD4A</italic> and the <italic>tss</italic> of <italic>SLC6A5</italic> is detected at 10 min, and one with the 3′ end of <italic>SLC6A5</italic> at 30 min).

(B) Criteria used to assess overlap of red and green foci. The image on the left provides a colocalizing control: a 110 nm bead that fluoresces in both red and green channels to give yellow in this merged image. The images in the middle and on the right are of foci collected as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g005">Figure 5F</xref> using probes targeting <italic>SAMD4A</italic> region <italic>d</italic> (green) and <italic>SLC6A5</italic> intron 5 (red) 30 min after induction. A focus is defined as &gt;4 contiguous (90 nm) pixels that contain signal above a threshold (defined as the average intensity of at least 50 pixels in a line-scan across the focus); typically, foci were 12±4 pixels in size and were classified as red or green (no signal of the other colour above threshold in &gt;75% pixels) or yellow (signal above threshold of both colours in ≥75% pixels). The middle image is therefore scored as one red and one green focus even though the two partially overlap; such partially overlapping foci were rare (constituting &lt;3% of all foci). The image on the right is scored as a yellow focus (as &gt;75% pixels in the focus contain both green and red signals above the threshold). Bar: 200 nm. (C) Summary of RNA FISH results. HUVECs were treated with TNFα for 10–60 min, RNA FISH performed with probe pairs detecting nascent RNA copied from the regions indicated, and numbers of cells containing red, green, and yellow foci determined (from images like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g005">Figure 5A–G</xref>). In each case, one probe (green) targets RNA copied from regions <italic>c</italic>, <italic>d</italic>, or <italic>e/f</italic> of <italic>SAMD4A</italic>, while a second (red) targets intronic RNA from either a control gene that yields no 3C product with <italic>SAMD4A</italic> (i.e., <italic>RCOR1</italic>, <italic>EDN1</italic>) or a test gene (i.e., <italic>TNFAIP2</italic>, <italic>SLC6A5</italic>) that does. Values represent numbers of cells (<italic>n</italic>) with the patterns indicated (percentages in brackets); numbers of yellow foci are highlighted. A probe targeting the anti-sense strand of <italic>SAMD4A</italic> region <italic>d</italic>, and pretreatment of cells with RNase A yields no signal (not shown). Before induction, probes targeting <italic>TNFAIP2</italic>, <italic>SLC6A5</italic> introns 1 and 10, and <italic>SAMD4A</italic> regions <italic>d</italic> and <italic>e/f</italic> yield no foci; <italic>SAMD4A</italic> probe <italic>c</italic> yields foci in &lt;3% cells. Results confirm polymerase positionings and 3C results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g002">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g003"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000419-g004">4</xref>). For example, at 10 min essentially no cells with green foci marking <italic>SAMD4A</italic> region <italic>d</italic> are seen, as this region is not yet transcribed; however, a significant number are seen after 30 min when it is. Similarly, many red foci marking <italic>SLC6A5</italic> intron 10 are seen after 30 min, but not after 10 min (and the opposite applies to foci marking <italic>SLC6A5</italic> intron 1). However, red foci are seen at both times with the short gene, <italic>TNFAIP2</italic>. No yellow foci were seen at any time with probe pairs targeting transcripts copied from region <italic>d</italic> and a control gene (<italic>RCOR1</italic>, <italic>EDN1</italic>). In contrast, probe pairs targeting <italic>SAMD4A</italic> and the test genes did yield yellow foci at times when polymerases were transcribing the appropriate regions (cartoons). These differences in the numbers of yellow foci are small but statistically significant. Consider, for example, the <italic>SAMD4A d</italic>:<italic>RCOR1</italic> pair at 30 min. In cells with ≥1 green plus ≥1 red focus (values within the orange box), there were 224 active alleles, but none overlapped to give a yellow focus. But with the <italic>SAMD4A d</italic>:<italic>TNFAIP2</italic> pair, 22 out of the 278 active alleles (i.e., 8%) overlapped to give a yellow focus. This difference is significant (<italic>p</italic> = 3.3×10<sup>−6</sup>; Fisher's exact test, one-tailed). Similarly, for the <italic>SAMD4A d</italic>:<italic>EDN1</italic> pair at 30 min, none of the 265 active alleles overlapped. However, in the <italic>SAMD4A d</italic>:<italic>SLC6A5</italic>-intron-10 pair, 14 of the 189 active alleles (i.e., 7%) overlapped. The difference between the two pairs was again significant (<italic>p</italic> = 6×10<sup>−6</sup>; Fisher's exact test, one-tailed).</p>
