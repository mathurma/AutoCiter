        <p>The short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. This simulation study identifies arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the rapid-delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>Kr</sub>)-linked SQT1 variant of the SQTS. Markov chain (MC) models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models in reproducing experimental data regarding effects of the N588K mutation on <italic>KCNH2</italic>-encoded hERG. These ionic channel models were then incorporated into human ventricular action potential (AP) models and into 1D and 2D idealised and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations and into a 3D anatomical model. In single cell models, the N588K mutation abbreviated ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD<sub>90</sub>) and decreased the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity (δV) during APs. This resulted in decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD<sub>90</sub> and of the effective refractory period (ERP): effects that are anticipated to be anti-arrhythmic rather than pro-arrhythmic. However, with consideration of transmural heterogeneity of I<sub>Kr</sub> density in the <italic>intact</italic> tissue model based on the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov ventricular model, not only did the N588K mutation lead to QT-shortening and increases in T-wave amplitude, but δV was found to be augmented in some local regions of ventricle tissue, resulting in increased tissue vulnerability for uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to formation of re-entrant excitation waves. In 2D and 3D tissue models, the N588K mutation facilitated and maintained re-entrant excitation waves due to the reduced substrate size necessary for sustaining re-entry. Thus, in SQT1 the N588K-hERG mutation facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular re-entry, increasing the lifespan of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D tissue.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Sudden cardiac death may arise in individuals with diseased heart tissue, or in apparently healthy subjects who suffer from genetic defects in ‘ion channel’ proteins, which increase cardiac arrhythmia risk and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. One rare, though serious, genetic condition is the ‘short QT syndrome’ (SQTS). Although it is now known that the <italic>KCNH2</italic>-encoded N588K-hERG mutation is associated with the main (SQT1) variant of the SQTS, the mechanisms by which ventricular arrhythmia is initiated and sustained are still unclear due to lack of genotypically accurate experimental models. In this study, we used sophisticated multi-scale computer models of human ventricles in order to investigate the pro-arrhythmic effects of the N588K hERG mutation. It was found that the mutation accelerated the ventricular repolarization process, produced augmented electrical heterogeneity in some local regions of the tissue, leading to increased risk of arrhythmia genesis. It was also found that accelerated ventricular repolarization reduced the substrate size of the tissue required to sustain re-entrant circuits in both two and three dimensions. This study provides new mechanistic insight into understanding of how changes to hERG channel function in SQT1 lead to exacerbated ventricular arrhythmia risk in this inherited arrhythmia syndrome.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Impaired cardiac ion channel function can lead to arrhythmias and, thereby, to significant morbidity and mortality. Genetic repolarization disorders include the ‘long’ and ‘short’ QT syndromes in which ventricular repolarization is, respectively, prolonged or accelerated, thereby increasing susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Maury1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Modell1">[2]</xref>. The short QT syndrome (SQTS) was first recognized as a distinct clinical syndrome in 2000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Gussak1">[3]</xref>. It is characterised by markedly shortened QT intervals, poor rate adaptation of the QT interval, shortened ventricular and atrial refractory periods, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and by an increased incidence of sudden death in affected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Maury1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Patel1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Schimpf1">[5]</xref>. Candidate gene screening has revealed three forms of potassium channel linked SQTS associated with distinct mutations to <italic>KCNH2 (hERG), KCNQ1(KvLQT1)</italic> and <italic>KCNJ2</italic> encoded-potassium channel subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Bellocq1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Priori1">[10]</xref>. The first identified SQT1 variant is caused by base changes that lead to a common amino-acid substitution (asparagine588lysine; N588K) in the external S5-Pore linker of the hERG potassium channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Brugada1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Hong1">[8]</xref>. This mutation leads to a marked right-ward voltage shift in hERG channel inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Cordeiro1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate1">[12]</xref>, reflected in action potential (AP) voltage-clamp experiments by a markedly increased hERG current (I<sub>hERG</sub>) during both ventricular and atrial AP repolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Brugada1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Cordeiro1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>As hERG underpins the rapid delayed rectifier channel current (I<sub>Kr</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Mitcheson1">[14]</xref>, the N588K ‘gain-of-function’ hERG mutation is anticipated to increase greatly the contribution of I<sub>Kr</sub> to cardiac repolarization in SQT1 patients, thereby accounting for QT interval abbreviation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Brugada1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Cordeiro1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>. Although this effect would be anticipated to shorten ventricular effective refractory period (ERP) and thereby to increase susceptibility to re-entrant arrhythmia, there is at present no genetically accurate animal model in which the basis of arrhythmogenesis in SQT can be explored. Data from experiments using the perfused canine left-ventricular wedge preparation treated with the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opener pinacidil or the I<sub>Kr</sub> activator PD-118057 suggest roles in the substrate for ventricular tachycardia with QT interval shortening for ERP abbreviation and heterogeneous abbreviation of APs across the ventricular wall (and thereby amplified dispersion of repolarization) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Antzelevitch1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Extramiana1">[16]</xref>. However, neither of these pharmacological interventions reproduces precisely the changes to I<sub>Kr</sub> caused by the N588K hERG SQT1 mutation. An alternative approach to determine the arrhythmogenic substrates in the SQTS is <italic>in silico</italic> reconstruction of activity in the absence and presence of SQT mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Priori1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Itoh1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang2">[20]</xref>. In the case of SQT1, the available simulation data regarding functional consequences of the SQT1 mutation are either incomplete or based on data obtained at ambient rather than physiological temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Priori1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Itoh1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Weiss1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang2">[20]</xref>. Moreover, no simulation study has yet demonstrated a viable <italic>tissue</italic> substrate for ventricular arrhythmia in SQT1. Accordingly, the present study was conducted in order: (i) to recapitulate the kinetic changes to I<sub>Kr</sub> in SQT1 based on available experimental data at physiological temperature by utilising and comparing Hodgkin-Huxley and Markov chain formulations; (ii) using human ventricular cell-based models to determine the functional consequences of incorporating the SQT1 mutation on AP repolarization and the QT interval; (iii) to explore the arrhythmogenic substrate in SQT1 by using “idealized” and “realistic” 2D tissue and 3D organ simulations. The results of our study provide a clear link between the kinetic changes to I<sub>hERG</sub>/I<sub>Kr</sub> in SQT1 and altered ventricular tissue electrophysiology that favours re-entrant arrhythmia in this form of the SQTS.</p>

        <p>We first tested the ability of the developed full Markov chain (f-MC) I<sub>Kr</sub> model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g001">Figure 1A</xref> for the gating scheme) to reproduce previously published experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref> on the voltage dependence of WT and N588K I<sub>hERG</sub> at physiological temperature. The voltage-clamp protocol used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g002">Figure 2Aii and 2Bii</xref>) was the same as that used experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate1">[12]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g002">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the profile of outward I<sub>Kr</sub>/I<sub>hERG</sub> under the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g002">Figure 2Ai</xref>) and SQT1 mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g002">Figure 2Bi</xref>) conditions, from which the corresponding I-V relationships were reconstructed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g002">Figure 2Aiii &amp; Biii</xref> respectively. For both WT and mutation conditions, the I-V relationships reconstructed from I<sub>Kr</sub> during simulated voltage-clamp matched those seen experimentally. Most significantly, the f-MC model recaptured the features of the mutation-induced defect of I<sub>Kr</sub> inactivation, which led to augmented I<sub>Kr</sub> current as has been observed experimentally for recombinant hERG channels at 37°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>.

        <p>We then examined the ability of the developed I<sub>Kr</sub> models to reproduce the dynamic properties of WT and N588K mutation I<sub>hERG</sub>/I<sub>Kr</sub> channels, by using simulated action potential (AP) voltage clamp, incorporating paired AP commands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the simulated normalised ‘instantaneous’ I-V relationship for current during the time course of AP clamp under WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g003">Figure 3Ai–Di</xref>) and the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g003">Figure 3Aii–Dii</xref>) conditions. It also shows the time-course of outward current “transients” elicited by a protocol comprised of paired AP commands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g003">Figure 3Aiii–Diii</xref>). Simulation data from the f-MC, r-MC and the H-H models were compared with published experimental ventricular AP clamp data obtained from CHO cells with expression of WT and N588K hERG channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>. During the time course of the AP, both the f-MC and r-MC I<sub>Kr</sub> models reproduced experimental instantaneous I-V data for the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g003">Figure 3Ai &amp; Bi</xref>) and mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g003">Figure 3Aii &amp; Bii</xref>) conditions, as well as the positive shift in the peak repolarizing current caused by the N588K mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref> (Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002313.s009">Text S1</xref>). However, the simulated I-V relation from the H-H I<sub>Kr</sub> formulations of the TNNP model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g003">Figure 3Ci–Cii</xref>) or the Luo-Rudy model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g003">Figure 3Di–Dii</xref>) did not closely match experimental data, for either the WT or mutation conditions (Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002313.s009">Text S1</xref>). Responses of hERG/I<sub>Kr</sub> to a protocol comprised of paired-AP stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref> are shown in the right panels. Each of the f-MC, r-MC and TNNP H-H models reproduced the response of hERG/I<sub>Kr</sub> channel to a premature stimulus as seen experimentally for both the WT and the mutation condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>, which reflects the interaction between recovery from inactivation and deactivation of I<sub>hERG</sub>/I<sub>Kr</sub> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Lu1">[21]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g003">Figure 3Aiii–Ciii</xref>) under both conditions. For the WT condition, the amplitude of I<sub>Kr</sub> increased with the increase of the inter-pulse interval, and reached a maximal amplitude at 30 ms before decreasing at greater time intervals. For the N588K condition, I<sub>Kr</sub> amplitude peaked 10 ms earlier, and was significantly greater at small intervals but decreased more extensively than WT between 30–70 ms of the inter-pulse interval. However, the response of the Luo-Rudy H-H model to paired-AP stimuli did not reproduce experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g003">Figure 3Diii</xref>). Considered collectively, the AP clamp simulation data suggested that the f-MC and the r-MC models recapitulated better the dynamic properties of WT and N588K I<sub>hERG</sub>/I<sub>Kr</sub> at 37°C than did the TNNP and Luo-Rudy H-H formulations tested in this study.</p>

        <p>The functional effects of the N588K mutation on ventricular APs were characterised by using modified TNNP models that incorporated the f-MC, r-MC and both H-H I<sub>Kr</sub> formulations (the original TNNP I<sub>Kr</sub> equations and the Luo-Rudy I<sub>Kr</sub> equations) for the WT and mutation conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows simulated APs (Ai), I<sub>Kr</sub> profile (Aii) and I<sub>Kr</sub> instantaneous I-V relationship (Aiii) of an EPI cell model with the f-MC I<sub>Kr</sub>.

        <p>Such APD abbreviation was attributable to both the I<sub>Kr</sub> amplitude increase and altered timing of the current, with peak I<sub>Kr</sub> occurring earlier during the AP plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g004">Figure 4Aii</xref>). Simulation results with the MIDDLE and ENDO cell models were similar in showing a marked APD reduction as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g004">Figure 4B &amp; 4C</xref>. Results for each of the f-MC, r-MC and H-H I<sub>Kr</sub> formulations in the EPI, MIDDLE and ENDO cell models are summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g004">Figure 4D–4F</xref>. This set of simulations with variant I<sub>Kr</sub> formulations in all cell models showed marked APD reduction associated with increased I<sub>Kr</sub> by the N588K mutation, which correlates well with previous studies in which a gain in I<sub>Kr</sub> due to N588K mutation produced AP shortening in the Luo-Rudy and the Priebe-Beuckelmann AP models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Itoh1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Weiss1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang2">[20]</xref>. The alteration to APD with the N588K mutation was non-uniform, with the largest reduction occurring for the MIDDLE cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Weiss1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang2">[20]</xref>. As a consequence, the APD<sub>90</sub> difference between ENDO-MIDDLE-EPI cells was attenuated by the mutation, leading to a decreased transmural dispersion of APD<sub>90</sub> when the three cell models were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Simulation results with the uses of f-MC, r-MC and H-H formulations all gave consistent results of attenuated APD<sub>90</sub> dispersion by the mutation when the three cell models were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
        <p>The N588K mutation flattened the APD restitution curves as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g005">Figure 5</xref>. For each of the three cell models, the four different I<sub>Kr</sub> formulations were adjusted to produce similar APD<sub>90</sub> restitution curves under the WT condition for EPI, MIDDLE and ENDO cells (data shown only for the f-MC formulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g005">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Incorporation of the N588K mutation decreased the measured APD<sub>90</sub>, causing a leftward shift to the APD restitution curve. The maximal slopes of the APD restitution curves for the Markov and TNNP HH formulations were also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggested an attenuation of rate-adaptation of ventricular APD, which is consistent with the poor rate-dependence of QT intervals in SQT patients. This was investigated further by plotting the steady-state APD-rate dependence for WT and N588K conditions (Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002313.s009">Text S1</xref> for the TNNP model with the f-MC I<sub>Kr</sub> formulation); the relationship was flattened and leftward shifted in the setting of SQT1. Among the four different I<sub>Kr</sub> formulations, the mutant f-MC and r-MC I<sub>Kr</sub> models produced significantly greater APD abbreviation than the H-H formulations of the Luo-Rudy and the TNNP I<sub>Kr</sub> models.</p>

        <title>Simulation of the ECG with WT and SQT1 mutant I<sub>Kr</sub></title>
        <p>Using a 1D-strand model of tissue across the ventricular wall a pseudo-ECG was computed for the WT and N588K mutation conditions at a stimulation rate of 1 Hz. The f-MC model was used for these and subsequent simulations. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g007">Figure 7A–D</xref>. In our initial simulations, the computed QT interval was shortened from 378 ms in the control condition to 240 ms as a consequence of the N588K mutation. The abbreviated QT interval in the simulations reproduces a key feature of the ECGs recorded from SQT1 patients – namely QT interval shortening. However, the model failed to reproduce another major feature of SQT ECG: a significant increase in the T-wave amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). To solve this discrepancy, it transpired to be necessary to incorporate a heterogeneous I<sub>Kr</sub> density in the 1D strand model. This is concordant with some available experimental data, as it has been observed that hERG mRNA expression is about 1.6 times more abundant in the EPI region than in the MIDDLE region from all three cell models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Szabo1">[24]</xref>, consistent with possible transmural heterogeneity of I<sub>Kr</sub> density. The original TNNP EPI, MIDDLE and ENDO models assume a uniform I<sub>Kr</sub> density. However, when EPI I<sub>Kr</sub> was set to be 1.5–1.7 times greater than that in the MIDDLE and EPI cells, the 1D strand model was then able to produce both QT interval abbreviation and an increased T-wave amplitude with the N588K mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g007">Figure 7F–7H</xref>), matching both major features of SQT ECGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Brugada1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Giustetto1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Watanabe1">[27]</xref>.

The results with these models (Figure S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002313.s009">Text S1</xref>) indicate that, although all 3 ventricular cell models produced qualitatively similar effects on AP parameters at the single cell level, at the 1D strand level only with the TNNP model did incorporation of SQT1 mutant I<sub>Kr</sub> lead to increased upright T-wave amplitude, and that this required transmural heterogeneity in I<sub>Kr</sub> expression (more details are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002313.s009">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to examine the factors responsible for an increased T-wave amplitude in the SQT1 setting with the TNNP ventricle model, we examined the effects of the N588K mutation on the membrane potential heterogeneity (δV) between the EPI, MIDDLE and ENDO cells, as well as transmural APD dispersion across the intact 1D strand.

However, with a ratio of 1.5 or above for the EPI I<sub>Kr</sub> to MIDDLE and ENDO I<sub>Kr</sub>, the N588K mutation augmented APD dispersion at localised regions of the MIDDLE region and at the junction region between the MIDDLE and EPI regions, which also contributed to an increased T-wave amplitude.</p>

        <title>Investigating the arrhythmogenic substrate in SQT1 – 1D simulations</title>
        <p>Using 1D-tissue strand simulations with the TNNP model we investigated the vulnerability of tissue to unidirectional conduction block, in response to a premature stimulus applied to the refractory tail of a previous excitation wave.

During the simulation, a conditional stimulus (with varying lengths) was applied to the ENDO side of the 2D model to evoke a planar wave that propagated towards the MIDDLE and EPI regions for the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g010">Figure 10Ci</xref>) and N588K mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g010">Figure 10Di</xref>) conditions. After a time delay, a premature stimulus was applied to a localised EPI region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g010">Figure 10Cii</xref> for WT and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g010">Figure 10Dii</xref> for N588K), that produced an unidirectional conduction towards the EPI side due to a longer refractory period of the MIDDLE, forming a re-entrant excitation wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g010">Figure 10Ciii</xref> for WT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g010">Figure 10Diii</xref> for N588K). The induced re-entrant excitation wave self-terminated for the WT condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g010">Figure 10Ciiii</xref>), but was sustained for the N588K mutation condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g010">Figure 10Diiii</xref>). In both the WT and mutant conditions, the formation of the induced re-entrant excitation wave was dependent on the size of the premature stimulus. We therefore measured the minimal size of the premature stimulus that enabled the formation of re-entry, as this is correlated with the wavelength of excitation (the product of APD and conduction velocity) and measures the minimal size of ventricular substrate necessary to sustain re-entry. For the WT condition, the measured size was large (51 mm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g010">Figure 10B</xref>) due to a comparatively long effective refractory period. Once initiated, the re-entry self-terminated within 284 ms. However, as the N588K mutation shortened the ERP and therefore the wavelength of the ventricular excitation wave, the size of the substrate was reduced to 23 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). Once initiated, the spiral wave was found to be sustained. As the minimal substrate size quantifies (in a reciprocal fashion) the tissue's spatial vulnerability to sustain re-entry, this reduction demonstrated an increased tissue susceptibility to arrhythmia in the setting of the N588K mutation.</p>

Under the control condition, the excitation wave was first initiated in the apex region of the left ventricle. Once initiated, it propagates rapidly along the endocardial surface towards the base regions of the left and right ventricles, and then conducted transmurally across the ventricle wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g012">Figure 12A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g012">Figure 12F</xref>).

As the surrounding tissue at the stimulus site was in its relative refractory period, the premature stimulus evoked an excitation wave that propagated uni-directionally in the retrograde direction of the control excitation wave, leading to formation of a re-entrant scroll wave within the transmural wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g012">Figure 12B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g012">Figure 12G</xref>). For the WT condition, the scroll wave self-terminated with a lifespan of 600 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g012">Figure 12C &amp; D</xref>). However, with the N588K mutation condition, the scroll wave broke up forming multiple wavelets that were sustained throughout the whole simulation period of 5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g012">Figure 12H &amp; I</xref>).

Results with the S2 stimulus applied to a similarly sized sub-endocardial region are similar to the results (not shown) when the stimulus was applied epicardially. These 3D results concur with the 2D simulations, further illustrating the pro-arrhythmic effects of the N588K mutation.</p>

        <title>Summary of major findings</title>
        <p>Due to the lack of a mammalian experimental model that can accurately reproduce the kinetic changes of SQTS mutations, ventricular cell and tissue models <italic>in silico</italic> provide a valuable means of investigating the functional effects of SQT mutations on genesis and maintenance of ventricular arrhythmias. The major findings of the present study are summarised as follows: (i) the Markov chain I<sub>Kr</sub> formulations reproduce better the dynamic properties of hERG/I<sub>Kr</sub> under both WT and N588K hERG SQT1 conditions than do the Luo-Rudy and TNNP H-H formulations; (ii) the N588K hERG mutation is causally linked to QT interval shortening, whether or not I<sub>Kr</sub> is presumed to be homogeneously distributed across the ventricular wall; however, a heterogeneous I<sub>Kr</sub> density across the ventricular strand TNNP model was found to be necessary to reproduce a taller T-wave amplitude as has been seen clinically in SQT1; (iii) with a heterogeneous I<sub>Kr</sub> density across the strand, the N588K mutation leads to augmented membrane potential differences (δV) between paired cells and transmural APD dispersion in localised regions of the transmural strand that contributes to the increased T-wave amplitude; (iv) the N588K mutation increases at some localised regions the tissue's temporal vulnerability to the genesis of uni-directional conduction by a premature excitation; (v) the N588K mutation shortens the minimal tissue substrate size that facilitates the maintenance of re-entry as shown in both idealised and realistic tissue models of the human ventricle. These findings substantiate the causal link between the N588K mutation and QT interval shortening and, moreover, provide a comprehensive explanation for increased susceptibility to re-entry and perpetuation of re-entrant arrhythmia in the setting of SQT1.</p>

        <title>Significance of the study</title>
        <p>Previous studies have used computer models to study the functional impact of the N588K hERG, KvLQT1 V307L (SQT 2) and KCNJ2 (SQT 3) mutations on ventricular cell AP shortening and characteristics of simulated ECGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Priori1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Weiss1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang1">[19]</xref>. However, whilst comprehensive investigation of the pro-arrhythmic effects of the V307L-KCNQ1 SQT 2 mutation using simplified multi-cellular geometry has been conducted before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang1">[19]</xref>, simulations addressing the effects of the N588K mutation on perpetuating and facilitating re-entrant excitation waves in ventricular tissue have not been performed until now. Furthermore, the present study is the first to determine the arrhythmogenic consequences of the N588K mutation on multi-scale models of the human ventricles. In an earlier study by Kogan and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Kogan1">[30]</xref>, delayed outward K<sup>+</sup> current deactivation rate was modified to determine effects on excitation-recovery and spiral wave activity. Slowing deactivation had a profound effect on wave-front propagation in those simulations. Whilst the results of that prior study are important in demonstrating a link between augmented K<sup>+</sup> conductance (through deactivation modification) and arrhythmogenesis, the SQT1 I<sub>Kr</sub> defect is principally one of impaired inactivation not deactivation and therefore requires targeted simulations that specifically reproduce I<sub>Kr</sub> changes with the SQT1 N588K mutation. Prior studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Weiss1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang2">[20]</xref> have reported inhomogeneous shortening of ventricular APD with loss of I<sub>Kr</sub> inactivation, which appears paradoxical in light of increased arrhythmia susceptibility in the syndrome. The present study resolves this apparent contradiction: whilst we have also demonstrated that the AP shortening as a result of N588K mutation is inhomogeneous, (resulting in a decreased APD<sub>90</sub> and ERP dispersion, as the greatest shortening of APD<sub>90</sub> occurred in MIDDLE cell APs), with heterogeneous I<sub>Kr</sub> in the ventricle the mutation augmented both membrane potential difference between paired cells and the APD dispersion in some localised regions of the transmural strand. These changes lead to an increased T-wave amplitude, which is different to previous simulation results but is consistent with clinical observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Brugada1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Giustetto1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Watanabe1">[27]</xref>. These changes also lead to increased tissue vulnerability to uni-directional conduction block in response to a premature stimulus. We have also shown that, in the setting of either a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous distribution of I<sub>Kr</sub>, the N588K mutation markedly reduced the minimal substrate size of the tissue essential for sustaining re-entrant excitation waves, enabling re-entrant excitation waves to persist in both idealised 2D and realistic 2D &amp; 3D models. In all tissue models, an initial single re-entrant excitation wave may degenerate into multiple re-entrant wavelets, leading to a transition from tachycardia-like to fibrillation-like electrical excitation waves.</p>

        <title>Relevance to previous studies</title>
        <p>Prior experimental work employing the canine perfused ventricular wedge preparation has used the K-ATP channel activator pinacidil to explore arrhythmogenesis in the setting of abbreviated repolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Extramiana1">[16]</xref>. Though mechanistically distinct from a hERG channel mutation, I<sub>K,ATP</sub> activation by pinacidil was seen to lead to preferential mid-myocardial AP abbreviation, to increased dispersion of repolarization and to increased susceptibility to VT with programmed electrical stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Extramiana1">[16]</xref>. Similar results were found subsequently using the I<sub>Kr</sub> agonist PD-118057 and the wedge preparation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Patel1">[4]</xref>. Our data show for the first time that, in general terms, a similar substrate occurs <italic>in silico</italic> with biophysically accurate I<sub>Kr</sub> models based on N588K-hERG. We have reported previously that the adult SQT 2 variant (incorporating the V307L-KCNQ1 mutation into the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel) also involves heterogeneous APD abbreviation and increased refractory dispersion and susceptibility to genesis of re-entry in the ventricle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang1">[19]</xref>. However, the extent and nature of transmural APD dispersion produced by SQT 2 and SQT 1 appear to differ: whilst SQT 2 augments the APD dispersion across the whole transmural strand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang1">[19]</xref>, SQT 1 only augments the APD dispersion in some localised regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). We have found that with a heterogeneous I<sub>Kr</sub> density across the ventricle wall, SQT1 may lead localised regions of tissue to have an augmented APD dispersion and membrane potential difference. These changes can account not only for an increased T-wave amplitude of the ECG as observed clinically, but can also produce increased tissue vulnerability to conduction block in localised regions of the ventricular wall, thereby facilitating re-entry. Our simulations suggest some similarity between SQT1 and SQT2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang1">[19]</xref>, however, in that both the N588K mutation (this study) and the V307L-KCNQ1 mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang1">[19]</xref> reduce the minimal size of ventricular tissue to sustain re-entrant activity.</p>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>Although the TNNP model has been derived from experimental data on the kinetics of ionic channels mostly obtained from human ventricular myocytes, has been validated by its ability to reproduce the experimental data from which the model was derived, and is suggested to be well-suited to the study of re-entrant arrhythmias in human ventricular tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-tenTusscher1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-tenTusscher2">[32]</xref>, it has some limitations (discussed in detail elsewhere; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-tenTusscher1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-tenTusscher2">[32]</xref>). For example, due to the lack of complete experimental data sets on the transmural heterogeneity of human ion channel current densities, there are some discrepancies between the simulated transmural APD dispersion and those observed experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Li1">[33]</xref> - the model-generated ENDO APD tends to be close to that of the EPI APD. In addition, the model assumed a uniform I<sub>Kr</sub> density across the ventricle wall, which may not be accurate as experimental data have shown a more abundant mRNA in the EPI region of the human ventricle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Szabo1">[24]</xref>. Also, in the multicellular tissue model - due to a lack of detailed experimental data - the distance between contiguous regions of distinctive cell types and intercellular electrical coupling was chosen here to produce a positive T-wave and a conduction velocity of a planar solitary excitation wave close to the experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Taggart1">[34]</xref>. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the proportions of each sub-region used in our study are similar to those used in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Weiss1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Gima1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Seemann1">[35]</xref>. In the 2D “realistic” model, although we have considered intrinsic anisotropic intercellular electrical coupling, the complex anatomical structure of ventricular wall and fibre orientation, the 2D model is just based on a single slice of the ventricle wall, lacking consideration of the 3D anatomical structure and anisotropy, which could influence perpetuation of ventricular arrhythmias due to the N588K mutation. This limitation has been taken into account in our study design, however, through the incorporation of additional work using our ‘realistic’ 3D geometry model, the results of which also support a re-entrant substrate in SQT1. The fact that results from the combined use of 2D simplified and ‘realistic’ models and of a 3D ‘realistic’ geometry model in this study point towards similar underlying arrhythmogenic mechanisms suggests that, at least in the setting of SQT1, relatively simple 2D models appear adequate to provide mechanistic insight into arrhythmogenesis in this condition. It remains to be determined, through a similar multi-level simulation approach, whether this is the case for other forms of SQT. It should be noted that other possible contributory mechanisms for the pro-arrhythmia in SQT1 have also been proposed. These include the generation of early EADs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Itoh1">[17]</xref> and an augmented dispersion of action potential repolarization between the Purkinje fibre network and the ventricle in the SQT1 context <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Cordeiro1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>. Additional single cell simulations (not shown) did not support the occurrence of early EADs in our model, however, whilst further studies are warranted in the future to incorporate biophysically and anatomically accurate Purkinje fibre cell networks into 2D and 3D models. Nevertheless, whilst it is important that potential limitations of the models used are made explicit, these limitations do not influence fundamentally the conclusions that can be drawn on likely mechanisms by which the N588K hERG mutation facilitates arrhythmia induction and maintenance.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>On the basis of the simulations in this study it can be concluded that not only is the N588K mutation causally linked to QT interval shortening, but also that it leads to increased APD dispersion and difference in membrane potential (δV) in some localized regions, that increase tissue vulnerability to the genesis of re-entry by a premature excitation. Moreover, the mutation shortens tissue ERP that facilitates the maintenance of re-entry in both 2D and 3D tissue scenarios. Thus, the findings of this study provide a comprehensive explanation for clinical consequences of this form of the SQTS in terms of abbreviation of repolarization and susceptibility to arrhythmia. The multiscale ventricular models developed and employed in this study may have further utility for probing the basis of arrhythmia in other forms of the SQTS and other repolarization disorders.</p>

        <title>Development of I<sub>Kr</sub> Markov chain model</title>
        <p>The full and reduced Markov chain model formulations for I<sub>hERG</sub>/I<sub>Kr</sub> formulation were based on the work of Kiehn <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Kiehn1">[36]</xref>, Clancy and Rudy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Clancy1">[37]</xref>, Lu <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Lu1">[21]</xref> and Wang <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Wang1">[38]</xref>. The models were modified to incorporate the experimentally-observed kinetic properties of WT and N588K-mutated hERG/I<sub>Kr</sub> channel. These kinetic properties include (1) the profound (&gt; +60 mV) shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation of N588K-hERG that alters rectification of I<sub>hERG</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Brugada1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate3">[39]</xref>; (2) the substantial increase of I<sub>hERG</sub> early during the ventricular action potential (AP) waveform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Brugada1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate3">[39]</xref>; and (3) the generation of rapid, transient, outward currents in response to premature, depolarizing stimuli under ‘paired stimuli’ experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>.</p>
        <p>A schematic illustration for the full Markov chain model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g001">Figure 1Ai</xref>. It consists of three closed states (C1, C2 and C3), an open state (O) and an inactivated state (I). Inactivation can occur from either the open or closed state but does so preferentially from the open state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Rudy1">[40]</xref>. From the full Markov chain model, a reduced Markov chain model (r-MC) was created by removing the transitions from the closed state (C3) to the inactivated state (I) and vice-versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002313-g001">Figure 1Aii</xref>). Consequently, inactivation occurs only from the open state in such a model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Wang1">[38]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To obtain the transition rates of the Markov chain model that reproduced the experimentally-observed kinetic properties of WT and N588K-hERG/I<sub>Kr</sub>, we simulated the experimental current-voltage (I-V) relationships for WT and N588K-hERG/I<sub>Kr</sub> using the voltage clamp protocol from McPate <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-McPate2">[13]</xref>. The membrane potential was held at −80 mV and then depolarized briefly to −40 mV (to evaluate instantaneous current), followed by 2 s depolarisations to a range of potentials from −40 mV to +60 mV (in 10 mV increments); finally, tail currents were elicited by repolarization to −40 mV for 4 s.</p>
        <p>Variables that modified these transition rates were introduced and their values were obtained by minimising the least-squared difference between the experimental data and the simulation. The variables that produced the best fit and behaviour of macroscopic currents relative to the experimental data were selected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002313.s009">Text S1</xref>). The minimisation was performed using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Broyden1">[41]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Initiation and conduction of action potentials in multicellular tissue models was modelled with the monodomain equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Clements1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-ColliFranzone1">[49]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002313.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>D</italic> is the diffusion coefficient describing the tissue conductivity.</p>
        <p>For one-dimensional (1D) computations, the mesh used was a single fibre, 15 mm long with 100 nodes that were spaced 0.15 mm apart, with each node representing a 150-µm cylindrical cell. This total strand length of 15 mm is consistent with the normal range of human transmural ventricle width; ∼4.0–14.0 mm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Drouin1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Yan1">[52]</xref>. In the strand, there were 25 endocardial cells (ENDO), 35 middle cells (MCELL) and 40 epicardial cells (EPI). The corresponding lengths of each region were 3.75 mm for ENDO, 5.25 mm for MCELL and 6 mm for EPI. The chosen proportion for each region is similar to those used in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Weiss1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang2">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Gima1">[28]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The diffusion coefficient, ‘<italic>D</italic>’ was set at 0.001 cm<sup>2</sup>/ms giving a planar conduction velocity of 65 cm/s through the strand. This is close to the 70 cm/s velocity of conduction along the fibre direction in human myocardium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Taggart1">[34]</xref>. ‘<italic>D</italic>’ was homogenous except for a 5-fold decrease at the EPI-MCELL border <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Zhang1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Gima1">[28]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To initiate a conducting excitation wave, a supra-threshold stimulus was applied at the ENDO end of the strand. The conduction velocity was calculated from nodes one-quarter and three-quarters of the way along the strand. The activation time of each point was defined to be the time at which the maximum upstroke velocity occurred.</p>
        <p>In two-dimensions (2D) simulations, both idealised and realistic geometries were implemented. The idealised geometry was a simple sheet of tissue measuring 15 mm by 50 mm. It was modelled by expanding the 1D transmural strand (length of 15 mm in the <italic>x</italic>-direction) into a sheet with a width of 50 m in the <italic>y</italic>-direction.</p>
        <p>The realistic geometry was a transverse cross-sectional slice taken from the middle of a 3D ventricular geometry reconstructed by DT-MRI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Seemann1">[35]</xref> with a spatial resolution of 0.2 mm. It was segmented into distinctive regions of endo-, middle and epi-cardiac layers with similar contiguous figurations in the transmural wall as in the 1D strand model. It also implemented anisotropic fibre orientations as used in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Seemann1">[35]</xref>. The intracellular conductivities in the fibre and cross-fibre directions were set to 0.3 and 0.1 mS mm<sup>−1</sup> respectively.</p>
        <p>In three-dimensions (3D), simulations were performed using an anatomical human ventricle geometry of a healthy 30 year-old male that was reconstructed by using DT-MRI. It has a spatial resolution of 0.2 mm with approximately 24.2 million nodes in total and includes anisotropic fibre orientation. The tissue was segmented into distinctive ENDO, MIDDLE and EPI regions for both the left and right ventricles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Keller1">[29]</xref>. The conditional activation sites were determined empirically across the ventricles walls, and were validated by reproducing the activation sequence and the QRS complex in the measured 64-channel ECG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002313-Keller1">[29]</xref> of that person.

        <title>Initiation of re-entry in 2D sheet</title>
        <p>In both the regular and realistic geometries, re-entry was initiated by a standard S1–S2 protocol. In the regular, idealised 2D sheet, a plane wave was initiated at the ENDO end by an S1 stimulus. During the vulnerable window of the tissue, an S2 stimulus was applied to a local tissue area in the EPI region to evoke unidirectional propagation that can lead to re-entry.</p>

        <title>Measurement of minimal size of S2 that sustains re-entry in 2D models</title>
        <p>Corresponding to a S2 stimulus, unidirectional conduction of the S2-evoked excitation wave leads to formation of a paired re-entrant excitation waves, with their tips counter-rotates with each other. If the distance between the two tips is sufficient long, each of the two tips has sufficient space to complete its pathway, and therefore, the paired re-entrant excitation waves sustain. Otherwise, the two tips collide leading to termination of the re-entrant excitation wave. To provide an adequate re-entrant pathway, a sufficient S2 size is required, which is dependent on the wavelength of the spiral wave. In order to evaluate the critical size of re-entrant pathway of tissue, we estimated the minimal spatial S2 length that supported the formation of re-entrant spiral waves under control and SQT1 conditions. This minimal length of S2 gives an indication of the susceptibility of the tissue to re-entry, i.e., the larger the minimal length, the harder the initiation of re-entry.</p>
