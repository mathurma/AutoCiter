        <p>Dosage compensation in mammals involves silencing of one X chromosome in XX females and requires expression, in <italic>cis</italic>, of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA. The X to be inactivated is randomly chosen in cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) at the blastocyst stage of development. Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from the ICM of female mice have two active X chromosomes, one of which is inactivated as the cells differentiate in culture, providing a powerful model system to study the dynamics of X inactivation. Using microarrays to assay expression of X-linked genes in undifferentiated female and male mouse ES cells, we detect global up-regulation of expression (1.4- to 1.6-fold) from the active X chromosomes, relative to autosomes. We show a similar up-regulation in ICM from male blastocysts grown in culture. In male ES cells, up-regulation reaches 2-fold after 2–3 weeks of differentiation, thereby balancing expression between the single X and the diploid autosomes. We show that silencing of X-linked genes in female ES cells occurs on a gene-by-gene basis throughout differentiation, with some genes inactivating early, others late, and some escaping altogether. Surprisingly, by allele-specific analysis in hybrid ES cells, we also identified a subgroup of genes that are silenced in undifferentiated cells. We propose that X-linked genes are silenced in female ES cells by spreading of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA through the X chromosome territory as the cells differentiate, with silencing times for individual genes dependent on their proximity to the <italic>Xist</italic> locus.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>In organisms such as fruit flies and humans, major chromosomal differences exist between the sexes: females have two large, gene-rich X chromosomes, and males have one X and one small, gene-poor Y. Various strategies have evolved to balance X-linked gene expression between the single X and the autosomes, and between the sexes (a phenomenon called dosage compensation). In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content>, expression from the male X is up-regulated approximately 2-fold, thereby balancing both X-to-autosome and female-to-male expression. In contrast, mammals silence one of the two female Xs in a process requiring the untranslated RNA product of the <italic>Xist</italic> gene. This balances female-to-male expression but leaves both sexes with only one functional X chromosome. Using mouse embryonic stem cells and microarray expression analysis, we found that dosage compensation in mice is more complex than previously thought, with X-linked genes up-regulated in both male and female cells so as to balance X-to-autosome expression. As differentiation proceeds, female cells show progressive loss of expression from one of the two initially active Xs. Surprisingly, silencing occurs on a gene-by-gene basis over 2–3 week of differentiation; some genes escape altogether, whereas a subgroup of genes, often adjacent to the <italic>Xist</italic> locus, is silenced even in undifferentiated cells. We propose that female X-linked genes are silenced by progressive spreading of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA through the X chromosome territory as differentiation proceeds.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In many higher eukaryotes, sex determination mechanisms have evolved in a way that has generated chromosomal differences between the sexes. In eutherian and marsupial mammals and the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, females have two copies of a gene-rich X chromosome, whereas males have one X and one smaller, gene-poor Y. Because monosomy for even the smallest autosome is lethal in mammals, mechanisms have presumably evolved to allow males to tolerate monosomy of the X, as well as to correct a potential imbalance between the sexes in expression levels of several hundred X-linked genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b002">2</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the situation has been resolved by an overall up-regulation of genes on the single male X, a dosage compensation mechanism that equalises expression both between X and autosomes and between the sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b004">4</xref>]. In mammals, expression in males and females has been balanced by X inactivation, a process by which most genes on one of the two female Xs are silenced early in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b007">7</xref>]. However, X inactivation alone exacerbates the X:autosome imbalance, leaving both sexes functionally monosomic for X-linked genes. This problem was highlighted many years ago, and a balancing, 2-fold up-regulation of genes from the single, active X was proposed as a possible solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b008">8</xref>]. However, proof of this has been difficult to achieve. Studies of the expression of the <italic>Ccl4</italic> gene in hybrid mice provided a clue that this might occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b009">9</xref>], but the first indication that genes on the active X are globally up-regulated has come only recently through the analyses of microarray data from a variety of publicly available sources. Comparisons of the mean, overall expression levels of X-linked and autosomal genes in various cell and tissue types, usually from mixtures of male and female, gives an X:autosome expression ratio of approximately 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b012">12</xref>]. Given that both XY male and XX female cells have only a single, transcriptionally active X, and two copies of each autosome, without up-regulation of X-linked genes the mean ratio should be closer to 0.5. The results therefore provide evidence, albeit circumstantial, for a balancing up-regulation of expression from the active X.</p>
      <p>We used microarray expression analysis to give a global picture of X-linked gene expression in differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, a model system that allows the dynamics of dosage compensation processes to be analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b013">13</xref>]. We show that up-regulation of X-linked genes is in place in undifferentiated male and female ES cells but is incomplete, with equalization of X-linked and autosomal transcript levels requiring 2–3 wk of differentiation. Evidence for a similar up-regulation was found in inner cell mass (ICM) cells isolated from male and female blastocysts. In female ES cells, continuing up-regulation through differentiation is counterbalanced by silencing of genes on the second, randomly chosen X. We show that silencing of X-linked genes occurs on a gene-by-gene basis throughout differentiation, and we present evidence that silencing is mediated by the progressive spreading of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA through the X chromosome territory.</p>

        <title>Expression of X-Linked Genes Is Up-Regulated in Both Female and Male ES Cells</title>
        <p>Expression of X-linked genes in female and male ES cells, relative to autosomal genes (X:A ratio), was assayed by co-hybridisation of labelled cDNAs to NIA15K mouse cDNA microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b014">14</xref>]. Expression levels of 180 X-linked genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sd001">Text S1</xref> for filtering criteria) were distributed over a ∼200-fold range, with a close correlation between expression in female and male cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">1</xref>B). Only two genes showed clear sex-specific expression in undifferentiated ES cells, namely <italic>Xlr3b</italic> and <italic>Xlr5</italic>, both of which showed minimal expression in the CCE/R male line. Consistent over-expression of <italic>Xlr5c</italic> and <italic>Xlr5d</italic> in female ES cells relative to males has recently been reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b015">15</xref>]. On differentiation, the expression of both these genes increased progressively in male CCE/R cells and decreased in female PGK12.1 cells, such that by day 21, expression was at comparable levels in both cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). Interestingly, <italic>Xlr3b</italic> and <italic>Xlr5</italic> are part of a cluster, some of whose members show tissue-specific imprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b016">16</xref>]. For undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), the regression line intercepts the <italic>y</italic>-axis (female) at a positive value (log<sub>2</sub> = 0.69, linear 1.61), showing that overall expression of X-linked genes is 1.6-fold higher in undifferentiated female ES cells, with two active X chromosomes, than in male ES cells, with only one. In differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), the intercept was close to 0 (log<sub>2</sub> = 0.14, linear 1.10), indicating that overall expression of X-linked genes was very similar in differentiated male and female cells.</p>

        <p>The distributions of expression levels of X-linked genes in male and female ES cells are shown as box plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>C. In both males and females, expression levels are skewed towards higher expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). A similar skewing was seen when the expression of genes on individual autosomes was analysed in the same way (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). To accommodate this, we have used median rather than mean values for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, horizontal line in each box). The median X:A ratio in undifferentiated (day 0) male ES cells is 0.81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). This is significantly above the median value of 0.5 that would be expected if X-linked genes were expressed equally to autosomal genes (<italic>p</italic> = 3.2 × 10<sup>−32</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 249) and demonstrates an overall 1.6-fold up-regulation of expression on the single X. Microarray expression data for three additional male ES cell lines has recently been made available (BL6.9, 129.3, and ES-D3-GL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b015">15</xref>], and we have used this to calculate X:A expression ratios, as above. Values ranged from 0.90 to 1.03, suggesting that an approximately 2-fold up-regulation of X-linked genes is a general property of male ES cell lines.</p>
        <p>In XX female cells, equal expression of X-linked and autosomal genes would give an X:A ratio of about 1.0, whereas the measured ratio is 1.39, which is significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, <italic>p</italic> = 1.1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 249). A very similar X:A expression ratio (1.37) was given by cDNA from the hybrid, female ES cell line 3F1 (see below). Thus, X-linked genes in female ES cells are also up-regulated. After 15 d of differentiation, X:A ratios in both male and female cells were close to 1, which is comparable to the situation in adult cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Expression of X-Linked Genes in the ICM</title>
        <p>To test whether the up-regulation of X-linked genes detected in ES cells also occurs in the cells of the blastocyst from which ES cells are derived, RNA was prepared from single ICMs from cultured male and female embryos (distinguished by presence or absence of the <italic>Sry</italic> gene, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), amplified and used to prepare cDNA for labelling of NIA15K arrays. As with expression in ES cells, the expression of X-linked genes in female and male embryos was closely correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The median X:A ratio in male ICMs was 0.86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), very similar to the value of 0.81 obtained for male ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) and indicative of up-regulation of X-linked gene expression. In female ICMs from the same batch of embryos, the X:A ratio was 0.89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This is consistent with up-regulation of genes on Xa in females only if one of the two Xs is inactivated in all or most of the ICM cells used in this experiment. This is certainly possible, because levels of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA were particularly high in female ICMs (around 8-fold higher than the median expression of autosomal genes) and significantly higher than the <italic>Xist</italic> RNA levels in male ICM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g002">Figure 2</xref>D) and differentiated female ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Whether this represents persistence of the imprinted paternal X inactivation present from early in development, or random X inactivation, or a combination of the two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b017">17</xref>], remains to be determined.</p>

        <title>Changes in Expression of X-Linked Genes Proceed throughout ES Cell Differentiation</title>
        <p>The dynamics of differentiation-related changes in X-linked gene expression were determined by analysing cDNAs from male and female cells at various times of differentiation between 0 and 21 d. The X:A expression ratio in female cells showed a gradual and progressive decrease until day 15, whereas in male cells, there was little change until day 7, after which there was a progressive increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

        <p>The observed increase in expression of X-linked genes in differentiating male cells and the decrease in female cells are unique properties of X-linked genes. Expression of genes on each of the 19 mouse autosomes, relative to all genes (designated the n:A ratio) showed no such changes. The n:A ratio varied from one chromosome to another over only a narrow range and did not change with differentiation or differ between females and males to the same extent as did the X:A expression ratio (Chromosome 2 is shown as an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and all 19 autosomes are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>The expression of X-linked genes in differentiating female ES cells can potentially be influenced by the following three parallel processes: (i) silencing through X inactivation, (ii) up-regulation through dosage compensation on the active X, and (iii) differentiation-related expression changes that are unconnected to the dosage compensation process. Given the close correlation between expression levels of X-linked genes in male and female cells throughout differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g001">1</xref> B), the latter two processes are likely to occur to a similar extent in both male and female cells. This being the case, changes in the female:male expression ratio of X-linked genes should reflect progression of the X inactivation process alone. With this in mind, we co-hybridised red/green labelled cDNAs from female and male cells, at the same stage of differentiation, to the same slide, and we calculated red:green or green:red ratios as a log<sub>2</sub> “M value”, as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b019">19</xref>]. In undifferentiated, cells the M value is around 0.65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), corresponding to a linear female:male expression ratio of about 1.6. M values derived from undifferentiated cells and cells at later stages of differentiation were all normally distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). There was no detectable fall in M value for the first 7 d of differentiation, with a small increase at days 2–4. Thereafter, there was a progressive decrease, culminating in an M value close to 0, which reflects equal expression of X-linked genes in female and male cells by day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g004">4</xref>B). It seems that a net loss of expression of female X-linked genes occurs later than previously concluded on the basis of single-gene analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b020">20</xref>].</p>

        <p>To determine the consistency of these findings between ES cell lines, we assayed X-linked gene expression in the hybrid (<italic>m. mus domesticus</italic> × <italic>m. mus castaneous</italic>) ES cell line 3F1. There is a close correlation in expression of X-linked genes between these two very different lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Further, co-hybridisation of 3F1 and male (CCE/R) cDNAs from the same stages of differentiation to the same slides showed a relatively late decrease in the expression of female X-linked genes relative to male, with no detectable decrease in female:male expression ratio (M value) after 2 d of differentiation, and complete equalisation only after 15 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).</p>
        <p>By studying the change in M value with differentiation time for individual genes, it became clear that some genes consistently showed a relatively early loss of activity in female cells, while others inactivated later, or not at all. Differences in silencing times were confirmed by real-time quantitative (RTQ)-PCR assays, in which expression levels in differentiating embryoid bodies were expressed relative to levels at day 0 (examples are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). As a first test of whether genes that inactivated relatively early in one ES cell line also inactivated early in others, we co-hybridised cDNA from undifferentiated cells and cells differentiated for 7 d to the same slide and calculated the day 7:day 0 expression ratio as an M value. Genes showing reduced expression in PGK12.1 cells after 7 d of differentiation tended also to show reduced expression in 3F1 cells, with a good overall correlation between the two cell lines in the change in expression of X-linked genes after 7 d of differentiation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>We subjected the PGK12.1 M value dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) to cluster analysis using the TIGR programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b021">21</xref>]. The programme grouped expression data from 252 X-linked clones into selected numbers of clusters, based on the manner in which expression (M value) changed during differentiation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g005">Figure 5</xref>A shows the results of an analysis in which the data were resolved into four clusters, each shown as a graph plotting the median value at each stage of differentiation tested. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g005">Figure 5</xref>B shows the corresponding heat maps. Clusters 1, 2, and 3 showed similar patterns of change, starting at an M value of 0.6–0.8 at day 0 (corresponding to a linear F:M ratio of 1.54–1.75) falling to around 0 by day 21, but differing in the stage at which M values first fell significantly, i.e., day 4–7 for cluster 1 (46 genes), day 7–12 for cluster 2 (74 genes), and day 12–21 for cluster 3 (64 genes). In contrast, the 21 genes in the fourth cluster behaved differently, with M values close to 0 in undifferentiated cells (median = −0.14) and generally increasing on differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). We note that irrespective of how many clusters the programme was asked to resolve, there was always one that showed essentially the same pattern as that of cluster 4 and that stood out from the rest.

        <title>Some X-Linked Genes Show Mono-Allelic Expression in Undifferentiated Female ES Cells</title>
        <p>One explanation (among several) for the finding that some genes are equally expressed in XX female and XY male ES cells is that they are expressed from only one allele in female cells. This could result from the failure to reactivate the paternal allele which, for most X-linked genes, is selectively silenced in the preblastocyst embryo but reactivated in the inner cell mass during blastocyst maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b024">24</xref>]. Alternatively, it could reflect initiation of (random) X inactivation before the onset of ES cell differentiation. To explore these possibilities, we assayed the expression of paternal and maternal alleles using the hybrid ES cell line 3F1, derived from a <italic>m.mus domesticus (129/sv)</italic> × <italic>m.mus castaneous</italic> hybrid backcrossed to <italic>129</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b025">25</xref>]. The <italic>129</italic> X chromosome is maternally derived, whereas the <italic>castaneous</italic> X chromosome is paternal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b026">26</xref>]. In 3F1 cells, the <italic>129</italic> X chromosome carries a loss-of-function <italic>Tsix</italic> mutation, such that when 3F1 cells differentiate, <italic>Xist</italic> is always up-regulated on the <italic>129</italic> X chromosome, which is therefore always inactivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b025">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three cluster 4 genes (<italic>Jarid1c</italic>, <italic>Gm784</italic>, and <italic>Acsl4</italic>) that distinguished the <italic>129</italic> and <italic>castaneous</italic> alleles and that could be selectively restriction digested so as to generate cDNAs that are distinguishable electrophoretically . Remarkably, for all three genes, expression in undifferentiated 3F1 cells was exclusively from the <italic>castaneous</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). We were able to test three other genes that showed a female:male expression ratio of close to 1 at day 0, but which the TIGR programme had not placed in cluster 4. One of these, <italic>Phka2</italic>, showed expression exclusively from the <italic>castaneous</italic> allele in undifferentiated 3F1 cells; a second, <italic>Ogt</italic>, showed expression that was strongly skewed towards the <italic>castaneous</italic> allele; whereas the third, <italic>Brodl</italic>, showed bi-allelic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Two genes whose female:male expression ratios in undifferentiated cells showed the expected female bias by microarray analysis (<italic>Pctk1</italic> and <italic>Zfp185</italic>) showed clear biallelic expression, as did a third gene (<italic>Pgr15l</italic>), for which a suitable SNP was available but which was not present on the NIA15K array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). The conclusion from these results is that a subpopulation of X-linked genes in female ES cells is mono-allelically expressed before differentiation and that in 3F1 cells, where inactivation is 100% skewed towards the maternal X, it is always the paternal (<italic>castaneous</italic>) X that is expressed. Thus, mono-allelic expression is not due to failure to reactivate the paternal allele from its preblastocyst silent state, but instead is due to the onset of “random” X inactivation before differentiation.</p>

        <title>Proximity to the X inactivation centre (Xic) Correlates with Mono-Allelic Expression in Undifferentiated Female ES Cells</title>
        <p>In searching for possible reasons for the gene-to-gene differences in inactivation rate, we asked whether position on the X chromosome, and specifically proximity to <italic>Xist</italic> and the Xic, was of any relevance. To do this, we tabulated the distribution of genes in each cluster across seven X chromosome regions of similar gene content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-st002">Table S2</xref>). Genes in clusters 1–3 are distributed across the X chromosome with no clear enrichment or depletion in any single region, nor any clear differences between clusters. In contrast, cluster 4 showed a significant enrichment in the region (85–108Mb) that contains the Xic (8 of 21 genes, <italic>p</italic> = 0.038, Fisher's exact test). Six of these eight genes are within 6 Mb (94.8∼100.5 Mb) of the Xic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-st001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-st002">S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The tendency of genes silenced before ES cell differentiation to be located adjacent to the Xic suggests that <italic>Xist</italic> RNA plays a role in their silencing, even before its increased expression early in differentiation. To test this, we took advantage of the finding that <italic>Xist</italic> transcript levels in undifferentiated 3F1 cells (carrying a mutation of the <italic>Tsix</italic> gene) are about 3-fold higher than in the 16.6 hybrid line, from which 3F1 was derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b025">25</xref>] and which has a functional <italic>Tsix</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b022">22</xref>]. In 16.6 cells, inactivation is 80% skewed towards the <italic>129</italic> X chromosome as a result of differences in strength of the <italic>Xce</italic> alleles in the parental strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b028">28</xref>]. In undifferentiated 16.6 cells, two of the four genes that are mono-allelically expressed in 3F1 cells (<italic>Gm784</italic>, <italic>Acsl4</italic>) were also expressed exclusively from the <italic>castaneous</italic> allele. However, the two that were most distant from the Xic (<italic>Phka2</italic>, <italic>Jarid1c</italic>) were bi-allelically expressed (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g006">Figure 6</xref>C), consistent with the possibility that silencing reflects local spreading of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA.</p>
        <p>If silencing of X-linked genes reflects the progressive spreading of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA through the X chromosome territory, then one would predict that genes that are close together on the chromosome should be silenced at similar times. To test this, we prepared a list of X-linked gene pairs separated by progressively increasing distances, and we asked whether members of each pair were found in the same cluster (i.e., any one of clusters 1–4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g004">Figure 4</xref>) more often than expected by chance. For this analysis, the four clusters are taken as broad indicators of inactivation timing. We find that gene pairs separated by up to 40 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-st003">Table S3</xref>) are in the same cluster significantly more often than predicted by chance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, statistical procedures used are outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sd001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sg007">Figure S7</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results presented here use microarray expression analysis to show that dosage compensation in mouse ES cells involves up-regulation of X-linked genes in both males and females, together with the progressive, differentiation-dependent silencing of genes on one of the two female X chromosomes. We find that up-regulation is present prior to ES cell differentiation and is present also in male (and most likely female) ICMs. Up-regulation of X-linked gene expression in male and female cells is consistent with the overall ∼1:1 expression ratio of X-linked and autosomal genes calculated from analysis of publicly available microarray expression data for a wide range of mouse and human cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b011">11</xref>].</p>

        <title>Progressive Silencing of X-Linked Genes in Differentiating Female ES Cells</title>
        <p>Increasing the level of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA transcripts early in differentiation of female ES cells, is a key event in silencing, in <italic>cis</italic>, of X-linked genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b022">22</xref>]. The more extensive <italic>Xist</italic> signal detected by RNA-FISH, following up-regulation, has been thought to represent “coating” of the X chromosome, an event that triggers gene silencing. However, the data presented show that global silencing of X-linked genes in differentiating ES cells is not contiguous with the onset of <italic>Xist</italic> up-regulation, but is put in place progressively over several weeks of differentiation. Indeed, we find no general relationship between transcriptional silencing and any one of the chromosome-wide changes that first become apparent on Xi at specific stages of ES cell differentiation, including <italic>Xist</italic> coating and H3 lysine 9 methylation (days 1–2), histone deacetylation (days 5–7), and incorporation of the histone variant macroH2A (days 8–12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b031">31</xref>].</p>
        <p>The slow, progressive fall in X-linked transcripts is not easily attributable to experimental or technical factors. Falls in transcript levels inevitably lag behind transcriptional silencing and will show a spread of values that reflects how promptly individual cells begin to differentiate, but such effects cannot account for the consistent variation from one gene to another in the stage at which transcript levels fall. Nor can differences in RNA turnover or stability account for the gene-to-gene variation in silencing time. An unstable transcript will vanish as soon as transcription stops, while a completely stable transcript will be diluted 2-fold at each cell division (i.e., every 16–18 h). Even these extreme stability differences cannot explain variations in inactivation time spread over 3 wk of differentiation. Strain-related differences in global gene expression patterns in different ES cell lines have recently been carefully documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b015">15</xref>], but we find no evidence that differences between ES cell lines, or the mouse strains from which they were derived, are fundamentally influencing our results. Levels of expression of the X-linked genes on the NIA15K array were very closely correlated between CCE/R (<italic>129/sv</italic>), PGK12.1 (<italic>PGK</italic> × <italic>129/OLA</italic>), and 3F1 (<italic>129</italic> × <italic>m.mus castaneous</italic>) ES cells, whereas both overall up-regulation of X-linked gene expression prior to differentiation and the slow decrease in X-linked gene expression during differentiation were similar in PGK12.1 and 3F1 cells.</p>
        <p>Our observation that some genes (e.g., <italic>Jarid1c</italic> and <italic>Acsl4</italic>) are silenced on the chosen X in undifferentiated ES cells shows that up-regulation of <italic>Xist</italic> expression is not essential for silencing. However, the tendency of these early-silencing genes to lie close to the <italic>Xist</italic> locus suggests that <italic>Xist</italic> RNA may still be involved, possibly through local spreading, the extent of which is limited by the low level of <italic>Xist</italic> expression in undifferentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b022">22</xref>]. This possibility is consistent with the finding that whereas four genes were shown by allele-specific analysis, to be mono-allelically expressed in undifferentiated 3F1 cells, only two of these show mono-allelic expression in 16.6 cells, in which <italic>Xist</italic> transcript levels are 3-fold lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b022">22</xref>]. The two genes that escape silencing in 16.6 cells (<italic>Phka2</italic> and <italic>Jarid1c</italic>) lie furthest from <italic>Xist</italic>, a finding generally consistent with a local spreading model. These results also raise the possibility that <italic>Jarid1c</italic> silencing is particularly sensitive to <italic>Xist</italic> expression levels, which might help explain reports that this gene (previously known as <italic>Smcx</italic>) escapes inactivation to varying degrees depending on stage of differentiation and cell or tissue type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b034">34</xref>].</p>
        <p>Recent data suggest that up-regulation of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA early in ES cell differentiation leads to the formation of a distinct <italic>Xist</italic> domain within the X chromosome territory, into which genes are placed as they are silenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b035">35</xref>]. The results presented here are consistent with an <italic>Xist</italic> domain, but we suggest that the domain expands through the X chromosome territory as differentiation proceeds, and that genes are silenced as they come into contact with the spreading <italic>Xist</italic> RNA. The progressive increase in <italic>Xist</italic> transcript levels during differentiation of female, but not male, ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-sg001">Figure S1</xref>C) is consistent with an expanding <italic>Xist</italic> domain. The stage at which any gene is silenced will therefore depend on its position within the X chromosome territory relative to the <italic>Xist</italic> locus. These positions will depend on how the X chromosome is folded within its territory, and for all genes except those most proximal to <italic>Xist</italic>, the folding need bear little relationship to the gene's (linear) position on the chromosome, which we find to be the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-st002">Table S2</xref>). We do find, as predicted by the spreading model, that genes that lie close together on the chromosome (within about 40 kb) tend to be silenced at about the same time, as measured by cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050326-st003">Table S3</xref>). None of this evidence is inconsistent with the possibility that some genes at least may be actively drawn into the <italic>Xist</italic> domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b020">20</xref>]; it is possible that <italic>Xist</italic> spreading and gene repositioning occur in parallel.</p>
        <p>In the model we propose, the pattern of gene silencing through differentiation is critically dependent on the configuration of the X chromosome territory, specifically the positioning of the <italic>Xist</italic> locus and of other loci relative to it. Differential reconfiguration of X chromosome territories in female cells prior to the onset of X inactivation, or even changes in their intranuclear location, may be a crucial initial step in the X inactivation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b036">36</xref>]. The fact that XY male ES cells express low levels of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA prior to differentiation, but do not inactivate genes proximal to <italic>Xist</italic> (e.g., <italic>Gm784</italic>, <italic>Acsl4</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050326-g006">Figure 6</xref>), indicates that <italic>Xist</italic> RNA is not the sole determinant of inactivation. Perhaps configuration of the X chromosome territory or chromatin conformation in undifferentiated male ES cells is such as to preclude contact between <italic>Xist</italic> RNA and critical X-linked loci. Our previous observation that X-linked genes in female ES cells carry levels of histone modifications associated with transcriptional activity that are higher than those in males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b037">37</xref>] raises the intriguing possibility that chromatin modifications might help determine susceptibility to <italic>Xist</italic> silencing. In this respect, it is interesting that the dosage compensation complex in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>, which includes <italic>roX</italic> RNAs, preferentially targets transcriptionally active genes, possibly through their distinctive histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b038">38</xref>].</p>

        <title>Evolutionary Considerations</title>
        <p>Dosage compensation is a rapidly evolving process, and the mechanisms by which it is accomplished vary from one organism to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b038">38</xref>]. It is interesting to ask whether evolution is driven predominantly by a need to equalise overall X-linked and autosomal expression levels, or whether transcript levels of key individual genes exert the major selection pressure. Recent studies on expression of Z-linked genes in birds, in which females are heterogametic (ZW) and males homogametic (ZZ), throw some interesting light on this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b039">39</xref>]. For a representative group of genes in various tissues in two species (zebra finch and chicken), the expression of Z-linked genes was consistently and significantly higher in ZZ males—where the Z:autosome expression ratio was around 1—than in ZW females—where the Z:autosome ratio ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 depending on the tissue. These findings indicate that dosage compensation is incomplete in birds, and that higher eukaryotes can tolerate significant overall differences in gene expression between the sexes and between X-linked and autosomal genes.</p>
        <p>It now seems that the three model organisms commonly used to study dosage compensation: fruit fly (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>), mouse (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Mus musculus</named-content>), and the nematode worm <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> have all adopted up-regulation of X-linked gene expression in XY (or XO) males as a means of balancing X:autosome expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b038">38</xref>]. In mouse and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b041">41</xref>] there is also an overall suppression of X-linked transcription in XX females/ hermaphrodites. The extra complexity of the mammalian, and worm, mechanisms is likely to reflect their evolutionary histories. It is generally accepted that the gene-poor Y chromosome is the evolutionary result of progressive degeneration of one of two originally homologous chromosomes, one of which (the proto-Y) carried a sex-determining allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b043">43</xref>]. Restricted crossing-over at and around the sex-determining locus, which is necessary to prevent the formation of intersex states, allows the progressive spread of mutations and the loss of functional genes along the proto-Y by reducing the selection pressure to which they are subjected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b008">8</xref>]. For many mutated genes, selection pressure will favour up-regulation of the remaining functional allele to restore the original transcript levels. The magnitude of this selection pressure will depend on the sensitivity of the gene product's function to transcript level. If in mammals (and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content>), unlike <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the newly evolving up-regulation mechanism were expressed from the beginning in both males and females, then a female-specific silencing mechanism would need to evolve in parallel to suppress damaging overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b042">42</xref>]. The fact that the up-regulation of X-linked genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is male-specific, whereas that in the mouse is not, suggests that the mechanisms by which up-regulation is achieved may be fundamentally different in the two organisms, despite the presence in mammals of homologues of several of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dosage-compensation complex components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050326-b045">45</xref>]. Unravelling the up-regulation mechanism in mammals and defining how it interacts, if at all, with <italic>Xist</italic>-mediated silencing to optimise expression of X-linked genes are now questions of particular interest.</p>

          <p>The graph shows how levels of expression of individual X-linked genes change after 7 d of differentiation in two female ES cell lines: PGK12.1 (<italic>x</italic>-axis) and 3F1 (<italic>y</italic>-axis). For each cell line, cDNAs from undifferentiated and differentiated cells were co-hybridised to the same slide, and the difference in expression was calculated as an M value (day 7:day 0 ratio, log<sub>2</sub> scale). Pearson product moment correlation coefficients (<italic>r</italic> value) and probabilities of chance correlation (<italic>p</italic>) are shown. These experiments were carried out with an NIA15K “half library”, and the number of data points is less than shown in other figures.</p>
