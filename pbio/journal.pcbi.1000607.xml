<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cellular differentiation is the process by which a less specialized cell becomes a more specialized cell type, characterized by the expression pattern of a subset of genes (called <italic>marker genes</italic> hereafter) during the differentiation process. The search for marker genes is widely pursued in almost every differentiation process, although a principled approach is still missing. The current practice is to separate distinguishable cell types, measure gene expression from each cell type, and then identify differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s006">Table S1</xref>). Such methods require the expression data for both cell types to be available. A limitation of these methods is that by the time the cell types are distinguishable, for example by morphology, many genes have already shown differential expression. This set of differentially expressed genes may include the class of “early marker genes” that are enriched for markers of early differentiating cell lineages as well as genes whose down-regulation triggers differentiation. However, the set of differentially expressed genes will also include a second, larger class of genes in which gene expression is not important to the regulation of the differentiation process but in which genes are simply characteristic of the fully differentiated cell types. Traditional sample comparison procedures are not designed to separate the two classes differentially expressed genes and as a result, the large lists of differentially expressed genes usually do not provide direct guidance for dissecting underlining mechanisms of differentiation.</p>
<p>Recognizing early marker genes enables separation of cell types at an early stage of differentiation; in turn, separating cell types at an early stage of differentiation enables identification of early marker genes. However, neither piece of the puzzle is currently available to a study of a new differentiation process.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that, contrary to common belief, early marker genes can be detected by measuring the average expression of a mixture of cell types, provided that enough biological replicates have been measured and statistical test based on variance ratio has been used. We provide (1) the theoretical reasoning, (2) a statistical method, and (3) two validation experiments.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the early stages of differentiation, a parental population of cells gives rise to at least one descendent cell type, generating a mixed population of both parent and descendent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In a general experimental design, the average expression of a gene in the cell mixture is measured, for example by microarrays, at a few time points (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) during the differentiation process. Biological replicates (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are available for every time point. Our task is to identify the earliest group of genes that have differential expression patterns. For a toy example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g001">Figure 1</xref>), this group of genes includes Gene 1 only, although all three genes have changed expression values over time. After time T1, the average expression level in a mixed cell population is measured for Gene 1 (dotted line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). After T1, the variance of measured expression of Gene 1 across biological replicates should inflate as compared to its variance before T1. The reason for this variance inflation is that the percentage of descendent cells is not identical across biological replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s009">Text S1</xref>). For example, at t<sub>2</sub>, biological replicate 1 may have 50% parental cells and 50% descendent cells, whereas biological replicate 2 may have an 80%–20% split of parental and descendent cells in the mixture (see Fig 5B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Dietrich1">[1]</xref> as an example). In contrast to a nearly 100% parental cell population at t<sub>0</sub> for all biological replicates, the difference in percentage of sub-populations after differentiation is a signal that can be utilized in a statistical method, hereafter referred to as Differentiation-Test (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Although the description of rationales above has various simplified assumptions, inflation of variance is intrinsic to unsynchronized differentiation events across biological replicates. Neither the model nor the applications assume the parental population is homogeneous (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<title>A toy example of gene expression levels during a cellular differentiation process.</title>
<p>(A) Two differentiation events happened at T1 and T2, respectively. From T1, Gene 1 has two expression levels in two subsets of cells in the cell mixture. Gene expression data are available at t<sub>0</sub> to t<sub>4</sub>. (B) The solid black and green lines are not observed after T1 and T2, respectively; instead, the dotted lines are observed as mean expression levels of the cell mixture from microarray data.</p>

<p>We used this approach to study the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells into embryoid bodies (EB). Very early in this differentiation process, different subsets of mES cells start to show different expression changes that then bias the development towards different lineages. These early marker genes are probably small in number, and the timing of their changes in early differentiating cells may be stochastic and exhibit large variation in replicate experiments. As differentiation continues, there will be further changes in the expression of these genes as well as in a larger number of other genes characteristic of the fully differentiated states of the various lineages (e.g., ectoderm, mesoderm, visceral and definitive endoderm). Strictly speaking, a time dependent mixture of two or more cell populations, as formulated in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section and the above titration experiment, is too simplistic to model the setting of mES to EB differentiation. However, the Differentiation-Test derived from such a model should still be applicable in this setting. At an early time point, such as 4 days after differentiation, the stochastic timing of the changes in an early marker gene will lead to increased variability of its measured expression level in biological replicates. The Differentiation-Test was designed to detect exactly this increased variability. To test this idea, we differentiated mES cells spontaneously into EBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Gene expression of six biological replicates of undifferentiated mES cells (0-day), as well as 4-day, 8-day and 14-day EBs was measured by Affymetrix microarrays (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We applied the Differentiation-Test to this dataset and identified the top 200 differentially expressed genes of 4-day and 8-day EBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s010">Text S2</xref>). These time points represented early stages of mES differentiation because after 8 days, numerous cystic structures were observed to become progressively larger over time. As a benchmark experiment, Zhou et al. used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to obtain the subset of differentiating mES cells that express a GFP under the control of an Oct4 promoter (Oct4+) and the subset of cells that do not express Oct4-promoter controlled GFP (Oct4−) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Zhou1">[2]</xref>. Oct4 is master regulator of self-renewal of mES cells, and its expression level is used as the indicator of the differentiation state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Ivanova1">[3]</xref>. Differentially expressed genes between Oct4+ and Oct4− cells reported by Zhou et al. were used as a benchmark gene list. The statistical significance of the overlap between the Differentiation-Test reported gene lists and the benchmark genes was assessed by Fisher's Exact Test, generating p-values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for 4-day and 8-day EBs, respectively. These small p-values were not due to a particular cutoff of the number of top-ranking genes reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s007">Table S2</xref>). In contrast, in testing 10,000 random lists of 200 genes each against the benchmark list, none (0%) of these reached p-values as significant as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In fact, the Differentiation-Test's top-ranked transcription regulators in 4-day EBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s008">Table S3</xref>) included a number of markers of early differentiation, including Sox4, Egr1, Id2, and Pax6 (ranked as 6, 9, 12, and 36, respectively), as well as known self-renewal regulators of mES cells, including Klf4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Jiang1">[4]</xref>, and Oct4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Nichols1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Niwa1">[6]</xref> (ranked 1 and 13, respectively). In contrast, a traditional T-test between 4-day EBs and undifferentiated mES cells failed to reveal any of these differentially expressed genes because 4-day EBs still had a similar mean expression of the marker genes as 0-day mES cells (Column H, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s008">Table S3</xref>). For example, T-test p-values for Klf4 and Oct4 are 0.90 and 0.95, respectively. These test results suggest that the Differentiation-Test detected differentially expressed genes in a very early stage of the differentiation process, generating consistent results to those obtained from a laborious experimental procedure of cell sorting. Cell sorting requires prior knowledge of a marker gene that is differentially expressed, which may not be available for every differentiation process in future studies.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the Differentiation-Test reported list would include <italic>uncharacterized</italic> critical regulators of pluripotency and self-renewal. Self-renewal regulators should have a lower expression in differentiated cells and therefore should be detectable in the cell mixture of 4-day EBs. We used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to further study two transcription regulators detected by the Differentiation-Test, namely, Smarcad1 and Pias2. They ranked 10 and 99 respectively among all transcription regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s008">Table S3</xref>). The other top-ranking regulators were not picked for experimental validation because they had known regulatory roles in ES cell differentiation. Upon 2 days of Smarcad1 shRNA induction, ES cells started to take on a flattened morphology; large percentages of cells lost Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that the knockdown of Smarcad1 induced the expression of Fgf5, a growth factor involved in multiple differentiation processes including differentiation to the neuronal lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Reuss1">[7]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). At 4 days of shRNA induction, we observed further loss of AP staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), reduction in pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, as well as induction of multiple differentiation marker genes including Fgf5, Cdx2, and Hand1, confirming that the cells depleted of Smarcad1 lost the ability to maintain their stemness state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). Multiple shRNA constructs targeting different regions of the target genes gave the same results. On the other hand, neither mock shRNA nor shRNA knockdown of Pias2 induced ES cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These results demonstrate the ability of the Differentiation-Test to identify novel self-renewal regulators.</p>

(A) Two days after puromycin selection, the colony morphology of typical undifferentiated ES cells with positive alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining (red) was maintained in two control experiments (Empty and Luci) and three Pias2 knockdown experiments. In contrast, flattened fibroblast-like cells were formed in each Smarcad1 knockdown experiment, and AP staining in Smarcad1 depleted cells was reduced.

<p>A regulatory network of early differentiation genes might reveal the critical events that underlie the earliest differentiation of ES cells. Using the genes identified by the Differentiation-Test, we constructed a gene regulatory network (GRN) that demonstrates the transition of ES cells to 4-day EBs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Nodes of this GRN were top-ranked transcription factors and signal transduction genes detected by the Differentiation-Test in 4-day EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Regulatory relationships among these nodes were taken from published results of ChIP-chip experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Jiang1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Boyer1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Loh1">[9]</xref>, ChIP-seq experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Chen1">[10]</xref>, and RNAi followed by microarray experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Ivanova1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Jiang1">[4]</xref>. Comparing the mean expression value of a gene in Oct4 expressing cells (Oct4+) and Oct4 non-expressing cells (Oct4−) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Zhou1">[2]</xref>, we separated the differentiation regulators into two modules: the upregulated module during differentiation (termed the differentiation module, yellow nodes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and the downregulated module (termed the pluripotency module, blue and red nodes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The DNA binding motif of RBP-J, the canonical downstream transcription factor of the Notch signaling pathway, is strongly enriched in the upstream regions of the differentiation module as compared to those of the pluripotency module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s011">Text S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Elkon1">[11]</xref>, suggesting the Notch signaling pathway might trigger the early differentiation of ES cells. These data are consistent with recent reports that Notch signaling promotes neural lineage entry of mES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Lowell1">[12]</xref> and that it is required for undifferentiated human ES cells to form the progeny of all three embryonic germ layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Yu1">[13]</xref>.</p>

<p>Modules and regulatory relationships. Yellow and blue nodes represent genes that are up- and down-regulated in differentiated cells. All blue and yellow nodes are collectively termed as pluripotency and differentiation modules, respectively. Edges (plain edges, activators ↑ and repressors ⊤) represent evidence of regulatory relationships. Plain edges: the regulatory relationship is supported by the binding of the regulator to the target gene (ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip data). Activators: the regulatory relationship is supported by both the binding of the regulator to the target gene (ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip data) and down-regulation of the target gene expression when the regulator is knocked down (RNAi microarray data). Repressors: the regulatory relationship is supported by both the binding of the regulator to the target gene (ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip data) and up-regulation of the target gene expression when the regulator is knocked down (RNAi microarray data).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>If high-throughput measurements of gene expression at the single-cell level were available, currently available statistical tools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000607.s006">Table S1</xref>) would be applicable to the search for differentially expressed genes during differentiation. However, microarrays typically cannot measure gene expression from a single cell but can only measure the average signal from a bulk of cells. Such data demand new gene expression models from the single-cell level to the cell-mixture level.</p>
<p>The Differentiation-Test method makes a number of abstractions to the differentiation process. Most remarkably, the method assumes that the differentiation process starts from a relatively homogeneous initial cell mixture and progresses into a more heterogeneous cell mixture with identifiable events of divergence of expression levels of certain genes during the process. There are at least two sources contributing to the heterogeneity of gene expression in a cell mixture, including the unsynchronized cell-cycle stages and the cell type difference. The first source of heterogeneity is assumed to persist over time, and therefore it is adjusted for by the ratio of variances across time points. Statistically, when the initial cell mixture is not purely homogeneous, Equation (5) would have a non-zero first term in the summation. In such a scenario, the DT statistic still reflects the contrast of variation across time and the null distribution can be approximated by an F distribution with the same degrees of freedom. Therefore, the Differentiation-Test does not require the initial cell mixture to be absolutely homogenous but does require the heterogeneity of the cell mixture to increase over time.</p>
<p>The same set of core regulatory proteins and protein complexes interact and regulate the genes in both the pluripotency module and the differentiation module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The complex interactions of these regulatory proteins suggest that their pivotal roles in ES cells may not be sufficiently reflected in a binary description as “activators” or “repressors,” whereas they may serve to strike a balance between the multiple extrinsic signals that the cells receive, filter intrinsic noise of the system, and collectively predispose the ES cells to pro- or anti-differentiation states. The implications of such complex interactions to data modeling and interpretation are twofold. First, a predictive model for cell fate decision might require modeling the regulators as continuous rather than Boolean variables. A case in point is the observation that the feedback loop of Oct4-Sox2-Nanog is capable of translating continuous differentiation signals into an irreversible bistable switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Chickarmane1">[14]</xref>. Second, gene knockout data should be interpreted with caution given that a regulator may not merely activate or repress gene expression but may also buffer variability in transcription by minimizing stochastic extrinsic and intrinsic signals that create noise in gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Chi1">[15]</xref>. A case in point is the deletion experiment of the Polycomb complex protein Suz12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Pasini1">[16]</xref>. Suz12(−/−) ES cells are viable and exhibit defective differentiation, which seems to contradict the role of the Polycomb group as a repressor complex that suppresses the expression of lineage-specific differentiation genes in ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Boyer1">[8]</xref>. However Suz12(−/−) ES cells exhibit a global loss of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Pasini1">[16]</xref>, which may have lost a buffering mechanism that renders the intrinsic signal for pluripotency unrestrictedly amplified. More experiments, such as a series of knockdowns of Suz12 into different concentrations, may produce data to further investigate such questions.</p>
<p>The new gene expression and RNA knockdown data suggest that Smarcad1 is a chromatin modeling factor that contributes to maintaining the pluripotency of ES cells. Smarcad1 is structurally classified into the SWI2/SNF2 superfamily of DNA-dependent ATPases that are catalytic subunits of chromatin-remodeling complexes. Although the importance of other members of the SWR1-like subfamily in chromatin remodeling (EP400, INOC1, and SRCAP) has already been elucidated, little was known about the biological function of Smarcad1 in transcriptional regulation. Homozygous mutation of Smarcad1 gives rise to a number of phenotypes including prenatal-perinatal lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Schoor1">[17]</xref>, confirming Smarcad1's importance in regulating early development. Smarcad1 preferentially binds to transcription start sites in embryonal carcinoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Okazaki1">[18]</xref>, which suggests that Smarcad1 is a gene specific transcription regulator rather than a ubiquitous chromatin modeling factor. These data and our observations collectively suggest that Smarcad1 might be an overlooked sequence-specific transcription regulator important for both ES cells and early development.</p>

<title>The test statistic</title>
<p>Within the model for raw microarray data, the search for differentially expressed genes is turned into a gene-by-gene test of its differentiation effect:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e035" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To identify an appropriate test statistic, we examine the behavior of the variance of measured data. Given transcript <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the variance of its microarray measurement (6) across the replicates is:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e040" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the factor derived by the Delta method of variance calculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000607-Casella1">[25]</xref>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the average intensity of the log transformed microarray readouts of the <italic>r</italic><sup>th</sup> sample, which was adjusted to be the same by almost all normalization procedures, and therefore its variance is 0.</p>
<p>Equation (5) shows that the variation of the log transformed microarray readout stems from at least two sources, one being the difference of the proportions of cell types across biological replicates (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the other being the measurement error (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The differentiation effect <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> contributes to the first term <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in (9). Under the null hypothesis <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, this term is 0. Under the alternative hypothesis, this term is positive and contributes to a larger variation of the measurements <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, a large variation of the measurements <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> does not necessarily favor the alternative hypothesis, because it might be confounded by a large measurement error <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To adjust for the measurement error, the Differentiation-Test uses the ratio of measurement variances across time as the test statistic:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e051" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the sample variance of the initial time point. If we assume the differentiation effect is the least manifested at the first time point, the test statistic DT can be used to rank genes for their differentiation effect at time <italic>t</italic>.</p>
<p>Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows an F-distribution: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the number of biological replicates at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and time 0, respectively.

With a q-value cutoff of 0.1, Differentiation-Test reported 137 and 116 genes in 4-day and 8-day EBs, respectively. The overlap of the two gene lists contained 31 genes (p-value = <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000607.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) The p-value was generated from the Fisher's Exact Test for enrichment analysis.</p>

(A) Four days after pruomycin selection, Smarcad1 knockdown cells became more flattened and fibroblast-like, and completely lost the AP positive colony compared with the cells after two days of RNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000607-g002">Figure 2</xref>). (B) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of gene expression in four-day knockdown ES cells. The levels of the transcripts were normalized against control empty vector transfection. Data are presented as the mean ±SEM and derived from independent experiments.</p>
