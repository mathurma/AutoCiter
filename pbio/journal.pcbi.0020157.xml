Accumulation of such sequences accounts for at least 40% of our genome today. These integrating elements are also of interest as gene-delivery vectors for human gene therapy. Here we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of integration targeting by HIV, MLV, ASLV, SFV, L1, SB, and AAV. We used a mathematical method which allowed annotation of each base pair in the human genome for its likelihood of hosting an integration event by each type of element, taking advantage of more than 200 types of genomic annotation. This bioinformatic resource documents a wealth of new associations between genomic features and integration targeting. The study also revealed that the length of genomic intervals analyzed strongly affected the conclusions drawn—thus, answering the question “What genomic features affect integration?” requires carefully specifying the length scale of interest.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Many types of genomic parasites insert their DNA sequences into the human genome.

Fragments of genomic parasites—integrating viruses and transposons—comprise a much larger fraction, at least 40%. These elements are also highly dynamic—new elements insert and occasionally excise, and repeated sequences provide portable regions of sequence homology that act as substrates for homologous recombination. Integration of new DNA can result in changes in gene activity or formation of new genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>Integrating DNA elements are also important in human gene therapy as delivery vehicles for new sequences. Recent setbacks in gene therapy, however, emphasize the importance of integration target site selection. In an otherwise quite successful gene therapy trial treating human X-SCID, the gene therapy vector used integrated near a proto-oncogene and caused leukemia in three of the patients treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>Here we present a detailed bioinformatic analysis of integration targeting in the human genome by seven types of integrating elements, taking advantage of the extensive sequence data available on de novo sites of integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b007">7</xref>]. For the retroviruses, published genome-wide surveys of integration target sites have shown that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), avian sarcoma–leukosis virus (ASLV), and simian foamy virus (SFV) all show different patterns of favored integration sites. HIV favors integration in active transcription units (TUs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b016">16</xref>], while MLV favored integration near gene 5′ ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b016">16</xref>]. ASLV shows the most random target site distribution, favoring TUs only slightly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b017">17</xref>]. SFV integration sites are also relatively randomly distributed, though a favoring of integration near CpG islands could be detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b018">18</xref>].</p><p>Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) are non-LTR retrotransposons that replicate via transcription, then reverse transcription primed by a nick in the genomic target DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b020">20</xref>]. LINE-related sequences comprise fully 20% of the human DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b002">2</xref>]. LINEs are the only known class of human transposons that are active for transposition, the others being inactive molecular fossils. Two previous surveys of integration targeting by engineered human L1 LINEs emphasized that the integration reaction often rearranges the target site DNA as a consequence of the coupled reverse transcription–integration mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b022">22</xref>]. The published studies reached different conclusions on whether or not TUs were favored integration targets.</p><p>Another class of transposons is exemplified by Sleeping Beauty (SB). This element transposes via a “cut-and-paste” mechanism, involving excision of the SB DNA from the genome and reintegration at a new site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b004">4</xref>]. SB integration site selection in vivo has been studied by two groups, revealing that integration sites were nearly randomly distributed in the genome, showing only a weak favoring of TUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b024">24</xref>].</p><p>The last integrating element studied is the parvovirus adeno-associated virus (AAV). AAV does not integrate as a normal step in its life cycle, but under certain growth conditions a portion of the viral DNA can become integrated in the host cell chromosome. In infections with wild-type AAV, integration can take place preferentially at a specific locus on human Chromosome 19. However, in infections with AAV-based vectors that do not express the viral Rep protein, integration is not site-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b025">25</xref>]. In the AAV-vector dataset studied here, integration was reported to take place with a modest preference for regions near transcription start sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b027">27</xref>]. Integration under these conditions is not carried out by an AAV-encoded integrase/transposase enzyme, but apparently by host enzymes involved in repair of DNA double-strand breaks. During the repair process, AAV sequences are proposed to become incorporated so as to bridge between the broken DNA ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b028">28</xref>].</p><p>Though integration takes place at many genomic locations, favored specific nucleotide sequences can be detected in the target DNA at the point of integration for most of these elements. For LINEs and SB, this nucleotide sequence is strongly conserved among sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b030">30</xref>]. For retroviruses, conservation is weaker but still significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b034">34</xref>]. In some cases, studies in vitro have shown that the favored target sequence is a property of the element-encoded integration enzymes. For example, a synthetic version of the favored HIV integration sequence 5′GT(A/T)AC3′ was shown to be a preferential integration target for HIV integration complexes in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b032">32</xref>]. Similar studies are available for MLV, ASLV, L1, and DNA transposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b038">38</xref>], but not for SFV and AAV. How much these favored sequences influence integration-site selection genome-wide has not been fully clarified.</p><p>Here we present a comprehensive statistical comparison of the factors influencing integration frequency by annotating each base pair in the human genome for its relative likelihood of hosting integration events. Combined effects of genomic features were then assessed, involving analysis of more than 200 variables over 17 integration-site datasets. These variables consist of recognizable genomic features such as gene density, CpG islands, DNase I cleavage sites, etc., analyzed over intervals of varying lengths, thereby resulting in &gt;200 measures. To construct the combined model, Bayes model averaging and the machine learning algorithm RandomForest were used to sample the “model space” efficiently and thereby clarify effects due to correlation among variables (i.e., “confounding effects,” in statistical terminology).</p><p>The effects of interval sizes used for comparison were also assessed. For example, in trying to evaluate the potential hazards of gene therapy, one might want to know whether the promoter regions for certain oncogenes were particularly favorable integration targets compared with other promoters. We found that conclusions may be different and even opposite depending on the interval size studied.</p><p>In the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> section, the analysis is organized around each type of genomic annotation. The data are summarized as color-coded “heat maps,” allowing use of these findings as an encyclopedia for assessing the effects of genomic features on integration targeting by each element. In the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> section, new findings are presented in turn for each class of integrating element.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Datasets Studied</title><p>The integration site collections studied are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020157-t001">Table 1</xref>, together with the original references. To generate each dataset, engineered elements were induced to carry out integration in cultured human cells. After allowing time for integration, genomic DNA was harvested, and human DNA flanking the integrated element was cloned and sequenced. For all of the elements except AAV it was possible to obtain integration site datasets from multiple cell types. Comparison among these datasets provides information on the influence of the cell type.</p><table-wrap content-type="2col" id="pcbi-0020157-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020157.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Integration Site Datasets Used in This Study</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020157.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col6" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col7" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><hr/>Element</td><td valign="top"><hr/>Element Type</td><td valign="top"><hr/>Cell Type</td><td valign="top"><hr/>Number of Sites</td><td valign="top"><hr/>Control Type</td><td valign="top"><hr/>Selection for Expression?</td><td valign="top"><hr/>Reference</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HIV</td><td>Lentivirus</td><td>Primary macrophage</td><td>786</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b014">14</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>HIV</td><td>Lentivirus</td><td>SupT1</td><td>587</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b008">8</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>HIV</td><td>Lentivirus</td><td>293T</td><td>1,185</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b012">12</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>HIV</td><td>Lentivirus</td><td>Jurkat</td><td>914</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were selected for expression of gfp</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b015">15</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>HIV</td><td>Lentivirus</td><td>Primary IMR90 lung fibroblasts</td><td>482</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b012">12</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>HIV</td><td>Lentivirus</td><td>Primary PBMC</td><td>542</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b010">10</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>MLV</td><td>Gamma retrovirus</td><td>Hela-S</td><td>544</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were selected with puromycin</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b016">16</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>MLV</td><td>Gamma retrovirus</td><td>Hela-NS</td><td>917</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b009">9</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>ASLV</td><td>Alpha retrovirus</td><td>Hela</td><td>194</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b017">17</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>ASLV</td><td>Alpha retrovirus</td><td>293T-Tva</td><td>640</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b010">10</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>SFV</td><td>Spumaretrovirus</td><td>CD34&plus; stem cells</td><td>1,751</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b018">18</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>SFV</td><td>Spumaretrovirus</td><td>Fibroblasts</td><td>962</td><td>Matched</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b018">18</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>L1</td><td>Non-LTR retrotransposon</td><td>Hela</td><td>92</td><td>Random</td><td>Integrants were selected with neomycin</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b021">21</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>L1</td><td>Non-LTR retrotransposon</td><td>Hela/HCT116</td><td>127</td><td>Random</td><td>Integrants were selected with neomycin</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b022">22</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>AAV</td><td>Parvovirus</td><td>Fibroblasts</td><td>434</td><td>Random</td><td>Integrants were not selected</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b026">26</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>Sleeping Beauty</td><td>DNA transposon</td><td>Hela</td><td>99</td><td>Random</td><td>Integrants were selected with zeocin</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b024">24</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr><tr><td>Sleeping Beauty</td><td>DNA transposon</td><td>Huh-7 hepatoma</td><td>282</td><td>Random</td><td>Integrants were selected with neomycin</td><td>&lsqb;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b023">23</xref>&rsqb;</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- --></table-wrap><p>Another variable was the treatment of cells after infection. In some cases, recovery of the integration sites involved use of a selectable marker carried on the integrating element. As a result, the integrated element was only recovered if it supported gene expression. Previous work has suggested that selection for expression biased the recovery of integration sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b016">16</xref>], and this analysis is extended below.</p><p>For statistical analysis, the integration site datasets were compared with randomly selected control sites in the human genome. Many of the sites were cloned by methods involving use of restriction enzymes to cleave genomic DNA flanking integrated elements. Thus there arises a concern that the placement of restriction enzyme cleavage sites in the human genome could bias the recovery of integration sites. For many of the datasets studied, it was possible to correct for possible biases by using a matched random control, in which each experimentally generated integration site was paired with ten random sites in the human genome that were constrained to lie the same number of base pairs from an appropriate restriction site. In the statistical analysis, each experimental integration site was compared with its matched random controls, thereby controlling for possible bias from restriction enzyme cleavage. For a few integration site datasets, it was not practical to generate matched random controls, so unmatched random sites were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020157-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>For comparison of integration frequency to transcriptional activity, microarray data was used to annotate genes for their relative activity.

To analyze effects of genomic features on integration, we used a common measure of a predictor variable's ability to discriminate between two classes of events, which is the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (for background on ROC curves, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b039">39</xref>]).

For the analysis, experimental and control integration sites were pooled, then the score for a genomic feature used to sort the sites into true (experimental) and false (control) integration sites. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate on the vertical axis versus the false positive rate on the horizontal axis. Conceptually, the curve can be constructed by beginning with a cutpoint (the value of a predictor—for example, gene density) that is higher than the highest value for any site. The ROC curve is started at (0,0). The cutpoint (gene-density value) is then moved down in stages. The curve is extended from lower left to upper right, taking a step in the vertical direction for each correct call (integration site), and taking a step in the horizontal direction for each false call (random control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><fig id="pcbi-0020157-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020157.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>ROC Curves as a Measure of the Association of DNA Integration with Genomic Features</title><p>(A) Diagram of the ROC analysis. The graph plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate for every possible cutpoint; vertical steps result when only the true positive rate increases as the cutpoint (i.e., cutoff value for the genomic feature) moves down; horizontal steps result when only the false positive rate increases, and when both rates increase as the cutpoint moves down the graph “steps” diagonally. The example shows the effects of score.20 on SB integration (though the method of construction is general). The area between the curve and the “no discrimination” line indicates discrimination between integration sites and random controls by the predictor tested. The curve will lie beneath the line of “no discrimination”—leading to an area of less than 0—if integration sites tend to have lower values of the variable under study than random controls.

For most of the elements, the sequences are approximately 2-fold rotationally symmetric through an axis between the points of joining on the two strands—this is because, in these cases at the two ends of the element DNA, the DNA breaking and joining steps mediating integration are identical. The exceptions are L1 and AAV, for which the points in the target DNA for joining of the two ends of the element do not have a consistent relationship. Note that the values given for M<sub>ij</sub> are the logarithms of the relative frequency of nucleotide i at position j among the integration sites compared with its value among the random controls. Thus, if nucleotide i almost always appears in position j in integration sites, M<sub>ij</sub> will approximate log(2) − log(1/4) ≈ 1.4, while if it appears only once in 128 integration sites M<sub>ij</sub> will approximate log(1/128) − log(1/4) ≈ −3.5.</p><p>(C) ROC values for score.20 considered over longer genomic intervals.

This fits with the expectation that the score.20 PWMs mostly represent favored sites of binding or catalysis for the element-encoded recombination enzymes, as suggested in previous work. For L1, the endonuclease that initially cleaves the target site DNA strongly favors 5′-AAATTT-3′ sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b035">35</xref>], which explains the strong correlation between integration and the L1 score.20 PWM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b022">22</xref>]. For the SB DNA transposon, integration is strongly favored at 5′-TA′3′ base pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b024">24</xref>], and this is similarly reflected in the activities of purified transposases related to SB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b038">38</xref>]. Weaker but still quite significant effects are seen for the retroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b034">34</xref>]. AAV integration shows the weakest effects of score.20, potentially a consequence of integration at spontaneous DNA double strand breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b028">28</xref>].</p><p>Many of the questions surrounding integration frequency involve genomic segments such as promoter regions, where one is interested in knowing how likely integration is in such a region, and how important different features are in directing integration towards that region. Such questions can be answered directly by calculating the expected number of integration events at each bp in a region and adding them together to obtain the expected number of integration events for the region. For some annotations, this can be computationally burdensome. However, a less computationally burdensome approximation can be used when integration events are sparse in the genome. To determine whether the score.20 PWM helps identify longer intervals that host integration events, intervals from 50 bp to 2 kb containing integration sites or controls were scored. Each base in the interval was treated as the edge of an integration site; then all such windows were scored over the interval, and the interval scores summed. The summed values were then tested for their ability to sort experimental integration sites from controls and the results were presented as areas under ROC curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Thus, this procedure tests whether favored primary sites are clustered in the genome.</p><p>Comparison of the top row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g002">Figure 2</xref>A (ROC areas describing the effects of the full score.20 motif) to the rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g002">Figure 2</xref>C shows that the score.20 PWM distinguished integration sites from controls much less efficiently when larger intervals were tested for all of the integrating elements. This may seem an obvious result given the specific motifs favored for integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), in which a single base shift can change a highly favorable motif to an unfavorable one. However, if particular regions are rich with favorable motifs, the average score over an interval may well predict integration. For eleven of the seventeen datasets, a graded reduction in ROC area is seen with increasing length of the interval considered. This is as expected if high-scoring matches to the score.20 PWMs are relatively common, so that substantial numbers of high scores are encountered almost as often in a randomly selected interval as in an interval containing an integration site. Surprisingly, the MLV values increase with longer interval sizes, though not back up to the original score.20 values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, indicating some degree of clustering of favored motifs. Thus, the influence of score.20 is mostly reduced at longer lengths scales, though even with 2-kb intervals for many of the integrating elements the effect was still discernable.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Integration in Transcription Units and the Effect of Gene Activity</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g003">Figure 3</xref>A shows a heat map for the area under the ROC curves, summarizing the increase in integration frequency within TUs and exons. Several human gene catalogs are available, so we repeated the analysis for five of them. The “exon” ROC areas showed no discernable effect and will not be considered further. However, ROC areas for TUs showed strong effects that differed among the datasets. All the HIV datasets showed favored integration in most of the TU calls, which is consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b016">16</xref>].

For SB, one dataset showed a weak association with refGenes, but all other measures were negative.

By the ROC approach used here, TUs were either unfavorable or had no influence. Similarly AAV integration targeting was not affected by TUs.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g003">Figure 3</xref>B shows a similar heat map based on ROC areas, this time summarizing the effects of gene density in genomic intervals of different sizes and a related measure that adds transcriptional activity to yield “expression density.” As before, the five sets of gene calls are compared. The effects of each feature were tested over intervals from 100 kb to 4 Mb. All of the datasets were at least weakly positive for at least a few of the measures. Particularly strong effects were seen for the HIV datasets in lymphoid cells or cell lines, and for the MLV dataset that was selected for expression after infection (MLV–Hela-S). Also favored, though less strongly, were the HIV datasets in other cell types and the remaining MLV dataset. Of the HIV datasets, the one showing the weakest response was from nondividing macrophages—together with other measures, this is consistent with a model in which the nondividing state of these cells diminished integration in active TUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b014">14</xref>]. There was no clear pattern of interval size, type of gene call, or expression level. This suggests that features broadly associated with high gene density were most significant.</p><p>The two ASLV datasets showed weak favoring of gene-dense and intensely expressed regions. AAV, SFV, and SB showed the weakest responses—for AAV, it was unclear that there was any significant favoring of integration near or within these features.</p><p>Note that each integration site dataset was analyzed versus transcriptional profiling data for the cell type hosting the integration events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020157-st001">Table S1</xref>).

Regions of high G/C on average are gene-rich and have short introns, high frequencies of Alu repeats, low frequencies of LINEs, high frequencies of CpG islands, and replicate early. Regions of low G/C content are typically opposite in these features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b001">1</xref>]. CpG islands are defined by clusters of the rare dinucleotide CpG that are undermethylated and are commonly associated with gene regulatory regions. The top row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g004">Figure 4</xref>A shows the ROC areas describing the response to G/C content for the seven integrating elements. The two MLV datasets show a strong favoring of regions of high G/C for integration. In contrast, three of the HIV datasets show a favoring of low G/C, which is paradoxical—HIV favors integration in gene-rich regions, which are typically rich in G/C, but instead A/T is favored. As is discussed below, this may reflect the action of the cellular HIV integrase-binding protein PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b012">12</xref>]. The other datasets showed weaker and less consistent responses to G/C content.</p><p>The remaining rows indicate the response to CpG island density over increasing length genomic intervals (from 1kb to 32 Mb). For short intervals, proximity to CpG islands correlates with proximity to regulatory regions, while for intervals long enough to span many genes, the CpG island density correlates with gene density (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b040">40</xref>]). Inspection of the ROC areas for short intervals (1–10 kb) shows that integration is enriched near CpG islands most notably for MLV, which is consistent with favored integration near regulatory regions as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b016">16</xref>]. One of the two SVF datasets and one of the two L1 datasets show weaker but detectable enrichment. The other elements were not responsive to nearby CpG islands, either favorably or unfavorably. For the longer genomic intervals, HIV and MLV showed the highest ROC areas, as expected from their known preferences for TUs (HIV) and gene 5′ ends (MLV). ASLV showed weaker positive ROC areas. AAV and SB showed no consistent favoring of CpG islands at long segment lengths, while L1 showed negative correlations.

We analyzed the TRANSFAC database, which contains 546 PWMs describing DNA binding sites for transcription factors. To assess effects of each on integration, the 2-kb interval centered on each integration site or random control was given a score based on the best single match to the PWM, and this score was used to generate an ROC area describing effects of that PWM. Many PWMs showed detectable positive or negative associations with integration. The most notable was for the two MLV datasets, where a substantial fraction of all PWMs showed positive association. As is discussed below, the TRANSFAC PWM results did not have strong predictive value when analyzed together with other genomic features such as gene density and proximity to gene boundaries. However, future studies using more sophisticated scoring functions may yet reveal informative associations between TRANSFAC PWMs and integration frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Proximity to Transcription Start and Stop Features</title><p>Several measures were used to compare integration frequency for the experimental and matched random control sites near transcription start and stop features as ROC areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). The measure “boundary.dx” measures the distance to the nearest gene 5′ or 3′ end. The green coloring seen for several datasets indicates an ROC curve area of less than 0.50, which is the result of integration sites tending to have shorter distances to the nearest gene 5′ or 3′ end than a matched random control site. However, most of the cells are black or nearly so, which reflects ROC curve areas near 0.50 and implies that there is little correlation with integration. “Start.dx” indicates the distance to the nearest gene start sites. Again, integration sites tend to be closer to start sites than their matched random controls, and so is sometimes shown as more intense green. “Signed.dx” scores sites by a function reflecting higher probability of integration near start sites, so increased integration near start sites results in a positive correlation and more intensely red coloring, as is seen for several datasets. “General.width” is a measure of the length of the interval, defined by the nearest transcriptional start and stop features, that also contains the integration site. Large values thus reflect gene-sparse regions, and are inversely correlated with gene density. Each of the measures was tested over the five collections of human gene calls.</p><p>For the two MLV datasets, measures reflecting proximity to gene 5′ ends (start.dx, boundary.dx, and signed.dx) showed significant ROC values, as expected from previous work. The analysis presented here establishes that these results were mostly independent of the gene calls used. For HIV, start.dx and boundary.dx showed little predictive value, consistent with gene 5′ ends not being particularly favorable for HIV integration. The signed.dx value reflects integration in the 5′ regions of TUs, and so is positive for the HIV datasets. Similarly, the general.width measure, which is inversely related to gene density, was negatively correlated with HIV integration. ASLV and SFV showed weak responses to signed.dx and general.wd, reflecting favoring of integration in gene-rich regions, but no consistent favoring of gene 5′ ends. However, SFV did show some favoring of gene 5′ ends for the CD34+ dataset but not for the fibroblast dataset, indicating a possible cell type–specific difference. L1 showed few consistent responses, though several of the general.dx and boundary.dx calls had predictive value, reflecting potential weak favoring of integration in gene-dense regions. AAV and SB integration showed no consistent responses to any of these measures, indicating that gene boundaries do not strongly affect integration in these datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Improved Models Incorporating Score.20 Together with Other Genomic Features</title><p>We next investigated how combinations of genomic features affect integration.

Regression methods can be used to fit multiple features at once, but given the number of features and datasets to be explored here there are more than 10<sup>70</sup> possible combinations of variables to form models. For this reason, we investigated combined effects using an approach based on Bayes model averaging (BMA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b043">43</xref>]. Models with high posterior probability were collected and used to evaluate the importance of the various features; the posterior mean of the regression coefficient for a genomic feature summarizes the effect of that feature when in combination with other features in the dataset. More detailed methods can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020157-sd002">Text S2</xref> (pp. 24–52).</p><p>The contributions of each class of features to each of the integration models are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020157-sd002">Text S2</xref> (p. 40). Consideration of the genomic features in the context of the full BMA model reinforces that the score.20 indicator and the other types of genomic features make independent contributions. However, now several of the genomic features show lower relative contributions (e.g., TRANSFAC PWM scores and juxtaposition with transcription start and stop features), suggesting that these are largely redundant with other measures. Heat maps of the effects of genomic features as reported by the BMA model are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020157-sd002">Text S2</xref>, pp. 42–50. Further modeling using the machine learning program RandomForest can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020157-sd002">Text S2</xref>, pp. 51–53, which yielded a generally similar picture. We return to selected combination effects below.</p><p>We then used the full BMA model to specify the relationships among the models for the different integrating elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g006">Figure 6</xref>). To generate values to allow comparison, a sample of random genomic sites was scored for the logarithm of the odds of integration using each of the BMA models. The correlations among scores are displayed in false color in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g006">Figure 6</xref>. Green corresponds to negative correlations and red corresponds to positive. The results were subjected to hierarchical clustering to highlight the similarities among datasets. Inspection of the branching pattern shows that the first major division is between the retroviruses and other groups. Within each of these branches the different element types were well-resolved, with slight resemblance among the retroviruses, but little between the retroviruses and SB, L1, and AAV. Thus the BMA models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g006">Figure 6</xref>) grouped the 17 datasets tightly by element type, supporting the conclusion that integration site selection is dominated by the element-encoded recombination enzymes that carry out the integration reaction. Factors such as cell type, selection for expression after integration, and cell division have detectable but much weaker effects.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020157-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020157.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Clustering the Comprehensive BMA Integration Site Models</title><p>Red indicates positive correlation and green indicates negative, as illustrated by the key at the bottom of the figure.

Subsequently, general conclusions and uses of the quantitative model are considered.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>L1</title><p>For the non-LTR retrotransposon L1, the score.20 PWM allowed near-perfect sorting of integration sites from control sites. When longer genomic intervals were considered, the effect of score.20 was still detectable, though diminished. Addition of other genomic features to a model based on score.20 alone using BMA showed little or no further improvement in ROC areas. Thus L1 integration site selection is dominated by the sequence at the point of integration, and otherwise is mostly nonspecific. Previous studies had noted the strong conservation of the nucleotide sequence at L1 integration sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b022">22</xref>]; this study establishes that the local sequence had strong effects on integration genome-wide.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Sleeping Beauty</title><p>For SB as well, the score.20 PWM was the predominant determinant, though the effect was reduced when longer intervals were used for comparison. The dropoff with interval size was steeper than for L1, in part because the main determinant of the favored site is relatively short (the dinucleotide 5′-TA-3′). Addition of other genomic features to a model based on score.20 alone resulted in only slight improvements. Unexpectedly, the genomic features important beyond score.20 identified in the BMA model diverged for the two SB datasets. Proximity to CpG islands, particularly analyzed over relatively long genomic intervals, was anticorrelated with integration in the Hela-cell dataset, whereas it was weakly positive in the Huh-7 dataset. Gene density was positively correlated with integration in the Huh-7 dataset only. This suggests possible cell-type–specific differences in SB integration. However, more data would be helpful to strengthen this idea, because the two SB datasets came from different laboratories and integration sites were cloned using different methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b024">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>HIV</title><p>Previous studies of HIV integration revealed that active TUs were favored integration targets, and that trend was recapitulated by a variety of measures in this data. Previously, proximity to DNase I cleavage sites was reported not to be associated with HIV integration over short (2-kb) genomic intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b016">16</xref>]. Analysis presented here shows that DNase I sites correlate positively over longer intervals, probably because of the correlation of both HIV integration sites and DNase I cleavage sites with gene-dense regions. Other measures, such as CpG islands and transcription start/stop features, also correlate positively with HIV integration at long interval sizes for the same reason. A substantial effect of score.20 could be detected in the initial phase of the analysis based on scoring individual base pairs, but this was considerably diminished, and for three datasets eliminated, when effects of score.20 were considered over longer genomic intervals.</p><p>The BMA model unexpectedly revealed a strong correlation between HIV integration and A/T-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020157-sd002">Text S2</xref>, p. 47). This is opposite to simple predictions based on favoring of integration in gene-rich regions, because gene-rich regions are G/C-rich. However, gene density is accounted for in the BMA models, so the effect of base composition is in addition to gene-density effects. The cellular PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 protein, which binds tightly to HIV IN, has an A/T hook DNA binding motif, which would be expected to cause accumulation of PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 on A/T-rich DNA. Depletion of cells for PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 results in increased HIV integration in G/C rich regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b012">12</xref>]. The finding of high A/T density at HIV integration sites (when controlling for other effects) across all six HIV datasets suggests that PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 likely influences HIV integration in all of the cell types tested.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>MLV</title><p>MLV integration showed an association with gene 5′ ends, CpG islands, and DNase I hypersensitive sites in previous studies where short window sizes were used for comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b016">16</xref>]. Analysis presented here shows that this effect often becomes even more pronounced when larger window sizes are analyzed (25 kb to 2 Mb). The comparisons over longer intervals likely capture effects due to both nearby gene 5′ ends and more global gene density. Analysis of the effects of these features in the BMA model showed considerable redundancy with transcription factor binding sites (TRANSFAC PWMs), consistent with a model in which these features are at least partially redundant. Score.20 had a clear-cut effect on MLV integration, and this was reduced when score.20 values were summed over longer intervals, though for unknown reasons the summed effects of score.20 were actually greater with longer intervals sizes, suggesting autocorrelation of favored sites.</p><p>The effects of selection were prominent in the comparison of the two MLV datasets, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b016">16</xref>] and analyzed in more detail here. Measures of association with gene density, expression density, DNase I cleavage, and CpG islands were all more pronounced in the selected dataset (MLV–Hela-S). This is consistent with the idea that integration near these features results in more efficient proviral gene expression, so that after selection for gene expression, proviruses near these features become enriched in the population. A similar trend has been reported for HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b016">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>ASLV</title><p>ASLV integration showed weaker (though still detectable) favoring of genomic features associated with genes and gene density, as suggested previously. For example, in the analysis of ASLV integration near DNase I sites over longer genomic intervals, which is newly reported here, a consistent positive correlation was seen in both ASLV datasets. The score.20 PWM analysis showed significant effects on integration site selection over short intervals, but this was mostly eliminated in analysis over longer genomic intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>SFV</title><p>Similarly with SFV, comparatively weak association was seen with genes, gene density, and associated features. Some weak association was seen with DNase I sites and CpG islands over longer genomic intervals. Score.20 scored relatively weakly compared with other elements, and effects of score.20 were reduced or absent in the comparison over long windows.</p><p>For SFV, this analysis emphasized the cell-type–specific differences between the two datasets. The association with gene-related features was noticeably greater for sites from CD34+ stem cells than for sites from fibroblasts. In the previous analysis of these datasets, pooled SFV sites from both cell types were reported to be enriched near gene 5′ ends and CpG islands. The analysis here discloses that this is almost entirely due to the contribution of the sites from the CD34+ cells, while those from fibroblasts showed no such bias. Similarly, with proximity to DNase I cleavage sites, analyzed here for SFV for the first time, there is a positive correlation but the effect is much stronger in CD34+ cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>AAV</title><p>AAV vectors are unique among the integrating elements studied here because AAV DNA is believed to be integrated by host DNA repair enzymes acting at spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks. The AAV score.20 PWM showed enrichment for G/C at positions −1 to −3, and this was the most prominent bias detected. Possible weak favoring of integration near gene-rich regions was also seen. An intriguing possibility is that these biases reflect a nearly random distribution of spontaneous chromosomal double-strand breaks. However, it is also possible that these biases reflect a greater likelihood of these sites participating in the repair reactions mediating AAV integration. Of all the datasets studied, the AAV vector data showed the least favored integration in TUs or gene 5′ ends. Potentially this increases the attractiveness of AAV as a gene therapy vector. However, a study of AAV integration in mouse liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b027">27</xref>] suggested a strong association with gene 5′ ends and CpG islands, quite different from the dataset studied here. Thus, further data on AAV integration in different cell types would be useful.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>General Conclusions and Uses of the Models</title><p>As discussed above, the analysis particularly emphasized the importance of the sizes of genomic segments used for comparing genomic features and integration intensity. At 3.5 billion bp, the human genome is so large that the effects of different genomic features on integration may change or even be opposite depending on the length scale in question. This was evident in several ways. Changing the size of intervals used to collect values for genomic features typically changed the ROC scores. For example, the effects of CpG island density on L1 elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) scored as weakly positive over shorter genomic segments (25 kb to 1 Mb), but was negatively correlated over long intervals (4 Mb to 32 Mb). Conversely, for several retroviruses, some effects of gene density, expression intensity, DNase I site density, and CpG island density became more significant with increasing interval length. In another example, summing integration scores for each base across longer intervals also resulted in different ROC values. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020157-g002">Figure 2</xref>C shows that the score.20 index had much less influence on ROC scores when 2-kb regions were compared instead of 20-bp segments. Thus, to answer the question “What genomic features influence integration of new DNA?”, the length scale of interest must be carefully specified.</p><p>Going forward, the ability to predict integration intensity for each base in the human genome will be useful as a tool for detecting new influences on target site selection. For any new genomic feature that is found to influence integration when analyzed in isolation, it is now possible to assess whether the feature contributes information independent of previously studied features. Integration intensity can be predicted by either the standard model described here or by the standard model plus the new feature, and the predictions of the two models compared with experimental integration data. Improved prediction by addition of a new feature establishes the importance of that feature. Conversely, lack of improvement indicates that the new feature is redundant with previously known features. This method should be quite useful in evaluating the influence of newly annotated genomic features on integration. For example, a large number of new types of annotation are now available for the 1% of the human genome in the ENCODE regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b044">44</xref>], and it will be interesting to use the integration models to evaluate their effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Data Analysis Strategy</title><p>The data analysis is based on a “nested case control” strategy (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020157-b045">45</xref>]) that uses a collection of integration sites (in the role of “cases”) along with control sites (the “nested controls”) sampled from the genome (the “cohort”) to make inferences about the probability of integration at a particular location based on the genomic features that characterize that location. This strategy depends on the relationship of a log-linear model of location-specific counts of integration to logistic or conditional logit models that discriminate between actual integration events and control sites, viz. the same parameters that govern the effect of a genomic feature on integration govern discrimination between actual and control sites. The logistic model is appropriate for random genomic controls, while the conditional logit model is appropriate when a set of controls is matched to each integration site (the matching of which is done to control for possible biases in the recovery of integration events).
