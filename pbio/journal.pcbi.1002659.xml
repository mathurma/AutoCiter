        <p>Experimental studies have shown that some proteins exist in two alternative native-state conformations. It has been proposed that such bi-stable proteins can potentially function as evolutionary bridges at the interface between two neutral networks of protein sequences that fold uniquely into the two different native conformations. Under adaptive conflict scenarios, bi-stable proteins may be of particular advantage if they simultaneously provide two beneficial biological functions. However, computational models that simulate protein structure evolution do not yet recognize the importance of bi-stability. Here we use a biophysical model to analyze sequence space to identify bi-stable or multi-stable proteins with two or more equally stable native-state structures. The inclusion of such proteins enhances phenotype connectivity between neutral networks in sequence space. Consideration of the sequence space neighborhood of bridge proteins revealed that bi-stability decreases gradually with each mutation that takes the sequence further away from an exactly bi-stable protein. With relaxed selection pressures, we found that bi-stable proteins in our model are highly successful under simulated adaptive conflict. Inspired by these model predictions, we developed a method to identify real proteins in the PDB with bridge-like properties, and have verified a clear bi-stability gradient for a series of mutants studied by Alexander et al. (Proc Nat Acad Sci USA 2009, 106:21149–21154) that connect two sequences that fold uniquely into two different native structures via a bridge-like intermediate mutant sequence. Based on these findings, new testable predictions for future studies on protein bi-stability and evolution are discussed.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Proteins are essential molecules for performing a majority of functions in all biological systems. These functions often depend on the three-dimensional structures of proteins. Here, we investigate a fundamental question in molecular evolution: how can proteins acquire new advantageous structures via mutations while not sacrificing their existing structures that are still needed? Some authors have suggested that the same protein may adopt two or more alternative structures, switch between them and thus perform different functions with each of the alternative structures. Intuitively, such a protein could provide an evolutionary compromise between conflicting demands for existing and new protein structures. Yet no theoretical study has systematically tackled the biophysical basis of such compromises during evolutionary processes. Here we devise a model of evolution that specifically recognizes protein molecules that can exist in several different stable structures. Our model demonstrates that proteins can indeed utilize multiple structures to satisfy conflicting evolutionary requirements. In light of these results, we identify data from known protein structures that are consistent with our predictions and suggest novel directions for future investigation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>New functional proteins are likely to evolve from existing proteins. Most existing proteins, however, are under selection to conserve their existing native structure in order to maintain functionality (and also to avoid aggregation and proteolysis). Without such selective constraints, the accumulation of random mutations would soon render a protein nonfunctional. When the same gene (protein) is under two selection pressures, i.e. to evolve a new functional structure while conserving its existing structure, an adaptive conflict arises. This adaptive conflict scenario is at the heart of most contemporary theories of molecular evolution, such as the popular Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization models (as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Conant1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Innan1">[2]</xref>). However, these models generally require gene duplications to take place before adaptive conflicts can be resolved. This implies that such models can only explain long-term processes that involve many unlikely events, such as the occurrence of a suitable gene duplication event, followed by retention, fixation in the population, and additional beneficial or neutral point mutations in one or both gene copies. Only then would an adaptive advantage become possible. Because of these potential drawbacks, a more recent model (<italic>Escape from Adaptive Conflict</italic>, EAC) emphasizes the sufficiency of single-gene, multi-functional proteins during short term adaptive conflicts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-DesMarais1">[3]</xref>. Similar ideas have been proposed earlier in terms of the concept of “gene sharing” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Piatigorsky1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Hughes1">[5]</xref>. In fact, a gene duplication of a multi-functional protein is more likely to be successful than duplicating a protein with only a single function: first, because a new function is already present – thus it does not have to first evolve the new function in a rare mutant carrying a gene duplication; second, functional divergence can be faster because the multiple functions have already been responding to conflicting selection pressures; and, finally, retention and fixation of the duplication is more likely because the second copy can immediately provide higher activity levels through higher protein concentrations for the multiple protein functions, none of which would likely have been fully optimized in a single-gene, multi-functional protein.</p>
      <p>Indeed, there is increasing evidence that proteins have a significant capacity for multi-functionality. Not only are many enzymes known to exhibit promiscuity for nonnative reactions and substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-OBrien1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Khersonsky1">[8]</xref>, multi-functionality has also been linked to proteins with two or more stable conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Meier1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Bryan1">[12]</xref>. These proteins can be called bi- or multi-stable. A few naturally occurring cases of such proteins are known, such as the prion protein that can assume different structures. One of these structures can aggregate to cause neurodegenerative pathologies such as mad-cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Tompa1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Samson1">[14]</xref>. Protein bi-stability was also found in the cysteine-rich domain proteins (minicollagen) that form the walls of Cnidarian organelles called nematocysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Meier2">[15]</xref>. Different conformers of these protein domains exhibit distinct patterns of disulfide bridges and perform different functions. Another example is the antiviral protein RhTC, which was found to target different HIV viruses by allowing a dynamic active site to assume very different conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Caines1">[16]</xref>. More generally, emerging evidence is lending support to the view that functional promiscuity in enzymes may frequently be based on thermodynamic fluctuations of conformational sub-states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Honaker1">[17]</xref>. However, this may not always be the case, for example, if the functional promiscuity is mediated by changes of catalytic residues that do not cause conformational changes. An evolutionary theory of structure-based multi-functionality requires detailed knowledge of the sequence-structure relationship in proteins, as emphasized by the theory of neutral networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Lipman1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer2">[23]</xref>. A neutral network consists of a connected set of sequences that fold into the same native (maximally stable) structure, and a pair of sequences in the network is connected if and only if they differ by one point mutation. Proteins can tolerate a number of mutations (mostly of surface amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Cordes1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Tokuriki2">[25]</xref>) without losing their native structure. It has been shown experimentally that the neutral networks of two protein structures can be directly connected, such that one or two mutations can cause a switch from one native structure to the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Meier1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Cordes2">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Bouvignies1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Because actual protein sequence space is too vast for computational — let alone experimental — exploration using current resources, we rely on a well-established explicit-chain biophysical model with exhaustive sequence-to-structure mapping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Dill1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Chen1">[33]</xref> to provide a model of protein sequence space consisting of sequences with up to six-fold degenerate native state (i.e. proteins with up to six native structures). This model, termed the “hydrophobic-polar” (HP) model, is based on the central role of hydrophobic interactions in protein structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Dill1">[29]</xref>. Earlier studies using the HP model but with non-degenerate native states have revealed that sequence space consists of distinct islands of neutral networks corresponding to unique native structures, which can be bridged either by single-site mutations (substitutions) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Wroe1">[32]</xref> or recombinational jumps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Cui1">[30]</xref>. A key feature of neutral networks arising from the HP model and similar simple exact models is a funnel-like distribution of free energy values around a most stable, and mutationally robust, <italic>prototype</italic> sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Xia1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Wroe2">[36]</xref>, or consensus sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Bershtein1">[37]</xref>. These funnels can act as attractors on evolving proteins outside the neutral network by allowing for selection of excited (non-native) conformational states, the stabilities of which increase with every incremental step toward the prototype sequence of that excited state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Wroe1">[32]</xref>. More recently, the model was used to show an association between evolvability and phenotypic variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Chen1">[33]</xref>. Some sequences in HP and HP-like models have been shown to have multiple native structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Dill1">[29]</xref> and even exhibit prion-like behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Harrison1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Chan2">[39]</xref>. However, an extensive account of sequence spaces with degenerate native structures is lacking and most theoretical studies of protein neutral networks to date have not considered the implications of multiple native structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Broglia1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Bloom3">[47]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this context, our main aims here are to investigate: (i) where do bridge proteins preferably locate in sequence space, (ii) the manner in which bi-stability is distributed in the sequence-space neighborhood around bridge proteins, and (iii) the role of opposing selection pressures in the evolutionary dynamics that may take advantage of bi-stability. Toward these goals, we will first describe below the characteristics of the sequence space in our simple biophysical protein chain model. We will show that bridge proteins, and bi-stable proteins in general, have a high potential for facilitating evolution under adaptive conflicts. We will further demonstrate that this potential originates from a nonrandom distribution of bi-stability in sequence space. Subsequently, we will apply the concepts and insights gained from our simple model to real protein structures. In particular, we will describe bi-stability in a well-documented experimental case and also in a larger set of putative bi-stable proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).</p>

          <p><italic>Bridge proteins</italic> have been described as intermediate evolutionary states along a mutational path leading from one protein phenotype to another phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Meier1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Goldstein1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Meier2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Cordes2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Alexander1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Anderson1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Anderson2">[49]</xref>. Phenotype is often defined in terms of biological function. Here we identify phenotype of a protein with its tertiary structure that underlies function. In the HP model we adopted, genotypes are modeled by polymer sequences consisting of 18 monomers that can either be hydrophobic or polar, whereas phenotypes are modeled by the conformations that these polymer chains can configure, as self-avoiding walks, on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Dill1">[29]</xref>. The simplicity of this setup allows for a complete, exhaustive description of the sequence-to-structure mapping within the model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The availability of such a mapping is of immense benefit to the modeling of evolutionary processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Chan1">[31]</xref>. Folded proteins in short-chain 2D HP models (with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> monomers) have ratios between inside and outside residues similar to those of three-dimensional real proteins of lengths <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Dill1">[29]</xref>.

              <title>Bi-stable and multi-stable proteins acting as evolutionary bridges.</title>
              <p>(<bold>a</bold>) Proteins with degenerate native states (two or more structures with maximum stability) can function as connectors between neutral networks. Bi-stability is indicated for a bi-stable protein by a schematic folding funnel with two free energy minima. In an ideal case, the neutral network of sequences for each native-state structure can be reached by a single mutation from a centrally located sequence. This would enable efficient evolutionary transitions between those neutral networks. The frequency of such a bridge protein sequence may be maintained at an appreciable level in populations evolving under adaptive conflicts. Bridge proteins with up to six-fold native-state degeneracy (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are illustrated. (<bold>b</bold>) Box plots of native-state stability (i.e., fractional population <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) versus native state degeneracy (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of all model sequences with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (grey), and the subset of all bridge sequences (magenta). Here we follow the standard convention for box plots in descriptive statistics: For each sample defined by a given value of the variable plotted along the horizontal axis (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for bridge or non-bridge sequences in this case), the lowest and highest bars are, respectively, the lowest and highest values of the property of interest (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in this case) observed for the given sample. The top and bottom of the box are, respectively, the corresponding lower and upper quartiles of the sample, whereas the median of the sample is shown by the line within the box. The box plots here indicate that bridge sequences are significantly more stable than non-bridge sequences (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in all cases, except <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

                <p>A bi- or multi-stable protein (with a degenerate native state) is a bridge sequence if it has at least two 1-error mutants that fold non-degenerately into at least two different structures among the sequence's multiple native-state structures, i.e., each mutant folds uniquely to a different structure. In other words, there is at least one connection to the core of each of the two or more neutral networks. In total, for sequences with chain length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> studied here (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), there are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sequences in the model sequence space, 6349 of which have non-degenerate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) native states.</p>

          <p>Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002659-t001">Table 1</xref> also show that only a small fraction of the possible maximum number of connections was achieved by most of the bridges in the HP model.

However, the average number of connections among such bridges is only about two (second last row in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002659-t001">Table 1</xref>), even though there is a small percentage of bridges that can realize the maximum number of connections (bottom row in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002659-t001">Table 1</xref>). In view of these statistics and for the sake of terminological simplicity, we will use the term bi-stable below regardless of whether or not the protein has <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when the meaning of the term is clear from the context of the discussion.</p>

          <p>Having identified bridge proteins among model proteins, we now study the potential advantage of bridges for protein evolution due to the bridges' ability to provide additional viable pathways through sequence space. When comparing all 17205 pairwise combinations of the 186 extended neutral networks (with five or more sequences per core network), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of these combinations shared at least one bridge. The percentage of one-mutation connections between neutral networks increased considerably (from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) when extended networks were included, instead of only the core networks. Among the 22 largest networks (with 20 or more sequences per core network), the percentage of the 231 network pairs sharing a bridge was even higher (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Likewise, the percentage of one-mutation connections between core and extended networks increases from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Large neutral networks are of particular importance for molecular evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-MaynardSmith1">[56]</xref> because they provide a higher degree of mutational robustness and thus are more likely to be populated over long time scales when compared to smaller neutral networks with lower mutational robustness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Wagner1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Cowperthwaite1">[58]</xref>. A neutral network resembles a protein family. In this regard, a large network could allow more variants among a protein's descendant to be functional. Now our model results indicate that a large network probably enjoys an added advantage of enhanced evolvability by virtue of its increased connectivity to other networks.</p>

          <title>Bridge proteins have relatively stable native states</title>
          <p>Another factor that makes bridge proteins form viable connections between neutral networks is their significantly higher median native state stability (measured by the fractional population <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) compared to proteins with the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> but that are not bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). This phenomenon can be readily explained by the close sequence space adjacency of bridge proteins to the prototype sequences of neutral networks (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s002">Figure S1</xref> in the supporting information online). A prototype sequence is the most thermodynamically stable protein within a neutral network. Since native stability increases with decreasing Hamming distance from the prototype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer2">[23]</xref>, bridges are on average more stable than non-bridge sequences because they are closer to the prototype.</p>

          <title>Potential bridge proteins in the Protein Data Bank</title>
          <p>In contrast to the complete account of bridge proteins in a simple model that we obtained by exact enumeration, it is currently not feasible to achieve the same for actual proteins. Nonetheless, we may scan the available data on proteins to identify candidates that have a high likelihood of bi-stability by using the broadest criteria for a bridge protein, viz., the existence of two distinct structures with similar stabilities that are encoded by the same amino acid sequence. A potential source of such candidates that has recently become available is the Protein Conformational Database (PCDB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Juritz1">[59]</xref> that collects all instances of proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for which more than one structure has been experimentally determined. Because many of these instances could have been caused merely by experimental uncertainties, especially when there is only a small backbone RMSD (root mean square deviation of backbone atoms) between the alternate structures, we only considered proteins with an RMSD of at least <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which has been considered to indicate a substantial structural difference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Shindyalov1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Cai1">[62]</xref>, and structure pairs that shared <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sequence identity. Once a protein was so identified, Rosetta free energy scores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Das1">[63]</xref> (corrected for differences in protein chain length; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) were computed for both structures of the protein, and a small difference between these scores was taken to be a measure of high bi-stability. In the present investigation, only those proteins that have Rosetta-determined stability differences among the smallest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all stability difference values in the initial set of candidates screened by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> criterion were considered as potential bridges. We consider the resulting subset of candidates after two levels of screening to have satisfied rather stringent structural and energetic requirements for bridge proteins, and thus may serve as starting points for further experimental investigations of possible bi-stable behaviors. A list of these proteins is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s001">Dataset S1</xref>. Our dataset contains only single-domain proteins because PCDB only compares structures of single-domain (i.e., not multi-domain) proteins as defined by CATH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Orengo1">[64]</xref>.</p>
          <p>A selection of these putative bridge proteins is highlighted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002659-t002">Table 2</xref>. This selection comprises the ten candidates with the smallest stability difference and the ten candidates with the highest RMSD between structure pairs (Nitrophorin-4 belongs to both categories), as well as two proteins that have previously been shown experimentally to exhibit bi-stability (the transcriptional regulator Rop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Schug1">[65]</xref> and Cytochrome P450 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Muralidhara1">[66]</xref>). Lymphotactin, which is included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002659-t002">Table 2</xref>, has previously been found to be bi-stable, forming two very distinct structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Tuinstra1">[67]</xref>. However, the automated clustering in PCDB did not pair these distinct structures. Instead, it paired different versions of the same structure, which has a long disordered tail. This is an illustration of the potential limitations of simple automated approaches. At the same time, this example also reflects the challenges that bi-stable proteins pose for experimental methods that often require significant modifications of a protein and its interactions (e.g., changes in the protein's amino acid sequence, binding partners, or environmental conditions) in order to capture their alternative structures.</p>

          <p>The proteins in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002659-t002">Table 2</xref> perform a variety of biological functions. Some of the listed examples are metabolic enzymes, others are involved in epigenetics, transcriptional regulation and signaling, larger intra-cellular structures, or immune functions. It will be interesting to investigate possible roles of bi-stable structural dynamics in these proteins' function. Often bi-stability is a part of a protein's normal functional dynamics. A common example is the conformational changes that some proteins undergo upon binding to a ligand. In that case, the alternate structures are associated with the same “native” function. Such structural dynamics is unlikely to be an evolutionary response to adaptive conflicts. Nevertheless, such bi-stable behavior may, under certain evolutionary conditions, lead to one of the protein's native functional/structural states being co-opted for a different function. In that case a situation of adaptive conflict would be created.</p>

        <sec id="s2b1">
          <title>Smooth bi-stability gradients around bridge proteins</title>
          <p>As discussed above, our model suggests that only a small fraction of the sequence space are bridge proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002659-t001">Table 1</xref>). This phenomenon raises the question as to the relevance of bridge proteins to evolution, because it would appear that the likelihood of these proteins emerging by random drift is small. However, evolution toward new protein phenotypes does not have to rely solely on random drift. It can be a directed, adaptive process. In this regard, model simulations have shown that evolving proteins can respond to selection of an excited (i.e. non-native) state structure before mutations convert the protein sequence from one that folds to a given original native structure to another sequence that folds into a new native structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Wroe1">[32]</xref>. As a consequence of the sequence space energy funnels around prototypes (see above), the stability gradient, i.e., the variation of stability with respect to change in sequence, for any given protein structure is essentially smooth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Bloom4">[68]</xref>. In this perspective, because bridge proteins lie in between two neutral networks — i.e. they reside in an overlap region of two sequence space stability funnels — mutations in a bridge protein are expected to gradually stabilize one structure and destabilize the other.</p>
          <p>To elucidate this expected trend, we used our model to measure the stability difference <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between two structures, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for all sequences in the corresponding neutral networks A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s003">S2</xref>), where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the number of intra-chain hydrophobic-hydrophobic (HH) contacts (the only type of interactions that carries a favorable energy in the model; see Eq. 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). This metric reflects the propensity of a protein to fold into one or the other structure, and thus reflects the degree of bi-stability: the more similar the stability values, the higher the degree of bi-stability, and vice versa. It follows that the highest degree of bi-stability in our model is reached when the native state is degenerate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), in which case the stabilities of the multiple native structures are exactly equal. A negative stability difference, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, corresponds to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the most favorable sole native structure, whereas a positive value corresponds to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the most favorable sole native structure. Both structures are equally stable for a bridge protein. Hence bridge proteins have a stability difference of zero (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Within a given neutral network, the stability difference between the native structure of the neutral network and the native structure of an adjacent neutral network can vary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). Therefore, an evolving protein can increase its stability toward a nonnative structure, while still maintaining its original structure as the sole native (most favorable) conformation.</p>

Nodes represent sequence variants. Node sizes are scaled according to native-state stability (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a larger node size corresponds to a large <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value). Edges connect sequences that differ by one mutation. The arrow indicates a mutation from a sequence with a stability difference of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to a sequence with a stability difference of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In other words, this mutation increases stability for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> while conserving <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the native state. Bridge proteins (magenta squares) are equally stable for both native states and thus have a stability difference of zero.

Each box plot gives the distribution (i.e. the entire data range with vertical lines delimiting quartile boundaries as specified in the caption for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g001">Figure 1b</xref> above) of 623 average stability differences computed for individual sequences that belong to the same neutral network and can be mutated into a bridge protein with the same given number of mutations (i.e. have the same Hamming distance from a bridge). The stability difference was calculated between the native structures of all 623 pairs of extended neutral networks (that have at least 5 core nodes, and at least one bridge). Data for each pair was counted only once, and the color blue is used in this plot for the larger network of each pair. The further away a sequence is located from a bridge in sequence space, the higher its stability difference towards one of the two structures, and the lower its bi-stability. All differences between box plots were significant (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>

          <title>A bi-stability gradient along an experimentally determined mutational path</title>
          <p>Inspired by the finding of the gradual sequence-space distribution of bi-stability in our simple biophysical protein chain model, we applied the methodology developed above to study the bi-stability of experimental protein structures. As a first step, we conducted an analysis of a set of sequences discovered by Alexander et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Alexander1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Alexander2">[69]</xref>, who have mutationally inter-converted the albumin-binding (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and immunoglobulin-binding (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) domains of <italic>Streptococcal</italic> protein G — two structurally very dissimilar domains — by introducing a series of single point mutations that do not change the respective native structures until one critical mutational step in the interconversion. One pair of single mutations (forward and reverse) inter-converts between two sequences (labeled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) that predominantly encode either for one native structure or the other; and a small degree of measurable bi-stability was observed in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Alexander1">[27]</xref>. Recognizing that this experimental observation comes remarkably close to the situation envisioned by our theoretical investigations, we attempted to verify a gradient of increasing bi-stability toward the bridge state (i.e. the structural switch) similar to that predicted above by our model.</p>
          <p>To this end, we used Rosetta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Das1">[63]</xref> and FoldX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Guerois1">[70]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) to insert the mutations determined by Alexander et al. into the wildtype structures of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with the intermediate labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g003">Figure 3a–d</xref> (horizontal axes) reflecting sequence identity, in accordance with the notation in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Alexander1">[27]</xref>. For instance, the sequence pairs <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> share <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sequence identity. For each sequence variant, the relative favorability of the two structures was computed using Rosetta or FoldX. Structure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the favored native state on the left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g003">Figure 3a–d</xref>: it has a higher stability (a lower energy) than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this situation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is interpreted as an excited state.

              <p>In this study, the PDB structures of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (PDB code 2FS1) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (PDB code 1PGA) were used as wildtypes (wt) for energy calculations and mutagenesis. There is only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sequence identity between wt <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and wt <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sequences. Based on the 2FS1 and 1PGA structures, the structures of all intermediate mutants (sequence variants) were constructed by either FoldX or Rosetta in accordance with the published sequences in Alexander et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Alexander1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Alexander2">[69]</xref>.

The resulting trend demonstrates that this tool is able to accurately predict which of the two structures is the native state (more stable, more negative free energy scores) for each of the sequences.</p>
          <p>The FastRelax <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Khatib1">[71]</xref> method of Rosetta in combination with strong Lennard-Jones repulsions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Kellogg1">[72]</xref> was used for free energy minimization for all Rosetta applications in the present study. Because FastRelax allows for movements of the side chains and the backbone, and can therefore produce multiple similar but nonidentical structures for the same sequence variant, the averages and standard deviations of the free energy scores determined from 25 replicate calculations are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g003">Figure 3a</xref> to provide a more comprehensive presentation of the Rosetta prediction.</p>
          <p>In contrast to the Rosetta/FastRelax method, FoldX fixes the main chain and only optimizes the side chains. A possible consequence of this limitation is that the absolute free energy scores (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the wildtypes were rather unfavorable and differed considerably between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Assuming that FoldX in conjunction with side chain optimization reasonably models the relative stabilities of different sequences adopting the same given main-chain structure even though the FoldX protocol may not account for the relative stabilities of different main-chain structures, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g003">Figure 3b</xref> shows only the relative change of free energies, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, from the respective wildtype.

          <p>Based on the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g003">Figure 3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g003">Figure 3c</xref> shows the stability differences, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Rosetta) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (FoldX), with the convention that negative differences correspond to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> being the favored native state (light blue area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g003">Figures 3c,d</xref>).

          <p>A very similar trend was observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g003">Figure 3d</xref>, where instead of employing the complex free energy functions of Rosetta and FoldX, we applied a simpler measure of stability, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, defined for any given sequence with respect to a given structure as the fraction of inter-residue contacts that are between carbon atoms among all atomic contacts (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Thus this measure may be viewed as a hydrophobic contact density.

          <p>As in the computational results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g003">Figure 3</xref>, the overall native stability of the mutants measured experimentally by Alexander et al. decreases with decreasing sequence distance to the structure switch between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Alexander1">[27]</xref>.

The simulations began with the onset of a second selection pressure, for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, that is as strong as the selection pressure for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This created an adaptive conflict to simultaneously conserve <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and also to improve stability for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Subsequent iterations of the master equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002659.e285">Eq. 5</xref>) allowed the spreading of fractional sequence population <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> towards all other allowed sequences <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (i.e., all sequences plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g002">Figure 2a</xref>), representing the evolutionary change within an infinite-size population over time.

The definition of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is akin to that of free energy in statistical physics, with more negative values for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> representing higher populations.

Steady state populations were obtained with (black symbols) and without (grey symbols) bridge proteins for an example neutral network pair, under three different selection pressures: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<bold>a</bold>; strong selection), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<bold>b</bold>; weak selection), and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<bold>c</bold>; no selection).

          <p>Under strong selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g004">Figure 4a</xref>), the prototypes of each neutral network — not the bridge proteins — have highest fitness. Because the network on the left (blue) has the more stable prototype, steady-state population accumulated there (lowest <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at Hamming distance −2 from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In the absence of fitness selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g004">Figure 4c</xref>), steady-state populations are only determined by network adjacency/topology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-vanNimwegen1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer2">[23]</xref> in that sequences with many neutral neighbors in the network are more populated at steady state, regardless of how stably they fold into their native structure. A very similar steady-state population distribution to the previous strong-selection case was observed, owing to a high correlation between mutational robustness (i.e. neighbours in the neutral network) and thermodynamic stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Bloom1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Bloom4">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Govindarajan1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Li1">[77]</xref>. Prototypes generally exhibit both properties prominently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer1">[22]</xref>. In both the “strong selection” and “no selection” cases, steady-state populations are largely unaffected by the removal of bridge proteins from the networks (open symbols).</p>
          <p>In contrast, a very different steady-state distribution emerged under weak selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). In this scenario, the most stable bridge protein (magenta circle) is clearly favored over any other sequence (black symbols). This distribution was also preserved, albeit to a lesser degree, when the actual bridge proteins were artificially removed (grey symbols) so as to force the evolutionary process to populate other sequences in this control simulation. The population as a whole is more equally spread out over many sequence variants, but it is still concentrated around the intersection zone between the two neutral networks (where bridges are usually located). Bridge proteins, despite being highly advantageous, are therefore not absolutely necessary for the evolution of bi-stability. The <italic>bi-stability landscape</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g002">Figure 2</xref> helps to explain why model proteins that are close to bridge proteins in sequence space are more populated when bridges are removed: they are the next best solution to providing the two beneficial structures. Instead of equal stability for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (in bridge proteins), one of the two structures is more stable than the other (by as little as one hydrophobic contact) in these model proteins. This stability difference is still large enough, however, to incur a considerable reduction in fitness — and thus steady-state population — compared to a bridge protein.</p>
          <p>To assess the generality of the trends revealed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g004">Figure 4</xref>, we repeated the master-equation evolutionary dynamics simulation for several additional neutral network pairs. The resulting steady-state populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s004">Figure S3</xref>) exhibited trends very similar to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g004">Figure 4</xref>, i.e., a V-shaped distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> around <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> under weak selection pressures and a considerably flattened distribution upon the removal of bridges.</p>
          <p>We have also examined how evolutionary steady states are achieved in our model. Under weak selection, the model evolutionary dynamics prior to achieving steady state indicates that the population of the initial prototype sequence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreases gradually as it spreads to mutants within network A, resulting in other <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sequences being populated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s005">Figure S4a</xref>; solid blue lines). At the same time, the highly beneficial bridge sequence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases rather quickly to become the highest-populated genotype, giving rise to the steady-state population distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g004">Figure 4b</xref>. These results were first obtained using our master-equation (ME) method, which is an efficient approach to obtain the steady-state distribution. The ME describes the deterministic dynamics of an effectively infinite population that can access all possible sequences. Recognizing that this assumption may be biologically unrealistic except for “quasi-species”-like systems consisting of fast-replicating entities such as viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Eigen1">[78]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Elena1">[80]</xref>, we sought to contrast the behaviors observed in our ME treatment with those obtained from stochastic Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of finite populations of 1000 individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s005">Figure S4a</xref>; dashed lines; MC protocol described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Naturally, because of their stochastic nature, individual MC simulation runs differ. Nonetheless, when results are averaged over 100 simulations, a clear agreement in the general behaviors between the ME and MC simulations is seen, with both sets of simulations achieving essentially the same high steady-state population for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bridge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s005">Figure S4a</xref>). Not unexpectedly, the evolutionary process in the finite-population MC simulation is somewhat slower than that in the ME simulation (cf. solid and dashed curves in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s005">Figure S4a</xref>) because there are continuous population transfers between neighboring sequences in every generation in ME but the corresponding discrete population transfers do not necessarily occur in every generation in MC. The evolutionary dynamics of the control case in which bridge proteins are not allowed to be populated is considered in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s005">Figure S4b</xref>. Consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g004">Figure 4b</xref>, non-bridge sequences from networks A and B rose to significant frequencies, with network A being generally more populated due to its larger size. Because prototype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e189" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is more distant from the bridge sequences than prototype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in terms of Hamming distance (2 vs 1) as well as stability difference (−2 vs 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g002">Figure 2a</xref>), <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e191" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> becomes more populated than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e192" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e193" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and bridges are not available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s005">Figure S4b</xref>). Compared to the dynamics in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s005">Figure S4a</xref> with bridges, the time needed to achieve steady state takes considerably longer in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s005">Figure S4b</xref> when bridges are not available because no individual sequence possesses a strong fitness advantage to provide a strong drive for the evolutionary dynamics in this hypothetical case.</p>

          <title>Bridge proteins persist under unequal selection pressures</title>
          <p>To relate our model results to real proteins, we realize that it is unlikely that two selection pressures acting on the same protein are exactly equal. Indeed, the selection pressures may even change over time. To address the impact of such effects on our conclusions, we considered a model in which the selection pressures for two structures are not identical. Now, instead of using a single selection pressure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that applies to both structures <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as in the above, we consider two independent selection pressures <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e197" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We found that the prominence of bridges is robust against imbalances between selection pressures under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Intuitively, as is assumed in our model, the advantage of a bridge protein under adaptive conflict lies in the presumed additive nature of the fitness contributions derived from each native structure. Prototypes, on the other hand, are optimized for only one structure. Thus, essentially, they can only benefit from the fitness contribution from that one structure because fitness contributions from any other excited-state structure would be minuscule. If, in addition, there is a low requirement for native stability (i.e., low selection pressure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e199" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the advantage that a highly stable prototype (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) may have over the less stable (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) yet bi-structural bridge protein will be reduced even further. Only if the difference in selection pressures becomes too large, evolution will, as expected, then favor a more stable protein (e.g. prototype) for the structure under stronger selection. These trends are quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g005">Figure 5</xref>. The magenta area at the center of the plot delimits the combinations of selection pressures that favor a bridge over a prototype, whereas the blue and red peripheral areas are dominated by a prototype.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our analysis of an entire model protein sequence space demonstrates that viability of proteins with degenerate native states can confer an advantage under adaptive conflicts. In such situations, extensive overlaps exist between stability funnels of neutral networks, with bi-stable bridge proteins situated at the interface between networks. Although detailed characteristics of real protein sequence space remain to be elucidated, based on our model results we have little doubt that the investigation of bi-stability and evolvability is a promising area of future research. Bi-stability, however, cannot be the only evolutionary response to adaptive conflicts, because the two alternative conformations are mutually exclusive and thus the function of the protein can never be fully optimized. In this regard, the role of gene duplications would also be crucial. We leave this topic for another study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Sikosek1">[81]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Strengths and limitations of the present simple biophysics model</title>
        <p>Here we have employed a simple biophysical protein chain model to infer general properties of bi-stable proteins and their distribution in sequence space. The model used here is a simple exact model with an explicit representation of the protein conformations on a two-dimensional lattice. Despite their simplicity, such models capture essential features of the sequence-to-structure mapping of real proteins (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">discussion</xref> in Results), and have provided significant insights into protein folding and evolution (reviewed in Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Chan1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Xia2">[35]</xref>). The simple exact modeling approach allows a complete description of a system, but clearly such models are only a caricature of reality. In particular, only a limited variation of stability and bi-stability is allowed in our simple model, resulting in an appreciable percentage of sequences adopting two native structures with identical stability. Real proteins, in contrast, are unlikely to have exactly equal native stability in bridge proteins. Nonetheless, inasmuch as the goal of theoretical/conceptual models is to make predictions that can be tested experimentally, the main testable prediction of this work is that bi-stability can be increased or decreased by mutations leading either towards or away from bridge proteins, which are sequences that enjoy maximum bi-stability.</p>
        <p>While the fraction of actual bridge proteins is unknown, one may speculate how the HP model relates to real proteins. For example, consider the following argument: Our simple model only allows for 10 different energy states (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e215" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> HH contacts). If the conformational ensemble of a real protein was mapped onto 10 equally sized bins of energy, the lowest-free energy bin (highest stability) could contain two structures with similar yet non-identical stabilities such that the protein may function as a bi-stable bridge (e.g. see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002659-t002">Table 2</xref>). This relaxed definition of a bridge could entail that one structure would still be much more stable than the other (as in the case of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e216" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in Alexander et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Alexander1">[27]</xref>). As a consequence, perhaps many such bridge proteins do not have easily measurable bi-stability because one structure remains dominant over the other. Nevertheless, the known examples of functional promiscuity suggest that even such unequal bi-stability may be of biological relevance. However, it is important to note that bi-stability can only occur if the two alternative native (or near-native) states are both thermodynamically accessible on time scales that are relevant for molecular functions.</p>
        <p>The consequence of bi-stability landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g002">Figure 2</xref>) for evolution is that proteins evolving under adaptive conflict for two alternative structures (whose extended neutral networks are connected in sequence space) are automatically directed towards bi-stable states, and that the dynamics of this process do not have to rely entirely on random genetic drift. Bridge proteins may thus be created in the laboratory by providing appropriate combinations of selection pressures, or known bridge proteins can be stabilized towards one of their structural sub-states. So far, this gradual shift in bi-stability was studied in terms of structural phenotypes; but the same concept should also apply to other definitions of phenotypes that depend upon structural stability.</p>
        <p>The simple fitness function in the present study rewards increased protein stability. This fitness function has provided significant insights; but it does not fully capture the subtle relationship between conformational stability and biological function in real proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-DePristo1">[82]</xref>. Too much stability can be detrimental for protein function, for example. More sophisticated biophysical models will need to be developed to incorporate such effects.</p>
        <p>Future work should also improve the computational methods for determining bi-stability changes of <italic>in-silico</italic> mutated PDB structures. In this regard, the discrepancy between FoldX and Rosetta predictions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g003">Figure 3a</xref> is noteworthy. Using these algorithms, only local structural optimization around PDB structures for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e217" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e218" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was performed in the present study. We made no attempt in global structural optimization, which amounts to using an amino acid sequence as the only input to determine its native structure, i.e., solving the protein folding problem for the given sequence. For this much more challenging task, scoring functions such as Rosetta that rely on comparative modeling have difficulties when presented with sequences that have a high degree of identity but fold to different structures nonetheless. The ability of Rosetta to arrive at the correct structure can be greatly enhanced by considering not only the amino acid sequence but also including experimental NMR chemical shift data as input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Shen1">[83]</xref>, as has been demonstrated for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e219" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Shen2">[84]</xref>. This finding underlines that the scoring function alone is insufficient for this system. As emphasized recently by van Gunsteren and coworkers, the energetics that govern the structural transition between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e220" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e221" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is highly delicate and cannot yet be accounted for atomistically using current force fields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Allison1">[85]</xref>. The quest for an accurate energy function for protein folding will likely remain a great challenge for years to come. In this light, the Rosetta criterion we adopted to obtain the present protein conformational diversity dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s001">Dataset S1</xref>) is, inevitably, tentative. Nevertheless, based on the theoretical framework we developed and the general trend observed here, this dataset should serve as an impetus and provide useful candidates to be evaluated by future experimental investigations.</p>
        <p>Our evolutionary simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s004">S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s005">S4</xref>) are idealized scenarios that do not realistically capture evolution in natural populations, where usually only a small portion of sequence space would be explored by individuals within a population that are related to each other by common ancestry. Our master equation approach and the calculated steady state therefore only give a general evolutionary trend: given enough time and mutations, a population will acquire the most bi-stable proteins. Nevertheless, we have shown that the nature of bi-stability landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g002">Figure 2</xref>) – where incremental shifts of excited state stability can lead towards increased bi-stability – have the potential to speed up adaptation under adaptive conflict, whenever such stability shifts are advantageous. Evolutionary experiments will be needed to test these predictions under natural conditions.</p>

        <title>Consequences for the theory of neutral networks</title>
        <p>The increasing knowledge of promiscuous enzymes and the high evolvability of new enzyme functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Khersonsky2">[86]</xref> suggests that enzymes are in general mutationally robust for their native functions, while at the same time accepting mutations that enhance promiscuous functions. An apparently neutral mutation may therefore actually be adaptive. Even an apparently detrimental (destabilizing) mutation might promote a promiscuous function that is only beneficial under certain environmental conditions that the experimenter may not be aware of.</p>
        <p>The theory of neutral networks is impacted by the inclusion of degenerate native-state structures in that the notion of “neutrality” is moderated. While the strictest definition of neutrality (no change in protein activity/stability whatsoever) is usually not realistically applicable, a weaker definition (neutral, if the overall native structure is conserved, but a small loss of stability is tolerated) can be reconciled with experimental data. One can also go one step further and define neutral networks as <italic>fuzzy sets</italic>, where set membership is a continuous (not a binary) function over the interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Zadeh1">[87]</xref>. Degenerate native states could be easily incorporated into such a definition. Our biophysical model shows that, at least in theory, excited state conformations may contribute to promiscuous functions, and could therefore be included into the “fuzzy” neutral set of all sequences that have some non-zero probability of forming that conformation. The membership to a fuzzy sequence set could be provided by the fractional population of the conformation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002659.e230">Equation 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Neutrality depends on the strength of the selection pressures involved, so that membership to a fuzzy neutral set as defined above requires a certain threshold of minimum stability. In the same manner as a falling sea level will expose more habitable land mass, a reduced selection pressure will allow for a larger number of viable protein variants.</p>

        <title>Can evolvability be promoted by degenerate native states?</title>
        <p>The intrinsic mutational robustness of neutral networks has been proposed to promote evolvability, i.e. the capacity to evolve towards new phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Wagner1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Draghi1">[88]</xref>. High robustness allows a population to accumulate many neutral variants within a neutral network. Some of these variants may be mutationally close to other phenotypes. We have shown that the inclusion of proteins with degenerate native states into neutral networks also enhances evolvability by providing more viable sequences between neutral networks. Compared to only proteins with non-degenerate native states, these additional sequences can access a substantial number of additional phenotypes. However, strong selection pressures would generally prevent evolution from utilizing degenerate native states, especially if only one of the native states is beneficial. The higher the native-state degeneracy, the lower the stability of a particular structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g001">Figure 1b</xref>), and the lower the selection pressure would have to be for viability. If more than one native-state structure is beneficial, and if fitness effects are additive, a low stability may be compensated by providing multiple beneficial structures. Therefore, evolvability requires weak selection pressures in our model.</p>
        <p>Draghi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Draghi1">[88]</xref> have found an analytical solution to the general problem of how robustness and evolvability are related. Their results are general enough to be applied to any system (biological or non-biological) that exhibits robustness. In particular, they have provided a biological example of RNA phenotypes. However, their study does not provide any information specific to proteins, because the necessary parameters cannot be measured easily. Proteins are fundamentally different from RNA: structure formation in proteins is largely determined by hydrophobic-polar interactions, which are largely absent in RNA. Consequently, proteins and RNA do not share similar genotype-phenotype relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Ferrada1">[89]</xref>. The results from our simple protein model are consistent with the general predictions by Draghi et al. that evolvability increases with robustness, given two conditions: first, robustness is relatively low (only <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of mutations in sequences belonging to the same neutral network are neutral in our model; detailed data not shown); and second, only a small fraction of phenotype space can be accessed from each point in genotype space (true for our model, since the number of mutations per sequence is limited to 18, while phenotype space consists of 1475 stable structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-BornbergBauer1">[22]</xref>). One of the measures of evolvability that they use, and that we also have used here, is the number of mutationally accessible new phenotypes per genotype. An alternative measure is the time (e.g. number of generations) a population takes to adapt to a new beneficial phenotype. These two measures, however, capture different aspects of evolvability: one is the potential to quickly access many different phenotypes if the need arises (a concept followed by some experimentalists working on promiscuous enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Amitai1">[90]</xref>), while the other is adaptation to one specific phenotype that is under selection (a scenario we have investigated previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Wroe1">[32]</xref>). Here, we have followed the first approach of measuring evolvability, because we also impose the important additional requirement of conservation of the existing phenotype. With this restraint, the new beneficial phenotype is never fully reached by adaptation, especially since we refrain from a binary definition of neutral network membership (see previous section). Dual phenotypes (as exhibited by bi-stable proteins) have not been considered by Draghi et al. or any other theoretical study on neutral networks. By allowing dual phenotypes, which evidently also exist in nature, we allow an evolutionary compromise, whereas a binary definition of neutral networks completely prohibits adaptation as long as the need for conservation exists. In addition, our results also have consequences for the case of “unopposed” adaptation (without conservation), at least as far as modeling efforts are concerned: the true connectivity (evolvability) between neutral networks could be significantly underestimated, if proteins with degenerate native states are not considered. Both scenarios — a complete shift of selection pressures from one phenotype to another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Wroe1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Draghi1">[88]</xref> and adaptive conflict (present study) — are important fields of investigation since both are likely to exist in nature.</p>
        <p>The true robustness and evolvability parameters of proteins remain largely unknown. It appears plausible, however, that proteins may have become the dominant type of biopolymer (as opposed to RNA, or other unknown biopolymers that might have existed during early stages of evolution), in part because they produce the right balance between robustness and evolvability that allows for fast adaptation.</p>

        <title>Future research on protein bi-stability and evolution</title>
        <p>Bi-stability as a factor for protein evolution (as opposed to conformational changes that are part of the same protein function) is currently based on a few mostly artificial example cases, but has not been widely observed in natural settings. This may be caused, in part, by experimental limitations in protein structure determination, and possibly also by a lack of research focus. Conformational diversity, as a more general case of bi-stability, has only recently gained broader attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Tokuriki1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Juritz1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Burra1">[91]</xref>, but much of its potential for evolution remains unexplored. We propose that bi-stability is particularly beneficial in complex and quickly changing environments that are likely to create adaptive conflicts. One important example could be the evolutionary arms-race between hosts and parasites. Bacteria and viruses have limited genetic material for adaptation to act upon, therefore these organisms might benefit from bi-stable and thus bi-functional proteins. Further studies in this direction will be instructive.</p>

        <title>Monte Carlo simulations of finite populations</title>
        <p>The above master-equation approach presupposes an effectively infinite population. To assess the effect of finite population on steady-state distributions, we have also conducted Monte Carlo simulations under the same general conditions with respect to selection pressure and mutation rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002659.s005">Figure S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Sikosek1">[81]</xref>. Similar to the initial conditions in the master-equation formulation, every Monte Carlo simulation was initialized with a population consisting of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e305" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> identical individuals each carrying the prototype sequence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e306" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. At each subsequent time step, a random number between 0 and 1 was drawn for each of the 18 monomers in each of the 1000 sequences. If the random number was less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e307" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the monomer was mutated (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e308" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e309" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, depending on whether the initial monomer was H or P), and fitness was then recalculated in accordance with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002659.e268">Equation 3</xref>. Multiple mutations in one sequence can occur in one time step; but these events were very rare under the chosen value for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e310" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Evolution thus proceeded essentially in discrete steps of single point mutations. After all mutations were performed for a given time step, a new population was selected for the next time step by the following consideration: As in the master-equation formulation, the relative fitness of individual <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e311" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the population with fitness <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e312" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e313" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e314" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e319" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s resulting from this construction are the boundaries of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e320" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> discrete bins in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e321" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with widths equal to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e322" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values. Now, to select an individual, a random number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e323" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was drawn and individual <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e324" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was selected if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e325" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <p>In the Rosetta approach (PyRosetta v2.0 implementation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Chaudhury1">[93]</xref>), mutations were introduced using the “PackRotamersMover” routine to produce the sequence variants, then each of the two wildtype PDB structures embodying the mutant sequence were optimized using the FastRelax method, which is currently the best-performing free energy minimization method of Rosetta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Khatib1">[71]</xref>. FastRelax was applied three times in a row to each wildtype PDB structure to ensure that the resulting structures were as optimized as possible and had comparable free energy scores.

        <p>All 7989 redundant protein structure clusters were obtained from the protein conformational database PCDB (version 2, August 2011) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Juritz1">[59]</xref>. Each entry in PCDB contains a cluster of CATH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Orengo1">[64]</xref> domain structures that correspond to the same sequence. The largest conformational difference (max PCD) between two structures of the same cluster was determined, using the RMSD values (in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e364" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) that were already included in PCDB (obtained using MAMMOTH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Juritz1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Ortiz1">[96]</xref>). Stability value of each structure in a pair with max PCD was calculated with Rosetta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002659-Chaudhury1">[93]</xref> by the standard energy function (see above). If a structure had unfavorable energy (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e365" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the FastRelax method (see above) was applied until a favorable energy (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e366" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was reached. Potential bridge proteins were identified by the criteria described above in Results.

          <p><bold>Bi-stable bridges are mutationally closer to a prototype sequence than non-bridge bi-stable proteins are.</bold> The general plotting convention of the box plots are the same as that provided in the caption for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g001">Figure 1b</xref> in the main text. The median Hamming distance to the nearest prototype sequence for the non-bridge sequences (grey box) and for the bridge sequences (magenta box) are, respectively, 2 and 1. (In both of these cases, the median coincides with the first quartile, i.e., the lower bound of the box). The detailed procedure for constructing this figure is as follows. First, for each sequence with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e367" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the prototype sequences of all of the neutral networks for the multiple native-state structures of that sequence were identified. In the second step, the shortest Hamming distance among the Hamming distances between the given sequence and each of the prototype sequences was determined. This procedure was repeated for all the bridge and non-bridge sequences to produce the statistics shown. By definition, bridge sequences are connected by single point mutations to at least two of the neutral networks of their native structures; whereas non-bridge sequences do not have this property. The statistics for 3987 bridge sequences and 19129 non-bridge sequences in our biophysical protein chain model are summarized in the present figure. Non-bridge sequences for which none of their multiple native structures form neutral networks (i.e., no sequence with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e368" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> exists that folds into those structures) were excluded in this analysis because in that case there are no prototype sequences for the non-bridge sequence's multiple native structures.</p>

          <p><bold>Evolutionary dynamics under adaptive conflict leads toward bi-stable proteins.</bold> Simulations were initialized with a population that was homogeneous for the prototype of network A (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e374" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), assuming previous strong conservation for only structure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e375" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. At the commencement of the dynamics simulation (first time step), a second selection pressure (for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e376" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was introduced, thus creating an adaptive conflict. Selection pressures were intermediate for both structures (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e377" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for this set of simulations. This condition allowed bi-stable proteins to evolve. Results from two different simulation approaches are presented. Master-equation (ME; solid curves) simulations are deterministic and assume an effective infinite population size (solid lines). We used this approach to compute the steady-state genotype distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002659-g004">Figure 4</xref> in the main text. For comparison, simulations under analogous conditions were also performed using a stochastic Monte Carlo (MC; dashed curves) approach, where 100 finite populations of 1000 individuals each were simulated independently. For the ME simulations, genotype frequencies are given as fractions of 1 (left vertical axis). For the MC simulations, genotype frequencies are given as average numbers of individuals over 100 independent runs (right vertical scale). As in the ME simulations, the mutation rate in the MC simulations was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e378" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per monomer per time step. Time-dependent frequencies (time plotted along horizontal axis, in logarithmic scale) are shown in <bold>a</bold> for the following gene (sequence) categories: prototype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e379" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (blue diamond; dark blue curve), all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e380" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sequences from network A (blue circle; light blue curves), and the most stable bridge <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e381" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (magenta square; magenta curves). Panel <bold>b</bold> provides results from the control simulations in which bridge proteins were artificially removed from the neutral networks. Thus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002659.e382" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as well as other bridges cannot be populated.
