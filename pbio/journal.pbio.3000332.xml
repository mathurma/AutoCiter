<abstract>
<p>Semen is fundamental for sexual reproduction. The non-sperm part of ejaculated semen, or seminal plasma, facilitates the delivery of sperm to the eggs. The seminal plasma of some species with internal fertilization contains anti-aphrodisiac molecules that deter promiscuity in post-copulatory females, conferring fitness benefits to the ejaculating male. By contrast, in some taxa with external fertilization such as fish, exposure to semen promotes spawning behaviors. However, no specific compounds in semen have been identified as aphrodisiac pheromones. We sought to identify a pheromone from the milt (fish semen) of sea lamprey (<italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic>), a jawless fish that spawns in lek-like aggregations in which each spermiating male defends a nest, and ovulatory females move from nest to nest to mate. We postulated that milt compounds signal to ovulatory females the presence of spawning spermiating males. We determined that spermine, an odorous polyamine initially identified from human semen, is indeed a milt pheromone. At concentrations as low as 10<sup>−14</sup> molar, spermine stimulated the lamprey olfactory system and attracted ovulatory females but did not attract males or pre-ovulatory females. We found spermine activated a trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR)-like receptor in the lamprey olfactory epithelium. A novel antagonist to that receptor nullified the attraction of ovulatory females to spermine. Our results elucidate a mechanism whereby a seminal plasma pheromone attracts ready-to-mate females and implicates a possible conservation of the olfactory detection of semen from jawless vertebrates to humans. Milt pheromones may also have management implications for sea lamprey populations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Semen is fundamental for sexual reproduction. Ejaculated semen contains sperm cells that are essential to fertilize eggs. The ejaculate confers reproductive advantages to males because the seminal plasma, the fluid compartment of semen, contains a myriad of molecules that alter the sexual attractiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref001">1</xref>], physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref003">3</xref>], and sexual behavior of post-copulatory females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref004">4</xref>]. For some animals with internal fertilization, ejaculate contains anti-aphrodisiac molecules that deter or inhibit other males from courting with copulated females to reduce sperm competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref005">5</xref>]. Seminal molecules may also cause the females to cease mating and start laying eggs without further mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref006">6</xref>]. Many of these seminal molecules have been shown to be female hormones, or mimics of hormones, that regulate the reproductive physiology and behaviors of females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref006">6</xref>]. Males gain reproductive advantages by investing in seminal molecules that suppress subsequent mating in already mated females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to the well-known anti-aphrodisiac function of seminal plasma in some species with internal fertilization, seminal plasma appears to be an aphrodisiac in some species with external fertilization in which seminal compounds stimulate mating behaviors. The milt (fish semen) of Pacific herring (<italic>Clupea pallasii</italic>) induces a series of reproductive behaviors in adults with elevated levels of steroid hormones despite no physical interaction occurring between the sexes when spawning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref008">8</xref>]. In addition, female bitterling (<italic>Rhodeus ocellatus</italic>) increase egg deposition when exposed to milt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref009">9</xref>]. The milt of these fishes likely contains pheromones that trigger the documented spawning behaviors. Evidence for this type of seminal pheromone remains limited to these 2 species. However, no specific molecules from semen have been identified with such a function, hampering a molecular understanding of how seminal plasma mediates reproductive behaviors.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that male sea lamprey, a basal vertebrate that spawns with multiple mates in a lek-like system, release a milt-derived pheromone. During their spawning season, sexually mature male lampreys that express milt (spermiating males) congregate on riverine gravel patches. Each spermiating male builds a nest and releases a sex pheromone from its gills that attracts sexually mature female (ovulatory) sea lampreys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref011">11</xref>]. In the spawning lek, each male defends a nest, while females move from nest to nest to spawn intermittently for approximately 1 week before mature adults die [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref012">12</xref>]. During that period, the gill-released sex pheromone alone is insufficient to attract and retain the females on the nest, but spawning pairs have been observed to remain together for an extended duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref011">11</xref>]. This indicates that additional factors contribute to the maintenance of spawning aggregations. Because males typically release milt frequently for a week, seminal molecules released along with sperm would be a reliable, localized signal for the presence of actively spawning males in the vicinity, likely within a mating aggregation.</p>
<p>In this study, we discovered that spermine in sea lamprey milt acts as a specific semen-derived sex pheromone that promotes mating behaviors. This polyamine, initially discovered as crystals in human semen by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1678 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref013">13</xref>], evokes olfactory responses in teleost fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref015">15</xref>] and possibly humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref016">16</xref>]. We reasoned that emitted spermine reveals sperm availability and thus can serve as a signal that benefits males seeking multiple mating partners. Our data indicate that sea lamprey seminal plasma contains high levels of spermine that stimulates the lamprey olfactory system and attracts ovulatory females at subpicomolar concentrations. We found that spermine activates a specific trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR)-like receptor (TAAR348), whereas an antagonist to this receptor inhibits olfactory and female behavioral responses to spermine. We conclude that spermine is a male pheromone and postulate that TAAR348 plays a role in mediating those responses to spermine.</p>

<title>Spermine was present in seminal plasma of sea lampreys</title>
<p>Previous studies found that spermine (see structure in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) is more abundant in semen than any other tissue or fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref018">18</xref>]. To measure emitted spermine from adult sea lampreys, we optimized an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) assay and found that sea lamprey milt contained 172 ± 21 ng g<sup>−1</sup> of spermine (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

<title>Spermine activated a single TAAR-like receptor expressed in HEK293T cells</title>
<p>Next, we sought to characterize the olfactory chemoreceptor(s) that detects spermine.

<p>Spermine stimulated cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production in HEK293T cells expressing TAAR348 in a concentration-dependent manner, but not in mock-transfected cells or cells with other TAARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). TAAR348 gave robust responses to spermine with a half-maximal response occurring at 34 ± 1 μM (mean ± SEM; half-maximal effective concentration [EC<sub>50</sub>]). TAAR348 also responded to 4 other amine variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000332.s004">S4A Fig</xref>); however, they were at least 30-fold less potent and did not produce maximal responses at the highest concentration tested (30 μM; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000332.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>A specific antagonist of TAAR348 reduced olfactory and nullified behavioral responses to spermine</title>
<p>Because genetic editing methods are not feasible in adult sea lamprey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref028">28</xref>], we utilized pharmacologic tools to examine the role of TAAR348 in mediating the observed olfactory and behavioral responses to spermine in sea lampreys. We screened 22 structural analogs of spermine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000332.s009">S2 Table</xref>) as potential antagonists of the TAAR348-mediated cAMP responses to spermine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000332.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). We found that cyclen (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane; see structure in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) blocked the spermine-induced cAMP-stimulating activity. It inhibited spermine-induced cAMP production in HEK293T cells with TAAR348 in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) in the nanomolar range, 0.6 ± 0.1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Cyclen appears to be a pure antagonist because it did not induce cAMP production when added alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To assess the specificity of cyclen as an antagonist of TAAR348, we tested cyclen on HEK293T cells expressing another sea lamprey TAAR-like receptor (TAAR346a), which we found responded to cadaverine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). TAAR346a and TAAR348 shared 47% identity at the amino acid level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000332.s007">S7 Fig</xref>); however, cyclen treatment did not inhibit cAMP production induced by cadaverine in TAAR346a-expressing HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). The incomplete maximal inhibition (approximately 70% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) is consistent with an action as a negative allosteric modulator that may contribute to the specificity of its actions.

<p>Likewise, cyclen nullified attraction of ovulatory females to spermine. When both maze channels were perfused with cyclen (10<sup>−12</sup> M), spermine at 10<sup>−12</sup> M did not induce a preference in ovulatory females over the vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.33).

<sec id="sec007">
<title>A spermine receptor agonist induced olfactory and behavioral responses comparable to those induced by spermine</title>
<p>In our final step to characterize a possible role of TAAR348 in mediating responses to spermine, we reasoned that another TAAR348 agonist, if found, should replicate the effects of spermine at the receptor, olfactory epithelia, and behavioral levels. From 22 structural analogs tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000332.s009">S2 Table</xref>), we found that 1-naphthylacetyl spermine (nap-spermine; see structure in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) was an agonist of TAAR348 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000332.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Nap-spermine induced robust cAMP production in cells expressing TAAR348, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 5 ± 1 μM, comparable to that of spermine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). As expected, nap-spermine induced EOG responses of magnitudes comparable to those induced by spermine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Moreover, cyclen inhibited the nap-spermine–induced cAMP production with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.5 ± 0.3 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), remarkably similar to the IC<sub>50</sub> for spermine-induced activity. As was the case for spermine, prolonged exposure of the olfactory epithelium to cyclen reduced the olfactory response magnitude to nap-spermine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Consistent with the behavioral results of spermine, nap-spermine attracted ovulatory females when compared with the vehicle (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008) but did not attract spermiating males (<italic>p</italic> = 0.38; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000332.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). In summary, cyclen consistently nullified the receptor, olfactory, and behavioral responses induced by spermine, whereas nap-spermine consistently induced responses that replicated those induced by spermine. These results, coupled with the lack of spermine-induced responses for 45 other sea lamprey olfactory chemoreceptors that we have tested, is consistent with a specific role for TAAR348 in mediating the pheromone function of spermine.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we show that sea lamprey milt is a source of the chemical cue spermine, which attracts ovulatory females, representing a chemically defined, semen-derived pheromone that stimulates reproductive behaviors. Pheromones are described as chemical signals that elicit stereotyped responses in certain conspecifics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref030">30</xref>]. Our chemical analyses linked the source of waterborne spermine to milt. Our biological assays demonstrated remarkable olfactory potency of spermine and a strong behavioral preference of ovulatory females for spermine. In addition, we showed that a sea lamprey TAAR-like receptor, TAAR348, responds to spermine when expressed in a heterologous system. Furthermore, a newly identified, selective TAAR348 antagonist reduced the olfactory response and completely nullified the female behavioral response to spermine. A distinct TAAR348 agonist replicated spermine effects, producing virtually identical responses at the receptor, olfactory epithelia, and whole-organism behavioral levels. These lines of evidence demonstrate that spermine is a pheromone that originates in the seminal plasma and attracts ready-to-mate female sea lampreys. Our data also support a model in which TAAR348 plays a key role in mediating the pheromone function of spermine.</p>
<p>The dichotomy in behavioral responses of adult female and male sea lampreys to spermine is consistent with our hypothesis that ovulatory females use spermine to identify males actively releasing sperm in a lek-like spawning aggregation. Spermine as a male signal is highly specific in its effects on individuals of the same species, attracting only ovulatory females and no other adults. On a typical nest, a male and one to several females often stay together and spawn many times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, a signal such as spermine, released through the act of spawning, may contribute to the maintenance of the temporary spawning groups and attract additional female mates. Although spermine elicits distinct sex specific behavioral responses, both male and female sea lampreys detect spermine at the olfactory level with comparable potencies. This phenomenon is consistent with those responses observed for sex pheromones in sea lamprey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref031">31</xref>], goldfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref033">33</xref>], tilapia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref035">35</xref>], and some insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast to the highly specific pheromone effect of spermine on ovulatory females, milt itself attracted both males and females of various maturation stages. Although this has not been documented previously in other species, such a broad effect of milt on behaviors of conspecific adults is consistent with the promiscuous spawning system of sea lamprey. Other males and females, mature or immature, may detect milt odors to spy on spawning habitat and potential mates engaging in spawning activities. Therefore, we speculate that these additional odorants from semen may be chemical cues that do not directly benefit the releasing male. In fact, a previous study has shown that immature sea lampreys en route to spawning grounds track odorants of spermiating males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref037">37</xref>]. Males may benefit from their attraction to milt because an aggregate of males in a lek-like system will collectively release more pheromone and attract more females than any one male can alone. The milt odorant(s) that attracts males and pre-ovulatory females remains to be identified. Future studies—particularly in natural spawning streams—on these aspects of milt function may further explain the fitness benefit of the incredible chemical complexity known to exist in seminal plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The remarkable olfactory potency of spermine is consistent with the effects of other sea lamprey pheromones and is likely a critical factor that enables this compound to function as a pheromone. Sea lampreys spawn in rapids with water velocities up to 1.5 m s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref011">11</xref>], where emitted milt containing spermine is likely quickly diluted, forming a steep spermine concentration gradient immediately downstream of a nest. Adult sea lampreys appear to be well adapted to detect and respond to spermine at a wide range of concentrations. Sea lamprey have the ability to smell spermine from 10<sup>−14</sup> or 10<sup>−13</sup> M to 10<sup>−6</sup> M, whereas the ovulatory females showed preference to spermine from 10<sup>−14</sup> to 10<sup>−10</sup> M. The behavioral attraction to a wide range of concentrations is consistent with those demonstrated for the lamprey mating pheromone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref010">10</xref>]. The olfactory detection threshold of spermine is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of either the lamprey mating or migratory pheromone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref039">39</xref>]. Spermine is detected at much lower concentrations in vivo (i.e., EOG and behavioral responses) compared with in vitro (i.e., TAAR348 expressed in HEK293T), suggesting more optimized conditions for receptor expression and function in native sea lamprey neurons or possibly the presence of additional types of spermine receptors. Notably, spermine evokes olfactory responses in goldfish and zebrafish, 2 species that spawn in more stagnant water, but only at much higher concentrations of 10<sup>−8</sup> M and 10<sup>−6</sup> M, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref015">15</xref>]. Whether spermine functions as an attractive pheromone in these 2 species has not been examined. Although spermine is known to be an odorant, its influence on behavior has not been examined in other animals.</p>
<p>The function of spermine as an odorant may be widespread because it is likely present in semen of many vertebrates. Pheromones are not necessarily species specific, and pheromone functions can be maintained through many mechanisms of species isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref006">6</xref>]. If spermine is found to function as a pheromone in other species, it might exemplify convergent evolution of pheromone structures in distant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref040">40</xref>] constrained by common biochemical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref006">6</xref>]. It is not surprising that spermine has been co-opted as a sex pheromone, which often evolve from compounds once originally intended for other functions linked to mate choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref041">41</xref>]. Spermine is abundant in semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref017">17</xref>] and critical to male fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref042">42</xref>]. It is possible that spermine is also critical to male fertility and sperm mobility in sea lamprey, as has been shown in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref043">43</xref>]. An ovulatory female lamprey should be keenly attuned to such a signal that is a reliable indicator for sperm availability to maximize the fertilization rate and her fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Our molecular and cellular data indicate that TAAR348 appears to be a narrowly tuned olfactory receptor. TAAR348 showed robust, concentration-dependent responses only to spermine and not to other biogenic amines. Spermine as a polyamine represents a new type of ligand for TAAR receptors, which have been shown to detect mono- and di-amines previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref046">46</xref>]. Notably, the gene family encoding TAAR-like receptors first appeared in lampreys and evolved independently from the TAAR gene family of jawed vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref047">47</xref>]. It would be interesting to determine whether spermine activates TAAR receptors of teleost fishes and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>Inhibition of multiple spermine functions by cyclen treatment shows that TAAR348 likely plays a role in sea lamprey responses to spermine. Cyclen specifically and potently inhibited TAAR348-mediated cAMP production in response to spermine but did not inhibit another polyamine-responsive receptor (TAAR346a). In the olfactory epithelia, cyclen treatment reduced the EOG responses to spermine but not to other odorants, including a known male lamprey pheromone 3kPZS and spermidine, a precursor to spermine. More importantly, cyclen treatment blocked the behavioral responses of ovulatory females to spermine, but not to 3kPZS, at equal concentrations (10<sup>−12</sup> M). Furthermore, the spermine response was restored when cyclen treatment was removed. In addition, another TAAR348 agonist, nap-spermine, replicated the effects of spermine by inducing virtually identical responses at the receptor, olfactory epithelia, and behavioral levels. All this evidence lends strong support for the model that TAAR348 mediates olfactory detection of spermine. Our data, however, cannot exclude the possible involvement of additional receptors in the detection of spermine, because the cyclen treatment reduced but did not completely eliminate EOG responses to spermine. Odorant perceptions are often encoded by the combinatorial activation of multiple receptors, particularly with TAARs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref048">48</xref>]. In the future, the role of TAAR348 should be further examined through gene knockout experiments, when such techniques become feasible in adult lampreys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on chemical, physiological, and behavioral evidence, we conclude that spermine is a male pheromone in sea lamprey. This discovery implicates a new strategy that male animals use to recruit mates through the release of chemical cues in ejaculates, as opposed to the commonly recognized strategy for males to deny further courtship to copulated females through seminal plasma compounds. Notably, the sea lamprey is an abundant and destructive invasive species in the Laurentian Great Lakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref050">50</xref>] despite being imperiled in many countries throughout its native range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref049">49</xref>]. Spermine, and our identification of cyclen as a spermine receptor antagonist, may provide approaches for either control or conservation of sea lamprey populations.</p>

<p>Reagents in the Materials and methods were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless stated otherwise. Immature adult sea lampreys (pre-spermiating males and pre-ovulatory females) were captured in tributaries of the Laurentian Great Lakes by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and Fisheries and Oceans Canada; were transported to the US Geological Survey Hammond Bay Biological Station, Millersburg, Michigan; and were held in 500 to 1,000 L aerated flow-through tanks maintained at 15 to 19°C. Pre-spermiating male (232.1 g ± 29.3, 487.8 mm ± 14.2; mean ± SEM) and pre-ovulatory female (266.3 g ± 21.2, 509.6 mm ± 13.4) sea lampreys used for EOG recordings were transported to the University Research Containment Facility at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, held in flow-through tanks (250 L) supplied with aerated, chilled well water maintained at 7 to 9°C, and were used in April and May 2016 to 2018. To produce sexually mature adults (spermiating male and ovulatory females) for spermine quantification and behavioral assays conducted in June and July 2016 to 2018, immature adults were held in cages constructed of polyurethane mesh and plastic pipe (0.5 m<sup>3</sup>) located in the lower Ocqueoc River, Millersburg, Michigan, to allow natural maturation.

<title>Quantification of spermine</title>
<p>Ovulatory female and spermiating male sea lampreys were separated by sex and held for 14 hours in two 500-L tanks supplied with continuous flow-through, aerated Lake Huron water at 17.7°C before samples were collected for the quantification of spermine. Each lamprey was transferred to a 20-L bucket supplied with continuous flow-through, aerated Lake Huron water and acclimated for 1 hour. All water was drained from the bucket, and 3 L of deionized water with an air stone was added. After 1 hour, the lamprey was removed from the bucket, and a conditioned water sample was collected. The water samples were concentrated 50 times using a CentriVap Cold Trap with CentriVap Concentrator (Labconco; Kansas City, MO) and then stored at −20°C until further analysis. Milt (sperm with seminal plasma) and eggs with ovarian fluid were collected from spermiating males or ovulatory females, respectively, by applying gentle pressure to the abdomen, resulting in expression of gametes from the cloacal opening. A subset of the milt samples were centrifuged (10 minutes, 1,020<italic>g</italic> at 4°C) to separate the seminal plasma from the sperm. The seminal plasma (supernatant) was transferred to a new tube. The samples were stored at −80°C until further analysis.</p>
<p>To prepare the stock solutions of spermine (≥99%, 85590) and [<sup>2</sup>H<sub>8</sub>] -spermine (Sp-<italic>d</italic><sub>8</sub>, 95%, 705330), each compound was dissolved in water/methanol (7:3, v/v) at a concentration of 1 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>. The stock solution of internal standard (IS hereafter; Sp-<italic>d</italic><sub>8</sub>) was further diluted with water/methanol (7:3, v/v) to 500 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>; 10-μl IS was added to each sample before extraction as described by Magnes and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref051">51</xref>] with modification. Briefly, each 1 mL sample spiked with IS was treated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA; 4%, 100 μL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref052">52</xref>], vortexed (5 minutes), and centrifuged (10 minutes, 10,000<italic>g</italic>), resulting in 500 μL supernatant that was mixed with 500 μL deionized water. Subsequently, sodium carbonate buffer (0.1 M [pH 9], 125 μL) and isobutyl chloroformate (25 μL) were added and incubated at 35°C for 15 minutes. The isobutyl chloroformate residue was cleaned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref053">53</xref>] and reconstituted to 100 μL with the initial mobile phase.</p>
<p>A Waters ACQUITY H-Class UHPLC system connected to a Waters Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to detect spermine in the conditioned water and gamete samples (Waters Corp.; Milford, MA). The mobile phase consisted of water (containing 0.1% formic acid) as (A) and acetonitrile (containing 0.1% formic acid) as (B). A Waters BEH C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm particle size) coupled with an Acquity UHPLC column in-line filter kit (0.2 μm filter) was used. Samples were separated with a gradient program at a flow rate of 250 μL min<sup>−1</sup> for 12 minutes at 35°C: 70% A for 1 minute, decreased to 0% A from 1 to 7 minutes, and then maintained at 0% A from 7.01 to 9.0 minutes, increased to 70% A from 9.0 to 9.01 minutes, and then maintained at 70% A to 12 minutes for column equilibrium. The sample injection volume was 10 μL. Spermine was detected by Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode and processed using Masslynx 4.1 software (Waters Corp.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.waters.com/waters/en_US/MassLynx-MS-Software/nav.htm?locale=en_US&amp;cid=513662" xlink:type="simple">http://www.waters.com/waters/en_US/MassLynx-MS-Software/nav.htm?locale=en_US&amp;cid=513662</ext-link>). The UHPLC–MS/MS parameters were optimized for the transition of the spermine analyte as follows: [M + H]<sup>+</sup> <italic>m/z</italic> 603.4, MRM <italic>m/z</italic> 603.4 &gt; 154.9, cone voltage 49 V, collision energy 40 eV, and retention time 6.92 minutes; and for the spermine-<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>8</italic></sub> analyte as follows: [M + H]<sup>+</sup> <italic>m/z</italic> 611.4, MRM <italic>m/z</italic> 611.4 &gt; 163.1, cone voltage 36 V, collision energy 40 eV, and retention time 6.92 minutes.</p>
<p>The UHPLC effluent was introduced into the mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization in the negative mode. The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–MS/MS) parameters were set as follows: capillary voltage, 2.60 kV; extractor voltage, 5 V; source temperature, 150°C; desolvation temperature, 500°C; and desolvation gas flow, 800 L h<sup>−1</sup> (N<sub>2</sub>, 99.9% purity). Argon (99.9999% purity) was introduced as the collision gas into the collision cell at a flow rate of 0.15 mL min<sup>−1</sup>. Data were collected in centroid mode with a scan range of 50 to 1,000 <italic>m/z</italic>. The dwell time established for each transition was 0.2 seconds, and the interscan delay was set at 20 ms. Data acquisition was carried out using Masslynx 4.1 software and processed using TargetLynx (Waters Corp.). The limit of spermine quantification with the UHPLC–MS/MS was 1.0 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>. Because the water samples were concentrated 50 times, the limit of spermine quantification of the water samples was 0.02 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

<title>EOG recordings</title>
<p>EOG setup and recordings were conducted following established procedures by Li and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref054">54</xref>] to determine whether the adult sea lamprey olfactory organ was sensitive to spermine. Sea lampreys were anesthetized with MS222 (100 mg L<sup>−1</sup>), immobilized with an intramuscular injection of gallamine triethiodide (3 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> of body weight, in 0.9% saline), and placed in a V-shaped plastic stand. Gills were continuously irrigated with aerated water containing 50 mg L<sup>−1</sup> MS222. The olfactory lamellae were surgically exposed by removing the skin on the surface of the olfactory capsule. The differential EOG response to each test stimulus was recorded using borosilicate electrodes filled with 0.04% agar in 0.9% saline connected to solid state electrodes with Ag/AgCl pellets (model ESP-M15N; Warner Instruments; Hamden, CT) in 3M KCl. The recording electrode was placed between 2 olfactory lamellae and adjusted to maximize the response to <sub>L</sub>-arginine standard while minimizing the response to the blank control (vehicle in charcoal-filtered water handled in the same way as stimulus solution but without the addition of spermine), and the reference electrode was placed on the external skin near the naris. Electrical signals were amplified by a NeuroLog system (model NL102; Digitimer, England, UK), filtered with a low-pass 60 Hz filter (model NL125; Digitimer), digitized by Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), and recorded on a PC running AxoScope 10.4 software (Molecular Devices; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/18779/~/axon%E2%84%A2pclamp%E2%84%A2-10-electrophysiology-data-acquisition-%26-analysis-software-download" xlink:type="simple">http://mdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/18779/~/axon%E2%84%A2pclamp%E2%84%A2-10-electrophysiology-data-acquisition-%26-analysis-software-download</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For the concentration-response recordings, the olfactory epithelia of sea lampreys were exposed to 10<sup>−15</sup> M to 10<sup>−6</sup> M solutions of spermine. A 10<sup>−3</sup> M stock solution of spermine in water/methanol (1:1, v:v) was prepared, stored at −20°C, and then serially diluted with filtered water to yield 10<sup>−15</sup> M to 10<sup>−6</sup> M solutions. A 10<sup>−2</sup> M stock solution of <sub>L</sub>-arginine in deionized water was prepared, stored at 4°C, and diluted with filtered water to yield a 10<sup>−5</sup> M solution. A 10<sup>−5</sup> M <sub>L</sub>-arginine solution was introduced to the olfactory epithelium for 4 seconds, and the response was recorded to correct for variations in olfactory sensitivity among fish. The olfactory epithelium was flushed with filtered water for 2 minutes, and then the blank control was introduced and recorded. Next, the test stimulus starting at 10<sup>−15</sup> M to 10<sup>−6</sup> M was applied in log<sub>10</sub> molar increments, recorded, and flushed. Blank control and 10<sup>−5</sup> M <sub>L</sub>-arginine standard were measured repeatedly (approximately after every 3 concentrations of stimuli) throughout each recording session. The EOG response magnitudes were measured in mV. The normalized EOG response was calculated as normalized EOG amplitude = (Rt − Rb) ÷ (Ra − Rb), where Rt is the response magnitude to the test stimulus, Rb is the response magnitude to the blank, and Ra is the response magnitude to 10<sup>−5</sup> M <sub>L</sub>-arginine. The responses to 10<sup>−5</sup> M <sub>L</sub>-arginine standard (mean ± SEM, male: 2.75 ± 0.08, female: 3.41 ± 0.08) and blank (male: 0.17 ± 0.01, female: 0.13 ± 0.01) were comparable to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref056">56</xref>]. The threshold of detection was defined as the lowest concentration in which the test stimulus elicited a larger response than the blank (paired <italic>t</italic> test, one tailed with a Bonferroni correction for 4 comparisons, α = 0.0125).</p>
<p>For the cyclen treatment to the olfactory epithelium experiments, the EOG responses to the test stimuli (spermine, <sub>L</sub>-arginine, 3kPZS [Bridge Organics Co., Vicksburg, MI]), spermidine, and nap-spermine) were first recorded in a similar manner as the concentration-response recordings. Then, the naris was continuously exposed to 10<sup>−5</sup> M cyclen for 5 minutes. Next, the EOG responses to mixtures of each test stimulus with the adapting solution of 10<sup>−5</sup> M cyclen were recorded. The naris was rinsed with charcoal-filtered water for 2 minutes, and then the responses to the test stimuli were recorded to ensure recovery of the olfactory system.

<title>Two-choice maze behavioral assay</title>
<p>The behavioral preferences of the sea lampreys to the test stimuli were evaluated using a two-choice maze assay that was described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref054">54</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000332.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Briefly, a single lamprey was introduced to the acclimation cage at the downstream end of the maze for 5 minutes. The lamprey was released, and the cumulative amount of time the lamprey spent in each channel was recorded for 10 minutes (pretreatment period before odorant application). The test stimulus was introduced to a randomly chosen channel and vehicle (water when milt was test stimulus and methanol for other test stimuli) to the other channel at constant rates of 200 ± 5 mL min<sup>−1</sup>. The test stimulus and vehicle were pumped into the maze for 5 minutes. The cumulative amount of time the lamprey spent in each channel was recorded for 10 minutes while continuing to apply the test stimulus and vehicle (odorant application period). The maze was flushed with water for 10 minutes before the start of the next experiment to remove any remaining test stimulus. The time spent in the control (Bc) and experimental (Be) channel before odorant application and in the control (Ac) and experimental (Ae) channel after odorant application were used to calculate an index of preference for each trial as defined by index of preference = [Ae ÷ (Ae + Be)–Ac ÷ (Ac + Bc)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000332.ref054">54</xref>]. The index of preference was evaluated using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (α = 0.05) to determine whether the index of preference was significantly different from zero. Differences were considered significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. A significant positive value of the index of preference indicated attraction. A significant negative value of the index of preference indicated repulsion. A nonsignificant value of the index of preference indicated neutral. The trial was discarded if the sea lamprey failed to enter the control and experimental channel for at least 10 seconds during the 10-minute period before the odorant was applied because this was an indication of strong side bias or inactivity.</p>
<p>To assess the influence of cyclen on behavioral responses of ovulatory females to spermine, a modified behavioral assay was followed. Cyclen (10<sup>−12</sup> M) was applied to the experimental and control channel during the acclimation and pretreatment period. The cumulative amount of time the lamprey spent in each channel during the pretreatment period was recorded. Then, a mixture of either cyclen (10<sup>−12</sup> M) and spermine (10<sup>−12</sup> M, test stimulus) or cyclen (10<sup>−12</sup> M) and 3kPZS (10<sup>−12</sup> M, control; Bridge Organics) was introduced to a randomly chosen channel and a mixture of cyclen (10<sup>−12</sup> M) and vehicle to the other channel for 5 minutes. Then, the cumulative amount of time the lamprey spent in each channel was recorded for 10 minutes while the treatments continued to be administered. An index of preference was calculated as described above. To determine whether the influence of cyclen on the spermine behavioral response was reversible, cyclen (10<sup>−12</sup> M) was applied to the experimental and control channel during the acclimation and pretreatment periods. Next, cyclen application stopped, and spermine application (10<sup>−12</sup> M) started. Spermine was applied to the experimental channel and vehicle to the control channel for the treatment period. The cumulative amount of time the lamprey spent in each channel during the pretreatment and treatment period was recorded, and an index of preference was calculated.</p>

The water samples were concentrated 50 times prior to subjecting them to the UHPLC−MS/MS, so the limit of spermine quantification of the water samples was 0.02 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>. <sup>†</sup>The handling of sea lampreys most likely resulted in the incidental release of expressible milt into the water sample. Adult lamprey skin is slippery. To transfer lampreys in and out of water sampling buckets, one needs to grip both head and tail regions of the lamprey, and accidental pressure on the abdomen is difficult to avoid. N.D., not detectable; UHPLC−MS/MS, ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</p>
