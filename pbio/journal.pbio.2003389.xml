<abstract>
<p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) balance self-renewal and differentiation to maintain homeostasis. With aging, the frequency of polar HSCs decreases. Cell polarity in HSCs is controlled by the activity of the small RhoGTPase cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42). Here we demonstrate—using a comprehensive set of paired daughter cell analyses that include single-cell 3D confocal imaging, single-cell transplants, single-cell RNA-seq, and single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq)—that the outcome of HSC divisions is strongly linked to the polarity status before mitosis, which is in turn determined by the level of the activity Cdc42 in stem cells. Aged apolar HSCs undergo preferentially self-renewing symmetric divisions, resulting in daughter stem cells with reduced regenerative capacity and lymphoid potential, while young polar HSCs undergo preferentially asymmetric divisions. Mathematical modeling in combination with experimental data implies a mechanistic role of the asymmetric sorting of Cdc42 in determining the potential of daughter cells via epigenetic mechanisms. Therefore, molecules that control HSC polarity might serve as modulators of the mode of stem cell division regulating the potential of daughter cells.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Stem cells are unique cells that can differentiate to produce more stem cells or other types of cells and can divide both symmetrically (to produce daughter cells with the same fate) and asymmetrically (to produce one daughter cell that retains stem cell potential and one that differentiates). The mechanisms that control the outcome of stem cell divisions have been the focus of many studies; however, they remain mainly unknown. Here, we have analyzed these mechanisms in murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by directly comparing the epigenetic signature, the transcriptome, and the function of the two daughter cells stemming from the first division of either a young or an aged HSC. We observe that, while young HSCs divide mainly asymmetrically, aged HSCs divide primarily symmetrically. We find that the mode of division is tightly linked to stem cell polarity and is regulated by the activity level of the small RhoGTPase cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42). In addition, we show that the potential of daughter cells is further linked to the amount of the epigenetic mark H4K16ac and also to the amount of open chromatin allocated to a daughter cell, but it is not linked to its transcriptome. In summary, our study suggests that HSC polarity linked to Cdc42 activity drives the mode of division, while epigenetic mechanisms determine the functional outcome of the stem cell division.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hematopoietic homeostasis depends on the ability of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to balance symmetric and asymmetric divisions over an organism’s lifespan. Asymmetric divisions allow one daughter cell to differentiate while the other retains its stem cell potential. In contrast, symmetric divisions result in daughter cells that adopt equivalent fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref008">8</xref>]. The asymmetric or symmetric distribution of cellular components to daughter cells during mitosis is thought to determine their fate. This concept has been proposed as a way of controlling the size of the HSC pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref009">9</xref>]. However, the mechanisms that control the mode and outcome of HSC divisions with respect to the potential and ultimately function of daughter cells remain incompletely understood.</p>
<p>While the number of phenotypic HSCs increases upon aging, their regenerative potential decreases, both in mice and in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref013">13</xref>]. Aged HSCs differentiate preferentially into myeloid cells and less into cells of the lymphoid lineage. Aging of HSCs is caused by intrinsic changes in HSCs and also by extrinsic factors from the niche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref020">20</xref>]. Epigenetic modifications and altered gene expression profiles (e.g., high expression of myeloid genes), together with loss of the polar distribution of tubulin and cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42) in the cytoplasm and loss of the polarity of the acetylated form of the epigenetic marker H4K16 (H4K16ac) in the nucleus, are hallmarks of intrinsic HSC aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref023">23</xref>]. Cdc42 is a small RhoGTPase that cycles between an active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state and an inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound state. A central, HSC-intrinsic molecular mechanism that causes aging of HSCs and that results in the above-mentioned phenotypic and functional impairments of aged HSCs is an increase in the activity of Cdc42 in aged stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref025">25</xref>]. Consequently, treatment of aged HSCs ex vivo with a Cdc42 activity specific inhibitor (CASIN), which reduces the age-associated increase in Cdc42 activity, increased polarity in aged HSCs and rejuvenated their function in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref016">16</xref>]. The increase in Cdc42 activity in aged HSCs is caused by an intrinsic increase in the level of Wnt5a in HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>]. Treatment of young HSCs with Wnt5a induced elevated activity of Cdc42 and a loss of cell polarity and premature aging of HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>We hypothesized here that HSC polarity determines the mode (symmetry/asymmetry) of HSC divisions and therefore that there is a difference in the symmetry/asymmetry of division upon changes in the activity level of Cdc42 in HSCs. We thus investigated whether the targeted alteration of Cdc42 activity by either CASIN (to decrease Cdc42-GTP levels in aged HSCs) or Wnt5a treatment (to increase Cdc42-GTP levels in young HSCs), which translates into polarity changes, influences the balance of asymmetric or symmetric HSC divisions (mode of division) and therefore drives functional differences among daughter cells (output of division) upon aging and rejuvenation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s003">S1A Fig</xref>). By comparing the mode of HSC division in vitro and the output of division in vivo, we demonstrate that young and aged CASIN-treated HSCs divide asymmetrically while aged and young Wnt5a-treated HSCs undergo symmetric divisions. We conclude that, by modulating Cdc42 activity and consequently cell polarity, it is possible to adjust the mode and the epigenetic outcome of HSC divisions.</p>

Next, 3D confocal immunofluorescence (IF) was used to quantify Cdc42 and H4K16ac allocation to daughter cells during mitosis. Young HSCs were found to segregate Cdc42 and H4K16ac asymmetrically into daughter cells. Aged HSCs displayed a symmetric distribution of both Cdc42 and H4K16ac in daughter cells, and inhibition of Cdc42 activity in aged HSCs increased the frequency of asymmetric divisions among aged HSCs.

<title>HSC polarity is strongly associated with the mode of division and predicted to drive an asymmetric outcome in daughter cells</title>
<p>Because it is not yet possible to image in living cells Cdc42 and H4K16ac allocation to nascent daughter cells, we used mathematical association analyses to investigate whether there is a link between polarity in mother HSCs and the mode of HSC division.

<p>(A) Pie charts in white/grey show the observed ratios of polar versus apolar HSCs in young, aged, Wnt5a-treated young, and CASIN-treated aged HSC samples, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref016">16</xref>]. Pie charts in green show the observed modes of division for the respective cell populations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref>). The intermediate panel depicts the possible connections (arrows) between cell polarity status and mode of division. Application of a maximum likelihood approach on a simple transition model (with <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> being the probability for a polar HSC to undergo an asymmetric mode of division and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> being the probability for an apolar HSC to undergo a symmetric mode of division) allows estimating the most probable configuration for <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, thereby supporting the notion that the solid arrows represent the most prominent choices. (B) The bifurcation diagram illustrates the differentiation switch. For certain parameter values of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, the ODE for total Cdc42 concentration <italic>c</italic><sub>tot</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) allows for 2 stable steady states: (I) total Cdc42 is highly expressed (associated with the HSC state) and (II) total Cdc42 is lowly expressed (associated with the progenitor state). (C, D) The pseudo-potential (“stemness potential”) landscape for total Cdc42 concentration with two stable steady states (two “valleys,” representing HSCs and progenitors). For HSCs undergoing asymmetric cell division (blue line in panel C), one daughter receives lower Cdc42 concentration (“passes the hill”) and progresses into the progenitor state (dashed arrow), while the other daughter retains the stem cell state. Daughters of HSCs undergoing symmetric division (blue line in panel D) retain their configuration. (E) The panels summarise the mechanistic model results (red boxes) for populations of young and aged HSCs, respectively.

<p>By applying a maximum likelihood estimation to the previously published observed frequencies of polar versus apolar HSCs in young, aged, young Wnt5a-treated, and aged CASIN-treated cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref016">16</xref>], we found that the probabilities <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> ≈ 0.96 and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> ≈ 0.82 best explained the corresponding modes of division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Modelling thus indicates that there is a 96% chance that a polar cell will divide asymmetrically, and apolar cells will divide with an 82% chance symmetrically.</p>
<p>Encouraged by this strong association between HSC polarity/apolarity and asymmetric/symmetric mode of division, we further designed a mechanistic mathematical model to investigate the causative link to the fates of the daughter cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s002">S1 Text</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). To mimic the experimental observations, we assumed that Cdc42 is either distributed uniformly (apolar) or peaked (polar) along a circular, abstracted cell shape. We directly coupled the active proportion of intracellular Cdc42 (Cdc42-GTP) to the shape of this distribution, thereby functionally connecting the observed increase in Cdc42 activity with the loss of polarity during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>]. The mathematical approach suggested that a switch-like construct could determine daughter cell fate, in which different fates manifest based on the intracellular protein concentration immediately after cell division. We also implemented a transcriptional autoregulative feedback for total Cdc42 concentration, thereby establishing bistability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). For certain parameter choices, such a system yielded 2 characteristic states: either Cdc42 was highly expressed due to self-activation (e.g., indicative of HSCs) or Cdc42 was lowly expressed (e.g., indicative of the progenitor state) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). The choice of either the HSC or the progenitor state was determined by Cdc42 concentration right after cell division. Distinct concentrations between daughter cells due to an asymmetric mode of division resulted also in distinct states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Because Cdc42 activity, and thereby HSC polarity, is altered during aging, the model predicted that asymmetric outcomes of division are more likely for young HSCs, while a higher incidence of symmetric divisions in aged HSCs will preferentially promote self-renewal, predicting a progressive expansion of the stem cell pool over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Indeed, an increase in the number of HSCs in aged mice and humans has been verified by several groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

To this end, we transplanted 1,000 young and aged HSCs from AcRFP mice (that ubiquitously and constitutively express the red fluorescent protein [RFP]) into young <italic>Rag2</italic>−/−γ<italic>c</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>Kit</italic><sup>W/Wv</sup> recipient mice and imaged the bone marrow 6 weeks after transplant. We observed a higher frequency of HSC clusters (58% of all HSCs) in the bone marrow of recipients of aged HSCs compared to recipients of young HSCs (11% of all HSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g006">Fig 6F and 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g006">6J</xref>). Aged HSCs were also closer to each other and more frequently located in proximity of another HSC when compared to the distribution of young HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g006">Fig 6H and 6I</xref>). The frequency of clusters, compared to non-transplanted controls, increased for both aged and young donor HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g006">Fig 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s009">S7E Fig</xref>), suggesting a contribution of the transplantation to aging of HSCs. In summary, clusters of HSCs in bone marrow are intrinsic to HSCs, are primarily formed by aged HSCs, and are consistent with an elevated frequency of symmetric divisions of aged HSCs.</p>

<p>A global supervised “between-group analysis” (BGA) showed distinct clustering of daughter cells derived from the different experimental arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g007">Fig 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s024">S4 Table</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s010">S8 Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s011">S9A–S9C Fig</xref>). Daughter cells from aged and aged CASIN-treated HSCs showed a higher transcriptional heterogeneity compared to daughter cells from young and young treated-with-Wnt5a HSCs. When daughter pairs were separated based on chronological age, the aged CASIN-treated arm was closer to the young than to the aged control arm. However, the daughter cells from young Wnt5a-treated HSCs were also closer to the young control than to the older control arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate asymmetry/symmetry based on the difference of the transcriptome between the daughter cells, we first performed Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) analyses followed by three different analytical approaches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s012">S10 Fig</xref>). We selected statistically significant genes (<italic>p</italic>-value and q-value &lt; 0.05) that fall into distinct clusters of highly correlated genes (metagenes) that, summarily, presented a portrait that captures the global transcriptional landscape of a given cell. Cells with similar portraits and significant sets of genes will implicitly have high levels of transcriptional similarity. In the first analysis, we performed a hypergeometric-model–based gene set enrichment analysis using 13 previously published HSC and polarity signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref039">39</xref>] by simultaneously interrogating all the gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g007">Fig 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s013">S11 Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s025">S5 Table</xref>). When we then compared cells belonging to a pair, the majority of the pairs showed a high degree of similarity (concordance) across all arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). In the second approach, we quantified the degree of similarity between SOMs of daughter pairs by comparing the genes that showed statistically significant log fold-change compared to the mean global expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). Each pair was classified as concordant or discordant based on the magnitude of genes showing the same direction of change. Again, we observed a high level of concordance for all daughter pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g007">Fig 7F</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, taking into consideration the results of the transplants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and the mathematical modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), we sought to confirm higher asymmetric outcomes (discordant transcriptome profiles) in young and aged CASIN-treated HSCs and increased symmetric division outcomes (concordant transcriptome profiles) in aged and young Wnt5a-treated HSCs. To this end, we analyzed differentially expressed genes among daughter cells from young and aged CASIN-treated HSCs to highlight discordant divisions among the different pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g007">Fig 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s026">S6 Table</xref>). Results showed a percentage of asymmetric divisions slightly higher for all arms compared to the previous gene set enrichment and fold change analysis approaches; however, again results were not in agreement with the transplants and the mathematical prediction, and no significant difference was observed among the four arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g007">Fig 7H</xref>).</p>
<p>In the end, we analysed enrichment for biological processes in the 134 up-regulated genes in young and aged CASIN-treated daughter pairs. We observed a significant enrichment in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g007">Fig 7I</xref>). In the down-regulated gene sets, structural constituents of ribosomes were significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g007">Fig 7I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s011">S9D Fig</xref>). No significant enrichment was found for the genes up-regulated in aged and young Wnt5a-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s027">S7 Table</xref>). Therefore, the transcriptome in daughter cells to a large extent does not correlate with the function of a daughter cell as determined in the transplantation experiments.</p>

<p>ATAC-seq was selected because it reflects alterations in chromatin accessibility that are possibly also linked to changes in the level of H4K16ac (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref044">44</xref>]). The ATAC-seq profile of single daughter cells showed the expected distribution of insert sizes and an enrichment at transcription start sites (TSSs) of nucleosome-free fragments and the expected profile with respect to CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s015">S13 Fig</xref>). ATAC-seq peaks were annotated predominantly to TSSs, introns, and intergenic regions up to 1 kb apart from TSSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s016">S14A Fig</xref>). The overall scATAC-seq profile of daughter pairs of young HSCs showed a marked increase in the value of peak ratio compared to daughter pairs of aged HSCs. This resulted in a difference in ATAC-seq peak amounts between daughters from young HSCs, while daughter pairs of aged HSCs presented more often with having equal amounts of ATAC-seq peaks and a ratio quite uniform around 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). The difference in the ATAC-seq peak amount between paired daughters allowed for scoring of divisions as symmetric or asymmetric. Briefly, for those pairs for which we had a sufficient number of peaks for the reshuffling simulation test of the null hypothesis that cells in a pair show the same peak counts in the same genomic positions, asymmetry assignment was based on the significance of no overlap and the ratio of the peak counts (as a measure of global chromatin accessibility) greater than 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s010">S8 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s017">S15 Fig</xref>). Based on these statistical parameters, young HSCs presented with 57% of asymmetric divisions, while aged HSCs showed 40% of asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g008">Fig 8C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s028">S8 Table</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s017">S15 Fig</xref>). The symmetry/asymmetry difference between young and aged cells determined by 3D-IF for Cdc42 and H4K16ac, in transplantation assays and as predicted by the mathematical model, is thus similar to the difference in the ATAC-seq peak profile of paired daughters of young and aged HSCs.</p>
<p>We next annotated scATAC-seq peaks to genes. Similar to the analyses performed for the scRNA-seq data, we used gene set enrichment analysis to align daughter pairs to known stem cell signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g008">Fig 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s018">S16 Fig</xref>) and presented them again in radar plots. The data revealed also for these analyses a higher frequency of asymmetric divisions for young HSCs (64%) compared to asymmetric division for aged HSCs (40%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g008">Fig 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s018">S16 Fig</xref>). Individual daughter cells from young and aged pairs were subsequently grouped according to the mode of division as established based on the ATAC-seq peak ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s028">S8 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>): both daughter cells of all symmetric divisions were assorted as stem cells because the majority of daughter cells stemming from symmetric divisions were, according to the transplantation assay, stem cells. As for asymmetric divisions, the daughter cells with the highest ATAC-seq peak number were assigned to the daughter progenitor cells group because daughter cells of symmetric divisions, which result in daughter stem cells, presented with a quite uniform and low peak count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). Next, transcription factor (TF) footprint analyses on ATAC-seq peaks identified significantly enriched TF binding sites common to daughter stem cells of both young and aged HSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s016">S14B and S14C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s019">S17 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s029">S9 Table</xref>). Among them were TFs like NFY, SpiB, Sp5, Sp1, Runx, ERG, PU.1, and Maz (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s016">S14B–S14D Fig</xref>). Of these, the frequencies of target sequences with a Sp5, Sp1, Maz, and ERG motif were even further increased in daughter stem cells of aged HSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s016">S14D Fig</xref>). In daughter progenitor cells from both young and aged HSCs, the enriched TFs set was very distinct from the one enriched in stem cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s016">S14E and S14F Fig</xref>), and factors like c-Myc, Usf2, and Stat3 further showed a decline in enrichment in aged daughter progenitors, while PU.1:IRF8, CEBP, CEBP:AP1, and Nanog showed the opposite trend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s016">S14E Fig</xref>). However, only the frequency of target sequences for the E2F6 motif was significantly more enriched in aged daughter progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s016">S14G Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed 603 and 490 significantly enriched pathways in young and aged daughter stem cells and 474 and 360 pathways in young and aged daughter progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s020">S18 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s030">S10</xref> Table). More than 75% of young daughter progenitor cells shared enrichment for only 1.47% of all significantly enriched GOs. These daughter-progenitor–specific enriched GOs for young HSCs were platelet homeostasis, mitosis, interferonγ and interferon signalling, IL-2 and IGF1 signalling, and pyruvate and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g008">Fig 8G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref049">49</xref>]. In daughter progenitors of aged HSCs, 100% of the cells were enriched for only 2.77% of the GOs, which included platelet homeostasis, TNF signalling, propionyl-CoA catabolism, and cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g008">Fig 8H</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref052">52</xref>]. To further dissect differences between young and aged daughter progenitor cells, we performed gene set enrichment analyses for a previously reported multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref053">53</xref>]. Despite only 2 aged and 3 young daughter progenitor cells showing significant enrichment, both young and aged daughter progenitor cells showed a similar set of genes overlapping across cells in a given age group but also across the two age groups, indicating a similar pattern of chromatin accessibility in and around these genes in both young and aged daughter progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003389.s016">S14H–S14I Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the daughter stem cells from both young and aged HSCs were enriched for GO pathways linked to glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and also for signaling linked to RhoGTPases, implying an important role of regulation of the glycolytic metabolism and of small RhoGTPase signaling (like Cdc42) for the regulation of stem-ness of daughter stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g008">Fig 8I and 8J</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref056">56</xref>], as also predicted by our mathematical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Similarly informative might be the finding that major differences in GO enrichment among daughter stem cells from young and aged HSCs were linked to signalling pathways involved in the interaction of HSCs with the stem cell niche: while daughter stem cells from young HSCs are enriched for GOs associated with TGFβ, VEGFR2, and EGFR signalling, daughter stem cells from aged HSCs are enriched for Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g008">Fig 8I–8J</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref058">58</xref>]. In summary, open chromatin configuration and thus the epigenetic make-up of a daughter cell strongly correlates with the potential of the daughter cell.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The asymmetric or symmetric sorting of epigenetic information upon HSC division has been proposed as a way of controlling the potential of nascent daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref009">9</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate, using a comprehensive set of paired daughter analyses that include single-cell 3D confocal imaging, single-cell transplants, scRNA-seq, and scATAC-seq, that the mode of HSC division is strongly linked to the polarity status before mitosis, which is in turn determined by the level of the activity Cdc42 in stem cells. These results consequently imply that the level of activity of Cdc42 in mother HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>] regulates the mode (symmetric/asymmetric) of HSC divisions, which results in a distinct allocation of epigenetic regulators like H4K16ac as well as of Cdc42 itself to daughter cells. Our data, combined with our mathematical model on the mode of divisions and the role of Cdc42 in daughter cells, further support that polar HSCs (that are the majority in young animals) undergo asymmetric divisions while apolar HSCs (that are the majority in aged animals) undergo primarily symmetric divisions. Aging and rejuvenation of HSCs, as a consequence of changes in the activity of Cdc42 in HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref016">16</xref>], also imply a change in the mode of HSC divisions and thus link the mode of division of HSCs to changes in the function of daughter stem cells. In addition, our data (both experimental and mathematical modeling) strongly support that symmetric divisions, which are the primary mode of division of aged HSCs, might be directly linked to the increase in the number of HSCs in bone marrow upon aging. A striking new feature, clustering of HSCs within the bone marrow of aged animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g006">Fig 6</xref>), is most likely a consequence of the elevated frequency of symmetric divisions of aged HSCs. An interesting novel concept derived from HSC clustering is that, in such clusters, HSCs might serve as niche cells for other HSCs.</p>
<p>Recently published data support a dominant role of hematopoietic progenitor cells but not HSCs in maintaining long-term hematopoiesis in an unperturbed setting in young animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref060">60</xref>]. Our findings are consistent with this novel concept because young HSCs will divide primarily asymmetrically and provide the progenitor cells that support hematopoiesis. Our data might predict that, upon aging, this dominant role of progenitor cells in driving hematopoiesis will shift towards a more relevant contribution of stem cells to hematopoiesis due to the reduced number of progenitors generated from aged HSCs.</p>
<p>The final fate of daughter cells after HSC divisions might be defined by signals intrinsic to stem cells that are allocated during division to daughter cells but might also be driven by extrinsic signals from the environment acting on daughter cells after mitosis is completed. The stem cell intrinsic signals need to be, by definition, epigenetic in nature (not linked to the DNA sequence), as daughter cells present with a genome that is identical to their mother cell. Our data and our mathematical model support that the decision on the potential of daughter cells is driven, to a large extent, by the mode of the division of the mother HSC, which is decided upon in the mother HSCs. We show distinct allocation of a polarity protein (Cdc42) and an epigenetic mark (H4K16ac) to daughter cells, which correlates with the potential of the daughter cells themselves. Our data also demonstrate that the overall transcriptome in daughter cells does not correlate with their potential, while the amount and the location of open chromatin regions is tightly linked to it. Furthermore, mathematical modelling and our ATAC-seq-linked GO signatures in daughter stem cells predict an important role for RhoGTPase signaling as well as metabolic signaling for the maintenance of the stem cell potential in daughter stem cells upon stem cell divisions. While a role of glycolysis in stem cell maintenance has been already described by multiple laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref055">55</xref>], an important role for RhoGTPase signaling for stem cell maintenance has only been recently suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref062">62</xref>]. The daughter progenitor cell signature is distinct from the stem cell signature, while sharing for both young and aged daughter-cell gene loci linked to platelet homeostasis. It has been described that HSCs can rapidly differentiate into platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref063">63</xref>]. In addition, progenitor cells display enrichment for signatures linked to interferon signaling, which has been, in the past, primarily associated with stem cell quiescence/activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref065">65</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, it has been reported that H4K16ac can directly control chromatin accessibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref044">44</xref>], so it is likely that a symmetric or asymmetric distribution of H4K16ac to daughter cells (due to polarity/apolarity of the mark in mother stem cells) might contribute to distinct levels of chromatin accessibility and thus affect the fate of daughter cells. These findings are consistent with recent data supporting that epigenetic memory in HSCs is persistent and guides cellular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref066">66</xref>]. The data presented here also imply that an open chromatin configuration precedes changes in gene expression in daughter cells. Our ATAC-seq analyses imply that young HSCs might also establish a specific chromatin configuration that allow stem-cell–extrinsic signalling (TGFβ, VEGF, IGF1, and EGF signalling) to act on nascent daughter stem cells, while aged daughter stem cells present with open chromatin regions linked to Wnt signalling. A role for all of these factors for the biology of young and aged HSCs has already been described, further supporting these conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003389.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, our data imply an important role for Cdc42 activity/polarity in HSCs for driving the symmetric/asymmetric mode of division as well as a role of epigenetic mechanisms for determining the potential of daughter cells. The frequency of polar HSCs decreases upon aging, which results in more symmetric divisions but daughter stem cells with impaired potential.</p>

<title>Mode of division: Young/polar HSCs divide asymmetrically, while aged/apolar HSCs undergo symmetric divisions.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation of the possible mode and outcome of polar and apolar HSC divisions. The establishment of cell polarity within the mother HSC is supposed to be one fundamental mechanism that controls mode and outcome of asymmetric stem cell division. Such stem cell asymmetric division allows one daughter cell to become differentiated and the other to retain stem cell potential; in contrast, symmetric division allows both daughter cells to adopt equivalent fates. (B) Percentages of HSCs in metaphase, anaphase, or telophase among total mitotic HSCs. (C–J) Quantification of the amount of Cdc42 and H4K16ac in nascent daughter cells. Each pair is connected by a line. *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <italic>n</italic> = 2–3 biological repeats; 25 pairs for young, 26 pairs for aged, 26 pairs for aged + CASIN and 14 pairs for young + Wnt5a for panel C–F; 41 pairs for young, 37 pairs for aged, 40 pairs for aged + CASIN, and 26 pairs for young + Wnt5a for panel G–J. (K) Representative epifluorescence pictures of young and aged HSCs cultured with and without growth factors (GF; SCF, G-CSF, and TPO all 100 ng/mL). Panels show DAPI (nucleus, blue), Cdc42 (red), and tubulin (green). The column graph depicts the percentage of polar cells retrieved in each sample. <italic>n</italic> = 3 biological repeats. Culture conditions did not affect the percentage of polar HSCs in both young and aged cell preparations. (L) Representative epifluorescence pictures of dividing (metaphase) young, aged, aged treated with CASIN 5 μM, and young treated with Wnt5a 100 ng/mL HSCs. Panels show DAPI (nucleus, blue), Cdc42 (red), and tubulin (green). The dashed lines cross transversally the dividing cells touching both opposite poles. The fluorescence intensity was measured along the dashed line (panel M); representative 3D confocal reconstruction of HSCs stained during division. The images show tubulin (green), H4K16ac (magenta), and the nucleus (DAPI, blue). The total level of H4K16ac during all phases of mitosis (metaphase, anaphase, and telophase) remained stable.</p>

<title>Details of the mathematical modeling approach.</title>
<p>(A) Sketch of the ODE model describing intracellular dynamics. Total Cdc42 is assumed to be autoregulative while an age-dependent proportion is activated. Active Cdc42 inhibits the cell’s acetylation level. (B) The variance of Cdc42 distribution (as a measure of apolarity) increases with increasing Cdc42 activity. (C) Representation of a polar and an apolar cell, respectively, in terms of a normal distribution <italic>N</italic>(<italic>μ</italic>,<italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>) of Cdc42 on the cell’s circular outline (and AcH4K16 within the cell nucleus opposite Cdc42 localization). The x-axis of the histogram represents the circle line ranging periodically from –<italic>π</italic> to <italic>π</italic>. Polar cells concentrate Cdc42 at a pole around zero while AcH4K16 is distributed opposite. In contrast, apolar cells show a rather uniform protein distribution due to an elevated variance <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>. (D) Cell division for a homogeneous polar cell population. All cells of the population show a similar polarity pattern and are divided by an arbitrary plane through their center. This division event leads to asymmetric cell divisions almost exclusively (dark green in upper pie chart) and, after running the cell-intrinsic process (ODE model), ends up with a close to 1:1 ratio of LT-HSCs (white) and progenitors (yellow). (E) Cell division for a homogeneous apolar cell population ends up with symmetric divisions and LT-HSC daughters only. (F–G) Cell division simulation for a population of 1,000 young and aged LT-HSCs, respectively, being heterogeneous with respect to polarity. Pie charts (correspond to simulation pie charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003389.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) depict the ratio of asymmetric and symmetric cell divisions and the ratio of LT-HSCs and progenitors, respectively. The histograms depict the frequency of daughter cells with a certain Cdc42 concentration after cell division. Upper histograms relate the symmetry of division with the specific Cdc42 concentration in the daughters. Lower histograms relate the results of the intracellular ODE model with total Cdc42 concentration after cell division. Cells with a Cdc42 concentration below 2 end up in a Cdc42-low state (= progenitors), whereas the other daughters end up in a Cdc42-high state (= LT-HSCs). (H) Distribution of <italic>k</italic><sub>+</sub> values (phosphorylation constant of Cdc42) for heterogeneous populations of young and aged LT-HSCs, respectively. (I) Both young and aged LT-HSCs present with a 2-fold increase of Cdc42 fluorescence intensity compared to progenitor cells as quantified by intracellular flow cytometry.</p>

<title>Symmetric and asymmetric HSC divisions: in vivo read-out in transplants.</title>
<p>(A) Representative flow cytometry charts of PB from two mice 24 weeks post transplantion of individual but paired daughter cells (named arbitrarily A and B) that originated from a distinct young mother HSC. Donor-derived contribution to PB is higher than 0.1% of total WBC, and contribution is detected for both lymphoid (B cells, B220+ and T cells, Cd3+) and myeloid lineages (Gr1+, Mac1+, and Gr1+Mac1+cells). Consequently, the division of the mother HSC was scored as symmetric.

Donor-derived contribution to PB is higher than 0.1% of total WBC and the contribution is detected for both lymphoid (B cells, B220+ and T cells, Cd3+) and myeloid lineages (Gr1+, Mac1+, and Gr1+Mac1+cells).

Daughter cell B shows no contribution to lymphoid cells (Cd3+ and B220+ cells). Consequently, the division of the mother HSCs was scored as asymmetric. (D) Representative flow cytometry charts of PB from two mice 24 weeks post transplantation of individual but paired daughter cells (named arbitrarily A and B) that originated from a distinct young aged HSC. Donor-derived contribution to PB is higher than 0.1% of total WBC only in daughter cell A. Daughter cell B shows a contribution to PB that is lower than 0.1% of total WBC.
