            <p>The International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) has
                become an important communication hub for bioinformaticians, and the core element of
                the Conference—presentations of peer-reviewed papers—is now only
                one of many activities. Presentation of timely journal publications (the Highlights
                sessions), Special Sessions organized by experts in the respective fields,
                Tutorials, and Special Interest Group meetings should attract attendees who might
                otherwise prefer smaller, more focused meetings. In addition to these formal
                activities, an important aspect is the informal communication between participants.
                This year, about 1,600 participants attended the meeting in the conference center
                under the CN Tower in Toronto. ISMB 2008 also left a footprint on the Web, via a Web
                service named FriendFeed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/</ext-link>), to
                capture highlights from the Conference in near real time. FriendFeed allows users to
                share items, either directly or by importing their latest content from any Web site
                that generates an RSS feed, leading to a continuous stream of information around
                which communities build (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000263-g001">Figure
                1</xref>). In addition, and of most relevance to ISMB, FriendFeed acts as a
                microblogging platform: Users post short, typically single-sentence messages which
                generate conversations in the ensuing comment threads. Microblogging, best
                exemplified by the Twitter service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://twitter.com/</ext-link>), is popular in
                the IT/tech sector, but little used by life scientists. It may be thought of as the
                fusion of instant messaging and traditional blogs: Anyone can follow or join a
                conversation, and conversations are archived. We recommend an article by Cameron
                Neylon entitled FriendFeed for Scientists: What, Why, and How? (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/06/12/friendfeed-for-scientists-what-why-and-how/" xlink:type="simple">http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2008/06/12/friendfeed-for-scientists-what-why-and-how/</ext-link>)
                for an introduction.</p>

            <p>We—a group of science bloggers, most of whom met in person for the first
                time at ISMB 2008—found FriendFeed a remarkably useful tool for taking
                notes and sharing them online. With a core group of ten contributors, we covered
                parallel sessions, leading to a more comprehensive set of notes than a single person
                could take. Some presentations, particularly the Keynotes, were covered by several
                people, generating a detailed overview of a talk from different perspectives. A
                virtual meeting space—a “room”—was created
                containing material relevant to ISMB 2008, in which members posted an item detailing
                the upcoming presentation. Notes on the presentation then took the form of comments
                posted by the attendees. This proved effective: In addition to notes, questions were
                asked and answered, links to relevant resources were posted, and comments were even
                added by people not attending the Conference.</p>
            <p>In addition to the live information stream, the ISMB 2008 room is a permanent,
                searchable archive from which this meeting report was compiled. It is freely
                available on the Web at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/ismb-2008/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/rooms/ismb-2008/</ext-link>.</p>

            <title>Keynotes</title>
            <p>The eight Keynote talks this year were noted for their high quality and breadth and
                were covered online with long comments threads.</p>
            <p>Claire Fraser-Liggett opened the meeting with a review of metagenomics and an
                introduction to the human microbiome project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/search?q=room%3Aismb-2008+microbiome+OR+fraser" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/search?q=room%3Aismb‐2008+microbiome+OR+fraser</ext-link>).
                The subsequent Q&amp;A session covered many of the exciting challenges for those
                working in this field. Clearly, solutions to problems that we thought were largely
                solved from research into single genomes, such as assembly and genome annotation,
                are being redefined in the context of metagenomics. What better way to start the
                meeting than to define the open questions and to highlight the opportunities for
                bioinformaticians to contribute to the field.</p>
            <p>Day one closed with David Jaffe's excellent Introduction to Next-Generation
                Sequencing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/e/685a365c-9ef6-4ec1-b5b7-48e2619a0790/Keynote-2-enormous-amounts-of-sequencing/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/e/685a365c-9ef6-4ec1-b5b7-48e2619a0790/Keynote-2-enormous-amounts-of-sequencing/</ext-link>).
                David illustrated the technology using a range of examples: chromatin modification,
                high-throughput polymorphism discovery in bacterial and eukaryotic genomes, and,
                finally, de novo genome assembly using short reads. He introduced some of the new
                tools required to work with short reads, such as the ALLPATHS assembly algorithm,
                demonstrating again how new technology drives software development in
                bioinformatics. Next-generation sequencing continues to gain attention, and
                David's enthusiasm for the topic led one commenter to note that
                “short reads sequencing can be used as THE general-purpose
                tool.”</p>
            <p>Eugene Myers is a regular guest at ISMB. In light of his major contributions to
                sequence analysis, it may surprise you to learn that his new passion is Image
                Analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/e/60f95dea-7f5d-454d-a296-abddbeb69cab/Keynote-3-Eugene-Myers-imaging/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/e/60f95dea-7f5d-454d-a296-abddbeb69cab/Keynote-3-Eugene-Myers-imaging/</ext-link>).
                The take-home message from Eugene's Keynote on day two was that digital
                microscopy is now a high-throughput technique, with the potential to generate
                terabytes of data. Noting that “my life is very colorful these
                days,” he presented a diverse set of analyses: tubulin tracking in
                mitosis, stereotypy-tracking cell position during worm development, motion tracking
                of mouse whiskers, and, finally, early results from ambitious projects to create
                atlases of fly and mouse brain. His “worm straightening
                algorithm” was particularly well-received by the audience. Noting that
                image analysis focuses currently on modeling and annotation, Eugene outlined the
                ultimate goal: the ability to mine information from this type of experimental data.</p>
            <p>The second Keynote of day two was a highlight: the presentation of the Overton Prize
                to Aviv Regev. In her presentation Modular Biology: The Function and Evolution of
                Molecular Networks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/e/29b67aac-38f2-4dd5-8c19-b8596895d36e/Keynote-Aviv-Regev-on-Modular-Biology/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/e/29b67aac-38f2-4dd5-8c19-b8596895d36e/Keynote-Aviv-Regev-on-Modular-Biology/</ext-link>),
                Aviv looked beyond the traditional representation of biological networks as, to
                quote a FriendFeed comment, “nasty hairball diagrams,” to ask:
                Is the concept of a functional module useful? Judging by her research, the answer is
                a resounding “yes.” Aviv showed the application of the modular
                concept to biological systems including evolution of the regulation of gene
                expression and analysis of gene expression in cancer. Unusual for keynotes, she also
                presented novel data: a comparative metabolic analysis of carbon utilization across
                13 yeast species. The evolution of networks was a key theme and linked well to the
                final Keynote of the Conference. Aviv concluded that the temporal and spatial key
                variables are still missing from network models.</p>
            <p>The Keynote presentations took a more clinical turn on day three, with Morag Park on
                Profiling the Breast Tumor Microenvironment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/e/04150591-adf3-4e16-a6ed-7fbeaf7d5ac9/Keynote-5-Morag-Park-profiling-the-breast-tumor/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/e/04150591-adf3-4e16-a6ed-7fbeaf7d5ac9/Keynote-5-Morag-Park-profiling-the-breast-tumor/</ext-link>).
                Proving that the ISMB is as much about biologically relevant research findings as
                computation and algorithm development, Morag illustrated how new microdissection
                techniques enable gene expression analysis in subpopulations of tumor cells. Having
                identified distinct expression profiles for different cell types, her research team
                has developed predictors that correlate with clinical outcomes and permit
                customization of individual treatment. Her presentation was an excellent
                demonstration that bioinformatics can impact directly the quality of human life.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon session, we witnessed a tour-de-force Overview of Systems Biology
                    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/e/ef87914f-c3c5-4943-88ad-c518e9991fb4/Keynote-6-Bernhard-Palsson-systems-biology-an-era/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/e/ef87914f-c3c5-4943-88ad-c518e9991fb4/Keynote-6-Bernhard-Palsson-systems-biology-an-era/</ext-link>)
                from Bernhard Palsson. His talk led us through a brief history of systems biology to
                his new paradigm: a comprehensive, structured knowledge base that we can use for
                metabolic reconstruction. Bernhard stressed the role of community annotation in
                “filling in the gaps” and described how this works, in the form
                of annotation jamborees targeted at model organisms. His presentation received the
                highest number of comments and was clearly of great interest to non-attendees
                following the coverage.</p>
            <p>Small non-coding RNAs continue to be a hot topic. A new twist in the tale was
                provided by Hanah Margalit in the opening talk of day four on Intriguing Roles for
                Small ncRNAs in Cellular Regulatory Networks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/e/29ec0f3d-5a1c-4f2d-807a-5f42e959bf50/Keynote-7-Hana-Margalit-intriguing-roles-for/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/e/29ec0f3d-5a1c-4f2d-807a-5f42e959bf50/Keynote-7-Hana-Margalit-intriguing-roles-for/</ext-link>).
                In another example of the two-way traffic between computational analysis and
                biological discovery, Hanah's group developed new algorithms to predict
                ncRNAs and their targets. Applying these algorithms, they demonstrated that viruses
                use miRNAs to downregulate the host immune system. With infectious enthusiasm, Hanah
                presented a set of recent experiments that validate this exciting new discovery.</p>
            <p>The last of the Keynotes was David Haussler on 100 Million Years of Evolutionary
                History of the Human Genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/e/d6af6373-897d-483d-975e-5204ef127f96/Keynote-8-David-Haussler-100-million-years-of/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/e/d6af6373-897d-483d-975e-5204ef127f96/Keynote-8-David-Haussler-100-million-years-of/</ext-link>).
                Improvising effortlessly through a brief technical glitch, he reminded us just how
                much new biology can be learned by obtaining and comparing complete genome
                sequences. Examples ranged from the more familiar: ultra-conserved regions in the
                human genome, the HAR1 gene, which looks increasingly to be a key factor in human
                brain development, to the almost-quirky—the discovery of an ancient
                transposon most similar to coelacanth. David concluded with an outline of his grand
                challenge: reconstructing the evolutionary history of each base in the genome of
                humans and other mammals. Once again, it was clear that many opportunities exist for
                bioinformaticians to contribute the tools and analyses required for this task.</p>

            <title>Summary of the Sessions</title>
            <p>Our notes are a partial record of ISMB 2008, reflecting the relatively small number
                of bloggers and their interests. One can imagine that with more contributors, an
                impression of the most popular presentations and topics could be gained from the
                level of online coverage. Sessions from the Biopathways SIG, Highlights,
                Proceedings, and Special Sessions tracks were covered online, in particular those
                discussing protein–protein interactions, biological networks, and the
                future of scientific publishing. One approach to provide an overview of the meeting
                is a “word cloud,” indicating commonly used words mined from
                Conference Abstracts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000263-g002">Figure 2</xref>
                shows the 100 most frequently used words from the 2008 ISMB Proceedings Abstracts,
                compared with the Proceedings from the 2007 ISMB/ECCB meeting in Vienna. These
                figures were prepared using the Web application TagCrowd (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tagcrowd.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://tagcrowd.com/</ext-link>).</p>

            <p>Although this is a crude analysis, several interesting trends can be discerned. The
                terms <italic>mass</italic>, <italic>peptide</italic>, and <italic>ms</italic> are
                on the rise, indicating increased use of mass spectrometry. In 2008,
                <italic>vector</italic> and <italic>machine</italic> appear, highlighting the
                current popularity of SVMs in bioinformatics. We also see increased usage of the
                terms <italic>accuracy/accurate</italic> and <italic>performance</italic>. Although
                Phil Bourne joked during his presentation on Pharmaceutical Off-Targets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/e/d5b274e5-1d34-4108-853e-5974b2a4cccd/HL29-Phil-Bourne-off-targets-for-some-major/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/e/d5b274e5-1d34-4108-853e-5974b2a4cccd/HL29-Phil-Bourne-off-targets-for-some-major/</ext-link>)
                that he was “too old to compare my method to other methods by showing that
                we're better on a completely different dataset,” this type of
                statistical validation seems to be used more widely than ever.

                    <italic>networks</italic> rather than a single <italic>network</italic>. We also
                discern the ever-growing development of <italic>methods</italic> and

            <p>The Ninth Annual BioPathways (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biopathways.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.biopathways.org/</ext-link>)
                meeting was dedicated to computational methods for synthetic biology and was
                organized in collaboration with Emergence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emergence.ethz.ch/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.emergence.ethz.ch/</ext-link>), an EU-funded consortium that fosters
                synthetic biology in Europe. Over two days, biological pathways were discussed under
                the topics of network reconstruction, database/software development, and network
                evolution.</p>
            <p>The need for standardization and machine-accessible pathway data was apparent. Peter
                Karp talked about recent developments at the MetaCyc (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://metacyc.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://metacyc.org/</ext-link>) and BioCyc
                    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biocyc.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://biocyc.org/</ext-link>) pathway databases. The number of available
                reactions and pathways in these databases has increased at an impressive rate due to
                curation. The nonredundant MetaCyc database now holds 7,144 reactions from 1,138
                pathways. Capturing pathway information locked away in published literature could
                benefit from voluntary curation. This is the objective and the experiment under way
                at WikiPathways (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways" xlink:type="simple">http://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways</ext-link>).</p>
            <p>The availability of biological information in a machine-readable format improves our
                ability to move data between analytical tools. Jennifer Gardy gave an interesting
                example in Cerebral (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pathogenomics.ca/cerebral/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pathogenomics.ca/cerebral/</ext-link>), a Cytoscape plugin that
                facilitates pathway layering according to location information. Cerebral was also
                developed for the comparison of multiple quantitative datasets, such as gene
                expression data across different conditions.</p>
            <p>Novel network analysis methods were described by David Gilbert and Shoshana Wodak.
                The Gilbert group has been working on a language to specify semiquantitative model
                rules that can be used for model verification. This could also be used to search
                pathway model databases for pathways that can implement a desired behavior for
                engineering purposes. Shoshana Wodak presented a new algorithm to find paths within
                a metabolic network, given start and end point metabolites.</p>
            <p>Acquisition of pathway information relies increasingly on large-scale datasets.
                Finding functional relevant pathways through analysis of large datasets is sometimes
                referred to as network reconstruction, a topic covered by Chris Sander, Lars Juhl
                Jensen, and Rune Linding. Lars presented NetPhorest (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://netphorest.info/" xlink:type="simple">http://netphorest.info/</ext-link>), a
                compendium of classifiers for linear motifs important for phosphorylation-dependent
                signaling. Rune described NetworKIN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://networkin.info/search.php" xlink:type="simple">http://networkin.info/search.php</ext-link>), a tool to predict in vivo kinase
                substrates by integrating gene functional association scores from the STRING
                    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://string.embl.de/" xlink:type="simple">http://string.embl.de/</ext-link>) database, in vivo phosphorylation data, and
                classifiers for kinase-substrate recognition obtained from NetPhorest. They
                explained how integration of the growing list of classifiers from NetPhorest might
                be used to predict signaling pathways.</p>
            <p>Chris Sander challenged the oft-used phrase: “There is no such thing as
                pathway reconstruction, nor is there such [a] thing as pathway
                re-engineering. Pathways are simply biological models.” He described an
                interesting approach to derive biological models from a significant collection of
                observations obtained from combinatorial perturbation experiments. Using a cancer
                cell line, researchers performed a set of 21 drug pair treatments and observed
                phosphoproteins and cell cycle markers. Using a novel computational approach, they
                were able to rediscover many of the functional interactions among the genes and to
                highlight potential new connections.</p>
            <p>Are pathway models obtained from the literature or from novel mining approaches
                useful for medical or technological applications? Chris Sander, Phil Bourne, and
                Christopher Myers all touched on this subject from different angles. Myers told us
                that all biological pathways are “sloppy.” Their analysis of
                different models shows that individual parameters are typically poorly constrained
                by collective fits, even when abundant observations are available. The focus of
                experimental design should move away from determining precise reaction parameters to
                collective behaviors. This also implies that altering precisely the activity of one
                cellular component for medical applications might not be the best approach to
                follow. Both Chris Sander, in relation to cancer therapy, and Phil Bourne, in
                relation to prediction of drug off-target effects, mentioned the need to understand
                the effect of pharmacological interventions within the context of complete
                biological pathways.</p>

            <title>Web 2.0 for Science Birds of a Feather Session</title>
            <p>Many scientists make little use of public Web 2.0 resources for creativity, sharing,
                and collaboration. Bloggers Shirley Wu (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://shirleywho.wordpress.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://shirleywho.wordpress.com/</ext-link>) and Pedro Beltrão
                    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pbeltrao.blogspot.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://pbeltrao.blogspot.com/</ext-link>) co-chaired a Birds of a Feather (BoF)
                discussion—Science Blogging and Web 2.0—attended by about 20
                people. A lively discussion ensued, examining the reluctance and the enthusiasm of
                life scientists to embrace Web 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://van.embl.de/cb/web_20_talk_series.shtml" xlink:type="simple">http://van.embl.de/cb/web_20_talk_series.shtml</ext-link>).</p>
            <p>The first topic was online reference managers: Connotea (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.connotea.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.connotea.org/</ext-link>), CiteULike, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.citeulike.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.citeulike.org/</ext-link>),
                and new entrant Labmeeting (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.labmeeting.com/signin" xlink:type="simple">http://www.labmeeting.com/signin</ext-link>), which allow tagging and online
                storage of papers. Why don't more scientists use them? A major reason seems
                to be the reluctance to share what one is reading with the rest of the world, based
                on the fear that a reading list is a window into your research. More generally,
                scientists are hesitant to use the open Web as an incubator for ideas and would
                rather rely on a tight circle of trusted individuals.</p>
            <p>Other issues discussed included uncertainty surrounding intellectual property of Web
                content, the problem of critical mass for social networking sites, the reliability
                and expertise of bloggers, and the possibility of domination by shallow
                collaborations. Pedro stated that the problem is not one of too many superficial
                connections, but that too few connections are being made. Tools such as Epernicus
                    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epernicus.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.epernicus.com/</ext-link>) could remedy this by connecting, for
                example, biologists and bioinformaticians working on complementary research.</p>
            <p>Many participants had a positive view of online tools such as social networking and
                blogging. Roland Krause described how a connection made on a social networking site
                resulted in collaboration and a journal publication. Participants agreed that
                blogging or joining communities such as FriendFeed, Nature Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://network.nature.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://network.nature.com/</ext-link>), and OpenWetWare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page" xlink:type="simple">http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page</ext-link>) can result in authorship,
                job offers, and a vastly increased audience—at least compared with your
                papers. Consensus from those who participate in science online is that the Web is a
                great equalizer: Students and post-docs can easily strike up
                “conversations” with more established scientists, and
                contributions have less to do with status and more to do with ideas. Web
                participation also opens your eyes to other perspectives and enables you to learn
                from people with more expertise than you.</p>
            <p>The BoF session ended with a discussion about coverage of ISMB Toronto. About half of
                the participants knew about the Conference microblogging. Everyone agreed that
                coverage of ISMB on the Conference Web site could be improved by something similar.
                The Conference organizers also agree and hope to include live microblogging at ISMB
                2009 in Stockholm.</p>

            <title>Poster Sessions</title>
            <p>The scale of ISMB is illustrated by the poster sessions: approximately 800 posters,
                presented over two evenings. How might poster presentation before, during, and after
                meetings be improved? Shirley Wu dreams of a future (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/e/44118735-65e8-0980-64c3-36247dd8dfab/Off-to-ISMB-2008/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/e/44118735-65e8-0980-64c3-36247dd8dfab/Off-to-ISMB-2008/</ext-link>)
                without the problems of printing and transport, where rolls of paper in cardboard
                tubes are replaced by memory sticks and flat-screen displays.</p>
            <p>Shouldn't posters be permanently archived? Sharing posters digitally using
                an image hosting service met with limited success (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://friendfeed.com/e/4e094687-f68e-5c51-f3ce-fac663f18c23/STRING-and-STITCH-known-and-predicted/" xlink:type="simple">http://friendfeed.com/e/4e094687-f68e-5c51-f3ce-fac663f18c23/STRING-and-STITCH-known-and-predicted/</ext-link>).
                A search for Web sites that host posters located the e-posters archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eposters.net/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.eposters.net/</ext-link>). However, this site serves as a PDF
                repository and lacks the visual and community features expected. Clearly, an
                opportunity exists for a well-designed service catering to those who wish to archive
                and share posters on the Web.</p>
            <p>Imagine that you were able to host a poster session at any time, with visitors from
                anywhere in the world. Organizations including Nature Publishing Group and the
                American Chemical Society are already running virtual poster sessions, meetings, and
                interactive displays in Second Life (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://secondlife.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://secondlife.com/</ext-link>). In the
                future, might all scientific conferences live on long after the meeting in virtual
                environments? Those interested should read Jean-Claude Bradley's

            <title>Summary</title>
            <p>Microblogging platforms and other tools for videos, podcasts, and virtual
                environments provide an untapped potential for science conferences. Our experiment
                using FriendFeed to cover ISMB 2008 was educational and surprisingly successful. We
                found that it enhanced our note-taking skills, allowed us to compile notes from
                parallel sessions, attracted wider interest from non-attendees, and, in addition to
                the “live” aspect, generated a permanent archive of the meeting.</p>
            <p>ISMB/ECCB 2009 will be held in Stockholm. We look forward to the new developments in
