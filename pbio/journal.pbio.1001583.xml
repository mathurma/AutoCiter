<p>Backscatter scanning electron microscopy and conventional whole cell patch-clamp experiments reveal a two-step mechanism for the regeneration of tip links, the crucial element of mechanotransduction machinery in the hair cells of the inner ear.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Sound detection by inner ear hair cells requires tip links that interconnect mechanosensory stereocilia and convey force to yet unidentified transduction channels. Current models postulate a static composition of the tip link, with protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) at the lower and cadherin 23 (CDH23) at the upper end of the link. In terminally differentiated mammalian auditory hair cells, tip links are subjected to sound-induced forces throughout an organism's life. Although hair cells can regenerate disrupted tip links and restore hearing, the molecular details of this process are unknown. We developed a novel implementation of backscatter electron scanning microscopy to visualize simultaneously immuno-gold particles and stereocilia links, both of only a few nanometers in diameter. We show that functional, mechanotransduction-mediating tip links have at least two molecular compositions, containing either PCDH15/CDH23 or PCDH15/PCDH15. During regeneration, shorter tip links containing nearly equal amounts of PCDH15 at both ends appear first. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrate that these transient PCDH15/PCDH15 links mediate mechanotransduction currents of normal amplitude but abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent decay (adaptation). The mature PCDH15/CDH23 tip link composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation. Thus, our findings provide a molecular mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells and could help identify elusive components of the mechanotransduction machinery.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The inner ear detects sound when stereocilia, the mechanosensory projections on the apical surface of the hair cells, are deflected and tug on tiny extracellular tip links. These links interconnect stereocilia and convey forces to the mechanosensitive transduction channels. Current models postulate a static composition of the tip link with protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) at the link's bottom end and cadherin 23 (CDH23) at the upper end. Tip links are subjected to substantial sound-induced forces. Although hair cells can renew (regenerate) disrupted tip links and restore hearing, the molecular details of this process are unknown. Our study provides mechanistic insight into tip link regeneration. We used backscatter scanning electron microscopy to monitor the distribution of immuno-gold labeled molecular components of the tip links during their re-formation and a conventional whole-cell patch-clamp technique to follow the concomitant recovery of mechano-electrical transduction. According to our data, the mechanotransduction machinery is initially re-established by the formation of functional (mechanotransduction-mediating) links of a previously unknown composition, PCDH15–PCDH15. Transition to the PCDH15–CDH23 composition underlies final maturation of mechanotransduction. This two-step mechanism of tip link regeneration was unexpected. As tip links are continuously stressed by loud sounds and regenerated throughout an organism's life, we provide a plausible molecular mechanism for the life-long maintenance of mechanosensory function in nonregenerating cochlear hair cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mechanosensory stereocilia bundles are arranged in rows of increasing height on the apical surface of the inner ear hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In mammals, auditory hair cells do not regenerate and therefore stereocilia bundles endure sound-induced deflections throughout an organism's life. When deflected by sound waves, stereocilia slide relative to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Karavitaki1">[1]</xref> and tug on tiny extracellular tip link filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Pickles1">[2]</xref>. Tip links are oriented obliquely, extending from the tops of shorter row stereocilia to the sides of stereocilia in the neighboring taller row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, inset). Current models of mechano-electrical transduction (MET) postulate that tip link tension controls the opening of the transduction channels that are located at or near the lower ends of the links <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Beurg1">[3]</xref>. Tip links are disrupted <italic>in vivo</italic> by intense acoustical stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Pickles2">[4]</xref> and can also be ablated <italic>in vitro</italic> by exposure to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free extracellular medium, which results in the loss of hair cell mechanotransduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Assad1">[5]</xref>. Although mammalian hair cells are terminally differentiated, broken tip links can regenerate and restore mechanosensitivity both <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Zhao1">[6]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Husbands1">[7]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms of this regenerative process are unknown, even though it is crucial for maintenance of hearing.</p>

<p>Two protein components of the tip link have been identified, cadherin 23 (CDH23) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Siemens1">[8]</xref> and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed1">[9]</xref>, which are both required for normal hearing and vision. Mutations of <italic>PCDH15</italic> or <italic>CDH23</italic> cause hearing loss or deaf-blindness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed2">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-DiPalma1">[14]</xref>. It was proposed that the tip links are formed by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent heteromeric interaction between PCDH15 at the lower end of the link and CDH23 at the upper end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kazmierczak1">[15]</xref>. This model is further supported by the evidence that tip link regeneration can be inhibited in the presence of soluble extracellular fragments of PCDH15 and CDH23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli1">[16]</xref>. However, disrupting the interaction of PCDH15 with CDH23 may have additional effects beyond tip link formation. A point mutation in PCDH15 that inhibits the PCDH15–CDH23 interaction <italic>in vitro</italic> results not only in the loss of tip links but also causes profound changes of the hair bundle structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Geng1">[17]</xref>, which were not observed in non-mechanosensitive hair cells of the mice lacking the TMC1/2 proteins, the latest candidates for MET channel subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kawashima1">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, knocking out each of three major classes of PCDH15 alternative C-terminal splice isoforms (CD1, CD2, and CD3) demonstrated that none of them is uniquely required for tip link formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Webb1">[19]</xref>. Therefore, it is still unclear whether or not a functional MET-mediating tip link always consists of a particular heteromeric PCDH15/CDH23 complex or tip links may have a different molecular composition.</p>
<p>To explore the molecular mechanism of tip link regeneration, we developed backscatter electron scanning microscopy to simultaneously visualize nanometer-sized stereocilia links and immuno-gold particles localizing the tip link components PCDH15 and CDH23. We measured the distribution of PCDH15 and CDH23 on the surface of stereocilia and along the length of the tip links during their regeneration. To our surprise, nascent regenerating tip links had PC DH15 at both ends of the link. These newly formed shorter links mediated MET current with a normal amplitude but abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent decay (adaptation). Only later, the heteromeric PCDH15–CDH23 composition of tip links was re-established and the normal adaptation of MET current recovered. Thus, tip link regeneration involves a hitherto unknown remodeling mechanism, in which PCDH15 transiently substitutes for CDH23 to accelerate recovery of hair cell mechanosensitivity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We studied tip link regeneration in young postnatal (5–7 d old) mouse inner hair cells (IHCs) in cultured organ of Corti explants at an approximately mid-cochlear location. In these IHCs, the developmental changes of the amplitude and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent decay (adaptation) of MET responses are largely complete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Stauffer1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Stepanyan1">[21]</xref>. Our study capitalizes on the unique sensitivity of stereocilia links in these cells to Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation. In young postnatal IHCs, fast exchange to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free extracellular solution supplemented with 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) disrupts most, if not all, stereocilia links, including tip, “top-to-top,” and “side” links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g002">2A</xref>). In this study, we defined a link that extends obliquely from the top of a lower row stereocilium to the side of a taller stereocilium in the direction of mechanosensitivity of the bundle as a “tip” link. Any other link originating at the hemisphere of the tip of shorter stereocilium is referred to as “top” link, while the links connecting stereocilia below the tip hemisphere are referred to as “side” links. Note that top and side links in young postnatal IHCs studied here are different from “top connectors” and other links that are insensitive to BAPTA and appear later in development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Goodyear1">[22]</xref>. Stereocilia links in young postnatal IHCs may contain both PCDH15 and CDH23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lagziel1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Michel1">[24]</xref>.</p>

<p>(A) Conventional SEM images of IHC stereocilia bundles not treated with BAPTA (control), immediately after BAPTA treatment (0 min), and at 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h of recovery. Insets show magnified images of tip links on the second (top) and third (bottom) row stereocilia indicated by dashed rectangles. Scale bar: 1 µm, main panels; 100 nm, insets. (B) Experimental arrangement with a patch pipette (right) and a piezo-driven probe deflecting stereocilia bundle (left). Scale bar: 5 µm. (C) MET current responses in representative IHCs at the same stages of tip link regeneration as in (A). Traces show MET current evoked by the graded deflections of stereocilia (bottom) with a piezo-driven probe. The beginning of MET current responses is shown on a faster time scale (right). Black traces highlight MET responses to small bundle deflections of 150 nm amplitude. Holding potential was −90 mV.

<p>Therefore, the complete disappearance of all stereocilia links after BAPTA treatment in young postnatal IHCs allowed us to quantify the re-appearance of links along the full lengths of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This was not possible in previous studies of tip link regeneration in chick basilar papilla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Zhao1">[6]</xref>, bullfrog sacculus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Assad1">[5]</xref>, or mouse cochlear outer hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli1">[16]</xref> due to the insensitivity of side links to BAPTA and the very tight spacing between stereocilia in these hair cell types.</p>

<title>Regenerating Tip Links Assemble Near the Top and Not at the Base of Stereocilia</title>
<p>We measured the distribution of all extracellular links along IHC stereocilia of the third (short) row, because its entire length can be observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), often including the space between the third and second row stereocilia. Third row stereocilia are mechanosensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Beurg1">[3]</xref> and have prominent tip links and side links, all of which disappear after BAPTA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g002">2A</xref>). Newly formed links always localized around the top of a stereocilium during link recovery, including 1 h after BAPTA treatment, when the number of nascent links was very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Only a few links were observed early during recovery (15, 30, and 45 min) and they were also located at the tips of stereocilia. We did not observe links in the middle or at the bottom of stereocilia during the first hours of recovery (15 min to 6 h) in any of the 84 organ of Corti explants examined. Rarely were links in these lower positions observed in control untreated samples or in samples that had recovered for 36 h or more. These data suggest that stereocilia links re-assemble at the tops of stereocilia and argue against the hypothesis proposing complete assembly of the MET apparatus, including relevant links, at the base of stereocilium and its subsequent movement to the top as a whole unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Geleoc1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Tip link components may be moved by myosin motors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Zhao1">[6]</xref> that are able to climb up along the actin core of stereocilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Shepherd1">[26]</xref>. Therefore, we examined whether the distribution of PCDH15 along stereocilium changes after tip link disruption and during their subsequent regeneration. PCDH15 is expected to be present in third row stereocilia and form the lower ends of nascent tip links <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kazmierczak1">[15]</xref>. Using an ultra-thin palladium coating, we were able, for the first time to our knowledge, to visualize simultaneously fine extracellular tip links and immuno-gold particles with SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). We used a previously validated affinity purified antiserum, HL5614, against an expressed fusion protein corresponding to extracellular sequence from N terminus that is common for numerous splice isoforms of PCDH15 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed1">[9]</xref>. Both immuno-gold and immunofluorescence HL5614 labeling were not observed when secondary antibodies were used without primary antibodies or in IHC stereocilia of mice homozygous for the <italic>Pcdh15<sup>av-3J</sup></italic> allele that encodes a truncated PCDH15 lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed1">[9]</xref>, thus validating the specificity of the antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s001">S1</xref>). In control cells untreated with BAPTA, 80%–87% of immuno-gold particles localized to tip links or immature side links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), as expected for the localization of PCDH15 in young postnatal IHCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed1">[9]</xref>. One to three gold particles were usually located at the lower end of a tip link (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, insets). BAPTA treatment disrupted stereocilia links in wild-type IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1G</xref>) and resulted in re-distribution of PCDH15 around the uppermost surface of the stereocilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1H</xref>), but did not affect the predominant concentration of PCDH15 labeling toward stereocilia tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). We concluded that tip links are likely to reassemble using PCDH15 molecules that remain near the tops of stereocilia. Because currently available antibodies against extracellular epitopes of PCDH15 are not isoform-specific, we cannot yet determine which PCDH15 isoforms participate in tip link formation and whether stereocilia tips contain one or more isoforms of PCDH15.</p>

<title>Regeneration of MET Occurs in Two Distinct Steps</title>
<p>To examine the properties of MET responses mediated by regenerating tip links, we used conventional whole-cell patch-clamp recording of MET currents evoked by deflection of IHC stereocilia with a piezo-driven rigid probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In control cells, hair bundle deflection activates a large inward current with a subsequent prominent decay within a few hundreds of microseconds after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, right traces). This fast inhibition of MET channel activity (adaptation) has been described in mammalian IHCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Beurg2">[27]</xref> and, despite a multitude of proposed mechanisms, is generally believed to be initiated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the MET channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Peng1">[28]</xref>. In contrast to a previous study of MET regeneration in mammalian outer hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli1">[16]</xref>, we monitored MET current not only at negative but also at positive intracellular potentials that eliminate electrochemical driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>). We adjusted the vertical position of the probe to minimize an artifactual and largely unrecognized decay of MET current that is independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through MET channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>, right). This phenomenon is not observed upon bundle deflection with a fluid-jet, even with relatively fast stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kros1">[29]</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, our stimulating technique is the first one to allow objective determination of the optimal vertical position of the stimulation probe and more accurate recordings of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent adaptation and deflection sensitivity of the MET current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Three different probe positions drawn to scale: “very high” (I), “high” (II), and “optimal” (III). Dashed cyan lines indicate the boundary layer of fluid entrained by a fast moving probe. The main panels show a “back view” of the probe deflecting stereocilia bundle, while insets represent side views. In positions (I) and (II), the liquid boundary layer may entrain the outermost stereocilia of the bundle during forward movement of the probe. Therefore, these outermost stereocilia are free to “spring back” when the probe stops. In contrast to bullfrog sacculus stereocilia, which are tightly coupled and move in unison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kozlov1">[48]</xref>, stereocilia of mammalian IHCs are coupled more loosely and are unlikely to move in unison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Stauffer1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Smith1">[49]</xref>. (B) MET currents (top traces) evoked by the graded deflections of stereocilia (bottom traces) in <italic>the same cell</italic> at different probe positions (I, II, III) at positive (+90 mV) and negative (−90 mV) holding potentials. Positive holding potential prevents Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the cell and, therefore, eliminates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent adaptation. Black traces highlight MET current evoked by the smallest deflection of the probe. (C) The current–displacement relationships of MET current (left); the extent of adaptation, i.e. percent changes of the MET current at the end of bundle deflection of 10 ms duration (middle); and the time constant of MET adaptation, τ<sub>ad</sub>, determined by a single exponential fit (right) at different probe positions (I, blue; II, green; III, black).

<p>As expected, BAPTA treatment abolished MET current in young postnatal IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The amplitude of MET current gradually recovered during the 12 h after reintroduction of normal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g004">4A</xref>). SEM imaging showed that both tip and top links recovered within the same period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g004">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Except for the first 2 h of recovery when the MET current is very small and optimal positioning of the piezo-driven probe cannot be guaranteed, the current–displacement relationship of MET current had the same shape at all stages of MET recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The normal slope of this curve is also consistent with reassembly of mechanosensory links at stereocilia tops rather than their transport from the base of stereocilia, which would result in a less steep current–displacement curve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Waguespack1">[30]</xref>.</p>

<p>In spite of a complete restoration of the MET current amplitude by 12 h of recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), adaptation did not fully recover, even after 24 h following tip link ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Zhao1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli1">[16]</xref>). The “fast” component of adaptation dominating at small bundle deflections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Wu1">[31]</xref> was affected the most. The time constant of this adaptation component was elevated almost 5-fold in the first hours after BAPTA treatment and returned to control values only after 36 h of recovery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), which is 24 h after complete restoration of the amplitude of MET current and re-establishment of stereocilia links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g004">Figure 4A–B</xref>).

Most informative was the alignment of the average normalized MET current at different time points after link ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). The aligned traces showed that the extent of adaptation (i.e., percentage of adapting MET current) quickly recovered to an intermediate level but then persisted at this level for more than 24 h, before increasing sharply to normal values sometime between 30 and 36 h after BAPTA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).

<title>PCDH15, but Not CDH23, Is Retained at Stereocilia Surface After Tip Link Disruption</title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the two-step MET recovery, we compared the distribution of PCDH15 and CDH23 at the surface of stereocilia before and after BAPTA treatment. We generated antiserum C2367 against the same extracellular epitope of CDH23, PB240 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kazmierczak1">[15]</xref>, that was used previously for CDH23 localization at the tip link (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s003">Figure S3</xref> for validation). Consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kazmierczak1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lagziel1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Michel1">[24]</xref>, backscatter SEM localized CDH23 to the upper end of the tip links and to the immature side links in young postnatal IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). CDH23 labeling was not observed in CDH23-deficient <italic>Cdh23<sup>v-6J</sup></italic> mice or in wild-type mice when primary antibodies were omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figures 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s003">S3A, and S3C</xref>). In general agreement with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kazmierczak1">[15]</xref>, BAPTA treatment resulted in redistribution of CDH23 along the length of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), but did not result in accumulation of CDH23 at the tip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). The overall number of anti-CDH23 immuno-gold particles in the vicinity of the tip links connecting stereocilia of the first (tallest) and second row decreased significantly after BAPTA treatment and did not fully recover even after 24 h in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, blue). In contrast to CDH23, the amount of anti-PCDH15 immuno-gold particles did not decrease after BAPTA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, red). Although the mechanism of differential loss of CDH23 is unclear, the ectodomain of CDH23 is significantly longer that of PCDH15 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Brasch1">[33]</xref>.

<p>The loss of CDH23 at the surface of stereocilia after BAPTA treatment was not a species-specific phenomenon. We observed a similar selective decrease of CDH23, but not PCDH15, after BAPTA treatment in chick cochlear hair bundles using polyclonal C2367 and monoclonal G19 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Goodyear2">[35]</xref> antibodies against extracellular epitopes of CDH23 and PCDH15, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s005">Figure S5</xref>). We also labeled wild-type mouse IHC stereocilia with a different antibody (TF7) recognizing an intracellular epitope of CDH23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lagziel1">[23]</xref> and found a substantial decrease of immunofluorescence after BAPTA treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s006">Figure S6</xref>), suggesting removal or degradation of stereociliary CDH23.</p>
<p>Examination of the spatial distribution of PCDH15 and CDH23 revealed prominent clustering of immuno-gold particles in the tip link area, which disappeared shortly after stereocilia link ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5D and E</xref>). However, PCDH15 and CDH23 responded differently to BAPTA treatment. While anti-CDH23 immuno-gold particles became much less abundant, PCDH15 was merely redistributed along the surface of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5F–I</xref>). In the first hour after BAPTA treatment, anti-PCDH15 immuno-gold particles in the tip link region of ∼120×120 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, green) were less clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), but their total number did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). PCDH15 decreased in the side link region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5H</xref>) and increased in nearby areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5I</xref>), arguing that PCDH15 molecules were free to migrate around to the front of a stereocilium. Later, anti-PCDH15 immuno-gold particles were once again concentrated in the tip link area, where their total number increased relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5D and G</xref>). Although almost 70% of the tip links had reassembled by the 5<sup>th</sup> hour of recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5G</xref>, black), the number of anti-CDH23 immuno-gold particles was still low in all of the analyzed regions of interest and had not yet recovered to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5G–I</xref>, blue). Loss of CDH23 after BAPTA treatment, circumferential migration of PCDH15 shortly after treatment, and its subsequent re-grouping in the tip link area were evident not only in the vicinity of the links connecting first and second row stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g005">Figure 5</xref>) but also in the vicinity of the tip links connecting second and third row stereocilia (data not shown). We therefore hypothesized that PCDH15 compensates for the loss of CDH23 in newly regenerating tip links.</p>

<title>Molecular Remodeling of the Tip Links During Their Regeneration</title>
<p>Remarkably, the distribution of PCDH15 and CDH23 along the length of the tip link filament changed after BAPTA treatment. We analyzed separately this distribution in the tip links connecting first to second and second to third rows of IHC stereocilia and, because they showed nearly identical results, combined the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In control untreated IHCs, PCDH15 was localized predominantly to the lower end of the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6A–B</xref>), while CDH23 was at the upper end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6B–C</xref>). In nascent regenerating tip links, we observed a large increase of the amount of PCDH15 at the upper ends of the tip links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6B and D</xref>). Throughout regeneration, PCDH15 was distributed almost equally at both ends of the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6B and D</xref>). In contrast to PCDH15, a significantly smaller number of anti-CDH23 immuno-gold particles was found on nascent tip links and they were located mostly at the upper end of the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6B and D</xref>). The total number of anti-PCDH15 immuno-gold particles per tip link significantly increased in the first hours of tip link regeneration and remained somewhat elevated throughout link regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, red circles), while the number of anti-CDH23 particles per tip link exhibited a reciprocal significant decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, blue circles). The apparent length of nascent developing tip links was significantly smaller than the length of tip links in control IHCs, indicating a prolonged period of link remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, black circles). We observed an increased incidence of anti-PCDH15 immuno-gold particles at the upper end or both ends of nascent tip link filaments, as well as multiple particles along the filament's length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). During link regeneration, the percentage of tip links having anti-PCDH15 particles only at the lower end, only at the upper end, and at both ends of the link were approximately equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), consistent with stochastic labeling of a filament possessing PCDH15 at both ends.</p>

<p>Postnatal development of MET in mammalian IHCs has not yet been systematically investigated. We previously demonstrated that development of MET current responses and their adaptation are largely complete by P3 in the mouse IHCs in the middle of the cochlea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Stepanyan1">[21]</xref>. It is very likely that, similar to the cochlear outer hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Waguespack1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli2">[37]</xref>, developing IHCs first acquire the ability to respond to mechanical stimuli and only later exhibit fully mature adaptation. The molecular remodeling of tip links may contribute to this developmental maturation of MET current.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data revealed a hitherto unknown process of structural remodeling of broken tip links that is necessary for regeneration of MET in auditory hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g008">Figure 8</xref>). After stereocilia link disruption, CDH23 largely disappears while PCDH15 migrates from the side link area around the circumference of the stereocilium and becomes available for forming the upper end of a nascent tip link. At the same time, PCDH15 molecules at the lower end of a disrupted tip link also migrate circumferentially but remain at the stereocilia tip. Then, transient tip link filaments are assembled using PCDH15 molecules at both sides of the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g008">Figure 8</xref>, red). These transient tip links mediate MET current with normal amplitude but an abnormal extent of adaptation. Finally, new or perhaps refolded/repaired CDH23 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g008">Figure 8</xref>, blue) replace PCDH15 at the upper end of the tip link, completing the regeneration of mature tip links and the concomitant recovery of MET adaptation. This final step seems to be essential for long-term maintenance of MET because CDH23 is apparently required for MET in mammalian hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Caberlotto1">[38]</xref>. The high affinity interaction between CDH23 and PCDH15 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kazmierczak1">[15]</xref> may favor the replacement of PCDH15 at the upper end of the tip link with newly synthesized or repaired CDH23, whose appearance in regenerating links is delayed relative to PCDH15.</p>

<title>Formation of a transient PCDH15–PCDH15 tip link and its subsequent replacement with PCDH15–CDH23 link.</title>
<p>The model assumes that BAPTA disrupts PCDH15–CDH23 bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Sotomayor2">[39]</xref> and MET channels are bound to or located near the lower end of the tip link <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Beurg1">[3]</xref>. The transduction channel becomes nonfunctional after tip link disruption. Therefore, its location immediately after BAPTA treatment is unknown, although illustrated as present at the tip of stereocilium. Alternatively, MET channels may migrate away from the tip of a stereocilium as a complex with PCDH15 molecules. Harmonin-based complexes linking CDH23 to the cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Grillet1">[41]</xref> are shown as blue circles near the upper end of the tip link.</p>

<p>Because HL5614 antibodies recognize an extracellular epitope that seems to be common to numerous PCDH15 alternative splice isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed1">[9]</xref> and because these isoforms may have redundant function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Webb1">[19]</xref>, we cannot distinguish whether nascent regenerating tip links have at their ends identical or different PCDH15 isoforms. It is yet uncertain whether nonclassical cadherins like PCDH15 or CDH23 could form stable extracellular links through homomeric interaction. Evidence for CDH23–CDH23 homomeric interaction have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Siemens1">[8]</xref>, but the same group later suggested that this interaction, along with homomeric PCDH15–PCDH15 interaction, is likely to have a low affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kazmierczak1">[15]</xref>, which is consistent with our data that PCDH15–PCDH15 tip links are only temporary intermediates in the tip link regeneration process. A recent report also provided no direct evidence for homomeric interaction between the first EC domains of either CDH23 or PCDH15 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Sotomayor2">[39]</xref>. However, heteromeric interaction of different PCDH15 isoforms is still possible. Alternative splicing of the <italic>Pcdh15</italic> gene can generate several protein products that differ at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s007">Figure S7</xref>) and provides a dazzling variety of potential heteromeric interactions between different PCDH15 isoforms, which are known to be targeted specifically to different stereocilia compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed1">[9]</xref>. In addition, a secreted isoform of PCDH15 lacking the transmembrane domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-RougetQuermalet1">[40]</xref> may also be recruited to help span the distance between adjacent stereocilia.</p>
<p>It is yet unclear exactly how molecular remodeling of tip links affects the extent of adaptation of MET responses. It is possible that the decreased length of PCDH15–PCDH15 tip links changes the angle of inclination of tip link and therefore affects the extent of adaptation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s008">Figure S8A</xref>–B). However, such changes are predicted to affect the slope of the MET current–displacement curve, which was not observed in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The extent of adaptation may also decrease if the elastic harmonin-based complex connecting the upper end of the tip link to the cytoskeleton is replaced to a complex with nonlinear saturating stiffness, for example with PCDH15 that is bound to the cytoskeleton with molecules that “slip down” along the actin core when tip link tension reaches a certain level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001583.s008">Figure S8C</xref>). Indeed, recent studies identified harmonin and THMS as interacting partners of CDH23 and PCDH15, correspondingly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Grillet1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Xiong1">[42]</xref>. These very different interacting partners may contribute to different mechanical properties of macromolecular complexes connecting CDH23 and PCDH15 to the actin cores of stereocilia. Another possibility is that CDH23 at the upper end of the tip link may affect homomeric interaction of parallel PCDH15 filaments at the lower end of the link, thereby affecting the adaptation machinery, or recruit additional adaptation-related components of tip link, which can be seen as a third “foot” at the lower end of the link <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kachar1">[43]</xref>. In any case, our data open new perspectives to study the molecular basis of MET machinery by characterizing redistribution of the proteins normally associated with PCDH15 and CDH23 during tip link regeneration.</p>
<p>Delayed acquisition of fully developed adaptation is a common finding of studies investigating formation of the mechanotransduction apparatus either after tip link disruption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Zhao1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli1">[16]</xref> or during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Waguespack1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Si1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli2">[37]</xref>. However, there are different interpretations of these data. According to one model, the fully functional mechanotransduction machinery is assembled somewhere around the base of the hair bundle and transported by myosin-based motors to the tips of stereocilia, where it undergoes final “refinement” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli2">[37]</xref>. Another model postulates that the mechanotransduction apparatus is assembled at its final location at the tips of the stereocilia from components that arrive there in a stepwise progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Waguespack1">[30]</xref>. We did not find evidence for upward movement of stereocilia links or PCDH15 molecules along the stereocilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which is consistent with direct assembly of the transduction apparatus at the tips of stereocilia. On the other hand, replacement of PCDH15 with CDH23 at the final step of molecular remodeling of the tip links may be considered as a “refinement” of the transduction apparatus. We should note, however, one caveat of the direct comparison of our data with the previously published reports. In this study, we investigated regeneration of mechanotransduction in young postnatal mouse IHCs, capitalizing on the unique sensitivity of all stereocilia links in these cells to BAPTA treatment. Previous reports described regeneration or development of mechanotransduction in different hair cell types—e.g., hair cells of chick basilar papilla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Zhao1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Si1">[36]</xref>, mouse vestibular hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Geleoc1">[25]</xref>, and cochlear outer hair cells of rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Waguespack1">[30]</xref> and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli2">[37]</xref>. The diversity of preparations suggests caution in comparing results. For example, an unusually fast recovery of MET current–displacement relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) may result from specific mechanical properties of the IHC bundles or from better control of vertical positioning of the stimulating probe in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data reconcile two previous molecular models of tip link formation. One model proposed that the tip link has a PCDH15–CD3 isoform at the lower end and a PCHD15–CD1 isoform at the upper end of the link <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Ahmed1">[9]</xref>. A more recent model suggests that the tip link is built with PCDH15 and CDH23 at the lower and upper ends of the link, correspondingly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kazmierczak1">[15]</xref>. We show that the molecular composition of the tip links is not static. During tip link regeneration, the hair cell temporarily utilizes PCDH15 molecules at both ends of the link to recover MET responses until mature PCDH15–CDH23 links are established.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that regeneration of tip links and mechanotransduction <italic>in vitro</italic> recapitulates the assembly of the transduction apparatus <italic>in vivo</italic> (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g007">7</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Geleoc1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Si1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Lelli2">[37]</xref>. Therefore, the two-step molecular remodeling process that we have discovered may underlie formation of the tip links in the developing hair bundle, their turnover in the mature bundle, and their regeneration after intense acoustical stimulation in order to safeguard hearing.</p>

<p>Hair cells were observed with an inverted microscope (TE2000, Nikon) using a 100× 1.3NA 0.2WD oil-immersion objective and differential interference contrast. To access the basolateral plasma membrane of IHCs, the outermost cells including outer hair cells were removed by gentle suction with a ∼5 µm micropipette. Smaller pipettes for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): CsCl (140), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5), Na<sub>2</sub>ATP (2.5), EGTA (1.0), HEPES (5). The pipette resistance was typically 4–6 MΩ when measured in the bath. Patch clamp recordings were performed with AxoPatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Series resistance was compensated up to 80% (lag 7–10 µs). After compensation, the time constant of the recording system determined by the “membrane test” feature of the Clampex 9.2 software (Molecular Devices) was in the range of 35–70 µs. IHCs were held at baseline potential of −60 mV between the recordings and at −90 mV or +90 mV for the transient periods of MET recordings. MET recordings at positive (+90 mV) potential were used to adjust the vertical position of the probe along the bundle's height to minimize the artifactual (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive) component of MET adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g003">Figure 3</xref>). MET responses were low-pass filtered at 20 kHz (Bessel type, Stanford Research Systems), acquired at 200 kHz sampling rate, and averaged up to five times.</p>

<title>Hair Bundle Deflection by a Piezo-Driven Rigid Probe</title>
<p>We deflected hair cell bundles with a stiff glass probe that was fire-polished to match the shape of the hair bundle (∼5–7 µm). The probe was 15–20 mm long, protruding 2–3 mm out of a concentric hole drilled in a plastic screw. The short length of the probe prevents lateral resonances. The probe was moved by a piezo actuator (PA 8/14 SG) custom-modified for a faster response with a time constant of 26–28 µs, driven by a high current amplifier (ENV 800, Piezosystem Jena). Although this actuator is slightly slower than the one used previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Stepanyan1">[21]</xref>, its built-in strain gauge sensor provided direct reading of the probe's axial displacement. Command voltage steps were generated by pClamp 9.2 software and low-pass filtered at 25 kHz (Bessel type). The angle between the axis of the probe movement and the bottom surface of a dish was kept at ∼30°. Resting (zero) position of the bundle was estimated by manually advancing the piezo-probe toward the bundle in the excitatory direction until the MET current appeared and then stepping back until the cell current returned to normal. Because this manual technique is not precise, we did not analyze quantitatively the resting open probability of MET channels.</p>

<title>Immuno-SEM Imaging</title>
<p>Although visualization of immuno-gold particles with a backscatter SEM detector is a previously reported technique, we found that the reported methods are not suitable for imaging stereocilia links. Common carbon coating of samples does allow imaging of immuno-gold particles on stereocilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Goodyear3">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Verpy1">[46]</xref>, but a reasonable electric conductivity of the sample is achieved only with a heavy coating of ∼20 nm thickness, which hides stereocilia links. Chromium is another common coating material, but it is susceptible to oxidation, resulting in stereocilia link damage. Using an “ExB filter” of the Hitachi S-4800 instrument, we were able to observe immuno-gold particles on samples coated with a fine 2 nm layer of iridium or in samples prepared with OTOTO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Furness1">[47]</xref> technique. However, this approach worked only on relatively flat surfaces. The convoluted surface of the stereocilia bundle generates too many backscatter electrons for a reasonable atomic number (Z-) contrast. After trying carbon, chromium, silver, and iridium coating, we found that a fine coating with palladium allows sufficient Z-contrast and an acceptable resolution of fine surface structures. Therefore, the samples were dehydrated and dried as described above, but sputter coated with 2 nm of palladium. Stereocilia bundles were observed with Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with YAG detector of backscatter electrons.</p>

<p><bold>Potential mechanisms of the dependence of MET adaptation on tip link composition.</bold> (A) Transduction channel (green) in series with a nonstretchable PCDH15–CDH23 tip link <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Kachar1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Sotomayor3">[51]</xref>, “tension release” adaptation element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Stauffer2">[52]</xref>, and intracellular elastic elements at lower (<italic>K<sub>1</sub></italic>) and upper (<italic>K<sub>2</sub></italic>) ends of the tip link. According to Hooke's law, when the system is stretched by Δx with an external stimulus, MET channel encounters force: <italic>F<sub>peak</sub></italic> = <italic>K<sub>1</sub></italic>×<italic>K<sub>2</sub></italic>/(<italic>K<sub>1</sub></italic>+<italic>K<sub>2</sub></italic>)×Δx. Activation of the tension-release element decreases overall elongation of elastic components by Δd and changes the force experienced by the channel: <italic>F<sub>adapted</sub></italic> = <italic>K<sub>1</sub></italic>×<italic>K<sub>2</sub></italic>/(<italic>K<sub>1</sub></italic>+<italic>K<sub>2</sub></italic>)×(Δx−Δd) = <italic>F<sub>peak</sub></italic>−<italic>K<sub>1</sub></italic>×<italic>K<sub>2</sub></italic>/(<italic>K<sub>1</sub></italic>+<italic>K<sub>2</sub></italic>)×Δd. Assuming the MET channel is an ideal force sensor, extent of adaptation is: Ex = (<italic>F<sub>peak</sub></italic>−<italic>F<sub>adapted</sub></italic>)/<italic>F<sub>peak</sub></italic> = Δd/Δx. At first approximation, Δx is determined by shear displacement between stereocilia multiplied by Sin(Θ), where Θ is the tip link inclination angle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001583-Geisler1">[53]</xref>. Therefore, the extent of adaptation depends on the geometry of the MET apparatus. (B, left) If a shorter PCDH15–PCDH15 tip link is formed without changes to the stereocilia separation at the level of a tip link, Θ would decrease resulting in a smaller Δx and a larger extent of adaptation. (B, right) If stereocilia are closer to one another during link regeneration because of an increased number of shorter side links, the angle Θ may increase, decreasing the extent of adaptation. It is not possible to detect changes in Θ based on immuno-SEM images. (C) Replacement of CDH23 with PCDH15 at the upper end of the tip link may introduce to the MET apparatus an element with nonlinear stiffness (<italic>K<sub>2</sub></italic>, red). For example, it may occur if myosin motors connecting PCDH15 to the actin core of stereocilium would not withstand tension above a certain threshold and “slide down” along the actin core. Nonlinear force–displacement relationship of the system (red graph on the right panel) would result in a decreased extent of adaptation, similar to the one observed in our experiments during tip link regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001583-g004">Figure 4E–F</xref>).</p>
