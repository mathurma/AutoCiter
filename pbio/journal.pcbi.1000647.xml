<p>We developed a unified model of the GRK-mediated β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) regulation that simultaneously accounts for six different biochemical measurements of the system obtained over a wide range of agonist concentrations. Using a single deterministic model we accounted for (1) GRK phosphorylation in response to various full and partial agonists; (2) dephosphorylation of the GRK site on the β2AR; (3) β2AR internalization; (4) recycling of the β2AR post isoproterenol treatment; (5) β2AR desensitization; and (6) β2AR resensitization. Simulations of our model show that plasma membrane dephosphorylation and recycling of the phosphorylated receptor are necessary to adequately account for the measured dephosphorylation kinetics. We further used the model to predict the consequences of (1) modifying rates such as GRK phosphorylation of the receptor, arrestin binding and dissociation from the receptor, and receptor dephosphorylation that should reflect effects of knockdowns and overexpressions of these components; and (2) varying concentration and frequency of agonist stimulation “seen” by the β2AR to better mimic hormonal, neurophysiological and pharmacological stimulations of the β2AR. Exploring the consequences of rapid pulsatile agonist stimulation, we found that although resensitization was rapid, the β2AR system retained the memory of the previous stimuli and desensitized faster and much more strongly in response to subsequent stimuli. The latent memory that we predict is due to slower membrane dephosphorylation, which allows for progressive accumulation of phosphorylated receptor on the surface. This primes the receptor for faster arrestin binding on subsequent agonist activation leading to a greater extent of desensitization. In summary, the model is unique in accounting for the behavior of the β2AR system across multiple types of biochemical measurements using a single set of experimentally constrained parameters. It also provides insight into how the signaling machinery can retain memory of prior stimulation long after near complete resensitization has been achieved.</p>

<p>The β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is involved in regulating many cellular processes such as smooth muscle relaxation in the airways and the vasculature. Drugs that activate the β2AR are used in treating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and prolonged use of these drugs leads to the loss of their effects. Thus, a dynamic model of how the β2AR responds to different drugs is fundamental to their rational use. In this study a consensus model of G protein coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated receptor regulation was formulated based on quantitative measures of six processes involved in β2AR regulation. This model was then used to simulate the consequences of manipulating key rates associated with the GRK-mediated β2AR regulation, leading to predictions which will provide a useful framework for further tests and elaborations of the model in basic and clinical research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is intimately involved in the control of smooth muscle relaxation in airways and the vasculature, in stimulation of the heart, and numerous other physiologically important actions. Agonist stimulation of the β2AR causes activation of the Gs/cAMP/ protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Agonist triggers β2AR desensitization that involves two pathways, G protein-dependent highly amplified PKA phosphorylation, and G protein-independent G protein coupled receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylation that in turn triggers arrestin binding, internalization, recycling and resensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Clark1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Premont1">[4]</xref>. Additionally, there is an important role for PKA regulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and phosphodiesterase activity in the desensitization of the response to β2AR stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Violin1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Xin1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>We recently examined the turnover profiles of cAMP in HEK 293 cells expressing only endogenous β2AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Xin1">[6]</xref>. Our study of the β2AR desensitization was based on characterization of membrane localized cAMP in single cells with genetically encoded cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels in the presence of GRK and/or PDE inhibitors, and measurements of PDE activity. A model was developed that adequately described cAMP turnover based on GRK-mediated β2AR desensitization and PDE activation by PKA. Violin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Violin1">[5]</xref> measured β2AR stimulation of cAMP profiles using a GFP-YFP-tagged EPAC sensor (ICUE2) following manipulation of GRK activities with siRNA to reduce levels of GRKs, and inhibitors to reduce PDE activity.</p>
<p>As an extension of these studies, we have sought to model the GRK module of the β2AR desensitization and resensitization as it relates to measurements of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, internalization, recycling, desensitization and resensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In previous studies we showed that HEK 293 cells overexpressing the β2AR was an excellent system for examining the biochemical parameters associated with the desensitization process. Importantly, the time course and extent of desensitization of the β2AR in these cells overexpressing the β2AR is similar to that of the endogenous receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Clark2">[7]</xref>. In the overexpression system, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR shows an EC<sub>50</sub> that is approximately 1000 fold lower than the EC<sub>50</sub> for high occupancy-dependent GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR. Thus, it is possible to separate the GRK- and PKA-mediated desensitization of the β2AR into two different modules. At high concentrations of agonist we have shown that the GRK pathway accounts for almost all of the desensitization of the β2AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Seibold1">[8]</xref>. Here we have used a wide range of experimentally determined β2AR parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000647-t001">Table 1</xref>) to model and simulate the key steps in the consensus GRK pathway in response to varied agonist concentrations. The data simulated were obtained from over 90 distinct experiments performed in HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing the human β2AR. Accounting for all these disparate data using a single model provided strong constraints on the model, and ensured that its applicability was not restricted to only one class of data of the β2AR's response repertoire. The model provides a much needed quantitative description of the GRK pathway to β2AR desensitization and resensitization.</p>

<title>Model of the GRK-Mediated β2AR Regulation Pathway</title>
<p>The present model of the GRK-mediated regulation of the β2AR pathway derives from consensus models that have appeared over the last decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Clark1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Premont1">[4]</xref> that includes activation, GRK phosphorylation, arrestin binding and dissociation, desensitization, internalization, recycling and resensitization of the receptor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The experimental rate constants were derived from either new experiments or in some cases from previous publications as indicated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000647-t001">Table 1</xref>). The equations corresponding to these reactions (E1–E10) are described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>.</p>
<p>Our model incorporates several key assumptions. First, since all the parameters used for modeling of the GRK pathway were obtained using either isoproterenol (ISO) or epinephrine, full agonists for the β2AR, we assume a simple two state model for the receptor activation, where R<sub>s</sub> indicates the inactive receptor on the surface of the plasma membrane and R<sup>*</sup>L<sub>s</sub>, the agonist-induced active receptor. Agonist binding to the receptor occurs with rapid on/off-rates. The off-rates for ISO have been estimated to be ≥4/min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Mueller1">[9]</xref> and for epinephrine &gt;100/min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Krasel1">[10]</xref>. Based upon the K<sub>d</sub>s for epinephrine (450 nM) and ISO (283 nM), the on-rates were estimated to be very fast.</p>
<p>In the second set of assumptions we set the off-rates for a full agonist like epinephrine and ISO to be 4/min and chose an arbitrarily fast on-rate of ligand binding. This is done for the pragmatic purpose of running simulations without having to use the rapid rates, and also at the same time preventing the forward rates from being rate limiting for accessibility of the receptor for GRK phosphorylation. While the nuances of agonist binding to the β2AR and activation of Gs have been modeled in far greater detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Kenakin1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Linderman1">[12]</xref>, for our purposes these specific interactions have been ignored because they occur at much shorter timescales compared to the 0.5 to 30 min events associated with GRK mediated β2AR desensitization and subsequent resensitization. We also assume that the off-rates for ligand from the receptor are independent of its status of phosphorylation or arrestin binding. The effects of these events on ligand off-rates have not been determined. There is evidence that arrestin stabilizes a high affinity state of ligand binding and therefore might reduce ligand off-rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Gurevich1">[13]</xref>. Faster off-rates (5f in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g001">Figure 1</xref>) cause a faster resensitization following removal of agonist. Slower off-rates would lead to slower resensitization.</p>
<p>Third, we assume that the GRK phosphorylated β2AR (R<sub>gs</sub>, R<sub>g</sub><sup>*</sup>L<sub>s</sub>) has reduced activity (0.7) compared to unphosphorylated β2AR, consistent with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Benovic1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran1">[16]</xref>. We also assume that any arrestin bound receptors in the plasma membrane are completely uncoupled. Additionally, to enable modeling of resensitization of β2AR stimulation of adenylyl cyclase following agonist treatment, and removal of the stimulus by addition of antagonist, we represented the antagonist like a competitive inhibitor that competes with the agonist for binding to the receptor leading to lower agonist binding rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Prichard1">[17]</xref>. Treating the antagonist as such necessitated the introduction of additional molecular species in the model, viz. agonist free GRK phosphorylated receptor, either bound to (ArrR<sub>gs</sub>) or free of arrestin (R<sub>gs</sub>). These molecules are usually at negligible levels, but at the instance of addition of an antagonist like propranolol or rapid washout of agonist, there is a transient increase in levels of these species. Finally, we ignore spontaneous activation of the β2AR, since in the absence of ISO treatment, GRK phosphorylation of the receptor is negligible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Drake1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Vaughan1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Fourth, we assumed that an activated β2AR undergoes a single event of GRK phosphorylation and that it can be dephosphorylated in the plasma membrane in addition to the cytosol. We set the rate of GRK phosphorylation to be dependent on [R<sup>*</sup>] which is the fraction of ligand-bound receptor. Thus in our model GRK phosphorylation is dependent on receptor activation and agonist concentration, which is consistent with agonist occupancy being the rate determining step for GRK phosphorylation for strong agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Kohout1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran3">[23]</xref>. We previously identified three sites responsible for GRK phosphorylation of the β2AR, serines 355, 356, and 364 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Seibold1">[8]</xref>, and our conclusions have been supported by mass spectrometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-TresterZedlitz1">[24]</xref>. All of our GRK phosphorylation studies are performed using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylation of serines 355, 356, but not of either alone. The experimentally measured GRK phosphorylation rates upon treating with epinephrine range from 0.7–1.4/min. We assume that since ISO is a full agonist, the phosphorylation rates fall within the same range. Intermediate phosphorylated states of other GPCRs like rhodopsin have been considered in kinetic models of shorter timescales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Hamer1">[25]</xref>. For the longer timescales that we are modeling we ignore intermediary phosphorylated states and use the binding of our phosphosite antibody as readout of GRK phosphorylation of the receptor. The use of our anti-phosphosite antibody for kinetic studies has been validated by numerous groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Pontier1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Woo1">[29]</xref>. With regard to the cellular locale of β2AR dephosphorylation, our group has shown in several studies that the plasma membrane bound receptor, as well as that present in endosomes, can undergo dephosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Iyer1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Fifth, we assumed that the rate constants for arrestin binding to the receptor following agonist-induced GRK phosphorylation was 27/min and dissociation from an agonist-free receptor was 11/min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Krasel1">[10]</xref> even though these were obtained from fluorescently tagged proteins. We estimated the arrestin dissociation rate from an agonist bound receptor complex (3b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g001">Figure 1</xref>) to be ∼4.0/min given the stability of this complex from previous measurements of the K<sub>d</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Gurevich2">[31]</xref>. Arrestin binding in turn leads to clathrin coated pit internalization. Upon internalization of the β2AR we assume that there is rapid ligand dissociation consistent with the relatively high K<sub>d</sub>s and rapid on/off-rates of either ISO or epinephrine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Mueller1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Devanathan1">[32]</xref>. We have shown that the rate of basal internalization is negligible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Morrison1">[33]</xref> and have set the rate at a level that is 5% of the agonist-induced internalization.</p>
<p>Sixth, we assumed that the internalized β2AR can undergo; (i) dephosphorylation following arrestin dissociation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Pippig1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Sibley1">[35]</xref>; (ii) recycling with or without dephosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran1">[16]</xref>; and (iii) a very slow process of downregulation (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 3–4 hours) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Morrison1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Liang1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Williams1">[37]</xref>. Thus, in the present model that focuses on the rapid GRK-mediated events (0–30 min), we do not further discuss potential downregulation or de novo receptor synthesis as it contributes little to the events being modeled in these time scales. Also, in the model we allow any of the internalized receptors to be downregulated at the same low rate. At present, it is not clear what the precise mechanisms and pathways of downregulation of the β2AR involve, although we have shown that it is a biphasic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Williams1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, although GRK phosphorylation of the receptor and arrestin binding to the receptor are second order reactions, we represent them as pseudo-first order reactions. Our argument to do so is that both GRKs and arrestins are in excess of even the overexpressed receptor levels. Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran3">[23]</xref> have shown that GRK2, 5 and 6 levels exceeded overexpressed β2AR levels by approximately 100 fold. Clark and Knoll <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Clark2">[7]</xref> have shown that the extent of desensitization is similar with HEK 293 cells expressing endogenous (30 fmol/mg) versus overexpressed β2AR (3000 fmol/mg). This suggests that arrestin is at levels sufficient to give full desensitization even in a stable receptor overexpression system. Further, Menard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Menard1">[38]</xref> have shown that HEK 293 cells have the highest relative levels of GRK and arrestin when compared to four other cell lines.</p>

<p>Simulation of the dephosphorylation of the GRK phosphorylated β2AR is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. Dephosphorylation was measured after treatment of cells with either 1.0 µM or 10 nM ISO for 5 min followed by addition of 1.0 µM propranolol and measurement of the loss of WT β2AR phosphorylation using the anti-pS (355, 356) antibodies. Just like the experiments, the simulations were performed in two parts. The first part dealt with agonist treatment that allowed for phosphorylation of the receptor, and the second part involved treating with an antagonist which allowed for measuring/simulating dephosphorylation. The rate of agonist binding was calculated as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000647-t001">Table 1</xref>, and the time and concentration of agonist treatment were dependent on the experimental protocol being simulated. At the end of the first run the concentrations of all forms of β2AR were set as initial concentrations for the second part. Antagonist binding was simulated as competitive inhibition. The net effect was that in the presence of an antagonist, agonist binding rates were reduced 100,000 fold, but the dissociation rates remain unchanged. At the end of the simulations the sum total of the six GRK phosphorylated species were plotted against the experimentally measured GRK phosphorylated β2AR.

<title>Desensitization</title>
<p>Phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, internalization, recycling and arrestin recruitment rates were explicitly modeled and the experimental measures of these rates defined the rates used in the model for these individual steps. Experimental measures of desensitization and resensitization were measures of downstream events, namely activation of AC. Since AC was not explicitly modeled, the receptor species capable of activating AC, namely, R<sub>s</sub>, R<sup>*</sup>L<sub>s</sub>, R<sub>g</sub><sup>*</sup>L<sub>s</sub> and R<sub>gs</sub> were matched against the experimental measure of cAMP production, and in doing so we validated our model to data sets not used to develop the model.</p>
<p>The β2AR desensitization experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) were performed in HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing either WT β2AR or a β2AR lacking the two PKA consensus sites (S261, 262A and S345, 346A termed PKA-). The rationale for using the PKA- was to eliminate the contribution of PKA to the desensitization as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Seibold1">[8]</xref>. While the PKA component of desensitization is minimal at longer times of agonist treatment at high concentrations, it does contribute a small component of desensitization both at lower agonist concentrations and for shorter treatment times. Desensitization of β2AR stimulation of adenylyl cyclase was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Seibold2">[39]</xref>. The β2AR desensitization was simulated by setting agonist concentrations and time of treatment as per the experimental protocol being simulated. At the end of the simulation run, the total of the three active forms of the β2AR and naïve receptor was juxtaposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) against the experimentally measured active β2AR. As expected from the contribution of the PKA desensitization, we found that our GRK-mediated β2AR regulation model underestimated the experimentally determined desensitization over the first two minutes of agonist treatment for the WTβ2AR, but there was good agreement with longer treatment times. However, our model matches well the desensitization measured in the PKA- cells that overexpress the β2AR lacking the PKA consensus site, thus, supporting our argument that the model misses the PKA component that contributes to immediate early desensitization.</p>

<title>Resensitization</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows the results of simulation of receptor resensitization. Resensitization of β2AR stimulation of AC following agonist treatment (15 min, 1.0 µM ISO) and addition of the low affinity antagonist, metoprolol for the times indicated was measured as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>. The resensitization of the β2AR was simulated in two parts, as described for dephosphorylation and recycling above. At the end of the simulation run the sum total of all the active forms of the β2AR is juxtaposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) against the experimentally measured active β2AR. We see that using the default model there is a spike in the initial rate of resensitization relative to the experimental values. The spike can be ablated if we assume a ten-fold lower rate of ligand dissociation from an arrestin-bound receptor complex based on the apparent stability of this complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Gurevich2">[31]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b7">
<title>Sensitivity analysis of desensitization and resensitization</title>
<p>The univariate sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the effect of up to a twenty-fold increase or decrease in individual rates on the simulation results of desensitization and resensitization under conditions described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g003">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000647.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000647.s003">S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Significant deviations from experimental desensitization measurements were obtained for perturbations of only three rates. Consistent with the model, decreasing GRK phosphorylation (k<sub>2f</sub>) reduced the desensitization at earlier time points. Reducing arrestin affinity for the receptor-ligand complex (k<sub>3f</sub>, k<sub>3b</sub>) decreased desensitization at later time points.</p>
<p>The resensitization sensitivity analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000647.s003">Figure S3</xref>) results are complicated because we first desensitize the system for 15 min. This affects the starting values of resensitization. Decreasing internalization of ArrR<sub>g</sub><sup>*</sup>L<sub>s</sub> (k<sub>8f</sub>) reduces the amount of receptor desensitization achieved at 15 min (see conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus at the start of resensitization simulation we begin at a higher baseline and this overestimates the resensitization. As the simulation progresses there is no significant effect of perturbing internalization rates. Increasing recycling (k<sub>11f</sub>, k<sub>13f</sub>) reduces the amount of internalized receptor and therefore leads to an overestimation of resensitization.</p>

<sec id="s2c1">
<title>GRK rates</title>
<p>Decreasing the GRK phosphorylation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g004">Figure 4</xref> A–C), at saturating concentrations of ISO, resulted in decreased initial phosphorylation levels, whereas the steady state rates were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Increasing GRK phosphorylation rates did not have a marked effect on the initial phosphorylation and maximum phosphorylation. This is an interesting observation because GRK knockdown and overexpression studies are often performed at steady state and at saturating agonist concentrations. In principle this increases the risk of false negative results. Our data and simulations suggest that a more rigorous approach is measurement of initial rates of β2AR phosphorylation at subsaturating agonist concentrations. We show that the simulated effects of variations in rates of GRK phosphorylation are more pronounced following 50 nM ISO treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000647.s004">Figure S4</xref>). With respect to internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), lowering the GRK phosphorylation rates has marked effects on the initial rates of internalization, with little effect on the maximum amplitude. The effects on desensitization due to variation in phosphorylation rates were similar to the effects on phosphorylation, but phase shifted because these are sequential events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). As with phosphorylation therefore, measurements ideally should be made at the earlier time points and low agonist concentrations to detect significant changes.</p>

Pippig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Pippig1">[34]</xref> have shown that treating A431 cells with a phosphatase inhibitor did not affect the recycling of β2ARs in these cells.

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g005">Figure 5E</xref> we test a scenario that allows for dephosphorylation only at the plasma membrane and disallows recycling of phosphorylated receptor.

The major consequence of this model is that it essentially freezes the plasma membrane level of phosphorylated β2AR.

<title>Frequency Coding in the β2AR Signaling System</title>
<p>In an earlier study of the resensitization of β2AR stimulation following agonist treatment, we found that there was a rapid phase of resensitization that we attributed to the rapid dissociation of arrestin and a slower phase corresponding to recycling of receptor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran1">[16]</xref>. The rapid phase occurred with minimal dephosphorylation, clearly dissociating it from resensitization. We and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Krasel1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran2">[19]</xref> speculated that the slow rate of dephosphorylation would lead to a “memory of desensitization” upon a washout phase followed by second treatment with agonist.</p>
<p>These, as well as most previous studies, were performed with saturating levels of agonist for extended periods of time. <italic>In vivo</italic> this type of exposure likely rarely occurs. Rather, the β2AR is exposed to different amplitudes and frequencies of agonists in different tissues; e.g., β2AR in the synapse is exposed to a higher concentration of norepinephrine, but the delivery is pulsatile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Stjarne1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Trendelenburg1">[56]</xref> due to the rapid removal and reuptake of norepinephrine, whereas following release of epinephrine from the adrenal gland, much lower levels of agonist concentrations in the bloodstream are achieved for relatively longer periods.</p>
<p>To explore the predictions of our model under various frequencies of agonist stimulation, we first simulated a scenario where there is a rapid burst of a high concentration of agonist for 30 s duration followed by 30 s washout. We assumed instantaneous agonist dissociation from the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We observed that under this stimulation paradigm close to 80% desensitization (green – active receptor) is achieved with almost 100% GRK phosphorylation (red – phosphorylated receptor) and only about 20% internalization (black – surface receptor). Following removal of agonist, resensitization is rapid due to rapid arrestin dissociation. In spite of this near complete recovery, we show that during this pulsatile activation of the receptor, the receptor “remembers” prior exposure to an agonist and desensitizes much more strongly on subsequent exposures. This is because of the accumulation of the phosphorylated receptor due to slower dephosphorylation.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g006">Figure 6B</xref> we stimulate with the same concentration of agonist (1µM ISO) as used in the previous figure but instead of rapid pulsatile delivery we model a continuous delivery for 5 min followed by a wash for 5 min and subsequent restimulation for 5 min. Under this paradigm almost a 95% desensitization is achieved but with more than 50% internalization. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g006">Figure 6C</xref> we test how the system would behave when challenged with sub-saturating levels of agonist for longer periods of time. We simulated a β2AR response to 50 nM ISO for 30 min followed by 30 min wash and restimulation. Under longer periods of agonist treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g006">Figure 6B, C</xref>) the resensitization is biphasic (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The rapid phase of resensitization is dependent upon arrestin dissociation while the slower phase is dependent upon recycling and dephosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The latent memory that we described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g006">Figure 6A</xref> is only observed at higher frequencies of agonist stimulation. For periods of longer stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), as might represent treatment with a strong stable agonist in diseases such as asthma, receptor recycling plays an important role in resensitization. Surprisingly, if the longer term treatment is with a weak agonist like albuterol, a very strong desensitization occurs since this agonist at saturation is equivalent to the 50 nM treatment with ISO as previously discussed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Moore1">[57]</xref>.

<title>Slow Dephosphorylation and Rapid Arrestin Dissociation Account for a Latent Memory of β2AR Response to Agonists</title>
<p>Having shown that the β2AR signaling system could “remember” prior stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) we wanted to explore the inter-pulse time (time between paired pulse stimulation) dependency and effects of varied receptor dephosphorylation and arrestin dissociation on this latent memory. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g007">Figure 7A</xref> we simulate a paired pulse paradigm of receptor activation with 1µM ISO. As we predicted, even though resensitization is rapid, the β2AR system retained the memory of the previous paired pulse stimuli following restimulation and desensitized more strongly in response to subsequent stimuli as shown by the plot of “active” β2AR (green lines). The simulations show that this latent memory is due to the progressive accumulation of phosphorylated receptor on the surface (red). This primes the receptor for faster arrestin binding to surface receptor (blue) on subsequent agonist activation leading to a greater extent of desensitization. Note that there is no significant internalization following the pulsatile stimuli (black lines – surface receptor). Progressively increasing the inter-pulse time reduces the memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), as it allows significant dephosphorylation to occur. The memory is robust and survives beyond 30 min after the first stimulus. When the dephosphorylation rates are increased 2–50 fold over the default rate we see that a 50 fold increase is required to ablate the memory of the previous 6 s pulse of agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Going in the other direction, the result of decreasing the dephosphorylation rate 50 fold would result in a profound locking-in of latent memory (simulation not shown).</p>

<p>Some GPCRs have an apparently much higher affinity for arrestin such that arrestin does not dissociate rapidly following internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Moore2">[58]</xref>. To investigate this possibility we increased the affinity of arrestin for the receptor agonist complex in the model by decreasing the dissociation rate of arrestin from the complex. Increased residence of arrestin with the receptor complex increased the time required for resensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), whereas decreasing the residence time of arrestin on the receptor allowed for rapid resensitization. We also increased the stability of ligand binding to the receptor/arrestin complex by decreasing the off-rate 100 fold, and still the property of memory was not lost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000647.s006">Figure S6</xref>), although recovery time is extended. To summarize, the latent memory that we predict in the β2AR system is due to the slow dephosphorylation and rapid arrestin dissociation from the receptor.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2g">
<title>Partial Agonism</title>
<p>Another application of the model is for predictions concerning partial agonists. For most partial agonists the initial rate of ligand-induced GRK site phosphorylation is proportional to coupling efficiency (with the notable exception of cyclopentylbutanephrine) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Drake1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-January1">[59]</xref>. In our simulations of partial agonist phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000647.s001">Figure S1A, B</xref>) we are able to predict the extent and time course of phosphorylation solely by setting agonist occupancy proportional to coupling efficiency where the coupling efficiency of epinephrine, a full agonist, was set at 1.</p>
<p>Prolonged treatment with saturating concentrations of salmeterol, a clinically important drug for asthma therapy, results in decreased β2AR internalization relative to ISO, even though the GRK phosphorylation of the β2AR is of comparable levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000647.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Moore1">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-January1">[59]</xref>. Overexpression of arrestin restores some internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Moore1">[57]</xref>. This has led us to propose that salmeterol stabilizes an altered state of the receptor that has less affinity for arrestin which leads to a decrease in β2AR internalization. We modeled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000647.s001">Figure S1C</xref>) β2AR internalization on treatment with salmeterol and found that a simulation based only on coupling efficiencies overestimates grossly the extent of internalization. This discrepancy can be corrected in part if we reduce by ten-fold the rate of arrestin binding to a salmeterol-bound receptor complex. However it takes a ten-fold decrease in the rate of arrestin binding and a ten-fold increase in rate of arrestin dissociation from a salmeterol-bound receptor complex to match the negligible amount of experimentally measured internalization. This is congruent with our idea that salmeterol-bound GRK-phosphorylated β2AR complex (ArrR<sub>g</sub><sup>*</sup>L<sub>s</sub>) has a lower affinity for arrestin.</p>
<p>Attempts at measuring salmeterol-induced desensitization have been frustrated by the inability to wash salmeterol out. However our previous work suggested much less desensitization relative to a full agonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Moore1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-January1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Johnson1">[61]</xref>. Now it is possible for us to simulate salmeterol-induced desensitization using a model that matches other experimental measurements like salmeterol-induced β2AR phosphorylation and internalization. The result of the simulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000647.s001">Figure S1D</xref>) clearly supports the contention that salmeterol causes a much reduced desensitization relative to ISO when both the on- and off-rates of arrestin are changed ten-fold as in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000647.s001">Figure S1C</xref>. This may also help explain why salmeterol, a weak partial agonist, is an effective treatment for asthma.</p>

<title>Model Limitations</title>
<p>Despite the ability of the model to capture the broad range of data shown, a few limitations exist. The model in its current form does not include adenylyl cyclase, PDE, or PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor. In the absence of the PKA reactions the model cannot capture the behavior of the β2AR signaling system at low agonist concentrations or PKA induced PDE regulation. We previously showed that prestimulation of PKA phosphorylation with forskolin does not alter the time course of GRK phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran2">[19]</xref>, however, at high concentrations of agonist the GRK phosphorylation appears to reduce PKA site phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Vaughan1">[20]</xref>. A further complication concerns the possibility of AC regulation. Since we deal with only receptor-level desensitization we have ignored these downstream regulatory events.</p>
<p>We suggest a form of “cellular memory” occurs that allows the system to remember prior stimuli which are difficult to measure experimentally. For intact cell analysis this is confounded by the rapid hydrolysis of cAMP caused by PKA stimulation of PDE and the consequent difficulties in interpretation even with saturating levels of PDE inhibitors. Resensitization experiments need to be carried out in the presence and absence of internalization/recycling to show that under certain patterns of stimuli the system can show a greater desensitization to the second stimuli as suggested by the simulations. We also need to show that this effect is abrogated by addition or upregulation of phosphatase activity. Our simulations indicate that this potential upregulation must be extreme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) to significantly change the retention of memory. In that regard we recently reported on mutations of 3 lysines that greatly reduce ubiquitylation, and surprisingly cause an ∼5–7 fold increase in the rate of dephosphorylation of the β2AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Liang1">[36]</xref>. Consistent with our model this increase did not appreciably alter either desensitization or internalization of the receptor.</p>
<p>We show that the currently held dogma that disallows the possibility of plasma membrane dephosphorylation of the receptor and recycling of the phosphorylated receptor is clearly incompatible with our modeling and previous experimental results. One caveat though is that the effect of ligand-independent internalization of the β2AR on dephosphorylation kinetics has not been explored in detail. Ligand-independent internalization has been shown to occur in other GPCRs like the cannabinoid CB1 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-McDonald1">[62]</xref> and melanocortin MC4 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Mohammad1">[63]</xref>. We have previously shown in our cell lines that in the absence of agonist there is no measureable internalization of the β2AR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Morrison1">[33]</xref>. Recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Scarselli1">[64]</xref> it was shown that in HeLa cells transiently transfected with β2AR or M3R there was measureable amounts of ligand-independent internalization. It remains to be further examined if this was an artifact of transient transfections or if constitutive internalization of β2AR does occur in other cell lines and has an effect on dephosphorylation kinetics. Preliminary simulations (data not shown) on the effect of ligand-independent internalization on dephosphorylation kinetics in model F (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000647-g005">Figure 5</xref>) show that an increased rate of constitutive internalization will not rescue the poor behavior of model F.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Our long-term goal is to develop comprehensive, quantitative models of β2AR-mediated signaling pathways. Such quantitative models serve as a summary of the current state of understanding in the field, and have many important applications: (i) understanding of the mechanisms underlying the differences between β2AR response in different tissue types; (ii) simulation of clinically observed tachyphylaxis in β2AR associated with prolonged use of β2AR agonists in asthma and COPD treatment; (iii) hypothesis testing and generation of experimental predictions. The present model represents a significant advance toward this goal, since it is able to account for many salient β2AR response features in various experimental studies performed in different cell lines.</p>

<p>Since no single experiment gives the full range of data needed to adequately constrain the model we used an amalgamation of over 90 different data points from distinct experiments from three different cell types. The data sets chosen for modeling spanned measurements across every possible step in the signaling pathway. The key features we sought to match were general behavior of the signaling components across cell types, if possible, under a given stimulus paradigm. Most of the parameters for the model listed in the Appendix and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000647-t001">Table 1</xref> were based on biochemical values from our experiments (when available). More details on the choices of parameters are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000647-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The reactions describing the total GRK-mediated regulation of β2AR was written out using the Law of Mass-Action considering the system to exist in equilibrium. The model was implemented using Matlab R2008 (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) and a Runge-Kutta solver. The code is available upon request. All analyses were done using Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and plots were generated using GraphPad Prism 4.</p>

<title>Simulation of perturbations of the rate constants for the various parameters</title>
<p>The activities or amount of individual signaling components of the pathway can vary in different cell lines or by experimental manipulations such as overexpression or knockdowns of GRKs, arrestins or phosphatases. Simulations to account for these experimental variations were performed by simply varying 2 to 50 fold the appropriate rate constants.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b3">
<title>Simulation of partial agonists</title>
<p>The simulations for partial agonist-mediated activation of the β2AR were done by setting coupling efficiencies of each agonist relative to epinephrine (α). The coupling efficiencies/efficacies of different agonists were obtained from previous measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran2">[19]</xref>. The phosphorylation and internalization measurements were made at saturating concentrations for different agonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Tran2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000647-Moore1">[57]</xref>. Since the coupling efficiencies were set relative to epinephrine, agonist concentrations were set to saturating epinephrine concentrations (10 µM) for the simulation run.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b4">
<title>Sensitivity analysis of desensitization and resensitization</title>
<p>The univariate sensitivity analysis for the model was carried out to test the effect of variation of individual rates on the simulation results of desensitization and resensitization. Except for ligand binding and unbinding rates all other rates were individually varied 2X, 5X, 10X, 20X above and below the measured or default rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000647-t001">Table 1</xref>). The results were then plotted as the change from the average experimental measure of desensitization or resensitization at different instances of time.</p>
