<p>Transcriptome-wide analysis of protein-RNA interactions predicts the dual splicing effects of TIA proteins, showing that their local enhancing function is associated with diverse distal splicing silencing effects.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>The regulation of alternative splicing involves interactions between RNA-binding proteins and pre-mRNA positions close to the splice sites. T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA1) and TIA1-like 1 (TIAL1) locally enhance exon inclusion by recruiting U1 snRNP to 5′ splice sites. However, effects of TIA proteins on splicing of distal exons have not yet been explored. We used UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) to find that TIA1 and TIAL1 bind at the same positions on human RNAs. Binding downstream of 5′ splice sites was used to predict the effects of TIA proteins in enhancing inclusion of proximal exons and silencing inclusion of distal exons. The predictions were validated in an unbiased manner using splice-junction microarrays, RT-PCR, and minigene constructs, which showed that TIA proteins maintain splicing fidelity and regulate alternative splicing by binding exclusively downstream of 5′ splice sites. Surprisingly, TIA binding at 5′ splice sites silenced distal cassette and variable-length exons without binding in proximity to the regulated alternative 3′ splice sites. Using transcriptome-wide high-resolution mapping of TIA-RNA interactions we evaluated the distal splicing effects of TIA proteins. These data are consistent with a model where TIA proteins shorten the time available for definition of an alternative exon by enhancing recognition of the preceding 5′ splice site. Thus, our findings indicate that changes in splicing kinetics could mediate the distal regulation of alternative splicing.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Studies of splicing regulation have generally focused on RNA elements located close to alternative exons. Recently, it has been suggested that splicing of alternative exons can also be regulated by distal regulatory sites, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. The TIA proteins are key splicing regulators that enhance the recognition of 5′ splice sites, and their distal effects have remained unexplored so far. Here, we use a new method to map the positions of TIA-RNA interactions with high resolution on a transcriptome-wide scale. The identified binding positions successfully predict the local enhancing and distal silencing effects of TIA proteins. In particular, we show that TIA proteins can regulate distal alternative 3′ splice sites by binding at the 5′ splice site of the preceding exon. This result suggests that alternative splicing is affected by the timing of alternative exon definition relative to the recognition of the preceding 5′ splice site. These findings highlight the importance of analysing distal regulatory sites in order to fully understand the regulation of alternative splicing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pre-mRNA splicing is catalysed by small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNP) that recognise the splice sites on pre-mRNA and remove the introns with great precision. U1 and U2 snRNPs recognise the core motifs present at the 5′ and 3′ splice sites, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Reed1">[1]</xref>. These core splice site motifs, however, contain only about half of the information required to define exon/intron boundaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Lim1">[2]</xref>. Additional sequence elements can recruit regulatory RNA-binding proteins either to enhance or silence splice site recognition depending on their position relative to the splice sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Blencowe1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>T-cells intracellular antigen 1 (TIA1) and TIA1-like1 (TIAL1, also known as TIAR) are closely related RNA-binding proteins. They have three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a carboxyl-terminal glutamine-rich region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Tian1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Kawakami1">[6]</xref>. RRM2 is the major domain binding to uridine-rich sequences, RRM3 is thought to bind to RNA with no specificity, and RRM1 has no detectable RNA binding affinity in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Dember1">[7]</xref>. Instead, RRM1 and the C-terminus interact with U1 snRNP to enhance its recruitment to the 5′ splice site of alternative exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-DelGattoKonczak1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Zhu1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>TIA1 and TIAL1 are involved in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism. They are present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and shuttle between these two compartments in a manner that requires the RRM2 and RRM3 domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Kedersha1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Zhang1">[13]</xref>. In the nucleus, TIA1 and TIAL1 regulate alternative splicing by binding to U-rich sequences adjacent to the 5′ splice site and recruiting U1-C to promote exon inclusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-DelGattoKonczak1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Forch1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Zhu1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Forch2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Aznarez1">[15]</xref>. They also regulate the splicing of their own mRNAs, and the resulting two major isoforms have different splicing activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Izquierdo1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-LeGuiner1">[17]</xref>. In the cytoplasm, TIA1 and TIAL1 function as translational silencers by binding to the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Piecyk1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Gueydan1">[19]</xref>. They were also implicated in stress-induced translational silencing in stress granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Kedersha1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Gilks1">[20]</xref>. In addition, TIA1 and TIAL1 were shown to promote apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Taupin1">[21]</xref>, and depletion of both proteins promotes cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Reyes1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>The role of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory RNA motifs located close to alternative exons has been widely investigated, but recent studies suggest that distal regulatory motifs might also play an important role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Xue1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Licatalosi1">[24]</xref>. For instance, Nova1 and Nova2 proteins can silence inclusion of an alternative exon when binding downstream of the preceding exon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Licatalosi1">[24]</xref>. In contrast, Nova proteins enhance inclusion when binding directly downstream of an alternative exon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Licatalosi1">[24]</xref>. This suggested that the local and distal effects of Nova binding downstream of a 5′ splice site are reciprocal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule2">[25]</xref>. Since the function of TIA proteins in recruiting U1 snRNP to 5′ splice site is well characterised, these proteins offered a unique opportunity for a comprehensive study of the distal splicing effects of changes in 5′ splice site recognition.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet (UV)-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) was first developed to identify RNA sites bound by the splicing regulators Nova1 and Nova2 in brain tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule3">[26]</xref>. The traditional CLIP cDNA library preparation protocol suffers from a potential loss of cDNAs due to truncation immediately before the “crosslink site,” where at least one amino acid remains covalently attached after proteinase K digestion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Urlaub1">[27]</xref>. Therefore, we used a modified cDNA library preparation protocol that was recently developed (iCLIP), which identifies truncated cDNAs by introducing the second adapter to cDNAs after reverse transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Konig1">[28]</xref>. In addition, iCLIP introduces a random DNA sequence (barcode) to cDNAs during reverse transcription to differentiate between unique cDNA products and PCR duplicates. Since the first nucleotide of resulting cDNA sequences most likely locates directly downstream of the crosslink site, iCLIP enables quantitative and high resolution analysis of protein crosslinking to the target RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Konig1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we used iCLIP to identify the RNA crosslink sites of TIA proteins. iCLIP showed a high density of TIA crosslinking in 3′ UTRs of mRNAs and in non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Intronic TIA binding clusters were restricted to positions immediately downstream of 5′ splice sites. TIA binding at the 5′ splice site of an alternative exon and/or the preceding exon predicted its dual splicing effects. TIA binding enhanced inclusion of proximal upstream alternative exons and usage of upstream alternative splice sites but silenced distal downstream alternative exons if these lacked direct TIA binding. Interestingly, TIA proteins also regulated distal alternative 3′ splice sites, suggesting that by enhancing 5′ splice site recognition, they can indirectly silence downstream alternative exons.</p>

<title>iCLIP and iCLAP Identify Crosslink Sites of TIA1 or TIAL1</title>
<p>iCLIP was used to identify the crosslink sites of TIA1 and TIAL1 in HeLa cells in a transcriptome-wide manner. Briefly, cells were UV-irradiated, lysed, and RNA was digested with RNase I to a size of approximately 40–100 nucleotides (nt). The proteins were immunoprecipitated using TIA1 or TIAL1-specific antibodies, and the protein-RNA complexes were subjected to 5′ labelling using <sup>32</sup>P-γ-ATP for visualisation after SDS-PAGE separation. The specificity of each antibody was determined by overexpression of TIA1 or TIAL1 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g001">Figures 1A, 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s001">S1A and S1B</xref>). TIA1 and TIAL1 antibodies each detected RNA-protein complexes of correct size only from UV-crosslinked cells and only if an antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the signal decreased in TIA1/TIAL1 double knockdown (KD) cells and increased when the corresponding protein was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). There was a slight cross-reactivity of the TIA1 antibody to the TIAL1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s001">S1A</xref>, when TIAL1 was overexpressed). However, during immunoprecipitation, the TIA1 antibody mainly recognised the TIA1 protein, as no increase was seen when TIAL1 was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>

<title>iCLIP identifies the TIA1 and TIAL1 crosslink sites with nucleotide resolution.</title>
<p>Autoradiogram of <sup>32</sup>P-labelled RNA crosslinked to TIA1 (A) or TIAL1 (B) in HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation was performed with either anti-TIA1 or anti-TIAL1 antibody using lysate from UV-crosslinked HeLa cells, cells transfected with TIA1 or TIAL1, TIA1/TIAL1 KD cells, or non-crosslinked cells. High and low RNase concentrations were used and protein G beads were used as a control. The Western blots below the autoradiograms show the input lysate used for each immunoprecipitation. (C) TIA1 and TIAL1 crosslink to uridine tracts downstream of the alternative 5′ splice sites in the CLIP4 gene. The cDNA positions are colour-coded for three replicate TIA1 and TIAL1 experiments, and the random barcode (shown on the left) is used to identify unique iCLIP cDNAs (number in brackets indicates the number of corresponding PCR duplicates). Below, the bar graphs show the cDNA count (number of cDNAs at each crosslink site). Pre-mRNA sequence is shown below with crosslink nucleotides in red. The exon and intron positions of the two isoforms of CLIP4 mRNA are shown at the bottom.</p>

<p>To assess the RNA sequence specificity of TIA1 or TIAL1 without the use of antibodies, we also developed crosslinking and affinity purification (iCLAP), a method to purify Strep/His double-tagged TIA1 and TIAL1 proteins using stringent affinity purification. This method circumvents any cross-reactivity of antibody that would identify the same crosslink sites for both proteins. TIA1 and TIAL1 with the Strep/His tag on the N- or C-terminus were overexpressed in HeLa cells. After UV crosslinking and RNase I digestion, the protein-RNA complexes were first purified with magnetic streptavidin bead before ligation to the 3′ RNA adaptor. Cobalt beads were then used to further purify the protein-RNA complexes under denaturing conditions (8 M urea, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). iCLAP detected protein-RNA complexes only if cells were transfected with an appropriate construct, and no signal was detected in vector-transfected or non-crosslinked cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). In summary, the analysis of radioactive protein-RNA complexes indicated that both iCLIP and iCLAP isolated specific protein-RNA complexes without contamination from other co-purified proteins or RNAs.</p>
<p>To amplify the co-purified RNAs, these were dephosphorylated and ligated to the 3′ RNA adaptor on beads during immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) or affinity purification (iCLAP). After SDS-PAGE and nitrocellulose transfer, the protein-RNA complexes of 70–150 kDa were excised from the membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s001">Figure S1C</xref>) and subjected to proteinase K digestion. The RNA was reverse transcribed with a primer complementary to the 3′ RNA adaptor, which contained a second half complementary to the 5′ Solexa sequencing primer separated by a BamHI digestion site. The cDNA was then self-circularised, digested with BamHI, giving a product with corresponding adaptors at both ends, and amplified by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). PCR products were sequenced using single-end 44 nt reads on the Illumina GA2 system.</p>
<p>Three independent replicate iCLIP experiments and one iCLAP experiment were performed for both TIA1 and TIAL1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s010">Table S1</xref>). In total, 18.4 million iCLIP sequences were generated, 74% of which aligned to the human genome by allowing only single genomic hits and one nucleotide mismatch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s011">Table S2</xref>). Unique cDNAs were identified based on random barcodes, and the crosslink site was mapped to the first nucleotide preceding the start of the cDNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Together, iCLIP produced 869,782 unique cDNA reads for TIA1 and 2,966,801 unique cDNA reads for TIAL1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s011">Table S2</xref>). The iCLIP no-antibody controls, performed in parallel with two of the iCLIP experiments, did not generate detectable PCR products. When submitted for sequencing, they generated 1,074 and 7,798 unique cDNAs mapping to the human genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s011">Table S2</xref>). Since TIA1 or TIAL1 iCLIP generated 100-fold more cDNAs than controls, we estimated that over 99% of cDNAs from the iCLIP experiment represent RNA sites specifically crosslinked to TIA1 or TIAL1.</p>

<title>TIA1 and TIAL1 Bind the Same RNA Sites</title>
<p>The random barcode introduced into iCLIP cDNAs allowed us to analyse the distribution of TIA1 and TIAL1 on human RNAs in a quantitative and reproducible manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Only 1.7% of cDNAs mapped in antisense orientation to annotated genes, confirming the high strand specificity of iCLIP. Only 10% of cDNAs mapped to intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The highest cDNA density was seen in 3′ UTRs and ncRNAs, which together contained 22% of all cDNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). 2,277 ncRNAs and 8,602 3′ UTRs had a higher cDNA density than the whole-genome average, and the cDNA enrichment correlated between TIA1 and TIAL1 iCLIP (Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> = 0.95 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.90, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s003">Figure S3G and S3H</xref>).

Interestingly, cDNA enrichment in 3′ UTRs was 5-fold higher than in the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), in agreement with past findings that TIA proteins bind 3′ UTR to regulate translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Piecyk1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Kedersha2">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-LopezdeSilanes1">[31]</xref>.</p>

<p>Fifty-eight percent of TIA1 and 60% of TIAL1 cDNAs mapped to introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). 67,002 introns had a cDNA density higher than the whole-genome average, and the cDNA enrichment correlated between TIA1 and TIAL1 iCLIP (<italic>r</italic> = 0.81; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s003">Figure S3I</xref>). The cDNA density in introns was on average 18-fold lower than in 3′ UTRs and ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s003">S3I</xref>). Past studies have shown that TIA1 and TIAL1 regulate alternative splicing of exon 6 of FAS mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Forch2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-LeGuiner1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Shukla1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Izquierdo2">[33]</xref>. Both TIA1 and TIAL1 crosslinked to previously characterised intronic binding sites in FAS pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s005">Figure S5A</xref>).</p>
<p>Past studies suggested that TIA1 and TIAL1 have different RNA binding specificities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Dember1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Kim1">[34]</xref>. However, the two proteins can regulate alternative splicing of the same exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-LeGuiner1">[17]</xref>. We therefore analysed the in vivo RNA specificity of the two proteins using our iCLIP data. As a control, the iCLIP positions were randomised within the co-expressed genomic regions. The 21 nt sequence surrounding the crosslink sites was compared to randomised positions to identify the pentamers enriched at the TIA1 and TIAL1 crosslink sites. Pentamer enrichment in TIA1 and TIAL1 iCLIP data was highly correlated, and UUUUA and AUUUU were the two most common pentamers (<italic>r</italic> = 0.99; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s003">S3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s012">Table S3</xref>). Comparing replicate iCLIP experiments of either protein verified the high reproducibility of the observed sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s003">Figure S3C and S3D</xref>). Similarly, iCLAP experiments with both proteins were also highly correlated and were enriched for the same pentamers as iCLIP, independently supporting the determined sequence specificity of both proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). These results demonstrated that TIA1 and TIAL1 share the same in vivo RNA binding specificity.</p>
<p>Due to the high stringency of purification of protein-RNA complexes, iCLIP purified RNA sites that directly interact with TIA proteins. However, it is possible that some of these sites represent transient and low-affinity TIA-RNA interactions. To specifically analyse the high-affinity RNA binding sites, we determined clusters of TIA1 or TIAL1 crosslink sites with a maximum spacing of 15 nt containing a significant cDNA count when compared to randomised positions (FDR &lt;0.05). This identified 12,048 TIA1 and 34,058 TIAL1 crosslink clusters. Uridine represented 82% of TIA1 and 75% of TIAL1 clustered crosslink sites (i.e., crosslink sites that located within these clusters) and was also the most common nucleotide at all positions up to 10 nt away from these crosslink sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). This agreed with the past studies showing that TIA proteins bind to uridine-rich motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-DelGattoKonczak1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Forch2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-LeGuiner1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Gueydan1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>To compare the overlap between binding of TIA1 and TIAL1 to the same sites, we analysed the proportion of crosslink clusters identified by both proteins. Eighty-three percent (10,021 / 12,048) of TIA1 crosslink clusters overlapped with a TIAL1 crosslink site, and 59% (20,047 / 34,058) of TIAL1 crosslink clusters overlapped with a TIA1 crosslink site. The overlap depended on the number of cDNAs that defined a cluster. Ninety-nine percent of the crosslink clusters that were defined by five or more TIA1 cDNAs overlapped with a TIAL1 crosslink site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). We also assessed the distances between clustered TIA1 and TIAL1 crosslink sites. TIAL1 crosslink sites overlapped with TIA1 crosslink sites 15-fold more common than with randomised TIA1 iCLIP positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s003">Figure S3F</xref>). These analyses indicated that the binding sites of TIA1 and TIAL1 largely overlap.</p>
<p>Since both proteins showed a redundant binding behaviour, the iCLIP data of TIA1 and TIAL1 were merged to increase the reliability of cluster definition, which depends on the number of unique cDNA sequences. 46,970 crosslink clusters were identified in the joint TIA1/TIAL1 data with a maximum spacing of 15 nt (FDR&lt;0.05). The cDNA counts within these crosslink clusters were highly correlated between TIA1 and TIAL1 data, indicating that they had similar affinity to their common RNA binding sites (<italic>r</italic> = 0.85; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, the cDNA counts were correlated even at the single-nucleotide level, as evident in the 3′ UTR of MYC mRNA, which is a functionally validated translational target of the TIA proteins (<italic>r</italic> = 0.73; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s005">S5B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-MazanMamczarz1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Liao1">[35]</xref>. Taken together, iCLIP data suggested that TIA1 and TIAL1 have similar affinity for their common RNA binding sites.</p>

<title>iCLIP Predicts TIA Effects on Splicing of Cassette Exons</title>
<p>In order to identify the candidate positions where TIA proteins bind to regulate splicing, we compared the distribution of TIA1/TIAL1 iCLIP clustered crosslink sites close to constitutive and alternative cassette exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Thirty-fold enrichment was seen at positions 10–28 nt downstream of exon/intron boundaries compared to the last 20 nt of both type of exons.

<p>Since TIA proteins were previously described as splicing enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-DelGattoKonczak1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Forch2">[14]</xref>, we hypothesised that TIA crosslink clusters could be used to predict proximal enhanced exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, a regulatory logic was defined where TIA crosslink clusters 10–28 nt downstream of an alternative exon (region α in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) predicted enhanced exon inclusion. This predicted 1,620 alternative cassette exons as enhanced by TIA proteins. Furthermore, since binding of Nova proteins downstream of the preceding exon could silence distal alternative exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule1">[4]</xref>, we defined a second regulatory logic for distal silencing. TIA crosslink clusters 10–28 nt downstream of the preceding exon (region β in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) predicted silenced alternative exon inclusion if TIA crosslink clusters were absent in the region α. This predicted 1,962 alternative cassette exons as silenced by TIA proteins.</p>
<p>To assess the iCLIP predictions in an unbiased way, the splicing changes in TIA1/TIAL1 KD HeLa cells were analysed using a high-resolution splice-junction microarray. Microarray data were analysed with the ASPIRE 3 software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Konig1">[28]</xref>. The microarray detected splicing changes in 1,213 cassette exons (|ΔIrank|≥1), 46 of which were further assessed using reverse transcription and PCR (RT-PCR) and capillary electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s015">Text S1</xref>). RNA was isolated from cells treated with three different siRNA oligonucleotide pairs targeting TIA1 and TIAL1, and with control siRNA oligonucleotides (for knockdown efficiency, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Primer pairs generated a PCR product for 40 of the 46 tested splicing events, with 30 detecting two or more splicing isoforms. Among these, RT-PCR validated 86.7% (26/30) of the splicing changes, confirming the high accuracy of the microarray data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s009">Figure S9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s013">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>We assessed the accuracy of iCLIP predictions by comparing them to the splicing changes identified by the microarray. Exons were divided into subsets according to the confidence of the detected splicing change (ΔIrank), and the number of exons correctly predicted by iCLIP was identified in each subset. iCLIP predicted approximately 5% of false positives in control exons (|ΔIrank|&lt;0.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). However, iCLIP predicted a significantly higher number of exons among those with a detectable splicing change (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Fisher's Exact Test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). For these exons, iCLIP correctly predicted the direction of splicing change for 105 of 123 exons (85%), out of which 87 were enhanced (ΔIrank ≥2) and 18 were silenced (ΔIrank ≤−2). For example, a TIA crosslink cluster downstream of exon 23a in NF1 pre-mRNA located to a previously described functional TIA binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Zhu2">[36]</xref>, and it correctly predicted the enhancing effect of the TIA proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, a TIA crosslink cluster downstream of the exon preceding the alternative exon in LRRFIP2 pre-mRNA correctly indicated the TIA-dependent silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess whether TIA proteins bind at additional positions to regulate splicing, we comprehensively analysed the positions of TIA crosslinking in target RNAs with respect to the observed splicing changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Each clustered crosslink site in an individual RNA was considered as one crosslink event. The RNA map showed an increase in the number of crosslink events downstream of the exons, confirming that the predictive code included the primary positions where TIA proteins regulate splicing. There was a decrease in the number of crosslink events downstream of the silenced exons, combined with a significant increase downstream the preceding exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, mutually exclusive exons such as in FYN pre-mRNA displayed TIA crosslinking downstream of the enhanced exon but not in the vicinity of the silenced exon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). Since silenced exons had a reduced proximal TIA binding compared to control exons, TIA binding at the preceding exon was the most likely cause for the silencing effect.</p>

<p>The RNA map demonstrated a significant increase in the number of crosslink events downstream of the enhanced exons. To further validate the function of TIA binding at this position, we constructed a reporter minigene containing the alternative exon 5 and the flanking introns and exons of OGT pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In the iCLIP data, the only TIA crosslink cluster present in this region was located downstream of the 5′ splice site. Overexpression of either TIA1 or TIAL1 in HeLa cells increased exon inclusion, whereas TIA KD HeLa cells decreased exon inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Overexpression of either TIA1 or TIAL1 in the KD cells was able to restore exon inclusion. This confirmed that both TIA1 and TIAL1 could enhance inclusion of the exon.</p>
<p>To directly test whether the RNA sequence underlying the TIA crosslink cluster is necessary for the ability of TIA proteins to enhance exon inclusion, the 40 nt of intronic sequence downstream of the exon were replaced with a sequence from CDC25C pre-mRNA, which did not contain any TIA crosslink sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Splicing of the mutant minigene did not change in response to the increased or decreased TIA protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, the TIA crosslink clusters located downstream of enhanced exons identified the RNA sites necessary to mediate the enhancing effect of TIA proteins.</p>

<title>TIA Proteins Maintain Splicing Fidelity at the 5′ Splice Site</title>
<p>Extensive TIA crosslinking downstream of constitutive exons suggested that in addition to regulating alternative splicing, TIA proteins might also play a role in maintaining splicing fidelity. Microarray analysis detected increased retention of 143 introns and decreased retention of 102 introns in TIA KD cells. We tested 18 of these introns using real-time PCR with a 94% validation rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s007">Figure S7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s014">Table S5</xref>).

The introns that were inefficiently spliced in KD cells had a significantly increased number of crosslink events downstream of the 5′ splice sites compared to control introns, indicating that TIA1 negatively regulates intron retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This is consistent with a past study using the msl-2 reporter minigene, which showed that TIA1 binding to the uridine-rich track prevents intron retention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Forch3">[37]</xref>.

<title>iCLIP Predicts TIA Effects on Usage of Alternative 5′ Splice Sites</title>
<p>In addition to regulating splicing of cassette exons, TIA proteins can also regulate the usage of alternative 5′ splice sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-GalMark1">[38]</xref>. We therefore hypothesised that TIA crosslink clusters could be used to predict regulation of variable-length exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Since the variable regions are often very short, precise identification of binding sites is crucial. To test whether the resolution of iCLIP was sufficient to resolve dual regulation of alternative 5′ splice sites, a regulatory logic was defined where TIA crosslink clusters 10–28 nt downstream of the intron-distal 5′ splice site (position α in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) predicted silenced variable exons (i.e., increased usage of the intron-distal 5′ splice site).

<p>The microarray detected a splicing change in 213 variable-length exons in KD cells (|ΔIrank|≥1), 147 of which were a result of alternative 5′ splice site use. The accuracy of microarray data was assessed by analysis of seven alternative 5′ splice sites with a 100% validation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g005">Figures 5D, 5E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s009">S9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s013">Table S4</xref>). iCLIP predicted approximately 3% of false positives in either direction among the control exons (|ΔIrank|&lt;0.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

Replacing 40 nt of intronic sequence downstream of the intron-proximal 5′ splice site with a sequence from CDC25C pre-mRNA rendered the minigene unresponsive to the changing TIA protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

<title>TIA Proteins Regulate the Usage of Alternative 3′ Splice Sites by Binding at 5′ Splice Sites</title>
<p>The microarray also detected a splicing change in 84 alternative 3′ splice sites, four of which were analysed by RT-PCR with a 75% (3/4) validation rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s009">Figure S9C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s013">Table S4</xref>). The RNA map of TIA binding showed no enrichment of TIA crosslink events at the regulated alternative 3′ splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Instead, there was an increase in TIA crosslink event 10–28 nt downstream of the preceding 5′ splice site if TIA silenced inclusion of the variable portion of the exon, as shown for C3orf23 pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g006">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s008">S8B</xref>). Although the enrichment did not reach the significance level, these observations indicated that TIA proteins might silence the intron-proximal alternative 3′ splice sites by binding at the preceding 5′ splice site.</p>
<p>In order to test this hypothesis, we constructed a reporter minigene containing variable-length exon 4 and the upstream intron and exon from C3orf23 pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The only TIA crosslink cluster present located downstream of the 5′ splice site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000530.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). Since the intron has a size of more than 6 kb, we fused its first and last 600 nt to form the intron in the minigene. Overexpression of TIA1 or TIAL1 protein significantly decreased the inclusion of the variable part of the exon, whereas TIA knockdown significantly increased the inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In order to verify functionality of this binding site, the 83 nt downstream of the 5′ splice site were replaced with the corresponding region from constitutive exon 2 of GAPDH pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). This resulted in a loss of TIA regulation. Surprisingly, the mutation abolished inclusion of the variable portion of the exon, possibly due to the enhanced TIA-independent recognition of the GAPDH 5′ splice site. Taken together, the minigene reporter analysis confirmed that TIA binding downstream of the 5′ splice site can affect the usage of distal alternative 3′ splice sites.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study predicts the positive and negative effects of TIA proteins on splicing of cassette and variable-length exons based on experimental analysis of in vivo TIA-RNA interactions. Consistent with previous observations, we found strong binding of TIA1 and TIAL1 downstream of 5′ splice sites where it exerts local and distal effects on splicing regulation. In addition, binding of both proteins was also enriched in ncRNAs and 3′ UTR of mRNAs. The latter is consistent with their role in translational repression via binding AU-rich element (ARE) and with the role in stress granules, where they promote the assembly of translation pre-initiation complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Piecyk1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Gueydan1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Kedersha3">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Kedersha4">[40]</xref>. Further analyses of iCLIP data could therefore provide novel insights into how TIA binding mediates translational inhibition.</p>
<p>As shown in the example of the 3′ UTR of MYC pre-mRNA, TIA1 and TIAL1 crosslinking is quantitatively reproducible at the level of individual nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). This allowed us to show that TIA1 and TIAL1 have identical RNA binding specificity and that both proteins bind to the same primary RNA sites. This result is interesting from an evolutionary perspective, raising the question of why two proteins with the same specificity have been maintained in the genome. The redundancy between TIA1 and TIAL1 might increase the robustness of gene expression. Moreover, it is likely that the two proteins differ in their interactions with other proteins and in their post-translational modifications, allowing different signalling pathways to regulate activity of the two proteins. Since the relative expression of TIA1 and TIAL1 varies among human tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Izquierdo1">[16]</xref>, this could allow different signalling pathways to modulate expression of TIA-target RNAs in different tissues.</p>

<title>The Positions of TIA-RNA Interactions Predict the Splicing Effects of TIA1 and TIAL1</title>
<p>TIA crosslink clusters were identified downstream of 5% of alternative and constitutive exons, suggesting that TIA proteins play a widespread role in 5′ splice site recognition. However, in spite of this widespread TIA binding, we were able to use consistent rules to predict the effects of TIA binding on splicing of regulated alternative exons. Assessing TIA crosslinking at the 5′ splice sites of both the alternative and the preceding exon enabled us to distinguish between silenced and enhanced exons. Splice-junction microarray analyses and minigene experiments validated the accuracy of these predictions on a genome-wide scale and at the level of individual regulated exons, supporting the finding that the position of TIA binding on pre-mRNA determines its dual splicing effects.</p>
<p>The ability of iCLIP in predicting the dual TIA splicing effects is particularly noteworthy in the case of variable-length exons, since the distance between alternative splice sites is often very short, as shown in the example of CLIP4 pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The ability of iCLIP to directly identify crosslink sites and thereby resolve TIA binding at such proximal sites was crucial for the accuracy in separating silenced from enhanced variable-length exons.</p>

<title>TIA Effects on Variable-Length Exons Allow Evaluation of the Different Models of Splicing Regulation</title>
<p>In the present study, we have evaluated both the local and distal splicing effects of TIA binding at 5′ splice sites. Locally, TIA proteins can regulate alternative 5′ splice sites in a manner consistent with the splice site competition model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Nilsen1">[41]</xref>. TIA proteins enhanced the closest upstream 5′ splice site, leading to a concomitant decrease in usage of the competing 5′ splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Similarly, TIA binding downstream of a cassette exon acts by promoting the usage of its 5′ splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). A past study evaluating splicing intermediates showed that in cases of Nova binding downstream of enhanced exons, the downstream intron is removed prior to the upstream one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule1">[4]</xref>. This result is consistent with a splice site competition model, indicating that Nova and TIA proteins can enhance cassette exons by promoting the splicing pathway that uses the 5′ splice site of the alternative exon, with concomitant decrease in the exon skipping pathway that uses the 5′ splice site of the preceding exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>

<title>An overview of the models of TIA-dependent splicing regulation.</title>
<p>(A) TIA proteins can directly regulate 5′ splice site competition by enhancing either intron-proximal or intron-distal 5′ splice sites. (B) TIA proteins directly regulate alternative cassette exon inclusion by enhancing 5′ splice sites. (C) TIA proteins promote the use of intron-distal alternative 3′ splice sites without directly modulating competition between the alternative 3′ splice sites. By enhancing 5′ splice site recognition, TIA proteins decrease the inclusion of the variable portion of the exon. The splicing kinetics model proposes that the splicing kinetics is affected by 5′ splice site recognition, which then indirectly affects the ability of SR proteins and other factors to define the variable portion of the distal exon. According to this model, the slower splicing kinetics in the absence of TIA increases the time available to these factors to promote inclusion of the variable portion of the exon. (D) Similar to the effect on distal variable exons, a change in splicing kinetics could contribute to the ability of TIA proteins to promote skipping of distal alternative cassette exon by binding at the upstream 5′ splice site.</p>

<p>We also found that TIA binding can lead to distal splicing silencing effects. This supports the hypothesis of indirect silencing action, where an RNA-binding protein could cause a distal negative splicing effect by its local enhancing function, initially proposed to explain the same observation in the Nova RNA map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule2">[25]</xref>. A recent study of PTB-RNA interactions observed an opposite scenario where the local silencing function of PTB causes a distal positive splicing effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Xue1">[23]</xref>. These findings point to the observation that a local splicing function of RNA-binding proteins generally leads to reciprocal distal splicing effects. The study analysing the distal effects of PTB proposed a model where competition between the constitutive and the alternative 5′ splice site was responsible for these distal effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Xue1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>To gain further insights into the distal regulation of alternative splicing, we analysed the effect of TIA binding on distal alternative splice sites. Surprisingly, we found that TIA proteins regulate usage of alternative 3′ splice sites without binding directly at the 3′ splice sites. This distal effect does not involve a competition between the constitutive and the alternative 5′ splice sites. Instead, TIA proteins regulate the distal alternative 3′ splice sites by modulating recognition of the upstream 5′ splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). This result was also supported by the minigene experiment, which showed that a constitutive non-TIA dependent 5′ splice site promotes skipping of the variable portion of the distal exon. This suggests that regulation of a 5′ splice site recognition can affect splicing of downstream alternative 3′ splice sites even if it doesn't compete with another 5′ splice site. This effect could also contribute to the splicing regulation of distal cassette exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>

<title>Mechanistic Insights into the TIA-Dependent Regulation of Alternative Splicing</title>
<p>Unlike Nova, FOX2, and PTB proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ule1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Xue1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Licatalosi1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Yeo1">[42]</xref>, which bind at positions close to either 3′ or 5′ splice sites, TIA RNA maps did not identify significant binding at 3′ splice sites or within the alternative exons. Instead, TIA binding was enriched only downstream of the exons, where TIA proteins were reported to recruit U1 snRNP to the 5′ splice sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Gesnel1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Zhu1">[11]</xref>. It is clear that the uridine-rich motifs downstream of exons are not the only determinant of TIA binding, since these motifs are present also in the polypyrimidine tracts upstream of exons. It is therefore possible that TIA binds to RNA cooperatively in complex with U1 snRNP, which would ensure TIA binding only downstream of exons.</p>
<p>Interestingly, TIA crosslinking was equally common downstream of constitutive and alternative exons. Past studies found that uridine tracts are among the most enriched motifs downstream of constitutive exons, but the function of TIA binding to these motifs was not validated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Aznarez1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Voelker1">[43]</xref>. We found that TIA binding downstream of constitutive exons often promotes efficient splicing of the corresponding intron. Interestingly, this function is shared with the yeast orthologue Nam8p, suggesting that it represents a primary evolutionary function of the TIA proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Gottschalk1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Zhang2">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>We find that TIA proteins can cause a distal splicing effect by regulating recognition of a constitutive 5′ splice site, even if this site does not compete with an alternative 5′ splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Several models of splicing regulation could account for this effect. TIA proteins might change the conformation of the U1 snRNP complex in a way that promotes its pairing with the intron-distal 3′ splice site. Alternatively, binding of TIA proteins could lead to a change in the long-range RNA-RNA interactions, or a change in interactions with other RNA-binding proteins that bind at a distal site. Finally, the result could also be explained in light of the splicing kinetics model. Kinetic parameters of splicing were shown previously to influence the splice site choice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Nilsen1">[41]</xref>. By enhancing U1 snRNP recruitment to the 5′ splice site, TIA proteins might allow the splicing reaction to proceed faster, thereby shortening the time available for definition of the downstream alternative exon. In contrast, the slower splicing kinetics in knockdown cells could allow additional time for trans-acting factors, such as SR proteins, to recognise exonic elements that prevent skipping of the alternative exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g007">Figure 7C, D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Ibrahim1">[47]</xref>. Such effects of splicing kinetics might be related to the transcriptional effects on splicing, which act partly by changing the ability of SR proteins to define the alternative exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000530-Cramer1">[48]</xref>. Taken together, this study of TIA proteins highlights the importance of identifying the positions of protein-RNA interactions with high precision in order to reveal the full complexity of splicing regulation.</p>

For iCLAP, the Strep/His-tagged proteins were affinity purified using Streptavidin and Cobalt beads. RNA was ligated at 3′ ends to an RNA adapter and radioactively labelled on beads. After gel electrophoresis and nitrocellulose membrane transfer, protein-RNA complexes were visualised by autoradiogram. RNA was recovered by proteinase K digestion and reverse transcribed using primers with adapter regions separated by a BamHI restriction site and a barcode region at their 5′ end. cDNA was size-purified, circularised, annealed to an oligonucleotide complementary to the restriction site, and digested with BamHI. Linearised cDNA was then PCR-amplified using primers complementary to the adapter regions and subjected to high-throughput sequencing using Illumina GA2.

Exons were grouped into one single region for randomisation. However, as evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000530-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, the 3′ UTR contains a higher cDNA enrichment than the coding sequence; therefore, we randomised positions in each UTR region separately from the coding sequence.

<p><bold>TIA1 and TIAL1 crosslink to different parts of chromosomes.</bold> (A) Global view of chromosome 6 with TIA1 and TIAL1 iCLIP crosslink sites. The chromosome is shown at the top. The genes are shown below the tracks. The zoom-in view shows the MAPK14 gene. This gene has two mutually exclusive exons, and splicing change was detected by the microarray. The regions with enriched iCLIP cDNAs were zoomed in further down to nucleotide resolution. (B) Global view of the same chromosome. This time, the region with very high numbers of cDNAs was zoomed in. The crosslink sites map to the antisense strand, and three major peaks were further zoomed in. The first one maps to the 3′ UTR of a histone gene (1), whereas the other two map to non-coding tRNAs (2, 3).</p>
