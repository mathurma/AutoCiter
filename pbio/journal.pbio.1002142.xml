<abstract>
<p>The establishment of apical-basolateral polarity is important for both normal development and disease, for example, during tumorigenesis and metastasis. During this process, polarity complexes are targeted to the apical surface by a RAB11A-dependent mechanism. Huntingtin (HTT), the protein that is mutated in Huntington disease, acts as a scaffold for molecular motors and promotes microtubule-based dynamics. Here, we investigated the role of HTT in apical polarity during the morphogenesis of the mouse mammary epithelium. We found that the depletion of HTT from luminal cells in vivo alters mouse ductal morphogenesis and lumen formation. HTT is required for the apical localization of PAR3-aPKC during epithelial morphogenesis in virgin, pregnant, and lactating mice. We show that HTT forms a complex with PAR3, aPKC, and RAB11A and ensures the microtubule-dependent apical vesicular translocation of PAR3-aPKC through RAB11A. We thus propose that HTT regulates polarized vesicular transport, lumen formation and mammary epithelial morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In the adult mammary gland, tissue architecture is maintained through the regulation of the polarity of epithelial cells, which organize around a central cavity called the lumen. The mammary epithelium comprises a basal layer, which contains myoepithelial contractile cells and so-called mammary stem cells, and a luminal layer of cells organized around the lumen. The establishment of apical-basolateral polarity in luminal cells allows the separation of the apical and basolateral membranes and the maturation of cell–cell junctions. The protein complex composed of PAR3, PAR6, and aPKC regulates apical polarity in several tissues, including the mammary epithelium, and it is known that the loss of PAR3 and aPKC interferes with mammary gland development and promotes mammary tumor metastasis. RAB11A, a protein that regulates intracellular trafficking, coordinates apical translocation of PAR3-PAR6-aPKC. Huntingtin (HTT), the protein mutated in Huntington disease, modulates RAB11A activity and also regulates the microtubule-based vesicular trafficking in neurons. Using MCF10A, MDCK 2-D and 3-D cell cultures, and mouse models, we demonstrate here that HTT coordinates the apical vesicular trafficking of PAR3-PAR6-aPKC through RAB11A. We show that loss of HTT in luminal cells alters apical polarity, tissue architecture and the maturation of luminal cells during pregnancy and lactation in the mouse. Together, these findings uncover HTT-mediated vesicular trafficking as a new pathway in the establishment of epithelial apical polarity, with potential implications for health and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epithelial cells in glandular and tubular epithelial systems are organized as one layer surrounding a lumen. The establishment of apical-basolateral polarity in these systems is characterized by the formation of cell–cell adherens and tight junctions and accompanies lumen formation (reviewed in [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). This organization provides a functional barrier that regulates the polarized secretion and intake of molecules. Cell polarity complexes, which were originally identified in model organisms such as yeast, worms, and flies, are highly evolutionarily conserved [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Three major polarity complexes have been identified. The PAR polarity complex, which includes Partitioning Defective 3 and 6 (PAR3 and PAR6), atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and cell division control protein 42 (CDC42) proteins, promotes the establishment of the apical-basal membrane border. The Crumbs (CRB) complex, which is required to establish the apical membrane, is composed of the transmembrane protein CRB and the associated cytoplasmic proteins, PALS1 (also known as MPP5) and PALS1-associated tight junction protein (PATJ; also known as INADL). Finally, the Scribble complex, which is composed of scribble homolog (SCRIB), lethal giant larvae homolog (LGL; also known as LLGL), and disc-large homolog (DLG) proteins, defines the basolateral plasma domain. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these complexes interact and establish the apical and basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells by a system of mutual exclusion [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The PAR complex is a master regulator of polarity and is involved in polarity and spatial organization in almost all metazoan cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mammalian PAR3 is localized to tight junctions at the apical/lateral boundary [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and functions in their assembly [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], whereas PAR6 and aPKC maintain the integrity of the apical domain [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All of these proteins interact directly with each other. PAR6 acts as a targeting subunit for aPKC, and it recruits the CRB complex [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and LGL as substrates [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The binding of PAR3 to PAR6, which forms a complex with aPKC, is required for the delivery of aPKC to the apical surface [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, the interaction of PAR3 with aPKC is essential for the restricted localization of these proteins to the apical region [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the mammary gland, this interaction is essential for the regulation of progenitor differentiation and epithelial morphogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Formation of the apical surface, the first step of lumen morphogenesis, involves the coordination of the trafficking machinery and the polarity complexes. In mammalian cells, vesicles containing apical membrane components are delivered to a region named the apical membrane initiation site (AMIS) where the lumen begins [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This region is delineated by PAR3, aPKC, and the exocyst subunit SEC8. In polarized cells, trafficking from recycling endosomes is regulated by several members of the family of RAB GTPases. In particular, RAB11 controls vesicle trafficking in apical recycling endosomes and is necessary for epithelial morphogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similarly, during lumen formation, the trafficking of vesicles containing apical membrane components depends on RAB11 [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The targeting of apical vesicles containing podocalyxin (PCX) to the AMIS is regulated by RAB11A together with RAB8 and RABIN8, a RAB8-specific GEF that is activated by RAB11A [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The PAR complex targets SEC8-SEC10 to the AMIS, and recruits SEC15A-RAB8A-RAB11A vesicles to generate the pre-apical patch (PAP) [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This mechanism leads to the localization of CDC42 to the apical membrane, where it activates the PAR complex. Although the core complexes involved in these mutually interdependent processes are well characterized, regulatory factors that couple polarity proteins to the membrane transport machinery have not been identified.</p>
<p>Huntingtin (HTT), the protein mutated in Huntington disease, acts as a molecular scaffold and promotes intracellular dynamics. HTT associates with vesicles and microtubules. It is crucial for vesicular trafficking and affects axonal transport and endocytosis. HTT binds dynein and HAP1 directly [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and kinesin [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the dynactin subunit p150<sup><italic>Glued</italic></sup> [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] indirectly. HTT facilitates the transport of several cargoes along microtubules [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. HTT also mediates vesicle recycling during endocytosis by activating RAB11 [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These functions have consequences for a wide variety of cellular events mostly described in the nervous system during both development and the maintenance of homeostasis in adults. For instance, through its function as a regulator of microtubule-based dynamics, HTT influences the division of progenitors at the ventricular zone during cortical development [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the maturation of newly generated neurons during adult hippocampal neurogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and ciliogenesis in ependymal cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, HTT expression is ubiquitous, and this raises questions concerning the functions of HTT in tissues outside the central nervous system. We previously showed that HTT is detectable in healthy mammary tissue and mammary tumors where it regulates tumor progression [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. HTT is required in mammary basal progenitors for appropriate spindle orientation and for the determination of cell fate [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, we focused on the function of HTT in the establishment of apical polarity during the morphogenesis of the mouse mammary epithelium. We propose that HTT regulates apical vesicular transport, which enables the proper targeting of polarity proteins and the correct establishment of subsequent luminogenesis.</p>

<title>The Depletion of Huntingtin from Luminal Cells In Vivo Alters Ductal Morphogenesis and Lumen Formation</title>
<p>We recently showed that depletion of HTT from the basal compartment in the mammary gland results in altered morphological and functional differentiation [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the abundance of HTT is higher in luminal cells (LCs) than in basal cells (BCs) (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We sought to address whether HTT expression specifically in LCs is essential for epithelial morphogenesis; therefore, we deleted HTT from the luminal cell layer of the mammary epithelium by crossing <italic>Htt</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> mice harboring floxed <italic>Htt</italic> alleles [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] with transgenic mice expressing <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. <italic>Cre</italic> expression was mostly confined to the luminal cell population (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The abundance of <italic>Htt</italic> transcripts was 72% lower in LCs from MMTV<italic>Cre</italic>;<italic>Htt</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> (mutant) epithelium than in those from control epithelium, whereas mammary <italic>Htt</italic> transcript levels were similar in control and mutant BCs. Thus, HTT is specifically depleted in luminal cells in MMTV<italic>Cre</italic>;<italic>Htt</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> mice.</p>

<p>We then performed whole mount staining with fourth abdominal mammary glands isolated from mutant and control mice at the age of 5, 6, and 8 wk to measure ductal elongation and bifurcation. The direct visualization of ductal trees showed that ductal elongation and bifurcation were less extensive in mutant mice than in control mice (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). We quantified these effects by measuring the percentage of the fat-pad area covered by the ductal structures and the number of branches; both were significantly lower in mutant mice than in control mice at all stages analyzed (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Interestingly, the number of terminal end buds (TEBs) in 6- and 8-wk-old glands (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>) was significantly higher in mutant mice than in control mice. At 12 wk, which marks the end of puberty in mice, ductal extension and branching were similar between mutant and control mice, and the effect of HTT deletion disappeared (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B</xref> Fig). These findings suggest that loss of HTT delays ductal elongation and bifurcation in the mammary tree during puberty.</p>
<p>We performed hematoxylin and eosin staining on serial sections of mammary glands from 6- and 8-wk-old control and mutant mice (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). Although control TEBs showed a well-defined lumen at 6 wk, the structures from mutant mice were partially filled with cells. At 8 wk, control ducts were completely hollow, whereas mutant ducts displayed an aberrant architecture and contained many intraluminal cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). We hypothesized that these defects were linked to alterations in cell death and proliferation. Thus, we stained sections from control and mutant mammary ducts for cleaved caspase-3 to analyze apoptosis (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). Globally there were a high number of intraluminal cells in mutant TEBs; however, within this population, the proportion of apoptotic cells was lower in mutant TEBs than control TEBs at 6 wk (1.84% ± 0.05% in mutant versus 3.99% ± 0.1% in control mice; Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">1G</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). In contrast with controls, ducts from 8-wk-old mutant mice still displayed apoptotic cells and a high number of intraluminal cells (15.2% ± 1.36% in mutant versus 1.4% ± 0.57% in control mice; Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">1G</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>). Furthermore, KI67 immunostaining showed that the percentage of proliferating cells was higher in ducts from 6-wk-old mutant mice than in those from control mice of the same age (20.4% ± 2% in mutant versus 8.6% ± 0.57% in control mice; Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">1I</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g001" ref-type="fig">1J</xref>). At 8 wk, the percentage of proliferating cells was similar in control and mutant mice (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>These in vivo data suggest that HTT may result in delayed apoptotic-mediated clearing of intraluminal cells. To confirm this hypothesis, we used the human MCF-10A cells, which form acini in 3-D culture by 20 d of morphogenesis by luminal cells clearing through apoptosis-mediated anoikis [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. HTT deletion using specific shRNA blocked apoptosis-mediated luminal clearing, resulting in malformed acini filled with cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2E</xref> Fig). The acini formed when HTT levels were lowered were significantly larger than in control condition (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2F</xref> Fig). Thus, the loss of HTT alters ductal morphogenesis and results in delayed intraluminal cell death and a malformed lumen.</p>
<p>We also investigated how the loss of HTT in luminal cells affected the differentiation of the mammary gland at day 18.5 of pregnancy and day 1 of lactation. Both the number of secretory alveoli and the percentage of epithelial cells were lower in mutant glands than in control glands (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). On day 18.5 of pregnancy and day 1 of lactation, there were fewer well-developed alveoli in mutant glands than in control glands. In controls, the large cytoplasmic lipid droplets in luminal alveolar cells on day 18.5 of pregnancy were replaced with small lipid droplets at the luminal surface on day 1 of lactation (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). In mutant mammary glands, the large cytoplasmic droplets remained in the alveolar cells on day 1 of lactation. We investigated the functional consequences of these epithelial defects by analyzing the subcellular location of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A) on day 1 of lactation (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). The abundance of phosphorylated STAT5A in the nucleus (the active form of STAT5A) was lower in mutant alveolar cells than in control glands. The abundance of transcripts encoding the transcription factor ELF5 (<italic>Elf5</italic>), which is crucial for lobuloalveolar morphogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], was significantly lower in mutant alveoli than in control alveoli (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). Consistent with these observations, immunolabeling showed that the abundance of the milk whey acid protein (WAP) was lower in mutant glands than in control glands, and the RT-PCR revealed that the same was true for RNAs encoding the milk proteins β-casein (<italic>Csn2</italic>) and WAP (<italic>Wap</italic>) (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Ultimately, mutant mice failed to nurse their pups, which displayed severe weight defects (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>).</p>

<title>Huntingtin Is Required for the Apical Localization of PAR3-aPKC during Epithelial Morphogenesis in Virgin, Pregnant, and Lactating Mice</title>
<p>We then analyzed how HTT deficiency in LCs affects epithelial cell polarity. We compared the localization of PAR3 and aPKC in LCs from 12-wk-old virgin mutant and control mice (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). In control glands, PAR3 and aPKC were localized at tight junctions and the apical surface of LCs, whereas in mutant ducts, PAR3 and aPKC labeling was more diffuse, and both proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm. We also examined the localization of E-cadherin, a marker of adherens junctions (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). As expected, E-cadherin was enriched at the lateral compartment in control LCs. By contrast, in mutant LCs, it accumulated abnormally with PAR3-aPKC at the apical surface and was also dispersed in the cytoplasm. This was associated with defects in epithelial architecture and lumen malformation. Apical localization of PAR3-aPKC was also altered when mutant epithelia formed lumens (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>; arrows). We also determined the distribution of PAR3, aPKC, and E-cadherin in LCs of control and mutant epithelia on day 18.5 of gestation and day 1 of lactation (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A</xref>).

<p>We also analyzed the Golgi distribution by immunostaining using an antibody directed against the Golgi matrix protein GM130 (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B</xref>). In control epithelia, the Golgi apparatus localization was polarized in an apical position facing the lumen in most of LCs of control epithelia at all stages analyzed (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C</xref>). In the majority of mutant LCs, however, we found that the Golgi apparatus was dispersed within the soma and did not show a characteristic polarized distribution. We confirmed these observations in 3-D cultures of MCF-10A (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3F</xref> Fig). While the Golgi apparatus was dispersed in the absence of HTT, it still displayed a perinuclear distribution. In agreement, the microtubule network, which maintains the Golgi apparatus in the perinuclear area [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], was comparable in control and shHTT-treated MCF-10A cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, the absence of HTT in luminal cells alters their polarization.</p>
<p>We then asked whether HTT directly regulates the polarity complex. We determined whether HTT colocalizes with PAR3 and aPKC in mammary glands from 12-wk-old control mice (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). HTT colocalized with PAR3 and aPKC at the apical surface of LCs. In particular, HTT was enriched at tight junctions. Furthermore, PAR3 and aPKC coimmunoprecipitated with HTT in extracts of mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Consistent with these data, affinity-purification mass spectrometry previously showed that PAR3 and aPKC form a complex with HTT in cortical neurons [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although PAR6 has not been reported to interact with HTT, it belongs to the PAR polarity complex [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and also coimmunoprecipitated with HTT, PAR3, and aPKC. Thus, HTT is associated with components of the PAR polarity complex and may regulate epithelial polarity through this interaction.</p>

<title>Huntingtin Localizes with PAR3-aPKC at Cytoplasmic Vesicles and Modulates Their Apical Translocation in 3-D Culture</title>
<p>We then investigated the mechanisms by which HTT regulates apical polarity during epithelial morphogenesis. MCF-10A and primary mammary epithelial cells are useful to assess several aspects of mammary epithelial morphogenesis in 3-D culture [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3F</xref> Figs). For instance, the localization of polarity markers such as GM130 can be assessed in MCF-10A cysts with already-formed lumen (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3F</xref> Fig). However, MCF-10A and primary cells form lumen by apoptotic hollowing rather than initially setting up apical polarity; they form non-polarized early cell aggregates after plating, making them unsuitable to study the early steps of polarity establishment during epithelial morphogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We therefore used MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells, which are widely used to model epithelial polarization in several tissues [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In 3-D culture, individual MDCK cells proliferate and assemble into cyst structures, to form a polarized spherical monolayer surrounding a central lumen [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. After 24 h of plating, MDCK cells are an ideal system to directly visualize the process of polarity establishment. At this two-cell stage, cells undergo polarity inversion, which leads to the separation of the apical cortex from the lateral cortex [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Consistent with our in vivo observation (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>), HTT was localized predominantly at the apical cell cortex and tight junctions (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). It was also present in the cytoplasm, where it was enriched in cytoplasmic vesicular-like structures that colocalized with PAR3 and aPKC (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, arrowheads, <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B</xref>, asterisks).</p>

<p>We examined the extent to which HTT influences the apical translocation of PAR3 and aPKC during the first steps of lumen formation. We used lentiviral short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) to stably knock down HTT expression in MDCK cells. HTT expression was efficiently impaired with two lentiviruses (shHTT1 and shHTT2) expressing shRNAs targeting different sequences of canine HTT (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). As expected [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we found that PAR3 and aPKC in control cysts were enriched at the apical surface, whereas the adherens junction marker β-catenin was restricted to the lateral cortex (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). The depletion of HTT impaired the cortical accumulation of PAR3-aPKC, which displayed diffuse cytoplasmic localization (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). This impaired the transition from unpolarized epithelial cell aggregates to the establishment of the luminal PAP, where apical and basolateral plasma membranes are separated. Moreover, HTT-depleted cells displayed aberrant β-catenin localization, indicating altered specification of the basolateral cortex. Next, we introduced a construct encoding a full-length HTT tagged with mCherry (HTTFL; <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The shHTT2 construct was designed to inhibit the expression of endogenous HTT but had no effect on the expression of exogenous HTTFL (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The expression of HTTFL restored the apical translocation of PAR3-aPKC and the lateral localization of β-catenin was similar to that observed in cells expressing endogenous HTT (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Thus, HTT is instrumental for apical localization of PAR3-aPKC during the first step of polarity establishment.</p>
<p>We sought to investigate how HTT-mediated apical localization of PAR3-aPKC affects cystogenesis in MDCK cells. On day 4 of 3-D culture, most control cysts contained well-polarized cells that were organized around a central, single lumen (75% ± 2.74% of cysts; Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4I</xref>). PAR3 and aPKC were localized at the apical cortex and at tight junctions, and E-cadherin was restricted to the lateral compartment (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). Only 31.5% ± 1.3% of cells expressing shHTT1 and 28.12% ± 3.41% of cells expressing shHTT2 formed normal structures, and most cysts contained several lumens and were significantly bigger than control cysts (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). In HTT-depleted cysts, PAR3 and aPKC showed altered apical localization and abnormal colocalization with E-cadherin (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). Remarkably, the ectopic expression of HTT in HTT-depleted cysts restored normal cystogenesis and led to the apical accumulation of PAR3 and aPKC and the lateral localization of E-cadherin (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). By contrast, the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PAR3 in shHTT2-expressing cells was not sufficient to rescue cystogenesis (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">4J</xref>). In this context, both PAR3-GFP and aPKC showed diffuse staining in the cytoplasm (colocalization in white; <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4H</xref>). These observations suggest that HTT may act upstream from PAR3 to ensure the apical accumulation of PAR3-aPKC and proper cystogenesis.</p>

<title>Huntingtin Coordinates Microtubule-Dependent Apical Vesicle Trafficking in 3-D Culture</title>
<p>Apical vesicle trafficking during lumen morphogenesis depends on microtubule transport driven by motor proteins (reviewed in [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]).

Two hours post–dye addition, both the apical membrane and the intracellular endocytic vesicles (which accumulate underneath the apical surface) were labeled (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Movie</xref>; see also magnification in <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). By contrast, in HTT-depleted cysts treated with FM4-64, 2 h post-dye addition, endocytic vesicles failed to reach the apical membrane, accumulated in the cytoplasm, and the apical membrane was not labeled (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Movies). The ectopic expression of HTT in shHTT1/2-expressing cysts restored normal apical vesicular trafficking and cystogenesis (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Movie</xref>).

<p>We then confirmed that cystogenesis was dependent on the integrity of the microtubule network and on molecular motors. We treated cysts with 10 μM of nocodazole for 90 min prior to the analysis of the trafficking of FM4-64-containing apical vesicles. Nocodazole treatment altered apical vesicle dynamics, and the vesicles accumulated in the cytoplasm (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">5C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> Movies). Moreover, treatment with 5 μM nocodazole for 16 h impaired the apical accumulation of PAR3-aPKC and led to defects in cystogenesis (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">5E</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). HTT interacts with the microtubule motor kinesin 1 to promote anterograde vesicular trafficking in neurons [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. HTT also interacts with kinesin 1 to deliver the dynein/dynactin/NUMA/LGN complex along astral microtubules to the cell cortex during mitotic spindle orientation in mammary cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We asked whether HTT and kinesin 1 could act together during apical trafficking. Consistent with this idea, HTT and kinesin 1 colocalized and showed a punctate staining in control 24 h and day 4 3-D cultures (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">5I</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5C</xref>; asterisks). HTT depletion disrupted kinesin 1 localization (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>). Furthermore, kinesin 1 participated in apical trafficking: kinesin 1 depletion impaired the trafficking of FM4-64-containing apical vesicles, which correlated with defective cystogenesis (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">5J</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">5K</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref> Movies). Interestingly, the trafficking defects observed in the presence of nocodazole and in absence of HTT or kinesin 1 were associated to similar aberrant cystogenesis.</p>
<p>Overall, these results show that HTT regulates apical vesicular trafficking (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5L</xref>). Our data also support the hypothesis that this may occur through a microtubule-based, kinesin 1-dependent process.</p>

<p>HTT binds RAB11A and regulates its activity in neurons [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. RAB11 participates in lumen formation in mammalian 3-D cultures [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

RAB11A coimmunoprecipitated with HTT-PAR3-PAR6-aPKC (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>) and HTT localized with RAB11A at the apical membrane of mammary epithelial cells in vivo (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Similarly, in 24 h and 4 d 3-D cultures, HTT localized with RAB11A, showing a punctate staining which was consistent with localization on vesicles and accumulated at the apical membrane (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5D</xref>; asterisks). The apical accumulation of RAB11A was impaired when HTT was depleted in LCs in vivo (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) or in 3-D cultures of MDCK cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>).

<p>We then expressed different variants of GFP-tagged RAB11A in MDCK cells and analyzed the apical targeting of PAR3 and the subsequent effects on cystogenesis. In control cysts at 24 h, wild-type RAB11A (RAB11A<sup>WT</sup>) and the constitutively active RAB11A<sup>Q70L</sup> were localized, along with endogenous PAR3, at the apical surface (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">6E</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). By contrast, the dominant-negative RAB11A<sup>S22N</sup> accumulated in the cytoplasm and impaired the apical accumulation of PAR3. Cystogenesis was altered at day 4 in cysts expressing RAB11A<sup>S22N</sup>, whereas the expression of RAB11A<sup>WT</sup> or RAB11A<sup>Q70L</sup> mostly resulted in cysts with a single lumen (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">6E</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>). We next analyzed whether the expression of the RAB11A variants rescues the defects in the apical targeting of PAR3 and cystogenesis induced by the loss of HTT. Remarkably, in contrast with RAB11A<sup>WT</sup> and RAB11A<sup>S22N</sup>, RAB11A<sup>Q70L</sup> expression in shHTT2-treated cysts was sufficient to rescue the apical translocation of PAR3 and cystogenesis (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">6E</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>). We obtained similar results with aPKC (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). We conclude that HTT regulates RAB11A to coordinate the apical vesicular trafficking of PAR3-aPKC.</p>
<p>We then analyzed apical trafficking by live cell imaging of FM4-64-containing vesicles. The accumulation of FM4-64-containing vesicles at the apical surface was higher in control cysts expressing RAB11A<sup>Q70L</sup> than in those expressing exogenous RAB11A<sup>WT</sup> (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref> Movies). RAB11A<sup>S22N</sup> expression altered apical vesicle trafficking, which correlated with marked defects in cystogenesis (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Movie</xref>). In HTT-depleted cysts, RAB11A<sup>Q70L</sup> was able to recover FM4-64-apical vesicle trafficking and normal cystogenesis, whereas both RAB11A<sup>WT</sup> and RAB11A<sup>S22N</sup> failed to do so (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>; <xref rid="pbio.1002142.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.s023" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16</xref> Movies).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we propose a model in which HTT regulates RAB11A-mediated apical trafficking of the PAR-polarity complex in the mammary epithelium, with consequences for lumen formation and tissue architecture (<xref rid="pbio.1002142.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Interestingly, loss of any of the components of the CDC42-PAR6-PAR3-aPKC complex also causes the formation of multiple lumens and thereby alters epithelial morphogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Disruption of the interaction between PAR3 and aPKC in the mammary gland induces malformations during mammary gland morphogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Remarkably, the epithelial architectural defects induced by the loss of HTT persisted during pregnancy and lactation and affected functional differentiation and milk production. Consistent with these findings, the expression of apical polarity proteins is essential for the differentiation of alveolar cells to milk secreting units [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>

<title>Model for HTT-mediated regulation of apical polarity.</title>
<p>During epithelial morphogenesis, HTT modulates the activation of RAB11A (1). HTT-RAB11A forms a complex with PAR3-aPKC, which may be recruited to HTT-kinesin 1 apical vesicles (2). HTT coordinates apical recycling of PAR3-aPKC vesicles (3). PAR3-aPKC accumulation at the pre-apical patches (PAP) (4) triggers the expansion of the apical membrane, leading to the formation of a central lumen (5).</p>

<p>We recently showed that the depletion of HTT from the basal compartment of the mammary gland alters luminal cell polarity [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the K5<italic>Cre</italic>; <italic>Htt</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> mouse model used in this study, HTT was depleted from basal cells but also partially from LCs. Thus, we were unable to conclude whether the effect of HTT on luminal polarity was direct or indirect. Here, we specifically removed HTT from LCs because HTT is strongly expressed in these cells and LCs are highly polarized. We show that HTT is important for the establishment of apical polarity during mammary morphogenesis. We provide evidence that one of the mechanisms by which HTT mediates its effect is the regulation of the apical trafficking of PAR3-aPKC. However, we cannot exclude that loss of HTT may lead to altered cell organization by another mechanism that would subsequently lead to a polarization defect. In particular, how HTT-dependent vesicular trafficking coordinates the segregation between apical and basolateral compartments remains to be determined. Early work in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> identified a Rab11-dependent trafficking of E-cadherin essential for epithelial junction maturation [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, HTT forms a complex with β-catenin [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is then tempting to speculate that HTT may also regulate basolateral trafficking through RAB11A during polarity establishment.</p>
<p>The orientation of mitosis also regulates lumen formation; therefore, alteration in this process may also contribute to the phenotypes observed. Indeed, HTT regulates spindle orientation in MaSCs and controls the cortical accumulation of the mitotic complex, including LGN, NUMA, dynein, and dynactin [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Interestingly, RAB11A, PAR3, and aPKC are also involved in spindle orientation [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Thus HTT could help localize RAB11A, PAR3, and aPKC during lumen formation and mammary epithelium morphogenesis to ensure the coordination of spindle orientation and apical trafficking.</p>
<p>RAB proteins cycle between GDP bound (inactive) and GTP bound (active) states and these cycles are controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). In their active form, RABs are associated with membranes and carry out their functions though effector partner proteins. RAB11 controls vesicle trafficking in apical recycling endosomes and is necessary for epithelial morphogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our results suggest that HTT acts upstream from PAR3 by regulating RAB11 activity. These results are consistent with a previous study showing that HTT binds RAB11A and regulates its activity in neurons [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The authors of this study showed that the inhibition of HTT expression affects the attachment of RAB11 to membranes and the guanine nucleotide exchange activity on RAB11. They also showed that HTT binds RAB11-GDP preferentially, suggesting that HTT either acts as a GEF for RAB11 or activates GEF activity on RAB11. Nonetheless, other mechanisms besides the microtubule-based apical delivery of polarity proteins may be affected by the HTT-mediated regulation of RAB11 activity. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that RAB11 localizes recycling endosomes to mitotic spindle poles by dynein-mediated transport [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Similarly, during mitosis, the interaction of HTT with dynein is required for the localization of spindle pole proteins [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The actin and the microtubule cytoskeletons and their associated motor proteins are critical for apical vesicle trafficking during lumen morphogenesis (reviewed in [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Interestingly, previous studies suggest that HTT is a crucial link between the microtubule and the actin cytoskeletons. HTT forms a complex with dynein, dynactin, and kinesin 1 (KIF5) in neurons to promote retrograde and anterograde microtubule-based axonal transport of several cargoes [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. RAB11-containing vesicles are bidirectionally transported by HTT in vivo in whole-mount <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval axons [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. During mitosis, HTT mediates the cortical localization of dynein, dynactin, LGN, and NUMA through kinesin 1-dependent transport along astral microtubules [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, we suggest that HTT acts with kinesin 1 to coordinate microtubule-based apical trafficking in a RAB11A-dependent pathway. The early endosomal trafficking effector, RAB5, binds HTT through HAP40, and RAB8, which associates with the Golgi membrane, can also form a complex with HTT through the myosin VI linker, optineurin [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The HAP40-HTT complex also interacts with optineurin [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, HTT may regulate actin-dependent dynamics when in complex with HAP40-Optineurin-MyosinVI, and it may regulate microtubule-dependent transport when in complex with dynein-dynactin-kinesin.</p>
<p>Finally, the cell polarity machinery is perturbed during tumorigenesis with consequences for metastasis. For instance, PAR3 levels are significantly lower in human breast cancers than in non-malignant tissue, and this down-regulation correlates with the overactivation and mislocalization of aPKC [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In murine models of breast cancer, loss of PAR3 promotes breast tumorigenesis and metastasis [<xref rid="pbio.1002142.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, the identification of new regulators of the apical vesicle trafficking machinery is critical for our understanding of both normal development of the epithelium and pathogenic pathways leading to metastasis.</p>

Cells were washed three times in PBS:glycine (130 mM NaCl, 7 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 3.5 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 100 mM glycine; 15 min each), blocked first in IF buffer (130mM NaCl, 7mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 3.5mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 7.7 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>, 0.1% BSA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% goat serum (1–2 h) and then with a second blocking buffer (IF buffer containing 10% goat serum and 20 μg/ml goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2; Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30–45 min. Anti-cleaved caspase 3, anti-β-catenin or anti-GM130 were diluted in the second blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. Acini were stained with anti-rabbit AlexaFluor-555.</p>
<p>MDCK cells grown on chamber slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Fixed cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum/1%BSA in PBS for 2 h, and then incubated with anti-ß-catenin and anti-PAR3 or anti-aPKC overnight at 4°C. Alternatively cells were incubated with anti-HTT 4C8 and anti-PAR3, anti-aPKC or anti-RAB11A 3 h at RT. Cells were stained with anti-mouse and anti-rabbit AlexaFluor-488 or AlexaFluor-555. Cysts with actin staining at the apical surface of cells surrounding a single lumen were identified as cysts with normal lumens.</p>
<p>For all immunostainings, the slides were counterstained with DAPI (Roche) and mounted in Mowiol.

<title>Quantification and Image Analyses</title>
<p>To measure the relative fluorescence intensity at the apical surface, a 30-pixel line was drawn across the apical surface and the cytoplasm using ImageJ software. The Line Scan function of ImageJ was used to reveal the relative fluorescence intensity across the line. The quantification of the polarization of the Golgi in MCF-10A 3-D acini was done using a home-built macro (ImageJ software, see below for details).</p>
