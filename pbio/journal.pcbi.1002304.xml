        <p>Transcription factors are proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to cis-regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, binding of the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG is essential to maintain the capacity of the cells to differentiate into any cell type of the developing embryo. It is known that transcription factors interact to regulate gene expression. In this study we show that combinatorial binding is strongly associated with co-localization of the transcriptional co-activator Mediator, H3K27ac and increased expression of nearby genes in embryonic stem cells. We observe that the same loci bound by Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 in ES cells frequently drive expression in early embryonic development. Comparison of mouse and human ES cells shows that less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG are shared between species. In contrast, about 15% of combinatorial binding events and even between 53% and 63% of combinatorial binding events at enhancers active in early development are conserved. Our analysis suggests that the combination of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG binding is critical for transcription in ES cells and likely plays an important role for embryogenesis by binding at conserved early developmental enhancers. Our data suggests that the fast evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding events, whereas “gene regulatory hotspots” which are bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues throughout early development are under stronger evolutionary constraints.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The mammalian body is composed of hundreds of distinct cell types. During embryogenesis, this diversity is created by multiple cell fate decisions and differentiation events. Embryonic stem (ES) cells provide the <italic>in vitro</italic> model to study differentiation and early development. Their pluripotent state is maintained by transcription factors such as OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG which bind to regulatory elements within the genome. Understanding the interplay between transcription factor binding, gene expression and cellular differentiation is key to understanding the development of the mammalian embryo. In this study we find that combinatorial binding of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG in ES cells identifies enhancers which are associated with active transcription. We observe that these enhancers also frequently show activity at later developmental stages. Using data from mouse and human ES cells we find that these combinatorially bound enhancers which are active in pluripotent cells and development show extraordinarily high levels of binding conservation (&gt;50%). Our analysis suggests that these conserved “gene regulatory hotspots” integrate the transcriptional network that promotes pluripotency into the gene regulatory networks that promote cell fate decisions and differentiation during early embryonic development.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Thomson1">[1]</xref>. During the course of normal development, implantation of the blastocyst results in further differentiation into distinct cell types of the three primary germ layers that will later form the tissues and organs of the developing embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Beddington1">[2]</xref>. This pluripotent state makes ES cells a unique <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular model system to study early embryogenesis. At the core of the regulatory network that maintains this state is a set of transcription factors amongst which OCT4 seems to play a key role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Boyer1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Babaie1">[4]</xref>. OCT4 has been shown to co-occupy many regulatory sites together with SOX2, NANOG and the co-activator p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Chen1">[5]</xref>. The potency of these transcription factors is demonstrated by their ability to induce pluripotency in mouse and human somatic cells. This was achieved by the ectopic expression of OCT4 and SOX2 together with either KLF4 and c-MYC, or NANOG and LIN28 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Nakagawa1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Yu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Takahashi1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The pivotal step in inducing and maintaining the pluripotent state occurs at the level of genomic DNA by the binding of transcription factors and co-factors that activate and repress gene expression. The largest fraction of the genome is non-coding with many non-coding elements being highly conserved. Even though it is expected that many of these elements harbor transcription factor binding sites and may act as enhancers, current understanding of the interplay between transcription factors and regulatory elements within the genome is limited. ChIP-Seq data pinpoints transcription factor binding sites not only in predefined regions such as promoters but in an unbiased way genome-wide. However, the high sensitivity comes along with a low specificity that makes identification of functional sites challenging. Nevertheless, in order to understand self renewal and pluripotency at the level of transcriptional regulation, it is crucial to identify a reliable set of regulatory elements that actively contribute to the regulation of gene expression in pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells.</p>
      <p>ES cells reflect a very early time point of development. Many genes which are important for early embryogenesis have a conserved function in mouse and human. OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG for example are essential for maintaining the pluripotent state both in mouse and human ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Boyer1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Loh1">[9]</xref>. However, despite their conserved function, where these transcription factors bind seems to be highly species-specific: A comparison of mouse and human ES cells revealed that only about 5% of binding events of the key pluripotency factors OCT4 and NANOG are conserved at orthologous genomic locations in both species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Kunarso1">[10]</xref>. A study of genome-wide binding in liver tissue reported the same with only about 7% conserved binding events for the liver transcription factors CEBP and HNF4 between mouse and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Schmidt1">[11]</xref>. These data show how fast cis-regulatory elements can evolve compared to coding sequence, yet we do not know what discriminates conserved from non-conserved binding events. Genome-wide comparisons give average values over all observed binding events. These numbers are influenced by many factors such as the choice of control, processing of the data, and p-value and false discovery rate cutoffs. The biological impact of individual binding events may therefore be very different, ranging from non-functional binding to binding events which are essential for the regulation of associated genes and the survival of the individual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Park1">[12]</xref>. For that reason, the fraction of conserved binding events is currently unknown for a highly confident set of enhancers.</p>
      <p>It is well known that transcription factors interact to regulate gene expression. It has been shown in mouse ES (mES) cells that combinatorial binding of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog is associated with increased expression of nearby genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Chen1">[5]</xref>. Here, we use combinatorial binding to increase the specificity of the ChIP-Seq technology in order to identify a highly confident set of regulatory elements. We investigate the association of these elements with the transcriptional co-activator Mediator, histone modifications and gene expression, to test whether the interactions of transcription factors provide a link between binding and activation of their target genes.</p>
      <p>Studies in Drosophila suggest that the combination of binding sites plays an important role during the evolution of gene regulatory elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-He1">[13]</xref>, however the effect of combinatorial binding on evolution in mammals is currently unknown. Analysis of mammalian genome sequences suggested that developmentally active enhancers are highly conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Visel1">[14]</xref>. Integration of genome-wide binding data from mouse and human ES and embryonal carcinoma (EC/NCCIT) cells and mouse developmental tissues allows us for the first time to study the evolution of gene regulation in the light of combinatorial binding and developmental activity in mammalian cells using an <italic>in vitro</italic> system. Our analysis indicates that both characteristics contribute to the evolutionary constraint on regulatory elements and suggests that the integrated data represents an essential set of conserved enhancers that links pluripotency with early embryonal development.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We mapped genome-wide binding data of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in mES cells to study the effect of combinatorial binding. We further mapped binding data from the transcriptional co-activators p300 and Mediator subunits Med1 and Med12 which are important to activate gene expression by linking regulatory elements with the basal transcriptional machinery. We additionally mapped binding data from Cohesin (subunits Smc1 and Smc3) and CTCF which are involved in gene regulation through DNA loop formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Kagey1">[15]</xref>. Using MACS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Zhang1">[16]</xref> we identified sets of potential binding events (ChIP-Seq “peaks”) for every factor. We discarded all peaks with a p-value&gt;1e-05 and peaks that were detected in the control data (“full data set”). As a control for the influence of the p-value cutoff, we additionally analyzed the data using only the top 10% of peaks (sorted by p-value) from every experiment (“stringent data set”). We intentionally did not choose a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff, since the FDR (as estimated by MACS) is heavily dependent on the control data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Zhang1">[16]</xref> which is lacking for some experiments (see supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s001">Figures S1</xref>). To compare genome-wide binding in mouse and human ES cells we processed data from human cells in the same way (see supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s013">Table S1</xref> for a complete listing of accession numbers, mapped reads and number of peaks). Important insights have been obtained from studies using ChIP-on-chip data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Boyer1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Kim1">[17]</xref>, however due to its limitation to promoter regions we did not integrate this data into our analysis. The complete data used in this study is available at the European Nucleotide Archive (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s013">Table S1</xref>) and can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://enhancer.molgen.mpg.de" xlink:type="simple">http://enhancer.molgen.mpg.de</ext-link>, where we provide a human and mouse genome browser displaying genome-wide binding profiles, major histone modifications and RNA-seq data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Lister1">[18]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the aligned <italic>SOX2</italic> locus in the mouse and human genomes along with the data used in this study.</p>

        <title>Combinatorial binding detects functional interactions</title>
        <p>As a first step toward analyzing combinatorial binding we calculated the similarity of the genome-wide binding profiles for all factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g002">Figure 2A–B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). These similarities identify three distinct clusters: Enhancer binding (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2), Insulator binding (CTCF, Cohesin subunits Smc1 and Smc3a) and transcriptional co-activation (Mediator subunits Med1 and Med12). Interestingly, pairwise distances from genome-wide data on DNA-protein interactions reproduce known protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Manke1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g002">Figure 2B</xref>): CTCF interacts with Cohesin at insulator elements, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog interact at enhancers, and Mediator plays a central role by integrating signals from distant regulatory elements and Cohesin. To test whether the amount of overlap of transcription factor binding that we observed can be expected by chance, we calculated the overlap of position-randomized binding events. Overall, the overlap observed in the data is much higher than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>).

For all possible combinations we calculated the fraction of loci where Med1 or Med12 co-localizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Since these loci vary by number and size, we calculated the expected overlap from randomized data sets (Hyper geometric test, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Between 5% and 30% of loci bound by Oct4, Nanog or Sox2 individually co-localize with Med1 or Med12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, loci bound by Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 simultaneously (further referred to as combinatorially bound loci) co-localize much more frequently with Med1 (44%, z-score 155.9) and Med12 (59%, z-score 215.5).</p>

(<bold>B</bold>) The majority of loci bound by Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog are more than 1000 bp away from the nearest transcription start sites for all possible combinations (indicated by boxes above).

        <p>Co-localization of DNA binding proteins could be unspecific, for example due to binding at open chromatin regions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Park1">[12]</xref> for a review). Unspecific co-localization is not accounted for with the theoretical expected overlap. To control for this effect we need to calculate co-localization of factors which we know are unrelated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows that CTCF largely binds to different regions than the enhancer binding proteins Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Handoko1">[22]</xref>, therefore CTCF co-localization should be depleted at combinatorially bound loci. We observe that CTCF overlaps with individual binding events of Sox2 and Oct4. In contrast, CTCF co-localization is significantly depleted at loci bound by Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog simultaneously (z = −10.5). This suggests that combinatorial binding reduces unspecific co-localization and confirms the association of the Mediator complex with combinatorial bound loci.</p>
        <p>The strength of the ChIP-Seq signal (“binding intensity”) is likely to hint at important binding sites. We calculated the association of Mediator with Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog independent of their combination for a data set that only includes the top 10% peaks (sorted by p-value) for every experiment. In this set, CTCF co-localization is depleted showing that a stringent p-value cutoff efficiently reduces unspecific overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, combinatorial binding is a much more sensitive indicator for Mediator co-localization, as only 16% of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog loci show Med1 co-localization when we look into high intensity peaks (25% with Med12), compared to 44% for the combinatorially bound loci in the full data set (59% for Med12). The binding combination has a similar influence in both the stringent and the full data set (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s002">Figure S2</xref>), re-assuring us that the particular choice of p-value cutoff is of little importance in this analysis.</p>
        <p>Since Mediator occupies many promoters in the genome, transcription factors that bind preferentially to promoter regions would be expected to show co-localization with Med1 or Med12. To test whether the interaction between Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog occurs mainly at the promoter thereby causing the observed Mediator co-localization, we calculated the fraction of promoter and enhancer bound loci for all binding combinations. The majority of loci bound by Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog are at distant regulatory elements (61%–97%), even when Mediator co-localization can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This shows that the increased overlap at combinatorially bound loci reflects specific binding at distant regulatory elements and is not caused by simultaneous occupation of the proximal promoter of actively transcribed genes.</p>
        <p>The strong association of combinatorial binding with Mediator suggests that Mediator bound loci are functionally different from loci without Mediator binding. We used histone modification profiles and gene expression of nearby genes to test for functional differences. Combinatorially bound loci occupied by Mediator are strongly enriched in H3K27ac, a mark for active enhancers, compared to loci without Mediator co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-RadaIglesias1">[23]</xref>. To test the effect of Mediator binding on gene expression, we performed a gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Subramanian1">[24]</xref> using expression data from mES cells compared to differentiated cells after 14 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-HailesellasseSene1">[25]</xref>. We sorted all genes according to their difference between ES cells and differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and then calculated the enrichment score for genes near loci bound by Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog with Med1/Med12 (group 1) and without Med1/Med12 (group 2). Group 1 shows a significant enrichment in genes expressed in stem cells (Enrichment scores 0.43, p-value 0.0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, group 2 shows a stronger enrichment in genes which are expressed in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, enrichment score −0.3, p = 0.05), suggesting that Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 might co-occupy poised enhancers. Both histone profiles and gene expression data support the notion that combinatorial binding identifies enhancers in embryonic stem cells while Mediator co-localization determines their activity.</p>

        <title>Combinatorial binding identifies developmental enhancers in embryonic stem cells</title>
        <p>Binding of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog frequently occurs near developmental genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Boyer1">[3]</xref> and gene expression data suggests that genes near combinatorial binding events are indeed up-regulated after differentiation. The majority of loci bound by Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog together with Med1 or Med12 are likely to act as enhancers in embryonic stem cells. However, the function of loci near inactive genes is unclear. Since many of these genes are active during development, we tested whether Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog co-occupied loci act as early developmental enhancers. We used a set of tissue-specific enhancers obtained from mouse embryos at day e11.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Visel1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Blow1">[26]</xref>, a stage where neither Oct4 nor Nanog is expressed. Nevertheless, 9% (z = 27.5) of combinatorially bound loci in ES cells overlap with developmental enhancers. Enhancers that are active in development show an enrichment of H3K27ac in neuronal progenitor cells (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s003">Figure S3</xref>), supporting that these indeed become active after differentiation. It is likely that some of these regulatory elements are in a poised state. Poised enhancers have been identified in embryonic stem cells by unique chromatin modification signatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-RadaIglesias1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Creyghton1">[27]</xref>, however, this is the first evidence for active participation of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in this poised state. Our analysis suggests that binding of pluripotency-associated transcription factors at developmental enhancers might be a key feature of the ability of pluripotent stem cells to differentiate into distinct cell types. Usage of such “shared enhancers”, which are active in multiple stages during differentiation, links the gene regulatory networks of embryonic stem cells with the networks for early development at the level of transcriptional regulation.</p>

        <title>Combinatorial binding events are conserved in evolution</title>
        <p>Using data from human ES cells, we investigated whether combinatorial binding can further help in discriminating conserved and non-conserved binding events. To test this, we first mapped genome-wide binding data for OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG from human ES cells and OCT4 from human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells using the same procedure as described above (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s013">Table S1</xref> for Accession numbers, mapped reads and number of peaks). EC cells are the malignant counterpart of ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Przyborski1">[28]</xref>, however they possess a distinct set of binding sites, extending the repertoire of potential OCT4 bound loci. We used whole-genome alignments to assign binding events in mES cells to their orthologous loci in the human genome, retaining only those that could be aligned uniquely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Fujita1">[29]</xref>. We call a binding event “conserved” if binding of the same factor can be observed at the aligned loci in the human and mouse genome.</p>
        <p>For every combination of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG binding we calculated the fraction of conserved binding events for every factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Indeed, combinatorial binding is a good predictor for conservation: Less than 5% of individual binding events are conserved, which is less than expected. In contrast, about 15% of binding events at loci which are simultaneously co-occupied by OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG in hES cells show conserved binding of the respective transcription factor in mES cells (z-scores = 33.6, 41.3, 31.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We additionally calculated the number of transcription factors that bind at conserved loci in mouse for all combinations of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). 53% of combinatorial binding events in human are simultaneously occupied by Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in mouse, showing that combinatorial binding is likely to be a conserved property of regulatory elements in ES cells.</p>

        <p>Since CTCF does not show significant association with combinatorially bound loci in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g003">3</xref>), we use CTCF binding in mES cells to estimate unspecific conservation. CTCF binding is significantly depleted at combinatorially bound loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, z-score = −6.8), showing that the increased conservation is specific to the combination of transcription factors. In contrast, CTCF binding can be observed at higher levels for all other binding combinations, most prominently OCT4 with SOX2. The combination of OCT4 and SOX2 without NANOG scarcely occurs genome-wide (159). In contrast, the combination OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG occurs 6698 times. The high levels of CTCF at OCT4/SOX2 loci is therefore likely to be unspecific and of low relevance. We further tested the enrichment of CTCF using the stringent data set that only contains the 10% most significant peaks (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In this stringent data set, CTCF levels drop below 5% for all combinations. This suggests that CTCF enrichment is an artifact of the large data set (false positive binding events). To see if a stringent p-value can be used to obtain similar estimates, we calculated the conservation independently of the binding combinations for the full and stringent data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Less than 5% of binding events are conserved between mouse and human in the stringent data set. This is higher than expected. However, combinatorial binding is a more sensitive indicator for conservation (3–5% conserved events for p-value cutoff vs. 14–17% for combinatorial binding), probably because many true binding sites will be lost in the stringent data set.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the fraction of loci within the proximal promoter (+−1000 bp) is higher for conserved binding events compared to non-conserved binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), thus suggesting that the promoter is under stronger evolutionary constraint. However, the majority of binding events are distant from the predicted transcription start sites. The increased level of conservation at combinatorially bound loci is therefore not caused by a bias towards promoter binding.</p>

SOX21 plays a pivotal role during brain development by promoting neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Sandberg1">[31]</xref>.

        <title>Conserved binding events are associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation and early development</title>
        <p>The outcome of transcription factor binding events is ultimately determined by the function of the genes that they regulate. We found 720 conserved loci bound by OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG in human and mouse ES cells, associated with 608 genes nearby. Amongst these putative target genes are <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>LEFTY1</italic>, <italic>JARID2</italic> and many other well known factors associated with pluripotency. A number of genes also show strong species-specific binding patterns, most prominently <italic>Esrrb</italic>, an interaction partner of Oct4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-vandenBerg1">[35]</xref> which is almost exclusively bound in mouse ES cells (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
        <p>To obtain a more general picture of the downstream target genes of conserved combinatorial binding events we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-McLean1">[36]</xref>. We selected all combinatorially bound regions as background. The subset of conserved combinatorially bound loci is significantly enriched in the terms pattern specification process (p = 4.7e-13), regionalization (2.5e-12) and developmental induction (8.4e-8). Even though the background set is already enriched in developmental GO terms (amongst others developmental induction, p-value 2e-8), the association of conserved combinatorial binding events with developmental processes is even stronger. In support of this, genes such as SOX21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Mallanna1">[37]</xref>, FGF4, NEUROG3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Spence1">[38]</xref> and CDX2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Chawengsaksophak1">[39]</xref> which are located near conserved combinatorial binding events have been shown to be important for directing differentiation of ES cells. This implies that conserved combinatorial binding events in ES cells have extensive downstream impact by controlling key regulatory genes involved in differentiation and provides further evidence for the tight connection between pluripotency and early development mediated by OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG through binding at developmental enhancers.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The enormous amount of genome-wide binding data produced in recent years has improved our understanding of the self-renewing and pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Boyer1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Chen1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Creyghton1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Lee1">[40]</xref>. By integrating data from ES cells with developmental enhancers we discovered that the very same regulatory elements bound by key pluripotency factors in ES cells frequently act as enhancers during early development. This finding provides an unknown link between the gene regulatory networks of ES cells and early development at the level of transcriptional regulation.</p>
      <p>The finding that binding at these developmental enhancers is highly conserved in mouse and human ES cells suggests that these elements are crucial for the maintenance of the pluripotent state. Nevertheless, some questions remain. Based on our data we cannot explain why in pluripotent cells OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG bind to enhancers which are also active at developmental stages when neither NANOG nor OCT4 are expressed. It is likely that these elements are poised for activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-RadaIglesias1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Creyghton1">[27]</xref>, and an open chromatin state might be maintained throughout development to enable recruitment of transcription factors, co-activators, or histone modification proteins throughout cellular specification. These enhancers bound in multiple developmental stages by multiple factors show properties of gene regulatory hotspots, elements that influence gene expression in numerous cell types from pluripotent cells to at least cells of the mouse embryo at day 11.5. The existence of such gene regulatory hotspots could explain the extraordinarily high level of binding conservation observed in ES cells, since mutations of these elements would influence a major part of early embryogenesis. In contrast to these hotspots, loss of individual binding events can more easily be substituted by nearby binding events, and is likely to influence only a limited number of cell types. Our analysis suggests that the fast evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks indeed mainly affects individual binding events, while combinatorial binding at these regulatory hotspots is under stronger evolutionary constraint.</p>
      <p>The definition of combinatorial binding in this study relies on ChIP-Seq technology. We define combinatorial bound loci as genomic regions were we observe binding of different transcription factors in similar cell types. These experiments are independent of each other and reflect measures from a mixed population of cells. Co-localization could therefore be observed without direct physical interactions (for example through indirect interaction or competitive binding). However, based on the results of this and other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-vandenBerg1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Lemischka1">[41]</xref> we believe that co-localization as observed by the ChIP-Seq technology indeed reflects combinatorial binding.</p>
      <p>One of the difficulties in analyzing genome-wide datasets is how to discriminate true binding sites from false positive binding sites. It is impossible to identify a set of exclusively true binding sites, due to technical limitations, but also due to biological variation since many binding events will only be important under specified developmental cues. A more stringent p-value cutoff decreases the fraction of false binding sites in the data while at the same time true positive binding events will be lost. Combinatorial binding is likely to select for true binding sites as well, since non-functional binding events are unlikely to be detected in multiple experiments (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s010">Figure S10</xref>). However, combinatorial binding is different from a stringent control of false positives as can be seen by Mediator co-localization and binding conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g006">6</xref>). It has been shown that groups of transcription factor binding sites are more likely to be conserved than isolated sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002304-Hemberg1">[42]</xref> which supports the value of combinatorial binding for transcriptional regulation. This is an important insight for future studies, which should consider the combination of transcription factors for defining regulatory networks.</p>
      <p>One limitation of the ChIP-Seq technology is that we cannot exclude combinatorial binding at isolated binding events. Weak or sporadic combinatorial binding events might be missed and therefore wrongly assigned as individual binding events (false negatives). We compared the results using two different cutoffs, a loose cutoff (full data set) with few false negatives and a very stringent cutoff (stringent data set) with many false negatives. The results largely agree: Combinatorial binding events (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG) consistently show the strongest association with Mediator (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and highest levels of binding conservation (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s004">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s009">S9</xref>). This suggests that the influence of the p-value cutoff and false negative binding events is limited on this analysis.</p>
      <p>Most of the binding data in this study is obtained from embryonic stem cells. We integrated data sets from two mouse cell lines (V6.5 and E14). Interestingly, loci bound in both cell lines are much more likely to show co-localization with Mediator (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). In human, we extended the available data by OCT4 ChIP-Seq from embryonal carcinoma cells to obtain data from different cell lines. We observe that, loci bound in EC and ES cells are much more likely to show combinatorial binding (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). Therefore employing closely related cell lines is a biologically relevant approach for identifying important binding sites when data on combinatorial binding is not available.</p>
      <p>Developmental cues that lead to differentiation of cells during early embryogenesis involves binding of transcription factors at regulatory sequences in the genome. We have demonstrated that in ES cells, the combination of transcription factors that bind to regulatory elements is important for transcriptional activation. Combinatorial binding of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG identifies enhancers characterized by H3K27ac and Mediator co-localization. Many of these combinatorially bound enhancers are active during early development. The comparison of mouse and human ES cells shows that both combinatorial binding and multiple activity of enhancers in ES cells and development increase the evolutionary constraint. The set of conserved combinatorially bound embryonic stem cell enhancers is available (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002304.s014">Table S2</xref>) and might be helpful as a set of putative human developmental enhancers. Our analysis suggests that the fast evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding events. In contrast to these events, there is a group of conserved enhancers in the genome which recruit multiple interacting factors and are active in multiple tissues of the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002304-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Many of these “gene regulatory hotspots” are under strong evolutionary constraints and seem to play a major role by linking the regulatory networks of cellular differentiation during early mammalian development.</p>

          <p>Binding conservation in embryonic stem cells is increased at developmental enhancers. For every data set, only the 10% most significant peaks of all peaks with p&lt;e-05 are considered. (<bold>A</bold>) Bars indicate the fraction of loci where binding of Nanog, Sox2, Oct4 and CTCF can be observed at the orthologous locus in mouse ES cells for all combinations of OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG in human ES cells discriminated by developmental activity as indicated by the boxes below. Dark boxes indicate “AND” relation, light grey boxes with “v” indicate “OR” relation, “?” indicates no restriction. Combinatorial binding events at developmentally active enhancers show the highest levels of binding conservation between mouse and human ES cells (&gt;40%). (<bold>B</bold>) The fractions of binding combinations in mES cells at conserved loci (for all combinations indicated by the boxes above). The majority of conserved binding events at developmentally active enhancers where OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG bind simultaneously show combinatorial binding of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in mouse ES cells. (<bold>C</bold>) The fraction of proximal and distant binding sites for conserved and non-conserved binding events (split up according to the combinations of binding as indicated by the boxes above).
