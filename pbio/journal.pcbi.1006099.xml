<abstract>
<p>Viruses and bacteria are critical components of the human microbiome and play important roles in health and disease. Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The human microbiome, the collection of microbial communities that colonize the human body, is a crucial component to health and disease. Two major components of the human microbiome are the bacterial and viral communities. These communities have primarily been studied separately using metrics of community composition and diversity. These approaches have failed to capture the complex dynamics of interacting bacteria and phage communities, which frequently share genetic information and work together to maintain ecosystem homestatsis (e.g. kill-the-winner dynamics). Removal of bacteria or phage can disrupt or even collapse those ecosystems. Relationship-based network approaches allow us to capture this interaction information. Using this network-based approach with three independent human cohorts, we were able to present an initial understanding of how phage-bacteria networks differ throughout the human body, so as to provide a baseline for future studies of how and why microbiome networks differ in disease states.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Viruses and bacteria are critical components of the human microbiome and play important roles in health and disease. Bacterial communities have been associated with disease states, including a range of skin conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref001">1</xref>], acute and chronic wound healing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref003">3</xref>], and gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref005">5</xref>], <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref006">6</xref>] and colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref008">8</xref>]. Altered human viromes (virus communities consisting primarily of bacteriophages) also have been associated with diseases and perturbations, including inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref009">9</xref>], periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref010">10</xref>], spread of antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref011">11</xref>], and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref017">17</xref>]. Viruses act in concert with their microbial hosts as a single ecological community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref018">18</xref>]. Viruses influence their living microbial host communities through processes including lysis, host gene expression modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref019">19</xref>], influence on evolutionary processes such as horizontal gene transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref020">20</xref>] or antagonistic co-evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref021">21</xref>], and alteration of ecosystem processes and elemental stoichiometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous human microbiome work has focused on bacterial and viral communities, but have reduced them to two separate communities by studying them independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref017">17</xref>]. This approach fails to capture the complex dynamics of interacting bacteria and phage communities, which frequently share genetic information and work together to maintain ecosystem structure (e.g. kill-the-winner dynamics that prevent domination by a single bacterium). Removal of bacteria or phages can disrupt or even collapse those ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref032">32</xref>]. Integrating these datasets as relationship-based networks allow us to capture this complex interaction information. Studying such bacteria-phage interactions through community-wide networks built from inferred relationships begins to provide us with insights into the drivers of human microbiome diversity across body sites and enable the study of human microbiome network dynamics overall.</p>
<p>In this study, we characterized human-associated bacterial and phage communities by their inferred relationships using three published paired virus and bacteria-dominated whole community metagenomic datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref034">34</xref>]. We leveraged machine learning and graph theory techniques to establish and explore the human bacteria-phage network diversity therein. This approach built upon previous large-scale phage-bacteria network analyses by inferring interactions from metagenomic datasets, rather than culture-dependent data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref028">28</xref>], which is limited in the scale of possible experiments and analyses. We implemented an adapted metagenomic interaction inference model that made some improvements upon previous phage-host interaction prediction models. Previous approaches have utilized a variety of techniques, such as linear models that were used to predict bacteria-phage co-occurrence using taxonomic assignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref035">35</xref>], and nucleotide similarity models that were applied to both whole virus genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref036">36</xref>] and clusters of whole and partial virus genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref037">37</xref>]. Our approach uniquely included protein interaction data and was validated based on experimentally determined positive and negative interactions (i.e. who does and does not infect whom). We built on previous modeling work as a means to our ends, and focused on the biological insights we could gain instead of building a superior model and presenting our work as a toolkit. We therefore did not focus on extensive benchmarking against other existing models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref040">40</xref>]. Through this approach we were able to provide an initial basic understanding of the network dynamics associated with phage and bacterial communities on and in the human body. By building and utilizing a microbiome network, we found that different people, body sites, and anatomical locations not only support distinct microbiome membership and diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref043">43</xref>], but also support ecological communities with distinct communication structures and robustness to network degradation by extinction events. Through an improved understanding of network structures across the human body, we aim to empower future studies to investigate how these communities dynamics are influenced by disease states and the overall impact they may have on human health.</p>

<p>We studied the differences in virus-bacteria interaction networks across healthy human bodies by leveraging previously published shotgun sequence datasets of purified viral metagenomes (viromes) paired with bacteria-dominated whole community metagenomes. Our study contained three datasets that explored the impact of diet on the healthy human gut virome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref014">14</xref>], the impact of anatomical location on the healthy human skin virome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref013">13</xref>], and the viromes of monozygotic twins and their mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref034">34</xref>]. We selected these datasets because their virome samples were subjected to virus-like particle (VLP) purification, which removed contaminating DNA from human cells, bacteria, etc. To this end, the publishing authors employed combinations of filtration, chloroform/DNase treatment, and cesium chloride gradients to eliminate organismal DNA (e.g. bacteria, human, fungi, etc) and thereby allow for direct assessment of both the extracellular and fully-assembled intracellular virome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref034">34</xref>]. Each research group reported quality control measures to ensure the purity of the virome sequence datasets, using both computational and molecular techniques (e.g. 16S rRNA gene qPCR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s015">S1 Table</xref>). These reports confirmed that the virome libraries consisted of highly purified virus genomic DNA.</p>
<p>The bacterial and viral sequences from these studies were quality filtered and assembled into contigs (i.e. genomic fragments). We further grouped the related bacterial and phage contigs into operationally defined units based on their k-mer frequencies and co-abundance patterns, similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s003">S3</xref> Figs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref037">37</xref>]. This was done both for dimensionality reduction and to prevent inflation of node counts by using contigs which are expected to represent multiple fragments from the same genomes. This was also done to create genome analogs that we could use in our classification model which was built using genome sequences. We referred to these operationally defined groups of related contigs as operational genomic units (OGUs). Each OGU represented a genomically similar sub-population of either bacteria or phages. Contig lengths within clusters ranged between 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>5.5</sup> bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s003">S3</xref> Figs).</p>
<p>The original publications reported that the whole metagenomic shotgun sequence samples, which primarily consisted of bacteria, had an average viral relative abundance of 0.4% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s015">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref034">34</xref>]. We confirmed these reports by finding that only 2% (6/280 OGUs) of bacterial OGUs had significantly strong nucleotide similarity to phage reference genomes (e-value &lt; 10<sup>−25</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref034">34</xref>]. Additionally, no OGUs were confidently identified as lytic or temperate phage OGUs in the bacterial dataset using the Virsorter algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref044">44</xref>]. We also supplemented the previous virome fraction quality control measures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s015">S1 Table</xref>) to find that, in light of the rigorous purification and quality control during sample collection and preparation, 77% (228/298 operational genomic units) still had some nucleotide similarity to a given bacterial reference genome (e-value &lt; 10<sup>−25</sup>). It is important to note that interpreting such alignment is complicated by the fact that most reference bacterial genomes also contain prophages (i.e. phages integrated into bacterial genomes), meaning we do not know to what extent the alignments were the result of bacterial contaminants in the virome fraction and what were true integrated prophages. As most phages in these communities have been shown to be temperate (i.e. they integrate into bacterial genomes) using methods that included nucleotide alignments of phages to bacterial reference genomes, we expected that a large fraction of those phages were temperate and therefore shared elements with bacterial reference genomes—a trend previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref014">14</xref>]. To ensure the purity of our sample sets, we supplemented the quality control measures by filtering out all OGUs that could be potential bacterial contaminants, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref037">37</xref>]. This resulted in the removal of 143 OGUs that exhibited nucleotide similarity to bacterial genomes but no identifiable known phage elements. We were also able to identify two OGUs as representing <bold>complete</bold>, high confidence phages using the stringent Virsorter phage identification algorithm (class 1 confidence group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref044">44</xref>].</p>

<title>Implementing phage-bacteria interaction prediction to build a community network</title>
<p>We predicted which phage OGUs infected which bacterial OGUs using a random forest model trained on experimentally validated infectious relationships from six previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref049">49</xref>]. Only bacteria and bacteriophages were used in the model. The training set contained 43 diverse bacterial species and 30 diverse phage strains, including both broad and specific ranges of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s016">S2 Table</xref>). While it is true that there are more known phages that infect bacteria, we were limited by the information confirming which phages do not infect certain bacteria and attempted to keep the numbers of positive and negative interactions similar. Phages with linear and circular genomes, as well as ssDNA and dsDNA genomes, were included in the analysis. Because we used DNA sequencing studies, RNA phages were not considered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>). This training set included both positive relationships (i.e. a phage infects a bacterium) and negative relationships (i.e. a phage does not infect a bacterium). This allowed us to validate the false positive and false negative rates associated with our candidate models, thereby building upon previous work that only considered positive relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref036">36</xref>]. It is also worth noting that while a positive interaction is strong evidence that the interaction exists, we must also be conscious that negative interactions are only weak evidence for a lack of interaction because the finding could be the result of our inability to reproduce conditions in which those interactions occur. Altogether we decided to maintain a balanced dataset at the cost of under-sampling the available positive interaction information because the use of such a severely unbalanced dataset often results in over-fit and uninformative model training. However, as an additional validation measure, we used the extensive additional positive interactions as a secondary dataset to confirm that we could identify infectious interactions from a more diverse bacterial and phage dataset. Using this approach, we confirmed that 382 additional phage reference genomes, representing a diverse range of phages, were matched to at least one reference bacterial host genome of the species that they were expected to infect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Because the model was built on full genomes and used on OGUs, we also assessed whether our model was resilient to incomplete reference genomes. We found that the use of our model on random contigs representing as little as 50% length of the original reference phage and bacterial genomes resulted in minimal reduction in the ability of the model to identify relationships (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Four phage and bacterial genomic features were used in our random forest model to predict infectious relationships between bacteria and phages: 1) genome nucleotide similarities, 2) gene amino acid sequence similarities, 3) bacterial Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) spacer sequences that target phages, and 4) similarity of protein families associated with experimentally identified protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref050">50</xref>]. These features were calculated using the training set described above. While the nucleotide and amino acid similarity metrics were expected to identify prophage signatures, the protein family interaction and CRISPR signatures were expected to aid in identifying lytic phages in addition to temperate phages. We chose to utilize these metrics that directly compare nucleotide sequences between sample phages and bacteria, instead of relying on alignment to reference genomes or known marker genes, because we were extrapolating our model to highly diverse communities which we expect to diverge significantly from the available reference genomes. The resulting random forest model was assessed using nested cross validation, and the median area under its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.788, the median model sensitivity was 0.905, and median specificity was 0.538 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This balance of confident true positives at the cost of fewer true negatives was ideal for this type of dataset which consisted of primarily positive connections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Nested cross validation of the model demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of the model could vary but the overall model performance (AUC) remained more consistent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). This suggested that our model would perform with a similar overall accuracy despite changes in sensitivity/specificity trade-offs. The most important predictor in the model was amino acid similarity between genes, followed by nucleotide similarity of whole genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Protein family interactions were moderately important to the model, and CRISPRs were largely uninformative, due to the minimal amount of identifiable CRISPRs in the dataset and their redundancy with the nucleotide similarity methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Approximately one third of the training set relationships yielded no score and therefore were unable to be assigned an interaction prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>We used our random forest model to classify the relationships between bacteria and phage operational genomic units, which were then used to build the interactive network. The master network, analogous to the universal microbiome network concept previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref051">51</xref>], contained the three studies as sub-networks, which themselves each contained sub-networks for each sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Metadata including study, sample ID, disease, and OGU abundance within the community were stored in the master network for parsing in downstream analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). The phage and bacteria of the master network demonstrated both narrow and broad ranges of infectious interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Bacterial and phage relative abundance was recorded in each sample for each OGU and the weight of the edge connecting those OGUs was calculated as a function of those relative abundance values. The separate extraction of the phage and bacterial libraries ensured a more accurate measurement of the microbial communities, as has been outlined previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref053">53</xref>]. The master network was highly connected and contained 38,337 infectious relationships among 435 nodes, representing 155 phages and 280 bacteria. Although the network was highly connected, not all relationships were present in all samples. Relationships were weighted by the relative abundances of their associated bacteria and phages. Like the master network, the skin network exhibited a diameter of 4 (measure of graph size; the greatest number of traversed vertices required between two vertices) and included 433 (154 phages, 279 bacteria, 99.5% total) and 38,099 (99.4%) of the master network nodes and edges, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Additionally, the subnetworks demonstrated narrow ranges of eccentricity across their nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). Graph node eccentricity, a measurement to supplement diameter, is the shortest distance of each node to the furthest other node within the graph. The phages and bacteria in the diet and twin sample sets were more sparsely related, with the diet study consisting of 80 (32 phages, 48 bacteria) nodes and 1,290 relationships, and the twin study containing 130 (29 phages, 101 bacteria) nodes and 2,457 relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). As a validation measure, we identified five (1.7%) examples of phage OGUs which contained similar genomic elements to the four previously described, broadly infectious phages isolated from Lake Michigan (tblastx; e-value &lt; 10<sup>−25</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref054">54</xref>].</p>

<title>Role of diet on gut microbiome connectivity</title>
<p>Diet is a major environmental factor that influences resource availability and gut microbiome composition and diversity, including bacteria and phages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref056">56</xref>]. Previous work in isolated culture-based systems has suggested that changes in nutrient availability are associated with altered phage-bacteria network structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref025">25</xref>], although this has yet to be tested in humans. We therefore hypothesized that a change in diet would also be associated with a change in virome-microbiome network structure in the human gut.</p>
<p>We evaluated the diet-associated differences in gut virome-microbiome network structure by quantifying how central each sample’s network was on average. We accomplished this by utilizing two common weighted centrality metrics: degree centrality and closeness centrality. Degree centrality, the simplest centrality metric, was defined as the number of connections each phage made with each bacterium. We supplemented measurements of degree centrality with measurements of closeness centrality. Closeness centrality is a metric of how close each phage or bacterium is to all of the other phages and bacteria in the network. A higher closeness centrality suggests that the effects of genetic information or altered abundance would be more impactful to all other microbes in the system. Because these are weighted metrics, the values are functions of both connectivity as well as community composition. A network with higher average closeness centrality also indicates an overall greater degree of connections, which suggests a greater resilience against network degradation by extinction events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref057">57</xref>]. This is because more highly connected networks are less likely to degrade into multiple smaller networks when bacteria or phages are randomly removed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref057">57</xref>]. We used this information to calculate the average connectedness per sample, which was corrected for the maximum potential degree of connectedness. Unfortunately our dataset was insufficiently powered to make strong conclusions toward this hypothesis, but this is an interesting observation that warrants further investigation. This observation also serves to illustrate the types of questions we can answer with more comprehensive microbiome sampling and integrative analyses.</p>
<p>Using our small sample set, we observed that the gut microbiome network structures associated with high-fat diets appeared less connected than those of low-fat diets, although a greater sample size will be required to more properly evaluate this trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Five subjects were available for use, all of which had matching bacteria and virome datasets and samples from 8-10 days following the initiation of their diets. High-fat diets appeared to exhibit reduced degree centrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting bacteria in high-fat environments were targeted by fewer phages and that phage tropism was more restricted. High-fat diets also appeared to exhibit decreased closeness centrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), indicating that bacteria and phages were more distant from other bacteria and phages in the community. This would make genetic transfer and altered abundance of a given phage or bacterium less capable of impacting other bacteria and phages within the network.</p>

<p>In addition to diet, we observed a possible trend that obesity influenced network structure. This was done using the three mother samples available from the twin sample set, all of which had matching bacteria and phage samples and confirmed BMI information. The obesity-associated network appeared to have a higher degree centrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), but less closeness centrality than the healthy-associated networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). These results suggested that the obesity-associated networks may be less connected. This again comes with the caveat that this is only an opportunistic observation using an existing sample set with too few samples to make more substantial claims. We included this observation as a point of interest, given the data was available.</p>

<title>Individuality of microbial networks</title>
<p>Skin and gut community membership and diversity are highly personal, with people remaining more similar to themselves than to other people over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref059">59</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that this personal conservation extended to microbiome network structure. We addressed this hypothesis by calculating the degree of dissimilarity between each subject’s network, based on phage and bacteria abundance and centrality. We quantified phage and bacteria centrality within each sample graph using the weighted eigenvector centrality metric. This metric defines central phages as those that are highly abundant (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>O</italic></sub> as defined in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref>) and infect many distinct bacteria which themselves are abundant and infected by many other phages. Similarly, bacterial centrality was defined as those bacteria that were both abundant and connected to numerous phages that were themselves connected to many bacteria. We then calculated the similarity of community networks using the weighted eigenvector centrality of all nodes between all samples. Samples with similar network structures were interpreted as having similar capacities for network robustness and transmitting genetic material.</p>
<p>We used this network dissimilarity metric to test whether microbiome network structures were more similar within people than between people over time. We found that gut microbiome network structures clustered by person (ANOSIM p-value = 0.008, R = 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Network dissimilarity within each person over the 8-10 day sampling period was less than the average dissimilarity between that person and others, although this difference was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.125, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Four of the five available subjects were used because one of the subjects was not sampled at the initial time point. The lack of statistical confidence was likely due to the small sample size of this dataset.</p>

<p>Although there was evidence for gut network conservation among individuals, we found no evidence for conservation of gut network structures within families. The gut network structures were not more similar within families (twins and their mothers; intrafamily) compared to other families (other twins and mothers; inter-family) (p-value = 0.547, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In addition to the gut, skin microbiome network structure was conserved within individuals (p-value &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). This distribution was similar when separated by anatomical sites. Most sites were statistically significantly more conserved within individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006099.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>As an additional validation measure, we evaluated the tolerance of these findings to inaccuracies in the underlying network. As described above, our model is not perfect and there is likely to be noise from false positive and false negative predictions. We found that additional random noise, both by creating a fully connected graph or randomly reducing the number of edges to 60% of the original, changed the statistical significance values (p-values) of our findings but not by enough to change whether they were statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.05).

As viruses are known to influence microbial diversity and community composition, we hypothesized that these differences would still be evident after integrating the bacterial and viral datasets and evaluating their microbe-virus network structure between anatomical sites.

When using this supplementary approach, we found that network structures significantly clustered by moisture, sebaceous, and intermittently moist status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g004">Fig 4C and 4E</xref>). Occluded sites were significantly different from exposed and intermittently occluded sites, but there was no difference between exposed and intermittently occluded sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006099.g004">Fig 4D and 4F</xref>). These findings provide further support that skin microbiome network structure differs significantly between skin sites.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Foundational work has provided a baseline understanding of the human microbiome by characterizing bacterial and viral diversity across the human body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref060">60</xref>]. Here we integrated the bacterial and viral sequence sets to offer an initial understanding of how phage-bacteria networks differ throughout the human body, so as to provide a baseline for future studies of how and why microbiome networks differ in disease states. We implemented a network-based analytical model to evaluate the basic properties of the human microbiome through bacteria and phage relationships, instead of membership or diversity alone. This approach enabled the application of network theory to provide a new perspective while analyzing bacterial and viral communities simultaneously. We utilized metrics of connectivity to model the extent to which communities of bacteria and phages interact through mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer, modulated bacterial gene expression, and alterations in abundance.</p>
<p>Just as gut microbiome and virome composition and diversity are conserved in individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref059">59</xref>], gut and skin microbiome network structures were conserved within individuals over time. Gut network structure was not conserved among family members. These findings suggested that the community properties inferred from microbiome interaction network structures, such as robustness (meaning a more highly connected network is more “robust” to network degradation because a randomly removed bacteria or phage node is less likely to divide or disintegrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref057">57</xref>] the overall network), the potential for horizontal gene transfer between members, and co-evolution of populations, were person-specific. These properties may be impacted by personal factors ranging from the body’s immune system to external environmental conditions, such as climate and diet.</p>
<p>We observed evidence supporting the ability of environmental conditions to shape gut and skin microbiome interaction network structure by observing that diet and skin location were associated with altered network structures. We observed evidence that diet was sufficient to alter gut microbiome network connectivity, although this needs to be interpreted cautiously as a case observation, due to the small sample size. Although the available sample size was small, our findings provide some preliminary evidence that high-fat diets are less connected than low-fat diets and that high-fat diets may therefore lead to less robust communities with a decreased ability for microbes to directly influence one another. We supported this finding with the observation that obesity may have been associated with decreased network connectivity. Together these findings suggest the food we eat may not only impact which microbes colonize our guts, but may also impact their interactions with infecting phages. Further work will be required to characterize these relationships with a larger cohort.</p>
<p>In addition to diet, the skin environment also influenced the microbiome interaction network structure. Network structure differed between environmentally exposed and occluded skin sites. The sites under greater environmental fluctuation and exposure (the exposed and intermittently exposed sites) were more connected and therefore were predicted to have a higher resilience against network degradation when random nodes are removed from the network. Likewise, intermittently moist sites demonstrated higher connectedness than the moist and sebaceous sites. These findings agree with previous work that has shown that bacterial community networks differ by skin environment types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref051">51</xref>]. Together these data suggested that body sites under greater degrees of fluctuation harbored more highly connected microbiomes that are potentially more robust to network disruption by extinction events. This points to a link between microbiome and environmental robustness toward network homeostasis and warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>While these findings take us an important step closer to understanding the microbiome through interspecies relationships, there are caveats and considerations to our findings. First, as with most classification models, the infection classification model developed and applied is only as good as its training set—in this case, the collection of experimentally-verified positive and negative infection data. Large-scale experimental screens for phage and bacteria infectious interactions that report high-confidence negative interactions (i.e., no infection) are desperately needed, as they would provide more robust model training and improved model performance. Furthermore, just as we have improved on previous modeling efforts, we expect that new and creative scoring metrics will improve future performance. Other creative and high performing models are currently being developed and the applications of these models to community network creation will continue to move this field forward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>Second, although our analyses utilized the best datasets currently available for our study, this work was done retrospectively and relied on existing data up to seven years old. These archived datasets were limited by the technology and costs of the time. For example, the diet and twin studies, relied on multiple displacement amplification (MDA) in their library preparations–an approach used to overcome the large nucleic acids requirements typical of older sequencing library generation protocols. It is now known that MDA results in biases in microbial community composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref061">61</xref>], as well as toward ssDNA viral genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref062">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref063">63</xref>], thus rendering the resulting microbial and viral metagenomes largely non-quantitative. Future work that employs larger sequence datasets and that avoids the use of bias-inducing amplification steps will build on and validate our findings, as well as inform the design and interpretation of further studies.</p>
<p>Although our models demonstrated satisfactory accuracy and overall performance, it was important to interpret our findings under the realization that our model was not perfect. This caveat is not new to the microbiome field, with a notable example being the use of 16S rRNA sequencing using the V4 variable region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref053">53</xref>]. Use of the V4 variable region excluded detection of major skin bacterial members, meaning that the findings were not able to completely describe the underlying biological environment. Despite this caveat, skin microbiome studies provided valuable biological insights by focusing on the community differences between groups (e.g. disease and healthy) which were both analyzed the same way. Similarly, here we focused our conclusions on the differences between the groups which were all treated the same, so that we can minimize our dependence on a perfect predictive model. We also provided explicit evidence that the introduction of noise equally to the compared groups did not significantly impact our findings.</p>
<p>Third, the networks in this study were built using operational genomic units (OGUs), which represented groups of highly similar bacteria or phage genomes or clustered genome fragments. Similar clustering definition and validation methods, both computational and experimental, have been implemented in other metagenomic sequencing studies, as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref064">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref066">66</xref>]. These approaches could offer yet another level of sophistication to our network-based analyses. While this operationally defined clustering approach allows us to study whole community networks, our ability to make conclusions about interactions among specific phage or bacterial species or populations is inherently limited, compared to more focused, culture-based studies such as the work by Malki <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref054">54</xref>]. Future work must address this limitation, e.g., through improved binning methods and deeper metagenomic shotgun sequencing, but most importantly through an improved conceptual framing of what defines ecologically and evolutionarily cohesive units for both phage and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref067">67</xref>]. Defining operational genomic units and their taxonomic underpinnings (e.g., whether OGU clusters represent genera or species) is an active area of work critical to the utility of this approach. As a first step, phylogenomic analyses have been performed to cluster cyanophage isolate genomes into informative groups using shared gene content, average nucleotide identity of shared genes, and pairwise differences between genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref068">68</xref>]. Such population-genetic assessment of phage evolution, coupled with the ecological implications of genome heterogeneity, will inform how to define nodes in future iterations of the ecological network developed here. Even though we are hesitant to speculate on phage host ranges at low taxonomic levels in our dataset, the data does agree with previous reports of instances of broad phage host range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref069">69</xref>]. Additionally, visualization of our dataset interactions using the heat map approach previously used in other host range studies, suggests a trend toward modular and nested tropism, but we do not have the strain-level resolution that powered those previous experimental studies.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that our model was built using available full genomes with known interactions, while the experimental datasets resulted in OGUs created from metagenomic shotgun sequence sets, as described above. While this is an informative approach given available data, it is not ideal. We envision future work focusing on training models using metagenomic shotgun sample sets from “mock communities” of bacteria and phages with experimentally validated infectious relationships. This would also be more informative than relying on simulated metagenomic sample sets, whose use would result in models built on simulations and more assumptions instead of empirical data. Together this way the training set can be subjected to the same pre-processing, contig assembly, and OGU binning processes as the experimental data. Furthermore, exciting advances in long read sequencing platforms such as the Oxford Nanopore MinIon system will provide more accurate genomic scaffolds than <italic>de novo</italic> assembled contigs, allowing for more accurate training and predictions of our models. As discussed above, it is because our current model is susceptible to this noise that we focus our conclusions on comparisons between experimental groups that were both treated the same. This is also why it was important for us to evaluate the susceptibility of our results to noise caused by the less-than-perfect prediction model.</p>
<p>Together our work takes an initial step towards defining bacteria-virus interaction profiles as a characteristic of human-associated microbial communities. This approach revealed the impacts that different human environments (e.g., the skin and gut) can have on microbiome connectivity. By focusing on relationships between bacterial and viral communities, they are studied as the interacting cohorts they are, rather than as independent entities. While our developed bacteria-phage interaction framework is a novel conceptual advance, the microbiome also consists of archaea and small eukaryotes, including fungi and <italic>Demodex</italic> mites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref070">70</xref>]—all of which can interact with human immune cells and other non-microbial community members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref071">71</xref>]. Future work will build from our approach and include these additional community members and their diverse interactions and relationships (e.g., beyond phage-bacteria). This will result in a more robust network and a more holistic understanding of the evolutionary and ecological processes that drive the assembly and function of the human-associated microbiome.</p>

<title>Operational genomic unit binning</title>
<p>Contigs often represent large fragments of genomes. In order to reduce redundancy and the resulting artificially inflated genomic richness within our dataset, it was important to bin contigs into operational units based on their similarity. This approach is conceptually similar to the clustering of related 16S rRNA sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), although here we are clustering contigs into operational genomic units (OGUs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref060">60</xref>].</p>
<p>Contigs were clustered using the CONCOCT algorithm (v0.4.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref075">75</xref>]. Because of our large dataset and limits in computational efficiency, we randomly subsampled the dataset to include 25% of all samples, and used these to inform contig abundance within the CONCOCT algorithm. CONCOCT was used with a maximum of 500 clusters, a k-mer length of four, a length threshold of 1 kb, 25 iterations, and exclusion of the total coverage variable.</p>
<p>OGU abundance (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>O</italic></sub>) was obtained as the sum of the abundance of each contig (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>) associated with that OGU. The abundance values were length corrected such that:

<title>Operational genomic unit identification</title>
<p>To confirm a lack of phage sequences in the bacterial OGU dataset, we performed blast nucleotide alignment of the bacterial OGU representative sequences using an e-value &lt; 10<sup>−25</sup>, which was stricter than the 10<sup>−10</sup> threshold used in the random forest model below, against all of the phage reference genomes available in the EMBL database. We used a stricter threshold because we know there are genomic similarities between bacteria and phage OGUs from the interactive model, but we were interested in contigs with high enough similarity to references that they may indeed be from phages. We also performed the converse analysis of aligning phage OGU representative sequences to EMBL bacterial reference genomes. We ran both the phage and bacteria OGU representative sequences through the Virsorter program (1.0.3) to identify phages (all default parameters were used), using only those in the high confidence identification category “class 1” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006099.ref044">44</xref>].

<p>The eigenvector centrality of node <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is defined as the <italic>i</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> value in the first eigenvector of the associated adjacency matrix <bold>A</bold>.
