      <abstract>
        <p>Metabolomics is a relatively new “omics” platform, which analyzes a discrete set of metabolites detected in bio-fluids or tissue samples of organisms. It has been used in a diverse array of studies to detect biomarkers and to determine activity rates for pathways based on changes due to disease or drugs. Recent improvements in analytical methodology and large sample throughput allow for creation of large datasets of metabolites that reflect changes in metabolic dynamics due to disease or a perturbation in the metabolic network. However, current methods of comprehensive analyses of large metabolic datasets (metabolomics) are limited, unlike other “omics” approaches where complex techniques for analyzing coexpression/coregulation of multiple variables are applied. This paper discusses the shortcomings of current metabolomics data analysis techniques, and proposes a new multivariate technique (ADEMA) based on mutual information to identify expected metabolite level changes with respect to a specific condition. We show that ADEMA better predicts De Novo Lipogenesis pathway metabolite level changes in samples with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) than prediction based on the significance of individual metabolite level changes. We also applied ADEMA's classification scheme on three different cohorts of CF and wildtype mice. ADEMA was able to predict whether an unknown mouse has a CF or a wildtype genotype with 1.0, 0.84, and 0.9 accuracy for each respective dataset. ADEMA results had up to 31% higher accuracy as compared to other classification algorithms. In conclusion, ADEMA advances the state-of-the-art in metabolomics analysis, by providing accurate and interpretable classification results.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Metabolomics is an experimental approach that analyzes differences in metabolite levels detected in experimental samples. It has been used in the literature to understand the changes in metabolism with respect to diseases or drugs. Unlike transcriptomics or proteomics, which analyze gene and protein expression levels respectively, the techniques that consider co-regulation of multiple metabolites are quite limited. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, called ADEMA, which computes the expected level changes for each metabolite with respect to a given condition. ADEMA considers multiple metabolites at the same time and is mutual information (MI)-based. We show that ADEMA predicts metabolite level changes for young mice with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) better than significance testing that considers one metabolite at a time. Using three different datasets that contain CF and wild-type (WT) mice, we show that ADEMA can classify an individual as being CF or WT based on the metabolic profiles (with 1.0, 0.84, and 0.9 accuracy, respectively). Compared to other well-known classification algorithms, ADEMA's accuracy is higher by up to 31%.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Metabolomics has emerged as a new “omics” platform in the last two decades with significant improvements in precision and sample throughput in the fields of analytical chemistry and mass spectrometry. Emergence of metabolomics has resulted in the creation of large datasets consisting of diverse classes of metabolites from multiple metabolic pathways. Metabolomics has been used to detect biomarkers of disease or drug-related changes between the control and experiment groups in a vast array of topics, such as Cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Giskedegrd1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Wu1">[4]</xref>, Diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Yi1">[5]</xref>, Cystic Fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Wetmore1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Grasemann1">[7]</xref>, Toxicology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-vanRavenzwaay1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Roessner1">[12]</xref>, and Plant Research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Bowne1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Arkin1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Univariate and multivariate statistical approaches have been used to analyze metabolites to determine meaningful biomarkers of disease presence/severity or treatment effectiveness. Univariate techniques include correlation/partial correlation analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Weckwerth1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Camacho1">[19]</xref>, ANOVA and significance testing for stand-alone metabolites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Wetmore1">[6]</xref>. These techniques consider one variable (metabolite) at a time. Multivariate techniques include Principle Component Analysis (PCA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Ward1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Hines1">[21]</xref>, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Scholz1">[22]</xref>, and Partial Least Squares–Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-vanRavenzwaay1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Guo1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Hines1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Steinfath1">[23]</xref>. All of the multivariate analysis techniques noted above assume that the underlying dependencies among metabolites are linear, which is not necessarily the case. There are non-linear multivariate techniques in the literature like Non-Linear PCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Kramer1">[24]</xref>. However, we are not aware of their applications to metabolomics analysis, with the exception of Scholz et. al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Scholz2">[25]</xref>, which tries to analyze time-course data with missing values.</p>
      <p>It is important for domain scientists to see how each metabolite level changes with respect to a given condition (e.g., disease, treatment etc.), in order to hypothesize about the metabolic alterations in the variable group. Since multivariate techniques truncate variables (e.g., based on <italic>variable importance in projection</italic> scores in PLS-DA) to find a small number of components that explain the variance best, they are not a good fit for this use. Instead, researchers use univariate techniques to locate significant changes per metabolite between the variable and the control. Then, they map these changes onto a metabolic network in order to detect pathways with increased/decreased flux based on the significances of increases/decreases, and the number of metabolites that are significantly changed in a detected pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Wetmore1">[6]</xref>. This method causes a number of problems. First, the number of wild-type (control) and condition cohorts is usually small, and due to the high degrees of freedom, the test statistic may miss some changes as they do not show up as significant. Second, analyzing individual metabolites and aggregating the results may fail to explain the phenomenon at hand: it has been shown that different combinations of perturbed metabolites have different effects on the organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Radeke1">[26]</xref>. Third, when changes in two metabolites with respect to each other are analyzed, the significance of the change in the ratio of their concentrations is checked, which is an ad-hoc solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-AldmizEchevarra1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Batal1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although current methods to analyze metabolite level changes are limited to univariate analysis, finding genes that are co-regulated with respect to a condition is a well-studied problem in the gene expression analysis context. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is the first work that aims to find whether a predefined set of genes are enriched in a group of experiments with a condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Subramanian1">[29]</xref>. GSEA has also been applied to metabolite data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Xia1">[30]</xref>. However, shortcomings of the method have been noted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Draghici1">[31]</xref>. In another work, combinations of expression levels of genes are shown to be informative about a condition through mutual information (MI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Chowdhury1">[32]</xref>, which is a statistical technique that can capture non-linear associations between random variables. In gene expression analysis, MI has been frequently used to find dependencies among gene expression profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Zhang1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Butte1">[36]</xref>. There are only a few mutual information-based techniques in the context of metabolomics analysis, targeting different problems such as reverse engineering of metabolic networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Cakr1">[37]</xref> or measuring correlations within the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Numata1">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In light of the limitations of the current approaches and motivated by the combinatorial approach used for gene expression analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Chowdhury1">[32]</xref>, we propose a novel multivariate method, called ADEMA (Algorithm for Determining Expected Metabolic Alterations). Given the control, ADEMA locates the “expected” metabolite changes that are indicative of the condition in the variable group. This task can help researchers (a) understand “under-the-hood” reasons for the symptoms that are being observed and (b) hypothesize on the cause-and-effect relationships between anomalies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g001">Figure 1</xref> provides an overview of the proposed methodology. The first step consists of forming a population with multiple individuals in variable and control groups and measuring the concentrations of those metabolites of interest. In the second step, each observation is assigned to discrete bins with some probability. The third step is to obtain the metabolic (sub)network for the measured metabolites. The fourth step locates the related subsets of metabolites using the metabolic network. The fifth and the final step uses the probabilities found in step 2, determines control-specific and variable-specific metabolite levels (bins), and compares them to find the changes in the variable group with respect to the control group. In the example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g001">Figure 1</xref>, there are 2 mice in the control group and 2 mice in the variable group. Four metabolites of interest are measured for each individual and are related using the metabolic network. It has been determined that &lt;A, B, C&gt; and &lt;A, B, D&gt; are the related subsets. Each observation is assigned a probability of being either <italic>up</italic> or <italic>down</italic> (two discrete bins). Finally, the algorithm determines that mice in the variable group have higher levels of A, B, C, and decreased levels of D as compared to mice in the control group.</p>

          <title>An overview for ADEMA.</title>
          <p>The first step is to construct a population such that it contains multiple individuals (in this case M1 and M2 who are in control group versus M3 and M4 who are in variable group. Concentrations of metabolites of interest are determined for all individuals (in this case concentrations of metabolites A, B, C and D). Then for the second step, each observation is assigned a probability to be in a discrete bin (we only consider two bins, namely, up or down). Third step is to construct the metabolic network to determine the associations between measured metabolites. In this figure circles represents metabolites and arrows represent the reactions that relate metabolites. This is followed by the fourth step that determines the subsets of metabolites, which are related in the metabolic network. We have found two sets, &lt;A, B, C&gt; and &lt;A, B, D&gt;, are the only subsets that are related. Using the probabilities found in step 2 and related subsets found in step 4, ADEMA determines control- and variable-specific metabolite levels (bins) and compares the changes in variable group with respect to mice in control group. In this example, ADEMA concludes that A, B and C are increased, and D is decreased in the variable group as compared to control mice.</p>

      </fig>
      <p>More specifically ADEMA has the following steps: (i) discretize (bin) metabolite observations using B-Spline curves, (ii) identify the related subsets of metabolites out of the observed metabolites by generating the Elementary Flux Modes (EFM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Moon1">[39]</xref> of the metabolic network, (iii) locate combinations of metabolite pool levels (i.e., bins) that are “informative” with respect to a condition, and (iv) calculate the expected metabolite levels for the variable and the control groups, based on the marginal mutual information provided; and, compare them. By employing the identified expected levels, ADEMA can then be used as a classifier.</p>
      <p>To evaluate ADEMA, a Cystic Fibrosis (CF) dataset (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s001">Dataset S1</xref>) that consists of multiple 3-week-old wild-type (control) and CF (variable) mice is used. Although individual metabolite changes are not significant in 3-week-old mice, the expected levels found by ADEMA conform to the independently performed flux and gene expression analysis done on 3-week-old CF and WT mice. Moreover, we show that ADEMA can classify CF versus WT in three different datasets (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s001">Dataset S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s002">Dataset S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s003">Dataset S3</xref>). ADEMA can predict whether an unknown mouse has CF or not, with 1.0, 0.84, and 0.9 accuracy for each respective dataset. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> are better up to 31% as compared to other well-known classification algorithms.</p>

        <title>Binning Observations</title>
        <p>Mutual information works with discrete values, whereas metabolite measurements are continuous real numbers. Therefore, to work with mutual information, one needs to discretize (bin) real values into discrete bins. In this subsection we discuss the existing methods employed in the literature and the reasoning behind picking a B-spline based strategy.</p>
        <p>There are two types of methods in the literature to estimate probability densities out of continuous data: Parametric and Non-parametric methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Silwerman1">[40]</xref>. The former one assumes that observations come from a known family of distributions. As we do not have any knowledge on the distributions of the observations we follow the latter approach (non-parametric).</p>
        <p>There are two non-parametric approaches in the current literature. The first one is kernel density estimation (KDE), which, given a window length <italic>l</italic>, estimates a density for each observation <italic>x</italic>, by counting the number of points in the window, weighted by their distances using a pre-selected kernel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Moon1">[39]</xref>. The result depends on the window length and the kernel used; also KDE has a high computational requirement. Thus, we did not pick KDE. The second approach is the histogram-based approach where observations are simply distributed into discrete bins. As metabolite measurements come with an error term, observations that are close to the borders can easily be misclassified when pre-determined thresholds are used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Cakmak1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Cicek1">[42]</xref>. To address this issue, B-spline functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-DeBoor1">[43]</xref> have been used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Daub1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Venelli1">[45]</xref>. Instead of placing an observation only in a single bin, each observation can be assigned to multiple bins, weighted by the B-spline function. In this case, bins are converted into overlapping polynomial functions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows basis B-spline functions for 6 bins. In this figure each curve represents a bin. Each observation is assigned to the bin represented by the B-spline function (curve), with the corresponding probability for that observation. The sum of the probabilities for each bin is 1 for that observation. That is, for a specific <italic>x</italic> value in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>y</italic> values found using the B-spline curves would sum up to 1. In comparison, the histogram-based approach would divide the range [0, 1] in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g002">Figure 2</xref>, into 6 pieces (e.g., 0–0.16–0.33–0.5–0.66–0.83–1) and assign observations to only one of the bins (e.g., with probability 1 to the assigned bin).</p>

        <title>Selecting Subsets of Metabolites</title>
        <p>ADEMA is a multivariate method that considers multiple metabolites at a time to capture interdependencies between molecules. There are two extremes. One can (i) calculate expected levels per metabolite, but then would miss the dependencies between metabolites themselves (e.g. consider all subsets of size 1), or (ii) look for expected states of all observed metabolites together (e.g. have only one subset that contains all metabolites), but, this time, would unnecessarily consider metabolites that are not related at the same time. Moreover, for <italic>n</italic> metabolites and <italic>M</italic> bins, there are <italic>M<sup>n</sup></italic> possible combinations of metabolites and their corresponding levels (bins) as each metabolite can be in <italic>M</italic> different levels. As the method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, the subsets of metabolites to be considered together must be chosen carefully. Next we discuss three strategies to select related subsets of metabolites.</p>
        <p>Metabolic networks provide a good understanding of the dependencies between metabolites by defining producer-consumer relationships. Elementary Mode Analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Schuster1">[46]</xref> is a technique that identifies minimal sets of reactions that are active at the steady state of an organism and a metabolic network of interest. Each set is called an elementary flux mode (EFM), and any flux distribution on the metabolic network at steady state can be represented as a combination of the elementary modes. By definition, elementary modes define the subset of reactions that form the basis of the flux going through the metabolic network of interest. Thus, as a measure of dependency between metabolites, our first strategy for selecting related metabolite subsets is to use elementary modes, and consider all metabolites <italic>associated with</italic> the reactions in an elementary mode as a subset. In our context, association for a metabolite with a reaction means being a substrate or a product of that reaction. Note that elementary modes might still contain metabolites in the order of <italic>O(n)</italic>. Should this be the case, we break down EFMs into pieces using a predefined threshold that limits the maximum number of metabolites that can exist in a subset.</p>
        <p>The second strategy for related metabolite subset selection aims to group metabolites that are close to each other in the metabolic network. For each metabolite, we construct a subset that contains all metabolites within one-hop distance to that metabolite (i.e., those that can be reached by a single reaction). The origin metabolite itself is also added to the set. Note that in the case of hub metabolites, the number of metabolites within a subset can still be large; thus, we apply the threshold strategy used for EFMs for this strategy as well. In contrast with the first approach, which locates the related metabolites using elementary fluxes that traverse the network, this approach disregards fluxes at the steady state, and focuses purely on topological closeness in order to determine the subsets.</p>
        <p>The third strategy is to randomly pick distinct metabolites to form related subsets of metabolites. This strategy is used as a baseline strategy, assumes no prior metabolic network knowledge, and disregards all flux or topology based relationships among metabolites. The number of metabolites is again limited by a threshold. One advantage of the third strategy is that it can be used when there is no or limited knowledge about the metabolic network or when the network is very complex or large.</p>
        <p>In the experimental evaluation, we compare performances of the three strategies in terms of the classification performance of ADEMA and report our findings on threshold selection and its effect on the algorithm efficiency. After the related subsets of metabolites are determined and the observations are discretized, the algorithm measures how informative the determined subsets are about the class variable (CF vs. WT) using mutual information.</p>

          <p>Following Theorem 1, when one of the terms is positive (i.e., more frequently observed in that class), the other is forced to be less than that (i.e., it is less frequent in that class). As stated before, our goal is to locate the expected metabolite levels for <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>CF</italic>. We are seeking (i) the expected metabolic state occurs in <italic>CF</italic>, but not in <italic>WT</italic> and (ii) the expected metabolic state that is to occur in <italic>WT</italic> but not in <italic>CF</italic>. In order to do so, we classify each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002859.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> into one of the two following random variables: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002859.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002859.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as indicators of <italic>CF</italic> and <italic>WT</italic>, respectively, based on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002859.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

          <p>As explained earlier, ADEMA may obtain more than one subset of metabolites using EFMs. After obtaining <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002859.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002859.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>for each <italic>Sub<sub>i</sub></italic>, ADEMA performs the following task of unifying results found per EFM. First, for each observed metabolite <italic>m<sub>j</sub></italic>, it finds all <italic>Sub</italic><sub>i</sub> such that <italic>m<sub>j</sub></italic> ∈ <italic>Sub</italic><sub>i</sub>. We name this set of subsets of metabolites as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002859.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

          <p>To summarize, ADEMA first classifies each bin combination <italic>o</italic> as an indicator of either the variable or the control based on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002859.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For each class, it determines the expected bin combination as a weighted sum of the classified combinations. They are weighted by the percentage of information they provide among all other combinations that are indicative of that class. This is done for each subset of metabolites considered. Finally, all expected levels found for each metabolite are combined as a weighted sum of the considered subsets; they are weighted by the percentage of mutual information each subset of metabolites provides among all the considered subsets. ADEMA finds an expected level per class for each metabolite. Next we describe an optional step of the algorithm. We show that the expected levels of metabolites can also be used to train ADEMA classifier to label unknown individuals.</p>

          <p>To obtain the EFMs we used the YANA software package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Schwarz1">[48]</xref>. The networks were input using the visual interface of YANA. For the fatty acid data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s001">Dataset S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s002">Dataset S2</xref>), the metabolic network shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s005">Figure S1</xref> was input as specified in Selway <italic>et. al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Selway1">[49]</xref>. This network starts with Decanoic Acid, and produces Oleic Acid and Palmitoleic Acid. There are two other disconnected parts. The first path goes from Linolenic Acid to Docosahexaenoic Acid and the second path goes from Linoleic Acid to Arachidonic Acid. For the liver profile, we assembled the network by connecting the related metabolites in the dataset with reactions defined in the metabolic atlas by Selway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Selway1">[49]</xref>. The screenshot for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s003">Dataset S3</xref> is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s006">Figure S2</xref>. YANA produced 4 EFMs for the fatty acid datasets and 77 EFMs for the liver profile. The EFMs were broken into subsets when they had more than the number metabolites allowed per group (in this case, we fix this number to 8). There were 20 EFMs broken into two pieces for the liver profile, so we used 123 subsets of metabolites.</p>
          <p>For the neighborhood approach, we obtained 1-neighborhood of each metabolite and constructed the metabolite subsets. For the fatty acid data, we obtained 11 subsets (all contain less than 8 metabolites) and, for the liver profile, we obtained 22 subsets of metabolites. Two of the subsets contained more than 8 metabolites; thus they were broken into two pieces to obtain 24 subsets in the end. Finally, to test the random strategy, we generated 4 random subsets for the fatty acid data and 123 subsets of metabolites for the liver profile each of which have less than 8 metabolites.</p>
          <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002859-t002">Table 2</xref> shows the classification performances per metabolite selection strategy. EFMs achieve the highest accuracy in all cases. Therefore EFM based metabolite selection strategy is selected as our default metabolite selection strategy.</p>

      <p>This section applies ADEMA to experimental metabolomics data on CF and wildtype mice, evaluates the results, and validates the approach. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal disorder caused by mutations in cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR), with the symptoms of respiratory and pancreatic dysfunction and low body-mass index. The most common mutation, F508del, results in deletion of a phenylalanine at 508<sup>th</sup> amino acid position of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Rommens1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Snouwaert1">[51]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Determining Expected Metabolite Levels for 3-week-old CF Mice</title>
        <p>In this section, we predict expected changes in the levels of metabolites for the 3-week-old <italic>CF</italic> and <italic>WT</italic> mice cohorts (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s001">Dataset S1</xref>). We are using blood metabolite levels as surrogate markers for liver metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Guyton1">[52]</xref>. We obtain CF and WT specific metabolite level combinations and calculate the expectation per subset of metabolites. Finally, we aggregate the results for each subset found using EFMs. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g001">Figure 1</xref> for an overview of the method, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s007">Figure S3</xref> for an example.</p>
        <p>Next, we test the validity of results generated by ADEMA against the findings of an independent wet-lab study. Details of the study are described in the next paragraph.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Results</italic></xref><italic> of Independent Wet-lab Study on 3-week-old CF Mice </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Bederman1">[<italic>47</italic>]</xref><italic>:</italic> Using the incorporation of <sup>2</sup>H from deuterated water administered to mice, (<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O), it has been determined that <italic>CF</italic> mice had significantly lower <italic>de novo lipogenesis</italic> (<italic>DNL</italic>, conversion of carbohydrates to <italic>Palmitic Acid</italic>, and elongation to <italic>Stearic Acid</italic>). <italic>DNL</italic> was 75% lower in <italic>CF</italic> mice as compared to <italic>WT</italic>. This implies that the flux through the <italic>DNL</italic> pathway (Decanoic Acid - Stearic Acid) was drastically reduced. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows this change on the depiction of <italic>DNL</italic> pathway. It is not entirely clear why DNL rates were markedly decreased in <italic>CF</italic> mice; however, Bederman et al. found significantly decreased food intake in 3 week old mice (<italic>CF</italic> mice consume 50% less food) suggesting that carbohydrate/insulin activation of <italic>DNL</italic> pathway can be delayed in 3-week-old <italic>CF</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Bederman1">[47]</xref>. Consequently, <italic>CF</italic> mice have significantly decreased adipose tissue stores and delayed growth overall as adults. Also, gene expression analysis shows that the <italic>ELOVL6</italic> (elongation of Tetradecanoic to Palmitic Acid and subsequently to Stearic fatty acid) gene expression was down by 3-fold in CF mice. Similarly, the gene <italic>SCD1</italic> which expresses the enzyme that converts (desaturates) Palmitic Acid to Palmitoleic Acid and Stearic to Oleic Acid is down by 22-fold in CF mice. These changes are marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g005">Figure 5</xref>. Although gene expression levels do not have a one-to-one correspondence with reaction activities due to many factors such as post-transcriptional regulation, they have been used in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Shlomi1">[53]</xref> as <italic>cues</italic> for reaction activity. Here, by considering the gene expression levels together with the reduction in <italic>DNL</italic> activity, it is safe to assume that the reactions are downregulated in the <italic>CF</italic> mice compared to <italic>WT</italic> mice.</p>

        <p>We show where the DNL pathway fits in the big picture in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g006">Figure 6</xref>. This figure shows general cellular metabolism with a focus on the lipogenic pathway. Bold arrows show carbon flux from Glucose into mitochondrion during the fed state. Since TCA cycle flux is slow in the fed state, excess carbon exits via citrate through citrate transporter back into the cytosol, where it is catalyzed by Citrate Lyase yielding Oxaloacetate (OAA) and lipogenic Acetyl-CoA, which is subsequently converted into Malonyl-CoA. Palmitic acid is then synthesized by adding units of Malonyl-CoA. Palmitate enters the DNL pathway, where it is elongated and/or desaturated to yield other components of the network that we describe in this manuscript. This overall DNL pathway is particularly relevant to CF due to the facts described above. Thus, examining carbon flux through this lipogenic network allows us to answer clinically relevant questions in CF research.</p>

DNL pathway is particularly relevant to CF since it has been showed that mice with CF exhibit low lipogenesis and deposition of newly synthesize fatty acids into adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Bederman1">[47]</xref>.</p>

These conclusions do not comply with the data or with the gene-expression-level-based expectation noted above. One would expect a drastic change on the metabolite values as the evidence suggests that there is a substantial alteration on the pathway flow.

ADEMA's prediction shows that Dodecanoic Acid and Tetradecanoic Acid are increased. The increases in Dodecanoic Acid and Tetradecanoic Acid can be explained by a downstream effect of Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid that lead to accumulation of these two metabolites as they are no longer consumed (Note that Palmitic Acid and Stearic Acid have bigger pool sizes than the precursors). Finally, ADEMA predicts that all metabolites in essential fatty acid elongation pathways Linolenic Acid to Docosahexaenoic Acid and Linoleic Acid to Arachidonic Acid are decreased. When metabolites are analyzed one by one, one would argue that there are no significant changes, which would lead to a different conclusion than the independent study. ADEMA provides a more consistent scenario, where the main products of the pathway are all decreased and lead to the accumulation of the precursors.</p>

        <title>Classification Performance</title>
        <p>To present the classification performance of ADEMA (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>), we make use of the blood profiles at 3 and 6 weeks (3 and 6 weeks data mentioned above) and the liver profile. To test the ADEMA approach, leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) is used. That is, we remove a mouse from the dataset (test data), train the classifier using the rest of the dataset (training data) and blindly classify the removed mouse. We repeat this for each mouse in that dataset. Note that LOOCV is desirable for small data size, is almost unbiased and is frequently used in microarray studies, despite the high computation model building cost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Dubitzky1">[54]</xref>.

This method first performs quantile normalization on each intra-replicate group, then performs a quality control to adjust its parameters to minimize inter-replicate discrepancies. Application of these methods to the datasets is straightforward. The dataset itself (real values), or the normalized version, was input to the method, and the classification accuracy is returned.</p>

However, for the 6-week data only ADEMA and Neural Network, and for the liver profile only, ADEMA and SVM return statistically significant accuracies. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> show that ADEMA performs equivalent or more accurately in all cases (up to 31%), and it performs better than all other methods for at least one dataset. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> also show that normalizing the data results in better accuracy for all approaches, with improvements up to 42%. Although in some cases performances of ADEMA and the other methods are identical, the advantage comes from the interpretability of ADEMA's result. That is, all the other algorithms make a prediction using some internal techniques, but provide no feedback or biological explanation to the user about how they did it or what made them to predict what they predicted. For instance, PLS-DA uses the most significant variables (in our case metabolites) that explain the variance, and disregards the rest of the variables, which makes it impossible to evaluate all metabolites at hand. SVM is known for its lack of interpretability as it transforms the variable into a high dimensional space to perform classification. Neural networks use a layered network structure where each node assigns weights to the interconnections; and, the output is a binary classification decision. The Random-Forest method builds multiple classification trees, and performs a majority voting among them. Although individual trees are interpretable (e.g., that, say, A is low and B is high implies <italic>CF</italic>), the majority voting obscures the interpretability of the final result. Finally, AdaBoost tries to improve the performance of the underlying classifier by reassigning weights to the misclassified examples in the previous iterations. AdaBoost is an optimization algorithm that relies on another classification algorithm, and the interpretability of the result depends on the underlying algorithm; in the end, the output is a binary decision. In comparison, ADEMA outputs expected levels, and outputs a snapshot of the metabolic changes that have led to the classification conclusion. This way, ADEMA lets researchers to hypothesize on the metabolic activity that distinguishes variable from the control. Once again, classification scheme for ADEMA uses the same <italic>WT-</italic> or <italic>CF</italic>-specific combinations that have been found to predict the expected levels as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g008">Figure 8</xref>. That is, during classification, it uses these combinations to calculate whether it is more likely for the unknown individual to be in the CF-specific states to WT-specific states. Therefore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g008">Figure 8</xref> provides an interpretation of the classification decisions ADEMA has made. Moreover, from the results of all classification tests, we conclude that ADEMA provides biologically meaningful signatures to predict the expected levels that can also be employed for classifications of samples.</p>

        <title>An In-Silico Experiment to Validate Expected Levels</title>
        <p>To further validate the expected levels found by ADEMA, we generated an <italic>in silico</italic> dataset using the kinetic model of simplified Glycolysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s004">Dataset S4</xref>). We used the Wolf2000_Glycolytic_Oscillations model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Wolf1">[57]</xref> from BioModels Database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Li1">[58]</xref>. Using the online simulation interface of the PathCase<sup>SB</sup> system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Cakmak2">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Coskun1">[60]</xref>, we ran 10 independent simulations using different initial concentrations for Glucose, which is the only incoming source of flux in the network (boundary metabolite). We ran 5 simulations with initial Glucose concentrations smaller than 6 units, and considered them as the control group. Then, we ran 5 simulations with initial Glucose concentration larger than 10 units and considered this group the variable group. Per each simulation, we obtained 75 values per metabolite for 75 time points and averaged them into a single representative amount. In this dataset, we obtained concentrations for 9 metabolites, which are reported in the model. These metabolites are: <italic>Glucose</italic>, <italic>Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphate, Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate+DHAP (abstracted as a single metabolite in the model), 3 Phosphoglycerate, Pyruvate, Acetaldehyde</italic>, and <italic>External Acetaldehyde</italic>.</p>
        <p>Observations are discretized using B-splines as described before. We picked &lt;6,2,8&gt; as the &lt;<italic>M,k,maxSubset</italic>&gt; combination based on the classification performance. YANA returned a single EFM (with all 9 metabolites), which is then broken into two subsets.</p>
        <p>As the initial input to the metabolic network was increased (i.e., increased Glucose concentrations) in the variable group, the expectation is to observe an increase in the metabolic activity along the network and increased metabolite concentrations. However, student's t-test cannot detect any significant changes between two groups for ATP and <italic>Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphate</italic> levels. On the other hand, ADEMA predicted an increase for all metabolites in the variable group with respect to the control group. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g011">Figure 11</xref>. This also supports the reliability of the expected levels found by ADEMA.</p>

        <title>Time Performance</title>
        <p>For the picked parameters described at the beginning of this section, ADEMA took 17 seconds for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s001">Dataset S1</xref>, 0.05 seconds for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s002">Dataset S2</xref>, and 66 seconds for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s003">Dataset S3</xref> to classify an unknown individual on average. ADEMA requires more time as each of <italic>M</italic>, <italic>k</italic>, the number of subsets, and the subset size increase. Parameter <italic>k</italic> increases the time requirement because of the recursive computations shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002859.e012">equation 3</xref>. As discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>, we limit the maximum size of the subsets of metabolites; so, we show the effect of the rest of the variables noted above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g012">Figure 12</xref>.</p>

        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g012">Figure 12</xref>, we show the average time required to calculate the expected levels per metabolite and to classify a mouse, for given <italic>M</italic> and <italic>k</italic> values using <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s001">Dataset S1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002859-g012">Figure 12</xref> clearly shows that, as parameters <italic>M</italic> and <italic>k</italic> increase, the computation time increases exponentially. Although this may raise a question on the applicability of ADEMA in a more general setting with networks of larger sizes and increased number of EFMs, next we show that ADEMA's parameters can be relaxed to trade accuracy for time. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002859-t003">Table 3</xref> shows accuracy results for all &lt;<italic>M,k,maxSubset</italic>&gt; combinations tested on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s003">Dataset S3</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002859-t004">Table 4</xref> lists the time taken for each respective test. As indicated before, the best accuracy result (0.9) was obtained using the combination &lt;<italic>6,2,6</italic>&gt;. This particular test took ∼66 seconds as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002859-t004">Table 4</xref>. On the other hand, the combination &lt;<italic>4,2,5</italic>&gt; resulted in 0.77 accuracy which is also significant at the 0.05 level, and took only ∼2 seconds. Thus, the execution time of the algorithm can be limited by relaxing the parameters, while still providing statistically significant classification performance. The accuracy/time performance tables for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s001">Dataset S1</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s008">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s009">S2</xref>, respectively, and for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s002">Dataset S2</xref> they are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s010">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002859.s011">S4</xref>, respectively. Similarly, when the metabolic network is large and the EFM calculation takes a long time, the algorithm can be switched to using the random metabolite selection strategy. The modular structure of the algorithm enables the user to pick parameters, or to switch between the subcomponents of the algorithm to achieve accuracy within the time limits set by the user for larger problems.</p>

        <p>To further validate that ADEMA can be applied on large-scale networks we have tested the algorithm on two in silico datasets generated for models Bungay2003_ Thrombin_ Generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Bungay1">[61]</xref> and Ung2008_EGFR_Endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Ung1">[62]</xref>. Former model has 74 species (metabolites) and latter model has 194 species. We have generated the data following the same procedure to generate data for Wolf2000_Glycolytic_Oscillations model as described in the previous subsection. For the first model we have run 5 simulations with low initial concentrations for “Ps_f” (&lt;1500), which represent the <italic>WT</italic> group and 5 simulations with high concentrations for “Ps_f” (&gt;2800) which represent the <italic>CF</italic> group. Same is done for “Src” in the second model (low concentrations &lt;6 and high concentrations &gt;20). Again, per simulation, we obtained 75 values per metabolite for 75 time points and averaged them into a single representative amount. For both datasets we tested ADEMA's classification scheme using LOOCV. ADEMA was able to achieve perfect accuracy for both datasets, and took only 0.96 and 0.86 seconds on average, respectively. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> show that ADEMA can be applied on large networks without sacrificing accuracy or reliability.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>ADEMA is a new framework that identifies expected level changes for metabolites with respect to a condition. For each related set of metabolites, it calculates the mutual information between each combination of discretized levels of the metabolites in that set, and the class variable. We have shown how each combination can be classified as being informative in terms of the variable group or the control group, and have used this information to calculate the expected levels per class variable. ADEMA also presents a scheme to use expected levels to classify individuals with unknown class labels. We have shown that the expected metabolite level changes calculated by ADEMA conform to flux measurement results and the gene expression analysis done on 3-week-old CF mice. We have also shown that ADEMA's classification performs more accurately than five other well-known classification techniques by up to 31%. Unlike all other classification techniques, ADEMA's classification results are also interpretable. That is, ADEMA provides an explanation of the classification result by outputting the expected level changes, along with the prediction. We think that this feature is very important for metabolomics researchers who attempt to capture a snapshot of the metabolism, and understand the differences between the two groups.</p>
      <p>ADEMA attempts to minimize the loss of biological information contained in a metabolic profile. Preservation of information is particularly important when a disease causes subtle changes in metabolite levels, i.e., changes that are insignificant at a single metabolite level, but significant when taken together with other metabolite levels.</p>
      <p>In terms of Cystic Fibrosis, our hope is for ADEMA to contribute to the biomarker potential of dyslipidemia in Cystic Fibrosis. Fatty acid profiles are currently used as outcome measures in clinical trials for CF patients; the use of ADEMA would maximize the amount of information obtained from fatty acid profiles, improving the outcome measure sensitivity. Metabolite profiles are useful in the treatment of other diseases as well. For instance, comprehensive serum fatty acid profiles are used to diagnose and monitor individuals with inborn errors of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and peroxisomal disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Lagerstedt1">[63]</xref>. ADEMA's increased sensitivity to subtle changes in metabolite levels may be beneficial to the analysis of metabolite profiles in many diseases. Furthermore, the advent of a new class of CFTR potentiator drugs (i.e., VX-770, discussed in Ramsey et al. 2011 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Ramsey1">[64]</xref>) obviates the need for additional outcome measures in drug trials. Fatty acid levels were not reported as an outcome measure in Ramsey et al. 2011, perhaps because of unresolved inconsistencies in the direction of change in individual fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Coste1">[65]</xref>. Further research is needed to determine if analysis of fatty acid profiles by ADEMA will provide a more clinically useful outcome measure.</p>
      <p>We foresee that there is room for improvement in ADEMA on selecting the relevant subsets of metabolites. Rather than relying on the existing knowledge of relations between metabolites, one can search for signatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002859-Chowdhury1">[32]</xref> that define the dataset to reach higher levels of mutual information. This may benefit the calculation of expected levels of metabolites and classification. Another limitation with ADEMA is its exponential nature (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>). However, as described in the algorithm can be tweaked to trade accuracy for execution time. Searching for small, but informative, states may also reduce the time complexity of ADEMA.</p>
      <p>ADEMA fills an important gap in the metabolomics literature because it provides an analysis of non-linear dependencies among multiple metabolites, and derives an expectation of changes with respect to a condition. This is a question that all “omics” platforms seek an answer for, and the need for techniques that embrace transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data is substantial. ADEMA has no metabolite-specific dependencies other than the use of EFMs, and it can easily be incorporated to other high-throughput techniques.</p>
