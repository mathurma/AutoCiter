                    results from reflex secretion of the hormone oxytocin; without oxytocin, newly
                    born young will die unless they are fostered. Oxytocin is made by magnocellular
                    hypothalamic neurons, and is secreted from their nerve endings in the pituitary
                    in response to action potentials (spikes) that are generated in the cell bodies
                    and which are propagated down their axons to the nerve endings. Normally,
                    oxytocin cells discharge asynchronously at 1–3 spikes/s, but during
                    suckling, every 5 min or so, each discharges a brief, intense burst of spikes
                    that release a pulse of oxytocin into the circulation. This reflex was the
                    first, and is perhaps the best, example of a physiological role for
                    peptide-mediated communication within the brain: it is coordinated by the
                    release of oxytocin from the dendrites of oxytocin cells; it can be facilitated
                    by injection of tiny amounts of oxytocin into the hypothalamus, and it can be
                    blocked by injection of tiny amounts of oxytocin antagonist. Here we show how
                    synchronized bursting can arise in a neuronal network model that incorporates
                    basic observations of the physiology of oxytocin cells. In our model, bursting
                    is an emergent behaviour of a complex system, involving both positive and
                    negative feedbacks, between many sparsely connected cells. The oxytocin cells
                    are regulated by independent afferent inputs, but they interact by local release
                    of oxytocin and endocannabinoids. Oxytocin released from the dendrites of these
                    cells has a positive-feedback effect, while endocannabinoids have an inhibitory
                    effect by suppressing the afferent input to the cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>When young suckle, they are rewarded intermittently with a let-down of milk that
                    results from reflex secretion of the hormone oxytocin. Oxytocin is a
                    neuropeptide made by specialised neurons in the hypothalamus, and is secreted
                    from nerve endings in the pituitary gland. During suckling, every 5 min or so,
                    each of these neurons discharges a brief, intense burst of action potentials;
                    these are propagated down the axons, and release a pulse of oxytocin into the
                    circulation. Here, we have built a computational model to understand how these
                    bursts arise and how they are synchronized. In our model, bursting is an
                    emergent behaviour of a complex system, involving both positive and negative

                    effect by suppressing the afferent input to the cells. Many neurons make
                    peptides that act as messengers within the brain, and many of these are also
                    released from dendrites, so this model may reflect a common pattern-generating
                    mechanism in the brain.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Supported by BBSRC and EPSRC of the United Kingdom.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The milk-ejection reflex is perhaps the best example of a physiological role for
                peptide-mediated communication within the brain. Here we use a large body of data,
                accumulated over the last 30 years, to develop a model of this reflex. In the model,
                synchronized bursting is an emergent property of the network; we use the model to
                explain diverse experimentally observed phenomena, many of which seem paradoxical.</p><p>When young suckle, they are rewarded intermittently with a let-down of milk that
                results from the reflex secretion of oxytocin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Takayanagi1">[1]</xref>. Oxytocin is made in
                about 9,000 magnocellular neurons, each of which sends a single axon to the
                posterior pituitary, where it gives rise to about 2000 neurosecretory varicosities.
                From these varicosities, large vesicles that contain oxytocin are secreted by
                exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Nordmann1">[2]</xref> in response to action potentials (spikes), propagated
                down the axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Leng1">[3]</xref>. Normally, oxytocin cells discharge asynchronously at
                1–3 spikes/s, but during suckling, every 5 min or so, they all discharge a
                brief burst of spikes (50–150 spikes in 1–3 s) that releases a
                pulse of oxytocin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Hatton1">[4]</xref>; this pulse, travelling in the systemic
                circulation, causes cells of the mammary gland to release milk into a collecting
                duct from which it is extracted by suckling.</p><p>In lactating rats, the background activity of oxytocin cells is like that in
                non-lactating rats; the cells fire slowly, asynchronously and nearly randomly.
                Suckling produces little change in this except that slow firing cells tend to speed
                up slightly, while faster firing neurons slow down. After a few minutes, the first
                bursts occur; these are small and involve only some cells, but progressively more
                cells are recruited until all show intense bursts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Belin1">[5]</xref>. Bursts are elicited by
                suckling, but not by most other stimuli; for example, systemic injections of
                cholecystokinin produce an increase in electrical activity that is identical in
                lactating and non-lactating rats, and which consists of a steady increase in firing
                rate that persists for 10–15 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Leng2">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Milk-ejection bursts vary in size from cell to cell and according to the strength of
                the suckling, but are consistent in their overall shape, especially from one burst
                to the next in any given cell. These features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Lincoln1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Wakerley1">[8]</xref> led to the belief that
                bursting reflects mechanisms intrinsic to oxytocin cells, but these mechanisms have
                proved elusive. Whole-organ cultures of neonatal rat hypothalamus display networks
                of oxytocin cells that burst periodically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Jourdain1">[9]</xref>; these bursts are
                synchronized, but inter-burst activity also shows high levels of synchrony, unlike
                    <italic>in vivo</italic> observations, and the bursts are generally longer and
                less intense than milk-ejection bursts. Oxytocin cells in slice preparations also
                display bursts when maintained in low extracellular
                [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and exposed to phenylephrine, but these
                are not synchronized, and are less intense than milk-ejection bursts <italic>in vivo</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Wang1">[10]</xref>. With
                these partial exceptions, <italic>in vitro</italic> preparations have not reproduced
                the bursting seen <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating that it depends on unknown
                features of the suckling input.</p><p>The two supraoptic nuclei contain about 2000 of these oxytocin cells and (in virgin
                rats) about 3.2 ng of oxytocin, about 95% of which is in the dendrites
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Nordmann2">[11]</xref>. Oxytocin cells have 2–5 dendrites, several
                hundred micrometres long, which are filled with neurosecretory vesicles that can
                also be released by exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Pow1">[12]</xref>. In a virgin rat, each cell has &gt;10,000
                vesicles in its dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Pow1">[12]</xref>, each vesicle containing ∼85,000
                molecules of oxytocin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Nordmann2">[11]</xref>, and in lactating rats, oxytocin synthesis is
                further elevated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Russell1">[13]</xref>. The cells intercommunicate within
                “bundles” of 3–8 dendrites; in lactating rats, these
                bundles are encapsulated by glial processes, but within a bundle the dendrites are
                directly apposed to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Hatton1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Theodosis1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Catheline1">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Dendritic oxytocin release in basal conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> is not much
                influenced by spike activity, but can be evoked by stimuli that mobilize
                intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Ludwig1">[16]</xref>. When
                oxytocin is released, it acts at high-affinity receptors on the dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-FreundMercier1">[17]</xref>
                to depolarize oxytocin cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Wang2">[18]</xref>; it also mobilizes Ca<sup>2+</sup> from
                intracellular stores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Lambert1">[19]</xref>, which promotes the further release of oxytocin
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Moos1">[20]</xref>.
                The mobilisation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> has another important consequence: it
                can “prime” the dendritic stores of oxytocin, making them
                available for subsequent activity-dependent release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Ludwig2">[21]</xref>. We have suggested that
                the suckling input might prime the dendritic stores of oxytocin, making them
                available for activity-dependent release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Ludwig2">[21]</xref>, and that this is
                essential for bursting. During suckling, dendritic oxytocin release is detected
                    <italic>before</italic> any increase in the electrical activity of oxytocin
                cells, and before any increase in pituitary secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Moos2">[22]</xref>. Central injections of
                oxytocin facilitate bursting in the presence of suckling, but are ineffective in its
                absence; conversely, local injections of oxytocin antagonists block suckling-induced
                bursting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Lambert2">[23]</xref>. Oxytocin cells also modulate afferent inputs via the
                production of endocannabinoids (and other substances), which inhibit excitatory
                inputs presynaptically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Hirasawa1">[24]</xref>, and oxytocin suppresses inhibitory inputs by
                attenuating the effects of GABA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Brussaard1">[25]</xref>. Oxytocin also acts on glial cells to promote
                morphological reorganization that facilitates dendro-dendritic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Theodosis1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Catheline1">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Here we show that bursting can arise as an emergent property of a model network
                constructed to incorporate the observations summarized above.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Model</title><p>Each model neuron is a modified leaky integrate-and-fire model subject to stochastic
                excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. The modifications include a post
                spike relative refractoriness that mimics the hyperpolarising afterpotential (HAP)
                that follows single spikes in oxytocin cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Bourque1">[26]</xref>. This is modelled as a
                transient rise in spike threshold, and reproduces the distribution of interspike
                intervals <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is largely determined by the HAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Leng3">[27]</xref>. Another
                modification mimics the effect of a slower activity-dependent afterhyperpolarisation
                (AHP); this sustains a prolonged reduction in excitability after intense activation,
                and is enhanced in oxytocin cells in lactation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Teruyama1">[28]</xref>. In the model,
                dendritic release is coupled to spike activity non-linearly; oxytocin secretion from
                the pituitary is non-linear in that there is a marked facilitation of secretion at
                high spike frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Cazalis1">[29]</xref>, and we assume that dendritic release is
                similarly facilitated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-DiScalaGuenot1">[30]</xref>. Dendro-dendritic interactions are modelled by
                elements that mimic the excitatory actions of oxytocin (implemented as an
                activity-dependent reduction in spike threshold) and the autocrine effects of
                endocannabinoids which feed back to modulate synaptic input rates.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Network Topology</title><p>A key element of our model is the topology of network connections, which differs

                    shows such a matrix for a network of 48 neurons and 12 bundles. We considered
                    two procedures in order to assign dendrites to bundles. In both cases, for a
                    network of <italic>n</italic> neurons, and a given integer
                    <italic>d</italic>&gt;0, we start with an empty adjacency matrix of

                    follows. The index of the first bundle <italic>i</italic><sub>1</sub> is
                    selected uniformly at random in the set
                    {1,2,…,<italic>n<sub>b</sub></italic>}, the second index is selected
                    uniformly at random in the set
                            {1,2,…,<italic>n<sub>b</sub></italic>}/{<italic>i<sub>1</sub></italic>},
                    ensuring that no neuron has two dendrites in the same bundle. For the first
                    procedure, this selection is repeated for all neurons, leading to a completely
                    random allocation of dendrites into bundles. There is a finite probability that
                    some bundles are never selected, and these are removed from the network. In the
                    second procedure, we keep track of the number of dendrites in each bundle and,
                    once one bundle contains <italic>d</italic> dendrites, this is excluded from
                    further selection. This we refer to as a “homogeneous arrangement of
                    the connections” as each of the <italic>n<sub>b</sub></italic> bundles
                    contains the same number of dendrites.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000123-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000123.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structure of the Model Network.</title><p>(A)Schematic diagram of the organization of the oxytocin network; the

                        This profile is essentially indistinguishable to burst profiles observed in

                        compared with that generated by the model (squares). In both cases,
                        histograms were constructed from spike activity between the bursts. The
                        individual distributions were normalized to the height of the mode and
                        averaged; bars are S.E.M. (C) Mean profiles of milk-ejection bursts from a

                        the effect on instantaneous frequency just before a burst, and it shows
                        that, in both real cells and model cells, most bursts begin with a slight
                        decrease in instantaneous firing rate. In the model this is because most
                        cells are usually follower cells - a burst has begun elsewhere, and the
                        first indication of this is a decrease in synaptic input as a result of the
                        inhibitory effects of cannabinoids. The bursts begin only when the
                        excitatory effect of oxytocin exceeds this.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000123.g003" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>The interspike interval histograms constructed between bursts match <italic>in

                for the background stochastic activity of the oxytocin cells, as well as bursting
                activity. Normally, all cells participate in the reflex in the model, with bursts
                approximately synchronized through the population. The mean variation in burst onset
                is 204±14 ms (mean±S.E. of 17 bursts), close to measurements

                period of silence <italic>preceding</italic> many bursts; this feature mainly
                reflects the inhibitory actions of endocannabinoids; in the model, endocannabinoids
                released from the first cells that display a burst can suppress synaptic input
                enough to cause a brief inhibition in other oxytocin cells before they are activated
                by oxytocin release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000123-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).

                does not abolish bursting, and has little effect on the timing of bursts (data not
                shown), as it activated relatively little at the background firing rates. The HAP
                mechanism does affect the timing of bursts as it limits the occurrence of short
                interspike intervals; as an increase in the frequency of short intervals increases
                the rate of depletion of dendritic oxytocin but also increases the frequency of
                events that can trigger a burst, the effects of changing the HAP are complex. In the
                model the HAP was fixed to provide a good match to the interburst interspike
                interval distribution, and so the effects of varying this were not studied
                systematically. As well as an HAP, some oxytocin cells show a depolarising
                afterpotential, which may further facilitate bursting; in the present model we have
                neglected this as it is present in only a minority of oxytocin cells, and has no
                clear contribution to background firing patterns <italic>in vivo</italic>

                    consequence of the suppression of afferent input as a result of endocannabinoid
                    release. This stops the release from becoming regenerative, and allows the
                    stores to increase further. In this phase, the network activity becomes more
                    irregular because of the opposing feedback mechanisms: local activity-dependent
                    excitation through the effects of dendritic oxytocin release, and inhibition due

                    of a model neuron in absence of suckling input; in this case, cells increase
                    their mean firing rate more strongly in response to an increase of the
                    excitatory input. In the model, during suckling, neurons that are strongly
                    excited produce endocannabinoids that reduce the overall input level. This
                    negative feedback defends the system from over-excitation, and maintains the
                    network activity in an optimal range for bursting. This is an important feature,
                    because bursting in the model is possible only within a range of values of
                    excitatory input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000123-g009">Fig. 9C</xref>).
                    The exact range depends on the strength of the coupling between spike activity
                    and dendritic secretion (as measured by the frequency threshold for release

                    At a low level of excitation, an increase in the excitatory rate favours
                    bursting by increasing the frequency of release episodes which can trigger a
                    burst. However, beyond a critical level, release events may be so frequent that
                    stores are not replenished fast enough to reach the critical level required to
                    trigger a burst. Under such conditions, bursts become rarer and less
                    predictable, until eventually over-excitation disrupts the reflex.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000123-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000123.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Effect of Suckling on Electrical Activity of Model Cells A and B.</title><p>In the model, suckling results in activity-dependent retrograde
                            inhibition of the synaptic inputs. Accordingly, as synaptic input level
                            increases, electrical activity increases faster in the absence of
                            suckling than in its presence. (A) The blue squares show the mean firing
                            rate of model cells with normal network interaction (i.e. with suckling
                            input), as a function of the mean synaptic input rate. The red diamonds
                            show the behaviour in the same conditions but without suckling. The
                            inhibitory input is fixed at 80 Hz. Thus in the model, suckling reduces
                            the background activity of the fastest firing cells. (B) As in (A), but
                            plotting the coefficient of variation (CV) of the interspike intervals
                            (SD (interval)/mean (interval)). This standard measure of the
                            irregularity of firing shows that the model cells fire more regularly as
                            the mean level of synaptic input increases. The effect of suckling is to
                            increase the irregularity of firing of neurons, mainly by reducing the
                            firing rate of the fastest cells. (C) In the model, during suckling, the
                            frequency of milk-ejection bursts is related to the average level of
                            synaptic input in a biphasic manner. At very low and at very high levels
                            of input, bursting will not occur. The frequency of bursts was obtained
                            by simulating the model at varying excitatory input rates and, also
                            shows the effect of altering the frequency threshold for dendritic
                            release: the higher the threshold, the fewer bursts will occur. (D) The
                            frequency of bursting depends on how homogeneous the background firing
                            rate of oxytocin cells is. Here, we looked at the effect of a spatially
                            inhomogeneous input on bursting frequency (mean of five trials of 50
                            min). Homogeneity is measured as the ratio of the SD of the synaptic
                            input rate over the mean. The bars are SD. (E)The effect of
                            endocannabinoids in the model is to increase the range of synaptic input
                            rates compatible with bursting, and to make the mean rate at which
                            bursts occur relatively independent of synaptic input rate within this
                            range. Here, this is illustrated by looking at the consequences of
                            removing the effect of endocannabinoids (no EC,
                            by = 0). This is true for all the
                            threshold values considered, the α setting panel shows the
                            comparison for the control case
                            (fth = 20 Hz).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000123.g009" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000123-g009">Fig. 9E</xref>,
                    the inhibitory effect of endocannabinoids reduces the likelihood of a burst
                    being triggered at low synaptic rates, but also reduces the rate of depletion of
                    dendritic oxytocin, thus increasing the probability of bursting at high synaptic
                    input rates. The overall effect is to increase the range of synaptic input rates
                    compatible with bursting, and to make the mean rate at which bursts occur
                    relatively independent of synaptic input rate within this range.</p><p>Spatial inhomogeneity in the stochastic input can also degrade the reflex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000123-g009">Fig. 9D</xref>). With increasing
                    spatial inhomogeneity, for a given average firing rate, there are more faster
                    firing cells, and also more slowly firing cells. The faster firing cells will
                    generate more short intervals – potential burst triggering events -
                    but those events will be less potent because of greater depletion of their
                    stores. For these events to trigger bursts, they must recruit responses from
                    other cells to which they are connected – but the slower firing cells
                    are less excitable (although they have higher store levels). The net result is
                    that bursts are triggered less often. Thus the system performs optimally when
                    the activity is relatively homogeneous between oxytocin cells, a conclusion
                    previously drawn from experimental studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Sabatier1">[33]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>During lactation, oxytocin is released in pulses following quasi-synchronous bursts
                of electrical activity in oxytocin cells. Here, we showed that such bursting can
                arise as an emergent property of a spiking neuronal network. Our model does not
                incorporate all elements of the physiology of oxytocin cells, but finds a minimalist
                representation congruent with physiological evidence to help identify the key
                processes. We suggest that, during lactation, the oxytocin system is organized as a
                network where neurons interact by dendritic release of oxytocin coupled non-linearly
                to electrical activity. This requires a stimulus-dependent process of priming of the
                dendritic stores, whereby these are made available for activity-dependent release.
                Dendritic release of oxytocin occurs only when the neuron's firing rate is
                sufficiently large, so interactions between neurons are rare and erratic between
                bursts and in the absence of the suckling stimulus, leading to asynchronous spiking
                except during the bursts themselves; the network is essentially thus a pulse-coupled
                network.</p><p>The most distinctive features of our model are the increase of excitability as a
                consequence of priming, and the inhibition following the bursts; the inhibition is
                attributed here to endocannabinoids, but is also due in part to other retrograde
                messengers. Dendritic peptide release, which is likely to occur widely throughout
                the brain, is a key feature in the control of information transfer in neural
                networks, through cross-talk and autocontrol by paracrine/autocrine mechanisms.</p><p>Peptides are a large and diverse class of signalling molecules, and many different
                peptides are expressed in different neuronal populations. It has been argued
                elsewhere that some peptide signals are ‘broadcast’ throughout
                the brain by diffusional “volume transmission”, rather than by
                temporally and spatially precise synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Leng4">[38]</xref>. Hypothalamic neurons
                which release the same hormone are generally ‘tied together’ by
                means of autoreceptors for the peptides they produce; thus small amounts of peptides
                released locally ‘bind’ a population of neurons into
                co-ordinated activity, allowing the population to develop a synchronous burst that
                can initiate a wave of secretion that travels to more distant sites in the brain.</p><p>In the present model, bursting arises as an emergent behaviour of a very sparsely
                connected population of neurons. Bursting can begin at any of many foci of neuronal
                interactions – within any of the dendritic bundles that link just a few of
                the neurons, from where it will spread rapidly through the remaining bundles.
                Bursting arises by a positive feedback mechanism through activity-dependent release
                of oxytocin, the magnitude of which is down-regulated after a burst (by depletion of
                a pool of releasable oxytocin); the core mechanism is thus analogous to a mechanism
                used in some other models of bursting – positive feedback followed by
                synaptic depression. The topology of the networks is very different – the
                present network is very sparsely connected compared to others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Tsodyks1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Wiedemann1">[40]</xref>),
                and the biological substrate is different – here the intercommunication is
                dendrodendritic rather than synaptic.</p><p>The model makes apparent sense of the role in the milk-ejection reflex of several
                biological phenomena. First, the afterhyperpolarisation, a slow activity dependent
                conductance, has a role only in shaping the burst profile; it contributes little to
                burst timing or to post-burst silences. Second, although the core mechanism inducing
                bursts is activity-dependent positive feedback, via release of oxytocin, negative
                feedbacks are also important. In the real system there are multiple negative
                feedback mechanisms involving several signalling molecules, here these are
                represented by only one – the production of endocannabinoids. In the
                model, endocannabinoid production is proportional to oxytocin release – a
                simplification, as the real determining factor is probably intracellular
                    [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Importantly, the dynamics of the
                effects of endocannabinoids differ from those of oxytocin, and the dual effects
                promote increased variability in firing rate as the system swings from excitation to
                inhibition. The “upswings” mean that, for a given mean firing
                rate, there are more clusters of short intervals towards the end of an interburst
                interval, and they are more likely to be correlated between neurons, making them
                more potent as potential burst-triggering events. At the same time, the depressive
                effects on firing rate means that at high synaptic input rates there is less
                depletion of the releasable pool of oxytocin. Accordingly, the rate at which bursts
                arise is relatively independent of synaptic input rate over a reasonably wide range.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Bursting, Spiking, and Multiscale Dynamics</title><p>Whereas neurons exchange information mostly via spikes, endocrine cells rely on
                    hormonal pulses to signal to their target tissues. For many neurons, clustered
                    spike activity can be optimally effective in inducing the required changes on
                    the targets, but for endocrine cells to generate a signal large enough to be
                    read at a distance, their secretory activity must not only be optimal for each
                    cell, their activity must also be co-ordinated; hence peptide hormone signals
                    are generally pulsatile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Leng5">[41]</xref>. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
                    neurons also display synchronised bursts, possibly as a result of direct
                    positive feedback from GnRH release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Khadra1">[42]</xref>. Neuroendocrine
                    cells are perhaps a special case in generating a classical hormone signal by
                    co-ordinated electrical activity. However, many populations of neurons in the
                    brain produce a peptide product as well as a conventional transmitter, and many
                    of these peptides have effects on organismal behaviour that are hormone-like
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-FreundMercier1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000123-Leng6">[43]</xref>, in that they act at
                    dispersed and often distant targets to produce prolonged organisational changes.
                    For a hormone-like, pulsatile signal to be produced reliably, the activity of a
                    population of peptide-secreting neurons must be co-ordinated in a
                    physiologically plastic manner. Such co-ordinated signals, coming from the
                    individual nodes of an interactive network, must emerge from the dynamics at the
                    lower level of organization (for the neuron case, from the dynamics of
                    stochastic ionic channels coupled via the membrane potential). In the present

                    the level of spike output, and its main strength is the simplicity of the
                    representation of a single neuron; this makes it feasible to use the model to
                    explore how properties of the network (connectivity and dynamics of
                    intercommunication) affect the system behaviour. We believe that the
                    simplifications are unlikely to have had any major influence, with two possible
                    exceptions. First, we have not included intracellular
                        [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] as a variable, although
                    mobilisation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can trigger dendritic
                    oxytocin release, and therefore probably contributes to the central oxytocin
                    release during milk-ejection. Implicitly we have assumed that this overlaps with
                    activity-induced oxytocin release and can be neglected, but it is possible that
                    in some circumstances oxytocin release triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup>
                    release from intracellular stores might precipitate a burst. Second, we modelled
                    dendritic release as a relatively common deterministic event – small
                    packets released fairly frequently. Dendritic release probably involves the
                    relatively rare exocytosis of large vesicles that each contains a very large
                    amount of oxytocin – and release is likely to be highly stochastic,
                    with interval length governing the probability of release rather than
                    determining it. Whether this will affect the model behaviour substantially
