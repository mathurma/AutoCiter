Since the vinculin binding (VB) sites are buried in the talin rod under equilibrium conditions, the structural mechanism of how vinculin binding to talin is force-activated remains unknown. Taken together with experimental data, a biphasic vinculin binding model, as derived from steered molecular dynamics, provides high resolution structural insights how tensile mechanical force applied to the talin rod fragment (residues 486–889 constituting helices H1–H12) might activate the VB sites. Fragmentation of the rod into three helix subbundles is prerequisite to the sequential exposure of VB helices to water. Finally, unfolding of a VB helix into a completely stretched polypeptide might inhibit further binding of vinculin. The first events in fracturing the H1–H12 rods of talin1 and talin2 in subbundles are similar. The proposed force-activated α-helix swapping mechanism by which vinculin binding sites in talin rods are exposed works distinctly different from that of other force-activated bonds, including catch bonds.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>For cell survival, most eukaryotic cells need to be mechanically anchored to their environment. This is done by transmembrane proteins, including integrins, which externally bind to the extracellular matrix and on the cell interior to the contractile cytoskeleton via scaffolding proteins. One essential scaffolding protein is talin, which binds to integrins via its head and to the cytoskeletal filament f-actin via its rodlike tail. As cells apply tensile forces to newly formed adhesion sites, proteins that are part of such force-bearing networks get stretched and might change their structure and thus function. One of many proteins that are recruited to newly formed adhesions is vinculin, and vinculin recruitment is upregulated by tensile mechanical force—but how? Since talin's vinculin binding sites are buried in its native structure, we used steered molecular dynamics here to derive a high resolution structural model of how tensile mechanical forces might activate talin's vinculin binding sites. Once tensile forces break up the talin rod into helix subbundles, an event that we find here to constitute the main energy barrier, we propose how the strain-induced gradual exposure of the vinculin-binding helices finally allows for their activation and enables helix swapping with the vinculin head.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the ETH Zurich, Swiss National Fond (2-77088-07), a postdoctoral fellowship from the Academy of Finland (VPH, project 109425), as well as the generous computational resources obtained from CSCS (Alps project) and ETH Zurich.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Hytönen VP, Vogel V (2008) How force might activate talin's vinculin binding sites: SMD reveals a structural mechanism.

Only talin, but not vinculin or paxillin, is recruited to the clustered integrins, if β3 integrins are activated not by ligand binding but by manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>), i.e., in cases where integrin activation occurs without the application of force and integrin is thus not part of a force-bearing protein network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b014">14</xref>]. Indeed, the recruitment of vinculin to cell adhesion sites has been shown to be force-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b019">19</xref>]. Vinculin recruitment strengthens cell adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b020">20</xref>], and reduces focal adhesion turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b021">21</xref>]. In focal adhesions, vinculin is in an activated state while it is autoinhibited in the surrounding cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b022">22</xref>]. Important to the model proposed here is that vinculin activation can also be induced in solution by isolated talin peptides containing VBSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b023">23</xref>].</p><p>As talin, vinculin is an alpha-helical protein sharing considerable structural similarity. The x-ray structure of full-length vinculin [PDB: 1TR2] reveals three head domains, V<sub>H</sub>, V<sub>H</sub>2, and V<sub>H</sub>3, that are connected to the tail domains, V<sub>T</sub>2 and V<sub>T</sub>, via a flexible, proline-rich linker. Vinculin's talin binding site is located in the V<sub>H</sub> head domain, which is composed of two four-helix bundles sharing one helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b024">24</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Since V<sub>H</sub> can bind to V<sub>T</sub>, thereby confining the molecule to an autoinhibitory closed conformation, vinculin activation is needed to increase its affinity to talin and actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b026">26</xref>].</p><p>While it was suggested that vinculin recruitment to focal adhesions is force-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b019">19</xref>], no high resolution structural mechanism has been derived experimentally by how force can activate talin's buried vinculin binding sites. What is known, however, is that fragmentation of the talin rod into smaller isolated helix bundles can activate talin's VBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b027">27</xref>], and that point mutations that destabilize helix-helix interactions can have a similar activating effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b027">27</xref>]. Finally, vinculin binding to talin's VBS can cause significant loss of secondary structure of the adjacent non-VB-helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b029">29</xref>]. Alternatively, it has been hypothesized that binding of PIP2 lipids to the talin rod may also lead to the activation of VB sites as the presence of PIP2 slightly increased the binding of vinculin to talin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b030">30</xref>]. No mechanism has been suggested though how activation by PIP2 could directly explain force-upregulated vinculin recruitment to newly formed cell adhesion sites.</p><p>To establish a potential mechanism of force-regulated activation of talin's VBSs, we used steered molecular dynamics (SMD) to study the force-induced conformational changes in the N-terminal talin rod fragment H1–H12 (a model created by merging two experimentally determined overlapping structures covering residues 486–889 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b028">28</xref>]). This computational method is valuable since no experimental techniques are available to obtain high resolution information how the structure of proteins is changed when they are mechanically stretched. Access to such information is essential to learn how force might activate proteins by switching their structure-function relation (as reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b032">32</xref>]). Therefore, known equilibrium structures of the talin rod were solvated here computationally in a box filled with explicit water molecules. Conducting the simulations in the presence of explicit water rather than in an unstructured dielectric medium is important, since the access of free water molecules to often buried force-bearing hydrogen bonds or salt bridges can regulate mechanical stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b034">34</xref>]. After equilibration for 1 ns, constant force was applied to either the termini of the rod fragment, or alternatively to putative force-bearing interfaces which might stabilize this rod fragment in the intact talin molecule. We then characterized the structural changes that lead to the sequential exposure of the vinculin binding sites. A mechanism of how stretching of the talin rod might activate vinculin binding is proposed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Since the talin is anchored to integrins via the head domain, while actin binding sites exist downstream at the C-terminus of the H1–H12 bundle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), the force vector acting between the membrane-bound integrins and the cytoskeleton are likely transmitted through talin along the long axis of the H1–H12 rod. Unclear is, however, whether the force in full length talin acts directly on the two terminal atoms of the H1–H12 bundle, or given the tilt of the helices with respect to the long rod axis of talin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b029">29</xref>], whether it is distributed over force-bearing interfaces formed with the adjacent domains. The H1 helix might form a force-bearing interface with the talin head (the structure of the linker region connecting T<sub>H</sub> and T<sub>R</sub> is not known), while the H12 helix might be tightly packed against the rest of the structurally unresolved C-terminal talin rod (residues 890-2541). We thus conducted two sets of constant force simulations where the force is either applied locally to the two terminal Cα-atoms of the H1–H12 bundle, or is distributed along the length of the terminal helices, H1 and H12, to mimic the existence of such putative force-bearing interfaces. For both cases, we analyzed how stretching the talin rod with constant force would alter its structure. The little resistance to strainnig the bundle is due to the unfolding of secondary structure and leads to a rapid molecular extension with time. If a major energy barrier has to be overcome to allow the further unfolding of the rod, the protein domain will pause to extend as indicated by a plateau region in the extension-time plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g003">3</xref>). We thus asked how the structure of the H1–H12 bundle is changed with time as we pull on the rod with constant force, and whether one major event leads to the complete disintegration of the rod or whether <italic>intermediate states (I)</italic> exist separated by energy barriers. Please note that the lifetimes of intermediate states increase as the forces are lowered to physiologically relevant forces (for further discussion see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b036">36</xref>]). Due to limited computational resources, however, the simulations shown here can only be run for several nanoseconds and higher forces are required to trigger the events described. For other molecular systems, however, it has been shown that these constant force approaches can correctly predict the positions of major energy barriers along physiologically significant unfolding pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b038">38</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0040024-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0040024.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Sequential Unfolding Trajectories and Associated Structures of the Talin Rod H1–H12 Extended under Constant Force Applied to Terminal Cα-atoms</title><p>(A) Extension-time plots for different constant force pulls, from 100–400 pN.

The hydrophilic side chain in Thr772 attracts water molecules that enter the helix bundle cleft when the talin rod is strained.

We observed that the first split occurred between H1–H8 and H9–H12 (6 times in 7 simulations where constant force is applied over terminal helices), after which H1–H8 splits into H1–H5 and H6–H8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g005">5</xref>). In the other case observed only once in seven simulations, H1–H5 separated first followed by the H9–H12 separation. The break-up into these well-defined bundles as a major event is most clearly seen if the force is distributed over the terminal helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Once the force-bearing interfaces are broken apart, the bundles have no stabilizing effects upon each other any longer. Consequently, the force is thus transmitted at these later times through the N- and C-terminal atoms of the resulting helix bundles. We thus simulated separately the unfolding of the helix bundles H1–H9 (crystallographically determined structure of talin rod fragment, PDB 1SJ8), H2–H8 (intermediate found in terminal atom pulls), and H9–H12 (intermediate seen only in force-bearing interface simulations). The starting end-to-end distances of the terminal atoms of these helix bundles prior to stretching were 3.6 nm (H1–H9), 7.9 nm (H2–H8) and 1.5 nm (H9–H12). Most noticeable when looking at all their unfolding pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g005">Figure 5</xref>) is the lack of well pronounced plateaus and thus clearly distinguishable intermediate states, especially in the case of H9–H12.

The blue fluctuatuions represent bonds formed between H1–H5 and H6–H8, while the green represents bonds formed between H6–H8 and H9–H12. While most hydrogen bonds fluctuate between formation and breakage even during the equilibration, only a few of the side-chain hydrogen bonds, like the bond 2, are longer-lived. This, together with the fact that there appears to be considerable statistical variability in bond breaking events between different simulations suggests that at least most of these side-chain hydrogen bonds are not force-bearing. While it cannot be excluded that one or the other of these bonds slightly contributes to the mechanical stabilization, hydrophobic contacts between the helix bundles seem to play the dominant role in upregulating the mechanical stability of the N-terminal part of the talin rod.</p><p>A separate SMD analysis of the talin rod fragments H1–H5 was done recently by applying force to the polar side chains T498, S501 and S502 close to the N-terminus of H1 and Q635, Q646, E650, and Q653 close to the C-terminus of H5, assuming that the force-bearing interactions were mediated by side chain hydrogen bond formation across the interfaces of adjacent α-helix bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b041">41</xref>]. When using an implicit water model in which the protein structure was solvated in a dielectric medium, they observed a rotation of VBS1 (H4) under applied force and suggested this to be a potential activating mechanism. They also observed that the H4 rotation was strongly reduced when repeating the simulation in the presence of explicit water molecules (these computationally more elaborate conditions were used in our simulations as well). We thus analyzed for how long the polar side chains of H5 are hydrogen-bonded across the interface formed between H1–H5 and H6–H8. Our simulations of H1–H12 reveal that water penetrates into the interface H1–H5 and H6–H8, thus breaking these side-chain hydrogen bonds, even before we can see a major force-induced structural change within the H1–H5 bundle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040024-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Among the residues that were previously used to model the contact interface between bundles H1–H5 and H6–H8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b041">41</xref>], only residues Gln635 (bonded to Ser714) and Gln646 (bonded to Lys721) are hydrogen bonded across the interface, and those side-chain bonds show quite low stability during our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g004">Figures 4</xref>, bonds 6 and 14, and S3), suggesting that those polar residues are also not force-bearing during the activation process of the H4 helix.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Comparative Analysis of Talin1 and Talin2</title><p>To compare the mechanical properties of the talin1 and talin2 rods, H1–H12, we generated a homology model of talin2 based on the talin1 structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040024-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Homology modeling is a reasonable approach since their sequences are highly similar (74% identical) in this region. Furthermore, a sequence analysis of the hydrogen bonding partners when comparing talin1 and talin2 from human, mouse, and chicken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g004">Figure 4</xref>) revealed that 29 of the 43 residues participating in hydrogen bonds between helix bundles are fully conserved, eleven of the residues (Ser658, Ser688, Thr693, Thr720, Ser754, Gln755, Gln762, Arg765, Glu780, His788, Lys869) are similar and only three residues are non-conserved (Arg692, Ser752, Gly766) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040024-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The RMSD for backbone atoms after energy minimization and thermalization was 1.3 Å. Also for talin 2, the fragmentation of the rod H1–H12 constituted the major energy barrier as seen in constant force and constant velocity SMD simulations, in which the force was distributed over force-bearing interfaces. The split of the rod occurred in identical positions as described above for talin1, namely between the bundles H1–H5, H6–H8 and H9–H12. Also the sequence of early events was similar: First, the H9–H12 bundles separated, followed by the rupture of the H1–H8 fragment. Our simulations of early events further indicate that the major energy barrier of fragmenting the rod are not greatly different between the talin1 and talin2 rods, H1–H12, at least within the stochastic variability that is intrinsic to single molecule studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040024-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Forces and Timescale of Computer Simulations</title><p>Finally, it is important to note that the SMD simulations are carried out on time scales that differ significantly from those at which biological molecules are stressed.

Tight packing of helix bundles might thus prevent the gradual unraveling of terminal helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g003">Figure 3</xref>) as also observed for other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b042">42</xref>].

Consequently, the two vinculin binding helices H11 and H12 lose their secondary structure early in the unfolding trajectory and might be deactivated by stretching them into straightened polypeptide chains.

Our simulations further suggest that the H1–H12 bundle is mainly held together via hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g004">Figure 4</xref>), and that the mechanically more labile smaller α-helix bundles H1–H5, H6–H8, and H9–H12 are stabilized if the bundles are packed closely against each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g005">5</xref>). Our findings for the talin rod are consistent with simulations of the mechanical properties of other proteins.

This notion of a force-induced water exposure of the VB helices, once the talin rod has fragmented into smaller pieces, is consistent with experimental findings that the VBS can be exposed under equilibrium conditions, but only if point mutations destabilize the integrity of the talin rod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b027">27</xref>].

Starting with the first split where H1–H8 separates from the H9–H12 bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g003">Figure 3</xref>), we observe a significant decrease in the buried surface areas of the three VB helices (H6, H9, and H12), while the buried surface area of the VB helix H4 is decreasing only at later time points when helix bundle H1–H5 is fragmented into smaller pieces. Note that H6, H9 and H12 are located at the interfaces of the H1–H5, H6–H8 and H9–H12 bundles. Since H11 is buried in the interior of the subbundle, there is only a slight drop in the buried area observed during the simulated time frame.</p><p>Is the increased solvent exposure sufficient to activate the VBSs? Considerable experimental evidence has demonstrated that bundle fragmentation by clipping off helices can indeed expose the VB sites that are otherwise buried in the full length talin rod under equilibrium conditions. The isolated H1–H12 bundle shows a higher affinity to vinculin than does the full-length talin or talin rod domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b030">30</xref>], and mutations stabilizing the H9–H12 bundle result in decreased vinculin binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b030">30</xref>].

Taken together, these results support the model where the H9–H12 bundle is stabilized by the neighboring helices which bury the VB helices, H9, H11 and H12. Similar trends are seen for the VB helix H4.

The force-induced reduction in buried surface area has an energetic price: the free energy of the system increases proportional to the increase of the water accessible hydrophobic surface area of the VB helices. When an adequate increase in free energy is reached, the partially water-exposed, ‘activated' helix can thus spontaneously associate with the α-helix bundle of the vinculin head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g006">Figure 6</xref>) for thermodynamic reasons discussed below.

Force causes the breakage of the talin rod into helix sub-bundles, which constitutes the major energy barrier. The subbundles H1–H5, H6–H8, and H9–H12 differ in their mechanical stabilities leading to a hierarchal sequence in which they break apart. The forced unfolding pathway of the talin rod might be altered by interaction with other molecules, including PIP2 and vinculin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b030">30</xref>], or the potential the dimerization of talin.</p><p>(C) Activation of talin's VB helices: Continued talin extension causes sequential exposure of the VB helices to water and leads finally to a separation from their host bundles. While the buried surface area of the VB helices in unstrained talin is larger than if comlexed with vinculin, conformational strain gradually exposes their hydrophobic residues—once activated, they can form an energetically more favored complex with the unstrained vinculin head. In this schematic model, only one vinculin molecule is shown. Since there are multiple vinculin binding sites in talin, the number of exposed VB helices is dependent on the applied force and the force-exposure time of talin.</p><p>(D) Vinculin binding to talin is enabled by α-helix swapping: a water-exposed VB helix can minimize its free energy by associating with the α-helix bundle of the vinculin head thereby burying its VBSs from water.

It has thus been proposed earlier that once released from the hydrophibic core of the talin rod, the H4 (VBS1) and potentially the other VB helices are available to induce ‘bundle conversion' thereby displacing the intramolecular interaction of the vinculin head to its tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b048">48</xref>]. This suggestion was further supported by findings that vinculin can be activated by helical peptides that contain the VBSs, subsequently leading to an increased affinity of the vinculin tail to actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b023">23</xref>].</p><p>Following these earlier suggestions derived for unstrained systems, we now propose that the complementary design between the talin and vinculin structures facilitates <bold><italic>force-induced</italic></bold> α-helix swapping: the VB helices find a thermodynamically more stable environment in talin <italic>under equilibrium</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0040024-t001">Table 1</xref>), the biologically inactive state, but as soon as talin is sufficiently strained, the association with the unstrained vinculin head is energetically preferred once a collision has occurred and occurs upon a collision with the vinculin head. Vice versa, the vinculin head is thermodynamically less stable in the absence of a swapped talin helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b030">30</xref>] and thus forms the auto-inhibitory complex with its tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b026">26</xref>]. We further suggest a biphasic vinculin binding behavior: the maximum probability of the α-helix swapping is reached once the VB helix has broken away from the other talin helices and exposes the hydrophobic residues of the otherwise structurally intact VB helices to water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Once a VB helix is sufficiently stretched and starts to lose its secondary structure, helix swapping might again be inhibited.</p><p>Of major physiological importance is furthermore the insight that the talin rod is engineered such that the activation of vinculin binding is force <italic>and</italic> time dependent, thus acting as a hierarchical force-time integrator. Not all VB helices are activated at the same time since the VB helices are located in sub-bundles that break up sequentially due to their differential mechanical stabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g005">5</xref>). A hierarchy thus exists in which the VBSs are force-activated (as indicated by asterixes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g003">Figure 3</xref>D): the earliest to be exposed are the VB helices H6 and H12, which are located in the weakest helix bundle interface. The next to be exposed are the VB helices H9 and H11 located in the C-terminal H9–H12 bundle, and the last one is VB helix H4, which is located in the sub-bundle H1–H5. If the talin rod is kept under constant force, the number of VB helices that have been activated will initially increase with time and the amount of force applied. Once a vinculin complex has been formed during the lifetime of the activated helix, the complexed helix might be protected against complete unraveling due to the additional interactions formed between a VBH and the unstrained vinculin head. In contrast, when applying force to the terminal ends of H1–H12, the VB helices H11 and H12 lose already their secondary structure before the bundle is completely fractured, potentially leading to their early deactivation.</p><p>Vinculin recruitment to talin thus initially increases if talin is incorporated into a force-bearing network formed when a cell adheres to a surface or matrix fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b030">30</xref>]. However, since each VB helix has its unique biphasic time response, increased force thus accelerates the sequence of these events, but not necessarily the total number of activated VBSs at later time points, particularly at low vinculin concentrations.</p><p>The comparative analysis carried out here for the rod fragment H1–H12 of talin1 and talin2 shows that they share a similar sequence of early unfolding events that lead to the fragmentation of the N-terminal part of the talin rod.

While we do not see major changes between the mechanical stabilities of the H1–H12 fragments of two talins, i.e., in their likelihood of being fragmented by tensile force, it is important to note that the talin rod has six additional VBSs in the structurally unresolved C-terminus and that we do not have any information so far regarding the differential mechanical stresses to activate them (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0040024-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0040024-sg001">S1</xref>).

First of all, once an amphiphatic helix is broken off from a helix bundle by the application of tensile force, it might be stabilized by insertion into either hydrophobic pockets of other proteins or even into the lipid bilayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b027">27</xref>]. Alternatively, other proteins that form helix bundles might also bind vinculin in a force-regulated manner. α-actinin, for example, has also a VB helix that can form a similar structural complex with vinculin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b026">26</xref>]. Similarly to talin, the VBS in α-actinin is buried in the native structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b050">50</xref>]. Identifying the repertoire of mechanisms by which forces can upregulate adhesive interactions has led to the recent discovery of catch bonds where a receptor-ligand interaction is enhanced when tensile mechanical force is applied between a receptor and its ligand (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b052">52</xref>]). In contrast, the force-activated helix swapping mechanism proposed here requires that the force is applied to just one of the binding partners, thereby activating bond formation with a free ligand. Also in contrast to catch bonds, the ligand does not necessarily have to be part of the force-bearing protein network at the time the swap is initiated. While force-induced helix swapping thus primarily upregulates the bond formation rate, the catch bond mechanism primarily extends the lifetime of an already existing complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Starting structures.</title><p>The talin rod domain H1–H12 (residues 486–889) of mouse talin was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pdb.org/</ext-link> [PDB theoretical models section: 1XWX]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0040024-b028">28</xref>].
