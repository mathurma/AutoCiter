<abstract>
<p>AGGF1 is an angiogenic factor with therapeutic potential to treat coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). However, the underlying mechanism for AGGF1-mediated therapeutic angiogenesis is unknown. Here, we show for the first time that AGGF1 activates autophagy, a housekeeping catabolic cellular process, in endothelial cells (ECs), HL1, H9C2, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Studies with <italic>Atg5</italic> small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and chloroquine demonstrate that autophagy is required for AGGF1-mediated EC proliferation, migration, capillary tube formation, and aortic ring-based angiogenesis. <italic>Aggf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> knockout (KO) mice show reduced autophagy, which was associated with inhibition of angiogenesis, larger infarct areas, and contractile dysfunction after MI. Protein therapy with AGGF1 leads to robust recovery of myocardial function and contraction with increased survival, increased ejection fraction, reduction of infarct areas, and inhibition of cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis by promoting therapeutic angiogenesis in mice with MI. Inhibition of autophagy in mice by bafilomycin A1 or in <italic>Becn1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Atg5</italic> KO mice eliminates AGGF1-mediated angiogenesis and therapeutic actions, indicating that autophagy acts upstream of and is essential for angiogenesis. Mechanistically, AGGF1 initiates autophagy by activating JNK, which leads to activation of Vps34 lipid kinase and the assembly of Becn1-Vps34-Atg14 complex involved in the initiation of autophagy. Our data demonstrate that (1) autophagy is essential for effective therapeutic angiogenesis to treat CAD and MI; (2) AGGF1 is critical to induction of autophagy; and (3) AGGF1 is a novel agent for treatment of CAD and MI. Our data suggest that maintaining or increasing autophagy is a highly innovative strategy to robustly boost the efficacy of therapeutic angiogenesis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Coronary artery disease is the number one killer disease worldwide. Recently, therapeutic angiogenesis has been proposed as an attractive new strategy for treating this and other ischemic diseases. This study establishes the angiogenic factor AGGF1 as a novel target and agent that can successfully treat coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction and dramatically improve survival and cardiac function in mouse models. We present the unexpected finding that AGGF1 has these effects via activating autophagy, and that autophagy is essential for therapeutic angiogenesis in animals. We find that AGGF1 is a novel master regulator of autophagy not only in endothelial cells but also in all other cell types examined in the study. Mechanistically, AGGF1 activates autophagy by activating JNK, which leads to activation of the Vps34 lipid kinase and assembly of the Becn1-Vps34-Atg14 complex involved in the initiation of autophagy. The study thus provides a link connecting the therapeutic angiogenesis and autophagy pathways in heart disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>AGGF1 is an <underline>A</underline>ngio<underline>g</underline>enic factor with a <underline>G</underline>-patch domain and a <underline>F</underline>orkhead-associated (FHA) domain. AGGF1 was initially identified by our laboratory through positional cloning analysis for a gene involved in development of Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome (KTS), a congenital vascular disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref001">1</xref>]. AGGF1 can induce angiogenesis and excessive angiogenesis, and increased AGGF1 expression is a cause of KTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref005">5</xref>]. We and others have also found that AGGF1 is critical to specification of veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref007">7</xref>], specification of multipotent hemangioblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref008">8</xref>], and anti-inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref009">9</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes remain to be fully defined.</p>
<p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) and its most severe manifestation, myocardial infarction (MI), are the most common causes of death worldwide. Therapeutic angiogenesis has been proposed as an attractive new strategy to treat CAD and MI patients. Therapeutic angiogenesis can be defined as the utilization of angiogenic growth factors to promote neovascularization and growth of collateral blood vessels, which act as endogenous bypass conduits to improve blood flow and increase tissue perfusion in the ischemic extremity. However, there is currently no United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic angiogenesis to treat CAD, MI, or other ischemic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref011">11</xref>]. Many challenges must be overcome before therapeutic angiogenesis becomes an applied patient therapy, including the critical identification of the most robust, effective angiogenic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref011">11</xref>]. Importantly, lack of understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic angiogenesis has slowed advances in this field.</p>
<p>Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved dynamic catabolic process that removes damaged, dysfunctional organelles and long-lived protein aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref012">12</xref>]. It recycles amino acids and other substrates for protein synthesis and ATP generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref012">12</xref>]. However, excessive autophagy can also lead to cell death. Autophagy is initiated by the formation of the phagophore; this process is mediated by the class III PI3-K complex consisting of Vps34, Vps15, Atg14, and beclin 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref012">12</xref>]. The phagophore then elongates and engulfs cytoplasmic materials targeted for degradation, leading to the formation of autophagosome. During this process, the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is cleaved and converted to LC3-I. LC3-1, the soluble form of LC3, is then activated and converted to LC3-II, which is the autophagic vesicle-associated form of LC3. The autophagosome is fused with the lysosome to form the autolysosome, which leads to degradation of the vesicle content by lysosomal hydrolases, recycling of the degraded products into amino acids and lipids, and generation of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that AGGF1 induces autophagy in endothelial cells (ECs) and all other cells analyzed as well as in mice with acute MI using a series of integrative in vitro and in vivo approaches. We show that an angiogenic factor can induce autophagy and that autophagy acts upstream of angiogenesis and is essential for therapeutic angiogenesis. We also demonstrate the robust potential of recombinant AGGF1 and AGGF1-mediated autophagy in therapeutic angiogenesis to treat acute MI.</p>

<title>AGGF1 Is a Universal Master Regulator of Autophagy</title>
<p>Because AGGF1 is an angiogenic factor, we focused our studies of AGGF1 on ECs. To identify the role of AGGF1 in regulating autophagy, we treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with different doses of AGGF1 and then analyzed expression levels of LC3-II and p62. AGGF1 strongly activated autophagy and the effect was concentration-dependent and saturable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). As a positive control, serum starvation induced the activation of autophagy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002529.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). To further demonstrate that AGGF1 induces autophagy, HUVECs were infected with a viral expression construct for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-LC3 for 24 h and then treated with AGGF1 or control Immunoglobin G (IgG). HUVECs with GFP punctuate (autophagic cells with autophagic vesicle-bound LC3-II) and overall GFP-staining were counted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The ratio of HUVECs with GFP punctuate was 31% ± 4% of the total GFP-positive cells with AGGF1 treatment but only 10% ± 2% for HUVECs incubated with IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Electronic microscopy directly demonstrated that AGGF1 induced formation of autophagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

<title>AGGF1-Induced Autophagy Is Required for Angiogenesis</title>
<p>To distinguish the cause–effect relationship between AGGF1-promoted autophagy and AGGF1-induced angiogenesis, we performed a series of studies with two inhibitors of autophagy, bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and chloroquine (CQ), and DMSO control. The effectiveness of Baf and CQ on inhibition of autophagy was verified by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002529.s005">S4 Fig</xref>).

<p>EC migration is also one of the key processes involved in angiogenesis. Wound-healing scratch assays for migration showed that AGGF1 treatment significantly induced HUVEC migration, but this effect was blocked by Baf or CQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Similarly, with Transwell migration assays, AGGF1 in the bottom chamber induced migration of 1.64-fold more HUVECs to the bottom of Transwells than IgG. However, this effect was blocked by Baf or CQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These data suggest that autophagy is required for AGGF1-mediated EC migration.</p>
<p>We also assessed the effect of autophagy on capillary tube formation mediated by AGGF1 using a matrigel-based angiogenesis assay. AGGF1 treatment increased the number of endothelial cell tubes, but this effect was blocked by Baf or CQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Moreover, using an <italic>ex vivo</italic> endothelial cell sprout assay from aortic rings, it is obvious that sprouts emerged from the aorta rings and grew outward after 4 d in culture with AGGF1 (500 ng/ml) (compare AGGF1 and IgG in the DMSO group, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).

<p>Cardiac apoptosis increases in response to MI and is responsible for myocardial fibrosis after MI. We assessed the cyto-protective activity of AGGF1 after MI by TUNEL staining of left ventricles.

<p>Cardiac apoptosis is a major cause of cardiac fibrosis.

AGGF1 protein therapy decreased MI-induced cardiac fibrosis and increased LV wall thickness (top panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002529.s014">S13 Fig</xref>). The size of cardiac fibrotic areas reflecting the size of the infarct areas was increased by MI, but AGGF1 treatment dramatically reduced the infarct size (22.54% ± 1.25% for AGGF1 treatment versus 50.94% ± 7.74% for IgG treatment, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) (bottom panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002529.s014">S13 Fig</xref>).

<p>To further confirm that AGGF1 inhibited myocardial apoptosis after MI, western blot analysis with myocardial lysates was performed for cleaved PARP, Bax, and Bcl-2.

<title>Autophagy Is Required for AGGF1-Mediated Angiogenesis and Cardiac Repair after MI: A Study with Autophagy-Deficient Becn1<sup>+/-</sup> Mice</title>
<p>To further test the hypothesis that autophagy is essential for AGGF1-mediated angiogenesis and recovery of myocardial function after MI, we assessed the effects of AGGF1 protein in an autophagy-compromised background in mice. Beclin 1, a mammalian homology of yeast Atg6/Vps30, is an initiator of autophagy and is required for autophagosome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref016">16</xref>].

<title>Molecular Signaling Pathway for AGGF1-Induced Autophagy</title>
<p>To identify the molecular signaling pathway for autophagy induced by AGGF1, we analyzed the activation/phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). AGGF1 markedly induced JNK activation in HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner, with peak effect at a dose of 500 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Moreover, AGGF1 induced phosphorylation of JNK in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Interestingly, as time increased, AGGF1-induced JNK phosphorylation increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Two different JNK inhibitors, JNK inhibitor II and JNK inhibitor III, blocked JNK activation by AGGF1. Consistent with this finding, AGGF1 increased the rate of autophagy as indicated by the increased level of LC3-II; however, the two JNK inhibitors inhibited autophagy induced by AGGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9C</xref>).</p>

<p>The Becn1-Vps34-Atg14L complex is involved in autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref012">12</xref>]. Since beclin 1 is required for autophagy by AGGF1 as shown in <italic>Becn1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> mice, we analyzed the effect of AGGF1 on the assembly of the Becn-1-Vps34-Atg14L complex. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that AGGF1 increased the complex formation between beclin 1 and Vps34 and between beclin 1 and Atg14L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). JNK inhibitor II reduced the complex formation among beclin 1, Vps34, and Atg14L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9D</xref>).</p>
<p>Vps34 is a class III PI3K and the activity (leading to PtdIns3P production) is required for autophagosome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref018">18</xref>]. Thus, we measured the activity of Vps34 lipid kinase. Compared with IgG, AGGF1 significantly increased the Vps34 lipid kinase activity as measured for conversion of PtdIns to PtdIns(3)P by an ELISA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). In the presence of JNK inhibitor II, the increased Vps34 PI3K activity by AGGF1 disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). Moreover, in an assay for Vps34 PI3K-dependent intracellular localization of a GFP-FYVE reporter protein, predominantly localized to membranes of endocytic compartments (the FYVE domain preferably binds to Ptdlns(3)P to other phosphoinositides), AGGF1 treatment increased the number of GFP-2-FYVE dots, an indication of increased Vsp34 PI3K activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9F</xref>). However, JNK inhibitor II significantly decreased the number of AGGF1-induced green GFP-2-FYVE dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9F</xref>).</p>
<p>The last step in autophagy is the degradation of autophagic cargos in the lysosomes. Autophagic cargos are mostly long-lived proteins, and their rate of degradation, an indicator for autophagic flux, can be measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref018">18</xref>]. AGGF1 significantly increased the degradation of long-lived proteins in HUVECs, and this effect was blocked with JNK inhibitor II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9G</xref>).</p>
<p>To further confirm the involvement of the JNK pathway in AGGF1-mediated autophagy, we used siRNA to knock expression of <italic>JNK1</italic> down and determine the effect of AGGF1 on activation of autophagy. AGGF1 failed to increase the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (activation of autophagy) when <italic>JNK1</italic> expression was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9H</xref>). <italic>JNK1</italic> knockdown also reduced the AGGF1-induced formation of the beclin1-Atg14L-VPS34 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9I</xref>). Combined with the data obtained on JNK inhibitors, these data demonstrate the involvement of the JNK pathway in AGGF-mediated autophagy.</p>
<p>Because Atg14L interacts with VPS34, we used siRNA to knock expression of <italic>Atg14L</italic> down and then determined the effect of AGGF1 on activation of autophagy. AGGF1 failed to increase the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (activation of autophagy) when <italic>Atg14L</italic> expression was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9J</xref>). <italic>Atg14L</italic> knockdown also reduced the AGGF1-induced formation of the beclin1-Atg14L-VPS34 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9K</xref>). After autophagy activation, DFCP1, an Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-residing PI3P binding molecule, is recruited to a membrane compartment related to autophagosome biogenesis. We found that the number of DFCP1-positive puncta was increased by AGGF1 treatment in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002529.s017">S16 Fig</xref>). Knockdown <italic>Atg14L</italic> significantly decreased the number of DFCP1 puncta and blocked the effect of AGGF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002529.s017">S16 Fig</xref>). These data suggest that AGGF1-induced PI-3K activation resulted in an increased level of PI3P, which was required for DFCP1 recruitment. As a whole, these data demonstrate that Atg14L is required for AGGF-mediated autophagy.</p>
<p>The above data suggest that AGGF1 induces phosphorylation/activation of JNK, which increases the activity of Vps34 and the assembly of the Becn-1-Vps34-Atg14L complex, resulting in the formation of autophagosomes and onset and completion of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that angiogenic factor AGGF1 can activate autophagy in ECs in vitro and in MI mice in vivo, thereby identifying a new and critical upstream regulator of autophagy. Interestingly, angiogenic factor AGGF1 has been found to induce autophagy during angiogenesis. First, we demonstrated that mice with acute MI (subject to LAD) showed an increased expression level of either <italic>AGGF1</italic> mRNA or protein, which was associated with up-regulated autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Second, autophagy was inhibited in heterozygous <italic>Aggf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Third, treatment of HUVECs with recombinant AGGF1 dramatically induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These data indicate that AGGF1 is a strong promoter for autophagy. Identification of the important role of an angiogenic factor in autophagy is a novel aspect of the study. The data also revealed a novel in vivo function for AGGF1 in the regulation of autophagy. Mechanistically, we found that AGGF1 activates autophagy by stimulating JNK activation. Two JNK inhibitors and <italic>JNK1</italic> siRNA blocked induction of autophagy by AGGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9</xref>). AGGF1-induced JNK activation increased the activity of Vps34 and facilitated co-assembly of the Becn-1-Vps34-Atg14L complex required for autophagy. Consistently, these functions were disrupted by JNK inhibitors and <italic>JNK1</italic> and <italic>Atg14L</italic> siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g009">Fig 9</xref>). We have previously reported that AGGF1 activates AKT to regulate specification of veins in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref006">6</xref>]. However, increased AKT activation was shown to inhibit autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref019">19</xref>]. Therefore, it is the AGGF1-JNK signaling pathway, not the AGGF1-AKT signaling pathway, that modulates autophagy. This conclusion is supported by a recent finding that activation of JNK1 by FGF18 induced autophagy in bone growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>During the initiation of autophagy, several other key modulators of the Becn-1-Vps34-Atg14L complex were identified, including Unc-51 Like Autophagy Activating Kinase 1 (ULK1) and Autophagy And Beclin 1 Regulator 1 (AMBRA1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref021">21</xref>]. Future studies may examine whether ULK1 or AMBRA1 affects the regulation of the complex of BECN-VPS34-Atg14 by the AGGF1-JNK pathway. Atg14L was shown to be a unique subunit of the autophagy-specific PI3K complex involved in autophagosome formation. Atg14L cooperated with the ER-resident Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein Receptor (SNARE) protein syntaxin 17 (STX17) to assemble autophagosome at ER-mitochondria contact sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref022">22</xref>]. It may be interesting to investigate whether AGGF1 modulates the Atg14L-STX17 interaction involved in autophagosome formation.</p>
<p>Another major novelty of this work involves the unexpected finding that autophagy is essential for therapeutic angiogenesis. The data in the present study demonstrated the essential role of autophagy in angiogenesis in vivo in mice. The molecular mechanism by which autophagy activates angiogenesis is unknown. One possible mechanism is that autophagy produces metabolites which are required for efficient EC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Recently, fatty acid carbons and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose" xlink:type="simple">deoxyribose</ext-link> nucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) synthesis were shown to be required for EC proliferation and vascular sprouting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, AGGF1 activates autophagy not only in ECs, but also in all cells examined, including cardiac cells HL1 and H9C2 cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). These data suggest that the AGGF1 has a much broader biological function. Because the function of AGGF1 is thought to be more related to angiogenesis, the present study focused exclusively on ECs. The dramatic therapeutic effects of AGGF1 on mice with CAD and MI may be related to the beneficial effects of AGGF1-activated autophagy not only in ECs, but also in cardiomyocytes and other cells. Future studies with EC-specific, cardiomyocyte-specific, and VSMC-specific knockout mice may distinguish specific roles of AGGF1 in ECs, cardiomyocytes, and other cells.</p>
<p>Autophagy occurs at a low basal level under physiological conditions in the heart and is up-regulated under ischemia/reperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref025">25</xref>]. The basal level of autophagy in the heart plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis; however, the role of increased autophagy in response to ischemia/reperfusion is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref012">12</xref>]. To date, it is not clear whether autophagy is protective (cell survival) or detrimental (cell death) to the heart during ischemia/reperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref025">25</xref>]. In some cases, up-regulation of autophagy was associated with a cardio-protective effect, but the cause–effect relationship was not conclusively demonstrated. In other cases, up-regulation of autophagy in response to ischemia/reperfusion was detrimental and exacerbated cardiomyocyte death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref012">12</xref>]. In this study, we provide evidence to demonstrate that autophagy is essential for functional recovery of the heart from acute MI in mice. Preconditioning of MI mice with autophagy inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine eliminated the therapeutic effects of AGGF1 protein on increased survival and improved myocardial contraction and recovery on cardiac structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Similarly, AGGF1 protein completely lost its therapeutic effects in autophagy-deficient mice (<italic>Becn1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> knockout mice and AAV9-CMV-Cre <italic>Atg5</italic> KO mice) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g008">8</xref>). These data suggest that autophagy plays a protective role under ischemia and is required for cardiac repair after acute MI. During the MI survival studies of <italic>Becn1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> knockout mice and AAV9-CMV-Cre <italic>Atg5</italic> KO mice, we made another interesting observation. Autophagy deficiency in <italic>Becn1</italic> KO and <italic>Atg5</italic> KO mice increased the survival of MI mice at the first 2 wk, but dramatically reduced MI survival starting after the first 2 wk (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g008">8</xref>). The data suggest that autophagy is protective to MI survival in the long run, and reduced autophagy leads to worsened survival. However, in the short run, autophagy may be damaging to MI survival, potentially due to strong stress response to ischemia. Instead, reduced autophagy leads to improved survival.</p>
<p>The use of angiogenic factors for generating new blood vessels from existing vasculature, i.e., therapeutic angiogenesis, has been proposed as an attractive strategy for treatment of CAD and MI patients. The VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factors) family of growth factors and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) are the widely studied angiogenic factors for therapeutic myocardial angiogenesis. For VEGF, the therapeutic dose was difficult to establish as lower doses did not show therapeutic effect, whereas high doses caused aberrant vascular growth and vascular permeability. For FGF2, long-term effects were not observed. We have found that vascular permeability increased in <italic>Aggf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> KO mice and AGGF1 administration blocked vascular permeability in mice. Therefore, AGGF1 protein therapy has a unique advantage for therapeutic angiogenesis over VEGFA. To date, no therapeutic angiogenesis treatment has been approved by the US FDA and many important issues must be resolved before therapeutic angiogenesis becomes a practical patient therapy. One solution is to identify other angiogenic factors to achieve robust therapeutic angiogenesis. In this study, we show that in a mouse model for acute MI, AGGF1 protein therapy significantly reduced mortality and dramatically improved overall cardiac function and myocardial contraction by inhibiting cardiac hypertrophy, reducing infarct size, and preventing cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g004">Fig 4</xref>). AGGF1 protein therapy enhanced myocardial angiogenesis in the mouse model for acute MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002529.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), an effect that is relevant to the dramatically improved myocardial function and contraction. Our data have demonstrated that angiogenic factor AGGF1 is a new growth factor with promising therapeutic potential in the treatment of CAD and acute MI.</p>
<p>One of the challenges for therapeutic angiogenesis is its efficacy. Considering the essential role of autophagy in therapeutic angiogenesis, maintaining autophagy is required for effective therapeutic angiogenesis, and increasing the levels of autophagy may be a potential strategy to robustly increase the efficacy of therapeutic angiogenesis. For example, utilization of pharmacological agents such as rapamycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref012">12</xref>] that increase autophagy may increase the efficacy of therapeutic angiogenesis for CAD and MI during AGGF1 protein therapy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that autophagy is essential for therapeutic angiogenesis, suggesting that manipulation of autophagy may serve as a potential strategy to robustly boost the efficacy of therapeutic angiogenic therapy for MI and other ischemic diseases. We show that AGGF1 activates autophagy, whereas haploinsufficiency of <italic>AGGF1</italic> inhibits autophagy. AGGF1 increases survival of mice with acute MI, reduces infarct areas, inhibits cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis, and leads to dramatic recovery of left ventricular function and myocardial contraction. Inhibition of autophagy by an autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 or in <italic>Becn1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Atg5</italic> KO mice with deficient autophagy eliminated all therapeutic effects of AGGF1. Together, these data uncover new fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy and therapeutic angiogenesis and provide a novel treatment strategy for CAD and MI, the leading causes of sudden death worldwide.</p>

<title>Cell Culture, Transfection, Autophagy Inhibitors, Antibodies, and Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in the EGM-2 medium containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and EGM-2 Single Quots (Lonza). A polyclonal antibody against AGGF1 was from Proteintech. Antibodies against CD31, LC3, p62, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax, phospho-JNK, total JNK, Vps34, Atg14L, beclin-1, and β-actin were from Cell Signaling. The antibody against cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was from Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Cardiac endothelial cells (ECs) were isolated from <italic>AGGF1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> or wild-type mice as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref026">26</xref>] and cultured as for HUVECs described above.</p>
<p>HUVECs were transfected with siRNA using the electroporation P5 Primary Cell Nucleofector Kits (Lonza). The transfection efficiency of siRNA was determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis of a target gene. Cells were discarded if contaminated by mycoplasma or other microorganisms.</p>
<p>HUVECs were treated with 25 μM chloroquine (Sigma) or 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) for 1 h before AGGF1 or IgG treatment. The dosage for autophagy inhibitors was as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

In brief, 4 wks after treatment, mice were anesthetized and left ventricles were dissected out for extraction of total proteins. Cultured HUVECs were washed three times with PBS and used for extraction of total proteins. Proteins were extracted on ice in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% DOC, 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM glycerophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 2.5 mM Na pyrophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). Extracted proteins were then mixed with reducing laemmLi sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with a primary antibody and appropriate secondary antibodies.

<title>Mouse Models for Myocardial Infarction and AGGF1 Protein Therapy</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6 mice were used for all studies. The <italic>Aggf1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> KO mice with a gene-trap allele were created by us. The autophagy-deficient <italic>Becn1</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> KO mice (<italic>Becn1</italic><sup><italic>tmeBlev</italic></sup>) were from the Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Atg5</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref031">31</xref>] were kindly provided by Dr. Noboru Mizushima at University of Tokyo, RIKEN BRC, and Dr. Quan Chen at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. To create <italic>Atg5</italic> KO in mice, <italic>Atg5</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> mice were anesthetized and injected with 0.2 ml of the adenovirus AAV9-GFP or AAV9-CMV-Cre (Vector Biolabs) into the left ventricular myocardium using a 35-gauge needle at multiple sites. Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Cleveland Clinic and the Ethics Committee on Animal Research of College of Life Science and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>The acute MI model was created by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref032">32</xref>] with male mice at the age of 10–12 wk (about 25 g). The mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and then intubated using a fine polyethylene cannula connected to a small animal ventilator. The body temperature of the mouse was monitored using a rectal sensor at all times during the surgical procedure and maintained by a heated surgical plate. After respiration of the mouse was controlled by the ventilator, a thoracotomy incision was made in the second intercostal space, and the heart was exteriorized out of the chest. The LAD coronary artery was ligated permanently with a 7–0 nonabsorbable surgical suture and the heart was then returned inside the chest. The chest wall was closed in layers and skin incision was closed by sutures. The mouse was then removed from the ventilator and kept warm in a cage at 37°C overnight. Sham-operated mice were subjected to the same surgical treatment, but the LAD was not ligated.</p>
<p>C57BL/6N mice were assessed for baseline cardiac function with echocardiography prior to surgery and then subjected to LAD ligation. One day after the surgery, each animal was examined with echocardiography to confirm the success of the MI surgery. One week after the surgery, the mice were injected intravenously with AGGF1 (0.25 mg/kg body weight) or the same dose of nonimmune control IgG (0.25 mg/kg body weight, R&amp;D systems) twice a week for 2 wk or until death. The IgG was used as the control as reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref035">35</xref>] and was considered to be a better control than saline without any protein.</p>
<p>In the set of experiments for bafilomycin A1 (an autophagy inhibitor), we divided the mice that survived the LAD ligation procedure for 1 wk and were ensured to have successful MI by echocardiography into four groups: an IgG-treated group with vehicle pretreatment (IgG with 0.1% DMSO), an IgG-treated group with pretreatment with bafilomycin A1 (0.3 mg/kg body weight, Sigma), an AGGF1-treated group with vehicle pretreatment, and an AGGF1-treated group with pretreatment with bafilomycin A1. Bafilomycin A1 is a vascular H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor and a membrane-permeable lysosomal inhibitor that blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion to prevent the final digestion step in the process of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref036">36</xref>]. In these experiments, one day after surgery, the mice were assessed by echocardiography for the success of the MI procedure and then treated with bafilomycin A1 or vehicle control by daily intraperitoneal injection for 5 d. One week after the surgery, the AGGF1 protein or control IgG was then injected through tail vein twice a week for 2 wk. All mice were randomized in all experimental protocols.</p>

<title>Echocardiography</title>
<p>Echocardiography was performed with a Vevo 2100 High-Resolution Micro-Ultrasound System (Visual Sonics Inc., Toronto, Canada) at five different time points: pre-surgery, 1 d after LAD ligation and administration of AGGF1 protein or IgG (1 d), 1 wk, 2 wk, and 4 wk after the surgery to determine the baseline heart function and ventricular dimensions in different experimental groups of mice.</p>
<p>The mouse under study was anesthetized with 1% isoflurane, placed on a heat pad in the supine position, and kept at 37°C to minimize confounding of data by fluctuating body temperatures. Hairs were removed by depilatory cream on the left chest before echocardiography. A 30 MHz variable frequency transducer was used to capture two-dimensional echocardiographic images of the mid-ventricular short axis and parasternal long axes when the heart rate of the mouse was between 450 and 550 beats per minute. Echocardiographic analysis was performed with digital images using a standard formula as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref015">15</xref>].

<title>Immunohistological Analysis</title>
<p>Four weeks after AGGF1 or IgG treatment, mice were anesthetized, euthanized, and the hearts were excised and fixed overnight. The fixed hearts were sectioned and immunohistochemical staining was performed on paraffin-embedded sections with a primary antibody against AGGF1 or CD31, which was followed by incubation with a biotinylated secondary antibody as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref037">37</xref>]. The sections were then treated with peroxidase-conjugated biotin–avidin complex using VECTASTAIN ABC-AP and visualized by DAB. Slides were counterstained with H&amp;E staining.

<title>Myocardial Apoptosis</title>
<p>Myocardial apoptosis was measured first by the TUNEL assay (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Tdt)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref029">29</xref>]. Four weeks after treatments with AGGF1 or IgG control, mouse hearts were excised and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 μm-thickness sections and used for the TUNEL assay using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The images were visualized under a fluorescence microscope and captured. The border zone of fibrosis was examined carefully. More than five fields in three different sections were examined for each mouse by a researcher who was blinded to the treatments. The percentage of the number of TUNEL-positive cells over the total number of nuclei as determined by DAPI was calculated. Heart sections incubated with the label solution but without terminal transferase were used as negative controls. A TUNEL-positive control was included by incubating sections with DNase I (3000 U/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml BSA) for 15 min at 15–25°C to induce DNA strand breaks prior to the labeling procedure.</p>
<p>Myocardial apoptosis was also measured by the caspase-3 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref029">29</xref>]. We used a caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit and followed the manufacturer’s instruction (Promega). The absorbance of p-nitroaniline cleaved by caspase-3 was measured at 405 nm using FlexStation3. Data on the caspase-3 activity were standardized over the sham group and the fold change of the caspase-3 activity (relative caspase activity) was compared among different groups.</p>

<p>HUVECs were transfected with an overexpression plasmid for GFP-LC3B by nucleofection (Lonza). After 24 h of culture, HUVECs were treated with AGGF1 or control IgG for 12 h. Images were captured with a florescence microscope and analyzed for the ratio of green punctuate cells over all green cells with successful transfection. Autophagy was also monitored by electron microscopy as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref039">39</xref>].</p>

<title>Real-Time RT-PCR Analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells or mouse hearts using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. A total of 0.5 μg of RNA samples was reverse-transcribed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was then performed using the FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roch) and a 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (ABI) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002529.ref042">42</xref>].

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Two-group comparisons were analyzed by a Student’s <italic>t</italic> test or nonparametric Wilcoxon rank test whenever appropriate (e.g., when the sample size was small and/or the distribution was not normal). For comparisons of more than two groups, one-way ANOVA or the generalized linear regression approach was employed for normal distributions and the Kruskal Wallis test for non-normal or small samples. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple testing after the overall F or Kruskal Wallis test showed statistical significance. The extract testing was used when the sample size was small (e.g., when all group sizes were &lt;10). The survival curve analysis was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier product-limit approach and compared by the log-rank test. Statistical significance is indicated by * <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and ** <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01.</p>
