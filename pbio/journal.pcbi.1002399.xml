        <p>Alternans of cardiac action potential duration (APD) is a well-known arrhythmogenic mechanism which results from dynamical instabilities. The propensity to alternans is classically investigated by examining APD restitution and by deriving APD restitution slopes as predictive markers. However, experiments have shown that such markers are not always accurate for the prediction of alternans. Using a mathematical ventricular cell model known to exhibit unstable dynamics of both membrane potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling, we demonstrate that an accurate marker can be obtained by pacing at cycle lengths (CLs) varying randomly around a basic CL (BCL) and by evaluating the transfer function between the time series of CLs and APDs using an autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) model. The first pole of this transfer function corresponds to the eigenvalue (λ<sub>alt</sub>) of the dominant eigenmode of the cardiac system, which predicts that alternans occurs when λ<sub>alt</sub>≤−1. For different BCLs, control values of λ<sub>alt</sub> were obtained using eigenmode analysis and compared to the first pole of the transfer function estimated using ARMA model fitting in simulations of random pacing protocols. In all versions of the cell model, this pole provided an accurate estimation of λ<sub>alt</sub>. Furthermore, during slow ramp decreases of BCL or simulated drug application, this approach predicted the onset of alternans by extrapolating the time course of the estimated λ<sub>alt</sub>. In conclusion, stochastic pacing and ARMA model identification represents a novel approach to predict alternans without making any assumptions about its ionic mechanisms. It should therefore be applicable experimentally for any type of myocardial cell.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cardiac arrhythmias are frequent complications of heart disease and an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The rhythmic activity of the heart relies on the action potential, a bioelectrical signal characterized by complex dynamics involving ion currents and intracellular calcium cycling. When these dynamics become unstable, arrhythmogenic patterns can emerge. A typical example is the beat-to-beat alternation of action potential parameters, a phenomenon called alternans, which represents a well known mechanism precipitating severe arrhythmias. Alternans results from the interaction of action potentials during consecutive beats. Classically, this interaction is investigated by describing the dependence of action potential parameters on previous diastolic intervals and action potential durations. However, experiments have shown that quantitative markers derived in this way are only approximate or even inappropriate to predict alternans. Here, we devised a novel procedure for the reliable prediction of alternans, based on introducing small random variations of pacing intervals followed by signal processing in the frequency domain. Using a biophysical model of the cardiac cell, we demonstrate that our algorithm accurately predicts the onset of alternans during pacing at an accelerating rate or during the application of a drug. Our approach may thus open new perspectives for the clinical evaluation of arrhythmias.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In cardiac physiology, alternans designates the alternation of action potential (AP) parameters (e.g., AP duration (APD), calcium transient) from beat to beat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Lewis1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Weiss1">[2]</xref>. It leads to dispersion of refractoriness and represents a well established mechanism of conduction block and thus of severe reentrant arrhythmias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Pastore1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Klber1">[4]</xref>. At the cellular level, alternans results from complex dynamic interactions between membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>), ion currents and intracellular calcium cycling, which can together lead to different types of dynamical instabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Weiss1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Chialvo1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Sato1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The classical understanding of the genesis of alternans is based on the concepts of restitution functions and iterated map models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Chialvo1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Nolasco1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Qu1">[11]</xref>. In the classical theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Chialvo1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Nolasco1">[9]</xref>, the relation between APD and the previous DI is first characterized by the APD restitution function <italic>f</italic> as APD = <italic>f</italic>(DI). During pacing at a given basic cycle length (BCL), the next DI can then be inferred as BCL–APD and the next APD mapped using <italic>f</italic>. By iteration, successive APDs and DIs can be reconstructed. The steady state is determined by the intersection of the line APD = BCL – DI with <italic>f</italic>. If the slope of the restitution function α = d<italic>f</italic>/dDI is &lt;1 at this point, the system is stable, and if α&gt;1, the system is unstable. Because of the nonlinear nature of <italic>f</italic>, this instability results in alternans, period doubling cascades and chaos via a variety of dynamical routes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Guevara1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Hastings1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>However, it has been shown that the criterion α = 1 for the onset of alternans is only approximate or even inappropriate. Indeed, alternans can be present even if α&lt;1, or conversely, APD may not alternate although α&gt;1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cytrynbaum1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cram1">[18]</xref>. These discrepancies can be explained by the notion of “memory” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Chialvo1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cherry1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Elharrar1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cherry2">[23]</xref>, reflecting the fact that APD depends not only on the previous DI, but on several previous DIs and APDs. In multicellular tissue, these discrepancies can also be explained by the fact that electrotonic interactions and a steep conduction velocity restitution relation can further affect the APD restitution slope at which alternans occurs by exerting important stabilizing or destabilizing effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cytrynbaum1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cherry1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-deLange1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In experiments, restitution is conventionally investigated by pacing at steady-state and by introducing premature or delayed stimuli (S1S2 protocol, S1S2 restitution curves), or by decreasing BCL stepwise and examining steady-state APD vs. DI at the end of each step (dynamic restitution curves). Results at odds with the classical theory have then motivated researchers to develop refined pacing protocols and analyses incorporating the notion of memory to investigate alternans, such as the “perturbed downsweep protocol” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Tolkacheva1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Kalb1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Kalb2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Tolkacheva2">[25]</xref>. To untangle the effects of memory, recent studies used pacing protocols in which the DI is varied slowly in a sinusoidal manner, revealing hysteresis between APD and DI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Wu2">[26]</xref>, or in a random manner, minimizing the influence of previous APDs and DIs on the current pacing cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Wu1">[22]</xref>. With this latter protocol, it was also demonstrated using regression analysis that APD depends on the APDs and DIs during several previous cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Choi1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In mathematical cardiac cell models, seminal insights have been obtained using eigenmode analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Li1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Otani1">[29]</xref>, in which one considers the deviation of the time course of model parameters from their steady-state periodic time course during pacing at a given BCL. This deviation is then decomposed as a sum of eigenmodes associated to corresponding eigenvalues (λ). For every eigenmode, the time course of model variables is scaled by the corresponding λ after each pacing cycle. When |λ|&lt;1, the eigenmode is attenuated from beat to beat and eventually dissipates. In contrast, the eigenmode is amplified when |λ|&gt;1, which implies instability. When λ is a real number, the sign of λ associates the corresponding eigenmode with either memory (λ&gt;0, same polarity for every beat) or alternans (λ&lt;0, polarity changes every beat). Thus, at least in single cell models, eigenmode analysis formally defines the <italic>exact criterion</italic> for the onset of alternans as λ<sub>alt</sub> = min{Re(λ)} = −1. However, eigenmode analysis requires accessing the internal model variables and, therefore, it is not feasible experimentally. Thus, applications of eigenmode analysis have so far been limited to computer simulation studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Jordan1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Jordan2">[31]</xref> and no straightforward approach has been designed on this basis to predict alternans in an experimental setting.</p>
      <p>In previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-deLange1">[24]</xref>, we introduced the concept of cardiac tissue as a “filter” transforming an input (e.g., a series of pacing intervals varying stochastically) into an output (e.g., the series of APDs or DIs). We examined the filter characteristics in the frequency domain in terms of gain and phase shift using the transfer functions between the series of pacing intervals and the series of APDs (H<sub>t→a</sub>) and between the series of pacing intervals and the series of DIs (H<sub>t→d</sub>), respectively. In the present study, we developed a generalized framework for a straightforward and accurate prediction of alternans. We devised an approach permitting to quantify the eigenvalue λ<sub>alt</sub> and these transfer functions by using only experimentally measurable quantities (APD, DI) without the requirement to access internal model variables. The first step of this approach consists of using pacing intervals varying stochastically around a mean BCL. In the next step, the poles (including λ<sub>alt</sub>) and zeros of the transfer functions H<sub>t→a</sub> and H<sub>t→d</sub> are identified by fitting an autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) model to the recorded values of APD and DI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Ljung1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The power of this approach was evaluated in the cardiac cell model of Sato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Sato1">[8]</xref>. This model is formulated in three versions (based on different sets of model parameters) implementing the following mechanisms of alternans: 1) V<sub>m</sub>-driven (alternans attributable to the gating kinetics of membrane ion channels, with a steep APD restitution curve), 2) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven with positive Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling (large Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients generating longer APDs), and 3) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven with negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling (large Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients generating shorter APDs). In the latter two versions, alternans originates from an instability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling and occurs even in the presence of shallow APD restitution curves, thus reproducing recent experimental and theoretical findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Chudin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Diaz1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Shiferaw1">[33]</xref>. The three versions of the Sato et al. model thus offered the advantage to test our approach for three fundamentally different ionic mechanisms of alternans. For this purpose, we compared the marker λ<sub>alt</sub> obtained using ARMA model identification during stochastic pacing with the exact control value of λ<sub>alt</sub> derived using eigenmode analysis. Our results provide the proof of principle that the eigenvalue λ<sub>alt</sub> can be estimated from the time series of pacing cycle lengths, APDs and DIs, and thus that the criterion λ<sub>alt</sub> = −1 could be utilizable experimentally.</p>

        <p>We used the model of Sato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Sato1">[8]</xref>, who combined the Fox et al. canine ventricular myocyte model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Fox1">[34]</xref> with the model of intracellular cycling proposed by Shiferaw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Shiferaw1">[33]</xref>. As mentioned above, this model is formulated in three versions implementing different mechanisms of alternans, including alternans originating from an instability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling.</p>
        <p>The three different versions of the model were stimulated with 1-ms current pulses of 50 µA/µF as in the original study of Sato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Sato1">[8]</xref>, which corresponded approx. to 1.23 times diastolic threshold. Simulations were run with a constant time step of 0.005 ms. Gating variables were integrated using the method of Rush and Larsen and other model variables were integrated using the forward Euler method. Activation time was defined at depolarization to −35 mV and repolarization time at −85 mV, respectively. APD was defined as the interval between activation and repolarization times and corresponded approximately to APD at 92% of repolarization. Intervals between successive activations were equivalent to pacing intervals due to the short and quasi constant latency in response to stimulation.</p>

        <p>In all ionic cardiac cell models, including the Sato et al. model, the state of the cell at any time <italic>t</italic> is fully described by a vector <bold>v</bold> of <italic>N</italic> linearly independent variables (<italic>N</italic> = 16 in the Sato et al. model), and the temporal evolution of the model is described by d<bold>v</bold>/d<italic>t</italic>, which is defined as a function of <bold>v</bold>. <italic>N</italic> defines the order of the cell model.</p>
        <p>At a given basic cycle length (BCL), there exists a unique function that maps <bold>v</bold><italic><sub>i</sub></italic> (<bold>v</bold> at the onset of the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> stimulus) to <bold>v</bold><italic><sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub> (at the onset of the <italic>i</italic>+1<sup>th</sup> stimulus). At steady state, <bold>v</bold> maps onto itself, defining the steady state vector <bold>v</bold><sub>BCL</sub>. As shown by Li and Otani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Li1">[28]</xref>, the mapping function can be linearized near steady state as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002399.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where δ<bold>v</bold> = <bold>v</bold>−<bold>v</bold><sub>BCL</sub> is a small perturbation of <bold>v</bold><sub>BCL</sub> and <bold>J</bold> is the Jacobian matrix of this mapping.

          <title>Derivation of transfer functions</title>
          <p>To derive the transfer function between a time series of pacing cycles fluctuating around BCL and APD, we first need to define and compute a vector <bold>a</bold> that describes the deviation of the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> APD (<italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic>) from its steady state value (<italic>a</italic><sub>BCL</sub>) in response to a perturbation δ<bold>v</bold><italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, according to the inner product<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002399.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where the superscript <sup>T</sup> denotes transposition.

However, in a practical setting, only a restricted set of quantities are measurable, such as APD and DI.

          <p>It must however be noted that modern cardiac cell models always exhibit features with very short time scales (e.g., the gates of the Na<sup>+</sup> current) as well as features with considerably longer time scales (e.g., the filling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum with Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Thus, mathematically speaking, cellular models of cardiac electrical activity belong to the category of stiff systems, for which it is known that some components dissipate considerably faster than others. These rapidly dissipating components correspond to eigenmodes which have eigenvalues close to 0. It then appears likely that all these models will have only few significant eigenmodes. Indeed, in the Beeler-Reuter ventricular cell model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Beeler1">[36]</xref>, Li and Otani observed that a majority of eigenvalues lie close to 0 and they found only 2 significant eigenmodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Li1">[28]</xref>. Therefore, in practice, a majority of poles and zeros will lie close to 0 and will exert only insignificant influences on the transfer functions. Consequently, low values of <italic>M</italic>&lt;&lt;<italic>N</italic> with only a few coefficients α and β may suffice to describe the dynamic behavior of a given model.</p>

        <p>The time course with which the model stabilizes towards steady state can be inferred from λ<sub>mem</sub>.

        <p>In all versions of the model, S1S2 and dynamic restitution functions never overlapped. As shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Elharrar1">[19]</xref>, this absence of overlapping proves that APD depends on more parameters than the previous DI. In the V<sub>m</sub>-driven model, the S1S2 restitution curves formed the closest pattern gathered around the dynamic restitution curve, and the S1S2 restitution curves were always monotonically increasing. In contrast, in the two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven versions of the model, the S1S2 restitution curves deviated substantially from the dynamic restitution curve, especially at larger DIs. In the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven model with positive Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling, the prominent increase of APD at long DIs was the consequence of larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, resulting in AP prolongation. In the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven model with negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling, the S1S2 curves were non monotonic and each curve exhibited a segment with a negative slope. This phase of decreasing APD with increasing DI was the consequence of larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, resulting in this case in AP shortening.</p>
        <p>Cherry and Fenton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cherry2">[23]</xref> introduced the concept of “memory amplitude” as a measure of short term memory. This measure is defined as the range of APD values covered by the S1S2 restitution curves at a predefined long DI. For DI = 800 ms, memory amplitude was 25, 152 and 151 ms in the V<sub>m</sub>-driven and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven model versions with positive and negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling, respectively. According to this criterion, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven models exhibit a larger amount of short term memory compared to the V<sub>m</sub>-driven model. However, memory amplitude and λ<sub>mem</sub> cannot be compared directly, because the former reflects APD changes over 2 (or a very few) beats, whereas the latter reflects the longest time scale of the model dynamics.</p>

        <p>These transfer functions represent the model behavior in terms of gain and phase shift in the frequency domain. The negative gain of H<sub>t→a</sub> indicates that at a mean CL of 400 ms, variations of APD are small relative to variations of CL, and thus that the effects of APD restitution are moderate. Conversely, the gain of H<sub>t→d</sub> around 0 shows that CL variations translate primarily to DI variations. However, the increase of H<sub>t→d</sub> to +3.5 dB at f = 0.5 beat<sup>−1</sup> indicates that DI variations at higher frequencies are actually amplified, revealing the propensity of the model to generate alternans.</p>

        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g004">Figure 4 <italic>B</italic></xref> first explores the behavior of the different markers extracted with the different methods, as BCL approaches the bifurcation to alternans. In all versions of the model, the conventional slopes S<sub>S1S2</sub> and S<sub>dyn</sub> derived using eigenmode analysis were indistinguishable from those obtained using conventional restitution protocols. However, both S<sub>S1S2</sub> and S<sub>dyn</sub> were poor predictors of alternans as they always were &lt;1 at the critical BCL at which alternans appeared. In contrast, λ<sub>alt</sub> was always exactly −1 at the onset of alternans as predicted by theory. The behavior of z<sub>td1</sub> further reflects the different dynamic mechanisms governing restitution. While z<sub>td1</sub> remains near 0 in the V<sub>m</sub>-driven model, it follows a nearly parallel course to λ<sub>alt</sub> in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven models, but with z<sub>td1</sub> &gt; λ<sub>alt</sub> for positive Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling and z<sub>td1</sub> &lt; λ<sub>alt</sub> for negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g004">Figure 4 <italic>B</italic></xref> then explores the ability of stochastic pacing combined with ARMA model fitting to estimate these different markers. This approach permitted the robust estimation of both λ<sub>alt</sub> in all three versions of the ventricular cell model, and this estimation was excellent at regimes when λ<sub>alt</sub> was close to −1 (a feature which is essential for the practical prediction of alternans). Similarly, z<sub>td1</sub> could be accurately estimated when it was larger than &gt;0.5 (in absolute value). When these markers were close to 0 (e.g., in the V<sub>m</sub>-driven model), the estimation became less reliable, in agreement with the notion that poles and zeros near 0 exert only a small influence on the dynamics of a time series, which renders their identification difficult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Ljung1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Hayes1">[37]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The combination of stochastic pacing and ARMA model fitting also permitted the reliable estimation of S<sub>S1S2</sub> according to Eq. 20 without actually conducting an S1S2 protocol. However, the estimates of S<sub>dyn</sub> with the ARMA model according to Eq. 21 were prone to a large variability (not shown). This is explained by the fact that H<sub>t→a</sub> and H<sub>t→d</sub> obtained with the ARMA model do not capture the transfer functions with a sufficient reliability at very low frequencies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g003">Figure 3 <italic>C</italic></xref>). Because S<sub>dyn</sub> is given by H<sub>t→a</sub> and H<sub>t→d</sub> at <italic>f</italic> = 0 (Eq. 14), the estimation of S<sub>dyn</sub> with ARMA model fitting is thus prone to be less robust.</p>

        <title>Aspect of the transfer functions at pacing regimes closer and closer to the bifurcation to alternans</title>
        <p>Representations of frequency response spectra are intuitively easier to interpret than corresponding sets of poles and zeros. Therefore, we investigated how the aspect of the transfer functions H<sub>t→a</sub> and H<sub>t→d</sub> behaves at regimes closer and closer to the bifurcation to alternans.

        <p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g005">Figure 5</xref>, it is apparent that the relationship between stochastic variations of CL and resulting variations of APD and DI is nonlinear, non-additive and frequency-dependent. At CLs far from the alternans regime (darker purple curves), restitution was less involved and CL variations translated primarily into variations of DI, while APD variations were comparatively small. This is reflected by a gain close to 0 dB for H<sub>t→d</sub> and a negative gain (attenuation) for H<sub>t→a</sub>. However, for all models and at regimes progressively closer and closer to the bifurcation to alternans (lighter redder curves), CL variations resulted in a more and more positive gain for both H<sub>t→d</sub> and H<sub>t→a</sub> at frequencies &gt;0.4 beat<sup>−1</sup>, with a peak at 0.5 beat<sup>−1</sup>. This observation can be interpreted as an increasing propensity to alternans. This gain reached values up to 20 dB, which corresponds to amplification by a factor of 10. Thus, in regimes close to the development of alternans, variations of APD and DI may reach a level which is comparatively one order of magnitude higher compared to variations of CL.</p>
        <p>The behavior of the transfer functions in the V<sub>m</sub>-driven model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g005">Figure 5 <italic>B</italic></xref>) was qualitatively similar to that in the first-order model, suggesting a low level of memory in the V<sub>m</sub>-driven Sato et al. model. In contrast, the behavior in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven models was clearly different. With positive Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g005">Figure 5 <italic>C</italic></xref>), the curves appear skewed towards the right. With negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g005">Figure 5 <italic>D</italic></xref>), the aspect is fundamentally different. First, at <italic>f</italic> = 0.5 beat<sup>−1</sup>, the phase shift of H<sub>t→a</sub> is −2π instead of −π, a difference explained by the presence of a zero (<italic>z</italic><sub>td1</sub>) more negative than λ<sub>alt</sub>. Second, a singularity appears at <italic>f</italic> = 0.5 beat<sup>−1</sup> in H<sub>t→d</sub> (abrupt change in polarity) when this zero leaves the unit circle at −1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g004">Figure 4 <italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus, all these transfer function “portraits” are able to picture and reveal the dynamical differences regarding both the propensity to alternans generation and memory in the different models.</p>
        <p>Similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g003">Figure 3</xref>, all these transfer functions could be estimated using the stochastic pacing protocol and ARMA model identification, with small deviations in the low frequency range &lt;0.05 beat<sup>−1</sup>. This range corresponds to time scales of &gt;20 beats and is thus determined by long-lasting effects of memory (poles and zeros near +1), which cannot be captured accurately by the ARMA model. These effects manifest themselves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g005">Figure 5 <italic>B</italic>–<italic>D</italic></xref> as inflections of both the gain and the phase shift curves at <italic>f</italic>&lt;0.05 beat<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

        <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g006">Figure 6 <italic>A</italic></xref>, the model was paced using a protocol consisting of CLs decreasing progressively (−0.1 ms/beat) to which random Gaussian variations (SD: 1 ms) were added. The resulting series of APDs and CLs were then segmented in windows of 30 cycles with an overlap of 15 cycles, and λ<sub>alt</sub> as well as S<sub>S1S2</sub> were estimated from the data in each window using a 2<sup>nd</sup> order ARMA model. In the illustrated example, λ<sub>alt</sub> progressively approached −1 and the onset of alternans coincided with the moment when λ<sub>alt</sub> reached −1 (vertical dotted line).

        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g006">Figure 6 <italic>A</italic></xref> shows once more that S<sub>S1S2</sub> is a poor predictive marker, as its value was only 0.4 at the onset of alternans. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g006">Figure 6 <italic>B</italic></xref>, the model was paced using the same ramp protocol as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g006">Figure 6 <italic>A</italic></xref>, but without adding random CL variations, i.e., using a control ramp protocol without stochastic variations. Although manifest APD alternans appeared later than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g006">Figure 6 <italic>A</italic></xref>, the difference series of APD (ΔAPD = APD<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> – APD<italic><sub>i</sub></italic><sub>−1</sub>) reveals that microscopic alternans (micro-alternans) actually appeared at the same moment as anticipated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g006">Figure 6 <italic>A</italic></xref> from the behavior of λ<sub>alt</sub>. Similar results were obtained with the V<sub>m</sub>-driven model and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven model with negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling.</p>
        <p>In an experimental setting, APD is always subject to measurement error. To evaluate how our analyses would be influenced by measurement error, we conducted 10 simulations as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g006">Figure 6 <italic>A</italic></xref> and added a random Gaussian error on the APD time series before the evaluation of λ<sub>alt</sub> and S<sub>S1S2</sub>. In these simulations, the SD of the random CL deviations was increased to 5 ms and the SD of the error added to APD was 1 ms. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g006">Figure 6 <italic>C</italic></xref>, adding noise to the APD time series resulted in an underestimation of λ<sub>alt</sub> (in absolute value) and a larger variability of the estimates, which necessitated increasing the number of cycles used for ARMA model fitting to 150. However, the estimation of λ<sub>alt</sub> became progressively more accurate as it approached −1, and extrapolating the time course of λ<sub>alt</sub> towards its intercept with the line λ<sub>alt</sub> = −1 permitted to anticipate the onset of alternans as in the control situation without adding noise to APD. Interestingly, the estimation of S1S2 was not influenced by measurement noise.</p>
        <p>It is also informative to analyze λ<sub>alt</sub> as a function of BCL, as done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g006">Figure 6 <italic>D</italic></xref> for the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g006">Figure 6 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>. In this analysis, linear regression of λ<sub>alt</sub> vs. BCL was conducted for data points with λ<sub>alt</sub>&gt;−0.85. By extrapolating the regression line to λ<sub>alt</sub> = −1, it was possible to anticipate the BCL at which alternans developed.</p>

        <title>Superiority of ARMA model identification compared to a time domain analysis</title>
        <p>To investigate whether ARMA model identification during stochastic pacing offers a significant advantage over a simpler time domain analysis consisting of quantifying the decay of APD oscillations following a perturbation, we examined the response of the Sato et al. model to a step change of BCL. An example is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g008">Figure 8 <italic>A</italic></xref> for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven model with positive Ca<sup>2+</sup> to APD coupling after a step decrease of BCL from 400 to 390 ms. The step decrease of BCL caused transient decaying APD alternans, followed by an exponential convergence of APD to its new steady state at BCL = 390 ms. These two patterns reflect the alternans and memory eigenmodes, respectively. To quantify the decay of the alternans eigenmode, an exponential function was fitted to the absolute value of the APD difference series (|ΔAPD|). The time constant of this function provided an estimate of λ<sub>alt</sub> of −0.800, which was close to the control value of −0.820 derived using eigenmode analysis. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g008">Figure 8 <italic>B</italic></xref>, this estimation was compromised when noise was added to APD (SD = 0.1 ms). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g008">Figure 8 <italic>C</italic></xref>, this time domain method is compared statistically to ARMA model identification during stochastic pacing (SD of APD: 5 ms; 3<sup>rd</sup> order ARMA model, identification over 30 cycles). In the presence of noise, the variability of λ<sub>alt</sub> estimates was significantly smaller for ARMA model identification during stochastic pacing. Similar results were obtained at other BCLs and for the two other versions of the cell model. Thus, in the presence of noise, ARMA model identification is more robust than quantification of the exponential decay of APD alternation following a step decrease of BCL.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Alternans is a clinically relevant phenomenon leading to dispersion of refractoriness, which precipitates conduction block and reentrant arrhythmias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Weiss1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Klber1">[4]</xref>. The prediction of cardiac arrhythmias and the understanding of their underlying mechanisms have always represented a great challenge in both research and cardiology practice. For these reasons, understanding electrical restitution and alternans has been the topic of numerous studies for more than four decades, starting with the classical one-dimensional iterated map model of Nolasco and Dahlen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Nolasco1">[9]</xref>. The dynamic mechanisms leading to alternans are manifold: they involve not only complex interactions between ion currents and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling at the cellular level, but also intercellular interactions at scales ranging from tissue to the whole organ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Weiss1">[2]</xref>. Because of this multiplicity of mechanisms and the complexity of cardiac dynamics, predicting alternans and arrhythmias still remains a difficult endeavor.</p>
      <sec id="s4a">
        <title>A new unified framework for restitution, alternans and memory</title>
        <p>In the present study, we revisit restitution by examining it in a generalized framework based on eigenmode analysis, a sound mathematical approach for the characterization of dynamical systems. Previous studies based on eigenmode analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Li1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Otani1">[29]</xref> have shown that in cardiac electrophysiology, alternans and memory are actually the two faces of the same dynamics. By looking into eigenmode analysis in the frequency domain, we first showed that in the linear limit, the eigenmode description of a cardiac cell is equivalent to the description using a memory model of cardiac restitution. Both descriptions can be understood in terms of transfer functions. In the frequency domain, memory and alternans can then be regarded as the two extremes on the frequency axis, which ranges from 0 to 0.5 beat<sup>−1</sup>. Based on engineering notions of signal processing, we then devised a practical method to determine these transfer functions together with their poles and zeros using only time series of CLs, APDs and DIs. Our key finding is that the propensity to alternans can be quantified and monitored and thus the onset of alternans can be anticipated using the eigenvalue (first pole) λ<sub>alt</sub> obtained via ARMA model identification during pacing at intervals varying randomly. The results of the computer simulations, conducted with models exhibiting three fundamentally different ionic mechanisms of alternans, not only support the general validity of this approach but also suggest that it may also be applied in non stationary regimes such as during a slow acceleration of the (average) pacing rate or the progressive application of a drug. Our approach is general because it can be applied to any model based on a biophysical description of ion currents as well as any higher-dimensional iterated map model of cardiac dynamics, such as the models of Vinet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Vinet1">[10]</xref>, Chialvo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Chialvo2">[13]</xref> or Qu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Qu2">[38]</xref>, for which eigenmode analysis can also be conducted and thus the transfer functions determined.</p>
        <p>Our approach develops its full strength when pacing at randomly varying intervals is considered. Our simulations provide the proof of principle that stochastic pacing permits the estimation of the transfer functions H<sub>t→a</sub> and H<sub>t→d</sub> and thus of their first pole as a marker for the propensity to alternans. It is worth to note that in our simulations, ARMA model identification was excellent in estimating S<sub>S1S2</sub>, even in the presence of measurement noise. Thus, the S1S2 restitution slope can actually be determined by stochastic pacing without the need to conduct an S1S2 protocol. However, the performance of ARMA model identification to estimate S<sub>dyn</sub> was low. This observation is explained by the fact that the determination of S<sub>dyn</sub> (using Eq. 21) is exquisitely sensitive to errors in the determination of the higher order coefficients of the ARMA model and that these errors cannot be decreased by increasing the order of the ARMA model. Indeed, in our simulations, &gt;99% of APD variance was already described with a model of order 2 or 3, and increasing this order provided neither a better description of the dynamics, neither a higher reliability in computing λ<sub>alt</sub> or restitution slopes. This indicates that the dynamics of the Sato et al. model, which has 16 variables, can be well represented by a lower dimensional model of order 2 or 3 in near stationary regimes. This also explains that the estimation of S<sub>dyn</sub> using ARMA model identification is prone to a large variability, and thus that it would not be superior to a conventional pacing protocol in a practical experimental setting.</p>
        <p>In this study, we used APD and DI as the system's output time series. It must be noted that our approach can also be used to derive the transfer function between pacing cycle lengths and any other output parameter such as the peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient or the peak of a given ion current. Therefore, in an experimental setting, ARMA model identification during stochastic pacing could also be applied on series of peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, or, a fortiori, on local conduction velocities or mechanical parameters (e.g., peak force or shortening). Our approach also offers the advantage to be versatile. For example, exploring the frequency response of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in addition to the response of APD may uncover additional insights regarding the primary cause of alternans (voltage vs. Ca<sup>2+</sup> driven), which may be pertinent in determining appropriate clinical therapeutic strategies (e.g. conventional pharmacotherapy targeting ion channels vs. new agents that may target the cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling machinery). This analysis was however beyond the scope of this work.</p>

        <title>Relation and consistency with previous studies</title>
        <p>As demonstrated in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref> section, the classical one-dimensional memoryless map <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Nolasco1">[9]</xref> represents a particular case for which the criteria S<sub>dyn</sub> = 1, S<sub>S1S2</sub> = 1 and λ<sub>alt</sub> = −1 are equivalent. However, the equivalence of these criteria breaks down as soon as cardiac dynamics exhibit memory. Memory can thus be defined as any deviation from the first order map behavior. Thus, the notion of memory clearly explains why, in a more general setting, any prediction of alternans based on S<sub>dyn</sub> or on S<sub>S1S2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Tolkacheva1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cram1">[18]</xref> should not be expected to be reliable.</p>
        <p>In a theoretical study, Tolkacheva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Tolkacheva2">[25]</xref> derived criteria for alternans and stability based on measuring dynamic and S1S2 restitution slopes in an iterated map model given by APD<italic><sub>n</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub> = <italic>f</italic>(APD<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>,DI<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>). The authors then generalized their analysis to mapping models with an arbitrary amount of memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Kalb2">[21]</xref> (corresponding to Eq. 15). The mapping models were investigated in the time domain using the perturbed downsweep protocol. We note that our framework is fully consistent with their time domain analyses, as it yields, for example, an equivalent result for S<sub>dyn</sub>. However, our approach provides additional insights in the Z and frequency domains and links restitution to eigenmode analysis. As a principle, frequency domain analysis permits to understand cardiac dynamics in response to any arbitrary sequence of pacing intervals, including stochastic pacing and pacing at cycle lengths varying in an oscillatory manner.</p>
        <p>In this latter context, the recent studies of Wu and Patwardhan deserve attention. To demonstrate memory effects, these investigators paced a ventricular cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Wu2">[26]</xref> or a mathematical cell model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Wu3">[39]</xref> while controlling the DI and varying it as a sinusoidal function with a period of 100 beats. This sinusoidal variation resulted in hysteresis of APD vs. DI, i.e., in a phase shift between both. Because a sinusoidal pacing protocol can be regarded as probing the transfer functions at the corresponding frequency (<italic>f</italic> = 0.01 beat<sup>−1</sup>), memory effects should become apparent at this frequency in graphical representations of transfer functions. Accordingly, at frequencies ≤0.01 beat<sup>−1</sup>, the three versions of the Sato et al. model are characterized by manifest phase shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g005">Figure 5 <italic>B</italic>–<italic>D</italic></xref>), whereas the phase shift is vanishingly small in the memoryless first-order model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002399-g005">Figure 5 <italic>A</italic></xref>). While a sinusoidal pacing protocol thus represents a suitable approach to probe memory, the advantage of the stochastic pacing protocol is that it examines all frequencies at the same time, thus probing both alternans and memory.</p>

        <title>Perspectives, limitations and challenges</title>
        <p>Stochastic pacing and ARMA model identification would be straightforward to implement in any electrophysiological apparatus. Therefore, our approach could readily be translated to <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models, opening the perspective of new diagnostic approaches during clinical investigation of heart rhythm disorders. In the future, one could for example envision stochastic pacing for clinical electrophysiological testing as a built-in extension to cardiac mapping systems or implanted defibrillators for the purpose of risk-stratification.</p>
        <p>Obviously, our theoretical framework must withstand the challenge of experimental validation. Because experimental data such as APD measurements are always subject to measurement error and because APD variability may also result from the stochastic gating of ion channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Zaniboni1">[40]</xref>, it will first be necessary to carefully optimize the SD of stochastic pacing variations, the number of cycles used for ARMA model identification and the order of the ARMA model. Our simulations suggest that our approach performs well as long as the system remains near its linear limit. If the SD of CL is set to be too large, our approach will eventually be limited by nonlinearities in the system and some stimuli may fall in the refractory period. To minimize the intrinsic variability of APD, it may then be appropriate to use small pieces of cardiac tissue in which this intrinsic variability is strongly decreased by gap junctional coupling between individual cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Zaniboni1">[40]</xref>. It will also be necessary to evaluate the effects of other sources of variability in both experiments and further computer simulations. Nevertheless, our computational results indicate that our approach should be robust in predicting the onset of alternans.</p>
        <p>From a theoretical point of view, it will also be necessary to extend the theory to multicellular systems in order to understand the influences of intercellular interactions, the effects of conduction velocity restitution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Watanabe1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Echebarria1">[42]</xref> and the consequences of multidimensional phenomena such as wavefront curvature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cabo1">[43]</xref>. In particular, it has been shown in spatially extended systems that electrotonic interactions can exert a large influence on the occurrence of alternans and the APD restitution slope at which alternans occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cherry1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cherry2">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, the occurrence of alternans can be significantly modulated by steep conduction velocity restitution slopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Cytrynbaum1">[15]</xref>. These aspects will require a careful computational evaluation. Such computational studies will permit to understand the possibilities and limitations of our framework in greater detail, and they are expected to provide additional insights into dynamical phenomena emerging at multicellular scales, such as spatially discordant alternans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Watanabe1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002399-Echebarria1">[42]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>In conclusion, stochastic pacing combined with ARMA model identification represents a novel frequency domain approach to study cardiac dynamics. This approach should be applicable experimentally for the accurate evaluation of the propensity to alternans and the prediction of its onset. Because its mathematical foundation does not make any a priori assumptions about the ionic mechanisms of alternans, it pertains to any type of myocardial cell or tissue, irrespective of species, disease status or pharmacological interventions.</p>
