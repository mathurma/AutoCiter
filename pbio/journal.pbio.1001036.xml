      <p>Bacteria are highly skilled at biological warfare. They have a range of weapons at
                their disposal: everything from secreted toxins to camouflage. Many bacteria can
                even make use of what's known as a toxin–antitoxin system to program
                their own individual suicide in support of the population's survival. In this
                system, a bacterial toxin lies dormant within the bacterium, wrapped up and
                prevented from becoming active by an antitoxin protein. Under conditions of stress,
                the antitoxin either stops being produced or is degraded, freeing the toxin to
                perform its attacks. One such toxin–antitoxin system, PezAT (also known as the
                epsilon/zeta system), is expressed in many pathogenic bacteria, but its mechanism of
                action is not known. In this issue of <italic>PLoS Biology</italic>, Hannes
                Mutschler, Anton Meinhart, and colleagues explain how this toxin–antitoxin
                system operates.</p>
      <p>The PezAT system has been difficult to study because the toxin half of the system,
                PezT, is deadly when expressed in cells without its antitoxin counterpart, PezA.
                However, Meinhart and his team observed that a mutant version of PezT—one
                lacking the last 11 amino acids of its C-terminus—still kills the bacteria
                that host it, but does so slowly enough to allow its mechanism of killing to be
                studied. Because truncated PezT kills slowly, the researchers had time to observe
                that it does so by distorting the shape of the bacteria and ultimately bursting the
                cells. These observations suggested that it acts by impairing the integrity of the
                bacterial cell wall.</p>
      <p>How does PezT affect cell wall integrity? Other research had suggested that PezT is
                toxic not only to bacteria but also to yeast. Meinhart's group therefore
                suspected it might affect a conserved component that is important for both bacterial
                and yeast survival. One such component is the bacterial cell wall precursor and
                metabolite UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG).</p>
      <p>In bacteria, UNAG is required for the formation of the peptidoglycans that make up
                the backbone of the cell wall and give it its stiff structure. The researchers
                theorized that PezT might act by phosphorylating UNAG because PezT structurally
                resembles a phosphotransferase. Indeed, their biochemical experiments showed that
                PezT directly phosphorylates a hydroxyl group on UNAG.</p>
      <p>There appear to be many negative consequences of UNAG phosphorylation. For one thing,
                UNAG is normally the substrate for an enzyme known as MurA. But PezT phosphorylates
                UNAG at the exact site on which MurA normally acts, thereby preventing UNAG from
                being processed correctly by MurA. When PezT phosphorylates UNAG, it therefore
                blocks MurA from acting on an unphosphorylated pool of UNAG. As a result,
                phosphorylated UNAG gradually accumulates within the cells, aggravating its own
                blockading effects by a positive feedback loop. As the blockade takes effect, the
                creation of new cell wall material is prevented, and the cell wall weakens until it
                can no longer withstand the hydrostatic pressure of the bacterium's contents,
                causing the bacterium to burst open.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, bacteria seem most vulnerable to the effects of PezT when they are
                growing rapidly; bacteria are more resistant to PezT-mediated death when they are
                growing slowly or are small in size. Therefore, activation of PezT seems to be a
                method by which rapidly growing bacteria can instigate a suicide program.</p>
      <p>Why would bacteria need to commit suicide? Meinhart and colleagues speculate that the
                suicide of a few bacteria in a rapidly growing population may promote the release of
                other toxins that can attack their host's cells or competing bacteria, thereby
                protecting their own. But now that we know about this secret weapon and its modus
                operandi, in the future it may be possible to deploy it against pathogenic bacteria
                by designing drugs that subvert this process. PezT could turn out to be a bacterial
                Achilles heel.</p>
