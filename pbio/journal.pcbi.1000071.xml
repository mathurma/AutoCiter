Functional regions of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences often exhibit characteristic but subtle motifs; thus, computational discovery of motifs in sequences is a fundamental and much-studied problem. However, most current algorithms do not allow for insertions or deletions (indels) within motifs, and the few that do have other limitations. We present a method, <sc>GLAM2</sc> (Gapped Local Alignment of Motifs), for discovering motifs allowing indels in a fully general manner, and a companion method <sc>GLAM2</sc>SCAN for searching sequence databases using such motifs. <sc>glam</sc>2 is a generalization of the gapless Gibbs sampling algorithm. It re-discovers variable-width protein motifs from the PROSITE database significantly more accurately than the alternative methods PRATT and SAM-T2K. Furthermore, it usefully refines protein motifs from the ELM database: in some cases, the refined motifs make orders of magnitude fewer overpredictions than the original ELM regular expressions. <sc>GLAM2</sc> performs respectably on the BAliBASE multiple alignment benchmark, and may be superior to leading multiple alignment methods for “motif-like” alignments with N- and C-terminal extensions. Finally, we demonstrate the use of <sc>GLAM2</sc> to discover protein kinase substrate motifs and a gapped DNA motif for the LIM-only transcriptional regulatory complex: using <sc>GLAM2</sc>SCAN, we identify promising targets for the latter. <sc>GLAM2</sc> is especially promising for short protein motifs, and it should improve our ability to identify the protein cleavage sites, interaction sites, post-translational modification attachment sites, etc., that underlie much of biology. It may be equally useful for arbitrarily gapped motifs in DNA and RNA, although fewer examples of such motifs are known at present. <sc>GLAM2</sc> is public domain software, available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.org.au/glam2" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinformatics.org.au/glam2</ext-link>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In recent decades, scientists have extracted genetic sequences—DNA, RNA, and protein sequences—from numerous organisms. These sequences hold the information for the construction and functioning of these organisms, but as yet we are mostly unable to read them. It has long been known that these sequences contain many kinds of “motifs”, i.e. re-occurring patterns, associated with specific biological functions. Thus, much research has been devoted to computer algorithms for automatically discovering subtle, recurring motifs in sequences. However, previous algorithms search for rigid motifs whose instances vary only by substitutions, and not by insertions or deletions. Real motifs are flexible, and do vary by insertions and deletions. This study describes a new computer algorithm for discovering motifs, which allows for arbitrary insertions and deletions. This algorithm can discover real, flexible motifs, and should be able to help us determine the functions of many biological molecules.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>MCF was supported by AIST.

Sequence motifs can describe and identify features in DNA, RNA and protein sequences such as transcription factor binding sites, splice junctions and protein-protein interaction sites. Numerous algorithms have been developed for discovering motifs, as well as algorithms for scanning databases for matches to a given motif or motifs. Some are specialized for discovery of DNA motifs.

Others, such as MEME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Bailey1">[9]</xref> and Gibbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Neuwald1">[10]</xref> can discover motifs in either protein or DNA sequences. The importance of motifs is further underscored by the numerous databases that have been compiled of known motifs including DNA regulatory motifs in TRANSFAC, JASPAR, SCPD, DBTBS, RegulonDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Matys1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Makita1">[14]</xref>, and protein motifs in ELM, PROSITE, BLOCKS and PRINTS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Puntervoll1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Attwood1">[18]</xref>.</p><p>It is worth noting that biological motifs fall into at least three somewhat distinct classes. The first comprises short motifs often found at functional sites of biopolymers, such as cleavage sites, binding sites and attachment sites. These short motifs probably arise through convergent evolution as often as not. The second comprises longer protein motifs associated with globular structural domains. These often, if not always, arise through divergent evolution. Finally, recurring motifs can arise from evolutionarily recent duplications, such as DNA transposons. It is not clear that these categories are best tackled by a single motif discovery method. <sc>glam</sc>2 is primarily aimed at short motifs for functional sites, although it performs respectably for the other categories.</p><p>In an ideal world, simple motifs would directly encode biological functions, as is the case with the triplet genetic code for amino acids for example. In reality, protein phosphorylation sites and the like may be encoded in a more complex and dispersed fashion, and in the worst case we would have to understand the full biophysics of the molecule in order to predict its function. Nevertheless, there is often at least a correlation between motifs and functional sites, which is useful. This is illustrated well by the ELM server, which uses protein motifs as a first step in predicting functional sites, and filters the predictions by criteria such as cell compartment and globular domain clash <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Puntervoll1">[15]</xref>. Thus, refining known motifs and discovering new motifs will be useful for identifying functional sites.</p><p>Most motif discovery algorithms are limited to gapless motifs. The main reason for this is that the motif discovery process becomes more difficult when gaps are allowed due to an explosion in the number of possible variations. Gapped motifs are ubiquitous in biology, however. Many of the motifs described in protein motif databases such as ELM and PROSITE contain variable length gaps. Transcription factor complexes can have DNA binding motifs with variable width spacers, and some DNA motif discovery algorithms are specialized to finding bipartite motifs – two motifs separated by a single, variable-length spacer.</p><p>There are some existing methods for discovering gapped motifs, but they do not appear to be widely used. <sc>pratt</sc> discovers gapped motifs, in the form of regular expressions, in protein sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Jonassen1">[19]</xref>. Regular expressions may have trouble capturing subtle motifs, because they specify exactly which residues and spacers are allowed at each position, and do not allow a better match in one part to compensate for a worse match in another part. Since they make such detailed specifications, it may also be hard to discover accurate regular expressions from small numbers of examples. In any case, <sc>glam</sc>2 re-discovers PROSITE motifs more sensitively than <sc>pratt</sc> (see below).</p><p>So-called profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used to represent protein structural motifs with gaps, notably in the <sc>sam</sc> and <sc>hmmer</sc> packages, and HMM training algorithms can be used to discover such motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Hughey1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Eddy1">[22]</xref>. It is telling that, while <sc>sam</sc> and <sc>hmmer</sc> are extremely successful and widely used, they are mainly used for motif scanning, and rarely for <italic>ab initio</italic> motif discovery. Recent versions of <sc>hmmer</sc> do not even retain the training algorithm. In fact, <sc>glam</sc>2 can be regarded as an HMM training method similar to these. A key difference is that, while <sc>sam</sc> and <sc>hmmer</sc> optimise the HMM parameters (the transition and emission probabilities), <sc>glam</sc>2 “integrates out” these parameters (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000071.s001">Text S1</xref>), and directly optimises the motif alignment. One consequence is that <sc>glam</sc>2 can use a better-characterised heuristic to search for the globally optimum solution: simulated annealing, rather than expectation-maximization with noise injection. (Expectation-maximization alone is well-characterized, but it only finds local optima.) <sc>glam</sc>2 actually uses the same stochastic traceback step as <sc>hmmer</sc>, but since <sc>hmmer</sc> optimises the parameters rather than the alignment, this is not true simulated annealing, as pointed out by its author <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Eddy1">[22]</xref>. The <sc>yebis</sc> program also discovers gapped motifs, in DNA only, using an <italic>ad hoc</italic> HMM training method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Yada1">[23]</xref>.</p><p>A dynasty of Gibbs sampling algorithms has been developed, which allow for gapped motifs with steadily increasing generality. The original Gibbs sampler only found ungapped motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Lawrence1">[24]</xref>. The second generation method allowed for discontiguous motifs, where poorly conserved positions within a motif are not considered part of the motif (“turned-off ”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Neuwald1">[10]</xref>. This allows a limited form of insertion, which must be the same size in all motif instances. A successor program named <sc>probe</sc> is aimed at protein structural motifs, and it models a motif as multiple separated blocks, where each block may be discontiguous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Neuwald2">[25]</xref>. Most recently, Neuwald and Liu extended <sc>probe</sc> to allow general insertions and deletions within blocks, using an HMM very similar to the profile HMMs of <sc>sam</sc> and <sc>hmmer</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Neuwald3">[26]</xref>. Since <sc>glam</sc>2 is also an extension of Gibbs sampling to allow general indels, it is somewhat similar to this method, but there are the following important differences:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Neuwald and Liu use a more complex motif model, designed for protein structural motifs, and much more sophisticated alignment-editing operations and annealing schemes.

We describe the <sc>glam</sc>2 algorithm for discovering gapped motifs, and a companion scanning algorithm, <sc>glam</sc>2<sc>scan</sc>. In the following, we first give an overview of <sc>glam</sc>2 and <sc>glam</sc>2<sc>scan</sc>, followed by more details on the methods. Full technical details are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000071.s001">Text S1</xref>. We then assess their performance at three different kinds of task: re-discovering PROSITE motifs, refining and then scanning ELM motifs, and aligning BAliBASE sequences. Finally, we give two examples of using these methods to discover kinase substrate motifs and to identify DNA target sites of the LIM-only complex. The results show that <sc>glam</sc>2 and <sc>glam</sc>2<sc>scan</sc> are very capable of identifying gapped motifs, especially short linear motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview of GLAM2 and GLAM2scan</title><p><sc>glam</sc>2 examines a set of sequences provided by the user, and returns an alignment of segments of these sequences. A typical alignment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000071-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Each sequence contributes at most one segment to the alignment. Our approach assumes that a motif is defined by residue preferences at certain positions, which we call key positions. These are analogous to the “turned-on” columns of the second-generation Gibbs sampler, or to the match states of a profile HMM. In a particular motif instance, some key positions may be deleted, and residues may be inserted between key positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000071-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-1000071-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000071.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A typical motif alignment from GLAM2.</title><p>The stars indicate the key positions.

It rewards alignment of identical or similar residues in the same key position, and penalizes deletions and insertions. However, deletions and insertions are penalized less strongly if they repeatedly occur in the same locations. This is reasonable because some locations in a motif may be more prone to deletions or insertions than others. Having defined a scoring scheme for alignments, it is straightforward to calculate the marginal score of one aligned segment: the score of the alignment including this segment minus the score of the alignment excluding this segment. These marginal scores reflect how well each segment matches the other segments.</p><p>Having defined a scoring scheme, <sc>glam</sc>2 attempts to find a motif alignment with maximum score. Even in the gapless case, the number of possible alignments is too huge to enumerate, and there is no practical algorithm to guarantee finding the optimal alignment. This problem is only exacerbated in the gapped case. Thus <sc>glam</sc>2 uses a heuristic optimisation method – simulated annealing – highly analogous to the optimisation methods of the gapless Gibbs samplers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Neuwald1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Frith1">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Simulated annealing takes an initial, presumably non-optimal, alignment and repeatedly makes changes to it. These changes have an element of randomness: they generally increase the score, but sometimes decrease it, which avoids getting stuck in local optima. The process is analogous to crystallization in a cooling material. Two types of change are performed by <sc>glam</sc>2, which we call site sampling and column sampling, because they are analogous to similarly-named procedures in the original Gibbs sampler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Neuwald1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Lawrence1">[24]</xref>.

In column sampling, one key position is moved, added, or deleted. These changes are carefully designed to satisfy the reversibility and detailed balance conditions of simulated annealing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000071.s001">Text S1</xref>). Such changes are applied until the score fails to improve for <italic>n</italic> (e.g. 10000) changes in succession. To check that a reproducible, high-scoring motif has been found, the whole procedure is repeated <italic>r</italic> (e.g. 10) times from different random starting alignments.</p><p><sc>glam</sc>2's behaviour can be controlled with numerous adjustable parameters. The allowed alignments can be constrained by specifying a minimum number of key positions (<italic>a</italic>), a maximum number of key positions (<italic>b</italic>), and a minimum number of segments in the alignment (<italic>z</italic>). This <italic>z</italic> parameter is a useful generalization of the OOPS (one occurrence per sequence) and ZOOPS (zero or one occurrence per sequence) modes of previous motif discovery algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Bailey2">[28]</xref>.

The stochastic traceback step is also similar to the standard traceback used to find optimal alignments, except that it chooses a random path through the matrix, weighted by the <italic>M</italic>(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>) values, rather than taking the optimal path.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Column Sampling</title><p>The site sampling moves of the original gapless Gibbs sampler were prone to getting stuck in shifted versions of the optimal motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Lawrence1">[24]</xref>, and <sc>glam</sc>2 has an analogous problem. Column sampling overcomes this problem, and in addition, allows the number of key positions in the motif to be adjusted.</p><p>In column sampling, one key position is chosen at random, and removed from the alignment. This means that the residues that were in this key position now become regarded as insertions between the preceding and following key positions. Then, a new key position is added to the alignment. Several ways of adding a key position are considered, and one of these is chosen at random, with probability proportional to the resulting alignment's likelihood ratio, as defined above, raised to the power of 1/<italic>t</italic>.</p><p>So far, this is highly analogous to site sampling. However, the number of ways of adding a key position to a gapped alignment is generally astronomical, and we do not have a clever algorithm to consider them all efficiently, so we must consider a subset. Furthermore, this subset must include the possibility of returning to the original alignment by adding back the key position that was removed, in order to satisfy the reversibility requirement of simulated annealing. Thus, we consider all ways of adding a key position that preserve certain properties of the key position that was removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000071.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we allow the number of key positions to increase by sometimes neglecting to remove the chosen key position, and we allow the number of key positions to decrease by sometimes neglecting to add a new key position. The probabilities of not removing and not adding a key position are carefully chosen to satisfy the detailed balance condition of simulated annealing: the details are interesting but somewhat technical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000071.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The Initial Alignment for GLAM2</title><p>The simulated annealing procedure for finding high-scoring alignments needs to start from some initial alignment. The initial alignment for <sc>glam</sc>2 is constructed as follows. The number of key positions (aligned columns) is set to a fixed value, <italic>w</italic>, chosen by the user, by default 20. Starting with an empty “alignment” containing zero sequences, the input sequences are taken one-by-one, in random order, and added to the alignment using a site sampling move with temperature <italic>t</italic> = 1. Ideally, the initial alignment should have no effect on the result, since simulated annealing finds the globally optimal alignment. In practice, the <italic>w</italic> parameter does influence the result, though this influence decreases as the annealing is allowed to run for longer.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Optimising GLAM2 Parameters</title><p>The <sc>glam</sc>2 algorithm involves many adjustable parameters, and we wish to find suitable parameter settings for effective motif discovery. It is likely that different settings will be optimal for different scenarios (e.g. protein versus DNA motifs, many short input sequences versus few long input sequences), and we cannot deal with all conceivable scenarios here.</p><p>The <sc>glam</sc>2 parameters fall into two categories: those that affect the scoring scheme for motif alignments, and those that affect the search algorithm to find high-scoring alignments. Of these, the former are more fundamental, since we must be able to recognise good alignments before we can contemplate searching for them. The score parameters are further divisible into those that determine scores for aligned residues, those that determine scores for deletions, and those that determine scores for insertions. Aligned residue scores are determined by a Dirichlet mixture, which is non-trivial to optimise, and we use parameters derived in previous work: for proteins we use recode3.20comp from <sc>sam</sc>, and for DNA we use a single Dirichlet component with all pseudocounts = 0.4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Frith1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Sjlander1">[30]</xref>. Deletion and insertion scores are each determined by a Beta distribution, which has only two pseudocount parameters. It is straightforward to find pseudocount values that best fit a given set of typical alignments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000071.s001">Text S1</xref>), but it is not so obvious whence to obtain such alignments.</p><p>We reasoned that, if we use <sc>glam</sc>2 with sensible guesses for these pseudocount parameters, we will obtain fairly good alignments, and these alignments can then be used to fit the pseudocounts. This procedure can be iterated until the fitted values stop changing. We took this approach with 58 PROSITE alignments and separately with 141 BAliBASE alignments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>). The alignments are, in fact, fairly accurate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>), and in both cases the following parameter settings are close to optimal. Pseudocounts for deletions: <italic>D</italic> = 0.1, <italic>E</italic> = 2. Pseudocounts for insertions: <italic>I</italic> = 0.02, and <italic>J</italic> = 1. All results reported here use these settings. Since these settings were tuned on protein alignments, they may not be ideal for DNA alignments.</p><p>The main parameters that affect the search algorithm are <italic>r</italic>, <italic>n</italic>, <italic>t</italic>, <italic>c</italic>, and <italic>w</italic>.

For this purpose, we used the PROSITE database (release 19.25 of 18-Apr-2006). PROSITE is a database of protein motifs represented by either “patterns” (regular expressions) or “profiles” (hidden Markov models) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Hulo1">[16]</xref>. To test <sc>glam</sc>2, we extracted all variable-length patterns (since these entail indels), and obtained the sequences annotated in PROSITE as true positive hits to each pattern.</p><p>Since <sc>glam</sc>2 produces motif alignments, we desired a set of gold standard alignments to compare them to. To construct gold standard alignments, we used <sc>ps</sc>_<sc>scan</sc> to locate the motifs in the sequences, and lined up equivalent residues in the <sc>ps</sc>_<sc>scan</sc> hits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-deCastro1">[33]</xref>. Sequences not having exactly one <sc>ps</sc>_<sc>scan</sc> hit were discarded.

This step is important because, if highly similar sequences are present, <sc>glam</sc>2 may, not unreasonably, detect this extended similarity rather than the desired motif. Sets with fewer than three remaining sequences were discarded. These steps resulted in 58 test sets with a total of 368 sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000071.s002">Dataset S1</xref>).</p><p>For this assessment, it is necessary to measure the similarity of a predicted motif alignment to a gold standard motif alignment. Our primary measure is sensitivity of aligned residue pairs: the number of correctly aligned residue pairs as a percentage of the total number of aligned residue pairs in the gold standard. We also measured the positive predictive value (PPV): the number of correctly aligned residue pairs as a percentage of the total number of aligned residue pairs in the prediction.</p><p>In this study, sensitivity is more informative than PPV, for two reasons. Firstly, unlike many other prediction assessments, there is no trivial way to achieve 100% sensitivity, because it is not possible to align all residue pairs at once. Thus, 100% sensitivity is significant and potentially useful, regardless of the PPV. Secondly, the PROSITE patterns probably err towards minimality, excluding subtle similarities that are hard to represent with regular expressions. Thus, excess aligned residues in the prediction are more likely to be biologically correct than are missing aligned residues.</p><p>We wished to compare <sc>glam</sc>2 to other tools that could be used to discover these motifs. Most motif discovery programs cannot handle variable-length motifs at all, and thus are ruled out. The first tool we compared against is <sc>sam</sc>-<sc>t</sc>2<sc>k</sc> (from <sc>sam</sc> version 3.5), which can discover motifs by fitting hidden Markov models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Karplus1">[21]</xref>. Since <sc>sam</sc>-<sc>t</sc>2<sc>k</sc> was not designed to find short motifs, we might expect it to return large alignments with low PPV – we include the <sc>sam</sc>-<sc>t</sc>2<sc>k</sc> comparison to highlight the paucity of methods that are suited to this task. We also compared against <sc>pratt</sc> (version 2.1), which discovers motifs in the form of regular expressions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Jonassen1">[19]</xref>. Since the test cases are derived from regular expression motifs, this assessment may be biased in favour of <sc>pratt</sc>.</p><p>The sensitivity and PPV of <sc>glam</sc>2 on each of the 58 test cases, compared to <sc>sam</sc>-<sc>t</sc>2<sc>k</sc> and <sc>pratt</sc>, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000071-g002">Figure 2</xref>. <sc>glam</sc>2 is generally the most sensitive method, often achieving 100% sensitivity or close to it. Interestingly, <sc>glam</sc>2 and <sc>sam</sc>-<sc>t</sc>2<sc>k</sc> often find considerably more extended alignments than the gold standard motifs, with low PPV. This suggests that either many of the motifs have large, subtle extensions not recorded in PROSITE, or many datasets have evolutionary or structural relations subtle enough to survive <sc>blastclust</sc>. In the latter case, it is not clear whether the smaller motif exists independently of the more extended similarity. <sc>pratt</sc> often achieves much higher PPV than the other methods, no doubt because it uses the same regular expression model as PROSITE, which does not capture the more subtle similarities.

Sets with fewer than three sequences after purging are discarded. We then extract the sites along with ten flanking residues on each side to create 41 sets of extended sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000071.s003">Dataset S2</xref>).

This puts <sc>glam</sc>2 at a disadvantage in a comparison such as ours, since the curators of ELM could optimize their REs on all the known sites, whereas <sc>glam</sc>2 is always tested on sites that it has not seen. This disadvantage is likely to be especially pronounced when measuring FP_100, because the ELM REs are fitted to all the unusual edge cases, which are hardest in cross-validation tests.</p><p><sc>glam</sc>2 motifs provide a good way to improve the specificity of ELM REs, as is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000071-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. For example, at sensitivities up to 50%, the <sc>glam</sc>2 motif learned from all the ELM sites is more specific than the corresponding ELM RE in 98% (40 out of 41) cases. Even at a sensitivity level of 100%, the <sc>glam</sc>2 motif is more specific in 88% (36 out of 41) of the cases tested. In the cross-validated test, which severely penalizes <sc>glam</sc>2, <sc>glam</sc>2 motifs are more specific than ELM REs at sensitivity levels below 75%.

At a sensitivity level of 50%, <sc>glam</sc>2 motifs learned from all of the known sites tend to be orders of magnitude more specific.

For slightly larger datasets and weaker motifs, it typically takes minutes or tens of minutes. To process many datasets, it becomes desirable to run them in parallel on a multi-CPU cluster. Proteins of typical length are processed several times more slowly than same-length nucleotide sequences, because <sc>glam</sc>2 uses a more complex Dirichlet mixture for proteins by default, and the Dirichlet calculations become the bottleneck. The time scales linearly with sequence length (assuming the motif width is bounded), making it difficult to analyse sequences longer than a few thousand residues, and impractical to analyse sequences much above ten thousand. Fortunately, just about all known proteins are under this limit. On the other hand, <sc>glam</sc>2 has modest memory requirements, and runs robustly without crashing.</p><p><sc>glam</sc>2's behaviour with large numbers of sequences is more complex. The speed is not directly affected, and it can happily process ten thousand or more sequences, but the result will probably be far from optimal unless the annealing is slowed down by increasing the <italic>n</italic> parameter. Furthermore, column sampling becomes ineffective with large numbers of sequences, especially if they are short. This is because it becomes unlikely that there will be any reversible way of moving, adding, or deleting a key position. Thus, it becomes more important to specify the number of key positions in advance with the <italic>w</italic> parameter.</p><p><sc>glam</sc>2<sc>scan</sc> is fast: it can scan a typical motif against the whole Swiss-Prot database in seconds. Its memory requirement scales linearly with the length of the longest individual sequence. Huge sequences such as whole mammalian chromosomes would require massive amounts of memory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that a powerful motif discovery method, Gibbs sampling, can be adapted to discover motifs with arbitrary insertions and deletions. Thus, we hope that researchers will not limit themselves to searching for gapless motifs in future. A remarkable point is that <sc>glam</sc>2 is not substantially slower than the original gapless Gibbs sampler to which it is highly analogous: the big-<italic>O</italic> complexity of the central step, realigning one sequence to the motif, does not change when arbitrary gaps are allowed.</p><p><sc>glam</sc>2 is most obviously useful for discovering and refining short protein motifs associated with functional sites, such as glycosylation sites, interaction sites, and cleavage sites. These motifs, together with contextual filters such as those used by ELM, should help us to elucidate many of the protein activities that contribute to biological systems. The application of <sc>glam</sc>2 to protein kinase substrates was somewhat hampered by (i) low availability of non-redundant substrate sequences for each class of kinase and (ii) limited information in current databases and the literature concerning motifs involved with kinase-substrate interaction. However, <sc>glam</sc>2 was clearly capable of identifying interesting short peptide motifs in sets of sequences related only by their role as substrates of a protein kinase family. This initial study suggests that in combination with other resources, <sc>glam</sc>2 is a useful tool for analysis of motifs involved in protein-protein interaction.</p><p>An exciting but more speculative application of <sc>glam</sc>2 is discovery of complex gapped motifs in DNA and RNA. Currently known DNA motifs tend to be gapless or bipartite, but it is plausible that multi-factor complexes bind to more complex motifs. Known transcription factor binding motifs are far too non-specific for accurate predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Wasserman1">[56]</xref>, and complex composite motifs might just supply the needed specificity. RNA molecules frequently contain functional sites with motifs that mediate, for example, subcellular localization and degradation. Myriad functions are emerging for non-coding RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Mattick1">[57]</xref>. While secondary and tertiary structure may be important for many RNA functions, it is likely that sequence motifs will often be present too, just as for the protein motifs in ELM and PROSITE.</p><p>While <sc>glam</sc>2 performs respectably on the BAliBASE multiple alignment benchmark, it is not the best tool for this kind of alignment, except perhaps for motif-like cases with N- and C-terminal extensions. <sc>glam</sc>2 is not really designed for extensive alignments such as these. Specifically, the following issues probably prevent it from performing better in this assessment:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><sc>glam</sc>2's simple motif model is not ideal for protein structural domains, because it does not favour multiple deletions in a row, and perhaps also because it does not distinguish insertion-opening and insertion-extension probabilities. These two properties could be added to our model, making it identical to a profile HMM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Durbin1">[58]</xref>. We believe that the mathematical development of <sc>glam</sc>2's scoring scheme and optimisation algorithm (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000071.s001">Text S1</xref>) could be adapted to this more complex model without fundamental difficulties. Better still, perhaps, would be a reticulate (branching) model accommodating partial order alignments (i.e. different subsets of sequences can be aligned to each other in different parts of the alignment) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Grasso1">[59]</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><p><sc>glam</sc>2's scoring scheme for a column of aligned residues assumes the sequences are equally and distantly related to one another, which is violated by construction in BAliBASE categories (2) and (3). One crude way to address this issue would be a weighting scheme that down-weights highly similar sequences.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Since <sc>glam</sc>2 can only adjust the number of key positions by one at a time, it can have difficulty optimising the alignment width, especially if it needs to extend over large insertions. We have no idea how to solve this problem (other than increasing <italic>n</italic>), but we are surprised how well <sc>glam</sc>2 does on BAliBASE category (5) with large insertions.</p></list-item><list-item><p><sc>glam</sc>2's scoring scheme is based on a Dirichlet mixture, whereas other alignment tools typically use a residue similarity matrix such as BLOSUM-62. Dirichlet mixture priors are more general and potentially more powerful than similarity matrices, but much harder to derive. Thus, we suspect there is more room for improvement in Dirichlet mixtures than in similarity matrices.</p></list-item></list><p>In all, we are pleasantly surprised that <sc>glam</sc>2 is as competitive on this assessment as it is.</p><p>It is sometimes desirable to search for multiple motifs, not just the strongest one. This can be accomplished by first obtaining the optimal <sc>glam</sc>2 motif, then masking the aligned instances of this motif using the companion <sc>glam</sc>2<sc>mask</sc> utility, and then re-running <sc>glam</sc>2.</p><p>Since <sc>glam</sc>2 always reports a motif, even for random sequences, it is often desirable to know whether a motif is statistically significant. Unfortunately this is not easy, but two approaches used with the original Gibbs sampler can be used here too <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Liu3">[29]</xref>. The first is to run <sc>glam</sc>2 on multiple shuffled versions of the original sequences, and observe how rarely the motif score for shuffled sequences exceeds the motif score for the original sequences. The second is to concatenate each original sequence with a shuffled version of itself, run <sc>glam</sc>2 on these hybrid sequences, and check whether the aligned segments occur in the original sequences more often than, or with higher marginal scores than, in the shuffled sequences. The statistical significance can be quantified using a Wilcoxon signed rank test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000071-Liu3">[29]</xref>. The second approach is faster, but lacks statistical power when there are few sequences. The tests described here assume that “statistically significant” means “with higher score than likely for randomly shuffled sequences”, which may or may not be appropriate.</p><p>We have presented an algorithm to detect similarities across multiple sequences, which bridges the gap between traditional motif discovery methods and multiple alignment techniques. It has a simple and general framework, which seems best suited to subtle, linear motifs with multiple insertions and deletions.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting
