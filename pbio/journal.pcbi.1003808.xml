<abstract>
<p>Linking networks of molecular interactions to cellular functions and phenotypes is a key goal in systems biology. Here, we adapt concepts of spatial statistics to assess the functional content of molecular networks. Based on the guilt-by-association principle, our approach (called SANTA) quantifies the strength of association between a gene set and a network, and functionally annotates molecular networks like other enrichment methods annotate lists of genes. As a general association measure, SANTA can (i) functionally annotate experimentally derived networks using a collection of curated gene sets and (ii) annotate experimentally derived gene sets using a collection of curated networks, as well as (iii) prioritize genes for follow-up analyses. We exemplify the efficacy of SANTA in several case studies using the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genetic interaction network and genome-wide RNAi screens in cancer cell lines. Our theory, simulations, and applications show that SANTA provides a principled statistical way to quantify the association between molecular networks and cellular functions and phenotypes. SANTA is available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SANTA.html" xlink:type="simple">http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SANTA.html</ext-link>.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Molecular networks are maps of the tens of thousands of interactions that occur between the components of biological systems. Types of interactions include physical, genetic and functional interactions between genes, gene products and metabolites. Network-based approaches to molecular biology are increasingly being used to better understand cellular functions. Currently, gene set methods can be used to functionally annotate the hits from high-throughput studies; however, no methods exist to functionally annotate molecular interaction networks. This greatly limits our ability to quantify the often subtle functional adaptions that occur in networks as they rewire to respond to external stimuli. Here, we extend well-tested concepts from spatial statistics to define a general association measure between networks and gene sets. Like Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, our approach measures concordant changes, but does this on networks, rather than on lists of genes. We validate it both in simulations and real-world case studies. We apply our approach to genetic interaction networks mapped under different conditions and created using different methods, and demonstrate how it extends the previous analyses of data sets, allowing us to better understand the high-level changes that occur within cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High-throughput studies, like measuring differential expression in RNA-seq experiments or morphological changes in RNAi screens, produce genome-wide data that are often difficult to interpret. Functional annotation of hits in such studies relies mostly upon gene set analysis methods, which measure an association between hits and pre-defined gene sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Ashburner1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Subramanian1">[2]</xref> by quantifying overlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Beissbarth1">[3]</xref> or concurrent trends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Subramanian1">[2]</xref>. These approaches generally treat hits as independent; only very few exploit an internal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Khatri1">[4]</xref>. Recently, many high-throughput studies have produced networks of physical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Vidal1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-RozenblattRosen1">[6]</xref> or genetic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Costanzo1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Laufer1">[9]</xref> interactions, rather than lists of hits. These networks can be even harder to interpret than lists of hits. While more and more networks are being generated, rigorous statistical methods to annotate their functional content are lacking, thereby making it difficult to identify and quantify any high-level changes. The need for rigorous functional analysis of networks becomes especially evident when trying to quantify the often subtle functional adaptions observed in networks specific to external stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Bandyopadhyay1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Gunol1">[11]</xref>, different phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Laufer1">[9]</xref>, cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Kiel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Wang1">[13]</xref>, or diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Pujana1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Sakai1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we develop methodology, called SANTA, for the rigorous and unbiased functional annotation of molecular networks. The basic input to SANTA are a network and a gene set and the output is the statistical significance of their association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003808-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Like Gene Set Enrichment Analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Subramanian1">[2]</xref>, SANTA measures concordant changes in phenotype, but extends this concept to networks rather than lists of genes. Our work is directly motivated by a study describing the functional content of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genetic interaction network by Costanzo <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Costanzo1">[7]</xref>. The iconic first figure of this paper shows a network connecting genes with similar genetic interaction profiles and nodes highlighted according to their membership to functional groups defined by the Gene Ontology. Costanzo <italic>et al.</italic> find that genes displaying tightly correlated profiles form discernible clusters corresponding to distinct bioprocesses and that the relative distance between distinct clusters appears to reflect shared functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Costanzo1">[7]</xref>. This is an important observation, because it shows which cellular functions are associated with the genetic interaction network. If the network had been generated under different experimental conditions that activate different processes in the cell, these functional associations would most probably have changed. Using SANTA, it is possible to quantify the significance of these changes in functional association in a principled statistical way, something not previously possible.</p>

<title>Overview of SANTA.</title>
<p>SANTA can be used both to quantify the strength of association between networks and sets of node weights (using <italic>K<sup>net</sup></italic>) and to prioritise genes for follow-up analyses (using <italic>K<sup>node</sup></italic>). Different node colour intensities represent different node weights.</p>

<title>SANTA rigorously implements an intuitive association measure</title>
<p>The roadmap for functional analysis of networks provided by Costanzo <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Costanzo1">[7]</xref> relies on assessing the clustering of selected nodes on the network. However, their analysis was done by eye and depends not only on the gene set and the network but also on the visualisation algorithm used. Clustering on a network is an intuitive measure of functional content, but without rigorous statistical methods the significance of observed patterns can not be assessed objectively. To address this problem, we have adapted well-tested concepts from spatial statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Ripley1">[16]</xref> to define an objective and quantitative association measure between networks and gene sets. SANTA (spatial analysis of network associations) is built on the guilt-by-association principle: if a gene set shows a surprising degree of clustering on a network, we call them ‘associated’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003808-g002">Figure 2C</xref>); if the gene set is randomly distributed over the network, we call them ‘not associated’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003808-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

<title>Application of the <italic>K<sup>net</sup></italic>-function to two gene sets.</title>
<p>Example input: (A) <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> GI map and (B) gene sets obtained from GO (‘GO:0044451: nucleoplasm part’ and ‘GO:0070011: peptidase activity’). (C, D) Network annotated with each gene set. From visual inspection, it appears that the gene set in (C) clusters more significantly than the gene set in (D). SANTA allows us to assess this clustering objectively. (E, F) The <italic>K<sup> net</sup></italic>-function is computed for the observed gene sets (red and blue lines) and for a large number of permutations (yellow area). (G, H) In order to quantify the significance of the clustering, the area under the <italic>K<sup>net</sup></italic>-function curve (AUK) is computed for the observed gene set (red and blue lines) and for each permutation (grey histogram). An empirical p-value is calculated using a Z-test. For GO:0044451, <italic>p</italic> = 5.680×10<sup>−30</sup> and for GO:0070011, <italic>p</italic> = 0.174, demonstrating objectively that the gene set in (C) does cluster more significantly.</p>

<title>Previous research</title>
<p>Enrichment analysis is a well-developed field and Khatri <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Khatri1">[4]</xref> recently described three ‘generations’ of statistical methods, from over-representation analysis and functional class scoring, to pathway-topology based approaches. While methods in the last category <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Rahnenfhrer1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Shojaie1">[19]</xref> use pathway topology to compute gene-level statistics, none of them can be directly applied to measure the functional content of a network. Two related approaches, the compactness score of PathExpand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Glaab1">[20]</xref> and EnrichNet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Glaab2">[21]</xref>, compare the clustering of two sets of genes on a network, but not the significance of the clustering of a single set. While the compactness score can be adapted to measure the significance of clustering, it focusses on the local structure of the network and can be less effective than SANTA to detect global effects, as we show below. Other approaches overlay interaction networks with genome-wide measurements and identify enriched subnetworks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Ideker1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Beisser1">[24]</xref>, to which enrichment analysis can then be applied in a consecutive step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Jia1">[25]</xref>. Again, subnetwork identification does not directly measure the association between gene sets and networks, and we show the effect of this difference in a comparison study.</p>
<p>In summary, no approach currently exists that, like SANTA, globally assesses the functional content of a network. In the following, we describe the methodology underlying SANTA and test its efficacy by applying it to both simulated and real data. Gene set enrichment methods have had a big impact on biological research and are used in almost every analysis of experimentally derived gene lists. The case studies we present in this paper show that SANTA has the potential to have a similar impact on all functional studies of network data.</p>

<title>Adapting Ripley's K-Function for networks</title>
<p>Spatial statistics model spatial correlation structures between observations (analogous to how time series analysis models the correlation between time points) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Gaetan1">[26]</xref>.

<p>In our scenario, we measure observations at fixed locations (the nodes in the graph) instead of random locations in the plane. However, we can still adapt basic spatial statistics methodology: In the following paragraphs we will define a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for weighted networks, called <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, by first defining distance measures on graphs (instead of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and then weighting each node by the strength of its phenotype. To adapt <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to networks, we formalised the problem using a node-labeled and edge-weighted graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nodes (vertices) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> a set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (undirected) edges between pairs of nodes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Node weights <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> correspond to the strength of a gene's phenotype (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or whether the gene is part of a particular functional group (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and edge weights <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> correspond to the strength or significance of interactions.</p>

<title>Graph distances</title>
<p>Distances between non-neighbouring nodes in this graph can be measured in many ways, including shortest path lengths, diffusion kernels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Kondor1">[28]</xref> and the mean first-passage time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-White1">[29]</xref>, which are all implemented in the SANTA software package. There are subtle differences in the aspects of the network structure incorporated within each measure. For example, a shortest-path approach will only take into consideration the one path with the shortest length, no matter how many other paths exist between two nodes. A diffusion kernel, on the other hand, takes into account all paths and will yield a smaller distance the better connected two nodes are. The results produced by SANTA are generally robust across distance measures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003808.s003">Figure S3</xref>), meaning that it often does not matter which method is chosen by the user. The shortest path distance method requires the least computational time and therefore we will mainly use this method in the paper. Efficient algorithms like Dijkstra's or Johnson's exist to compute shortest paths between all pairs of nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Cormen1">[30]</xref> and are conveniently implemented in software packages like ‘igraph’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Csardi1">[31]</xref>. However, the diffusion-kernel based distance measure is used to identify enriched subnetworks, as this method is seen to produce denser subnetworks.</p>
<p>Many of the graph distance algorithms assume that small edge-weights correspond to stronger functional association between the two nodes. Many networks, however, are built by correlation analysis, where stronger functional associations are shown by a larger weight. Thus, in practice, the edge weights in a given molecular network often need to be reweighed to be used as graph distances <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Due to differences between the methods used to create each molecular network, it is necessary to use a different approach when reweighing the edges of each network. Edges are reweighed so that the strongest interactions have a graph distance of 0 and the weaker the interaction the greater the distance (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>

<title>SANTA successfully identifies clustering on simulated networks</title>
<p>Functional annotation is an exploratory task without a general gold standard. In order to test the ability of SANTA to correctly identify clustered distributions of node weights on networks, we conducted a number of controlled simulations. In each of these simulations, we created a network containing a cluster of high weight vertices of a known strength and applied the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-function in order to determine whether it would successfully identify the clustering.</p>
<p>Each of the networks contained 500 nodes and was created using the Barabasi-Albert model of preferential attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Barabsi1">[32]</xref>. A seed node was chosen at random. All nodes in the network were ranked by their distance (using the shortest paths method) to the seed node and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> closest nodes chosen to be the sample set. A hit set was then created by choosing 5 nodes at random from the sample set. Different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (10, 20, 50, 100 and 500) were chosen to simulate different clustering strengths. A value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> equal to the number of nodes in the network is the same as randomly sampling nodes from the entire network.</p>
<p>As expected, SANTA identified more significant clustering when applied to hit sets created with smaller values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003808-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). When nodes are randomly sampled from the entire network, the p-values returned by SANTA were uniformly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003808-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), as expected when the null hypothesis is true.</p>

<title>SANTA incorporates the global structure of a network for functional association</title>
<p>One of the main advantages of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-function is that it considers the global topology of a network when measuring the significance of clustering. This can be demonstrated by comparing the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-function to an adapted version of the compactness score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Glaab1">[20]</xref>. The compactness score of a gene set is the mean distance between pairs of nodes in the gene set. It is used by the PathExpand tool to compare the clustering strength of different sets of nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Glaab1">[20]</xref>. By comparing the compactness score of an observed set of nodes to the compactness scores of permuted sets of nodes, it is possible to produce an empirical p-value describing clustering significance, much like the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-function.</p>
<p>Many real-world networks follow a power-law degree distribution and contain nodes with both a small and large number of interacting partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Barabsi1">[32]</xref>. If the genes in a gene set all have a large number of interacting partners, then the presence of interactions between the genes in the gene set could be considered less significant, as there is a greater likelihood that they would be observed by chance. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the global structure of the network and consider the number of nodes located near each node when quantifying clustering significance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003808-g004">Figure 4</xref> demonstrates that while the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-function incorporates the global structure of the network, the compactness score does not. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-function can also be applied to continuous distributions of node weights, while the compactness score can only be applied to binary sets, limiting its application. For these reasons, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-function is better suited to measuring the significance of clustering of node weights on real-world networks.</p>

<title>SANTA provides a complementary method of identifying enriched subnetworks</title>
<p>Next, we compared SANTA to approaches that overlay molecular networks with additional node information and identify a high-scoring subnetwork, using simulated and real data. A widely used example is BioNet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Beisser1">[24]</xref>, which identifies enriched subnetworks of nodes by fitting a beta-uniform mixture (BUM) model to the network in order to score nodes. Positive-scoring nodes are then aggregated and a minimum spanning tree calculated between these positive nodes. However, the presence of negative-scoring nodes between clusters can prevent BioNet from identifying multiple clusters. As the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-function considers each node individually, it is able to return high-scoring nodes spread across multiple clusters.</p>
<p>We conducted a number of simulations in order to compare the abilities of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and BioNet to identify high-scoring nodes located within multiple clusters on a network. In each simulation, a network containing 1000 nodes was created using the Barabasi-Albert model of preferential attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Barabsi1">[32]</xref>. 2, 3 or 4 nodes from distant parts of the network were selected to seed the clusters. For each seed node, 10 nodes were selected at random under a probability distribution that ensured that the probability of being chosen decreased exponentially with the distance from the seed node (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the seed node). The selected nodes became the high-weight nodes and were assigned node weights from a truncated normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, within the interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

If <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> high-weight nodes are applied to the network, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is said to have successfully identified a high-weight node if it is ranked within the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> nodes. BioNet successfully identifies a high-weight node if it is contained within the returned enriched subnetwork. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003808-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was able to successfully identify a greater proportion of labelled nodes than BioNet when 3 or more clusters were added to the network.

<title>Correlations in GI profile produce functionally more informative networks</title>
<p>For further validation, we applied SANTA to the global genetic interaction (GI) network of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where there is evidence that protein function is more closely related to the global similarity between GI profiles than to individual interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Costanzo1">[7]</xref>.

<title>Interaction networks provide different levels of information about cancer cell line maintenance</title>
<p>Different networks describe different aspects of cellular machinery: co-expression networks describe transcriptional effects, protein interaction networks describe complexes and genetic interaction networks describe epistatic buffering relationships.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SANTA is a general approach for functional annotation that extends enrichment analysis from gene sets to networks. SANTA combines the guilt-by-association principle, which is one of the most powerful paradigms for function prediction, with well-tested concepts adapted from spatial statistics. In this way, SANTA provides a rigorous implementation of an intuitive measure of functional annotation. We have applied SANTA to several datasets from different organisms and our results show how SANTA rigorously addresses the basic question of which functional processes are reflected in a network.</p>
<p>In yeast, our results on genetic interactions support the idea that a strong correlation of GI profiles between two genes is a greater indicator of shared function than the presence of a single GI. The reason for this increase in functional information is most probably that individual GIs don’t bear much evidence for underlying mechanisms, while having many GI partners in common is strong evidence for genes acting in the same pathway or complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Tong1">[45]</xref>. Additionally, Costanzo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Costanzo1">[7]</xref> noted that their network captured only 35% of the previously reported interactions, indicating that a large number of false positives and false negatives may be present within GI networks. Networks of correlations in GI profile may be more robust to the high number of errors that are present when GIs are mapped.</p>
<p>Extending these results to networks rewired under external stimulation, we show how SANTA quantifies subtle functional changes. In humans, we showed how SANTA can contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying large RNAi screens. Testing the association of hits with many different networks (transcriptional, proteomic, genetic) can help us to understand which cellular mechanisms underly the phenotypes. In summary, our results support that SANTA accurately quantifies the functional content of networks, points to mechanisms underlying observed phenotypes, and provides a natural way to compare functional changes across networks.</p>
<p>We expect SANTA to contribute mostly to the functional annotation of networks derived under different environmental conditions (like the GI networks we used as case studies here). However, SANTA is a very general approach and the examples we presented here also show other uses: it can also be used to annotate RNAi hits (if different functional networks are available) and prioritise individual hits over others (using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). In the future, we see many further opportunities for applying SANTA. For example, new methods of automated, single-cell phenotyping measure genetic interaction networks across a broad spectrum of phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Laufer1">[9]</xref> and a functional annotation method like SANTA could have great impact on understanding which cellular processes are reflected in which phenotype. Another potential application for SANTA lies in network-based medicine, where drug development for complex diseases is developing towards targeting dynamic network states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Barabsi2">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Erler1">[48]</xref> and network-based analysis has identified cancer subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Hofree1">[49]</xref>. Functional annotation of these networks will further our understanding of the biology underlying these diseases.</p>
<p>Gene set enrichment analysis is the first step in the unbiased analysis of most experimentally derived gene lists and we expect SANTA to have a similar impact on all functional studies of network data.</p>

<title>Shortest paths distance measure</title>
<p>There are a number of different methods available to calculate the distance between a pair of nodes in a network. One of the simplest methods involves identifying the shortest path connecting the node pair and using the length of this path. The shortest paths distance measure can be applied to networks with or without weighted edges. In unweighted networks, the shortest path is equal to the number of edges included within the shortest path. In weighted networks, it is the sum of the edge weights along the shortest path.</p>
<p>A number of different algorithms are available to compute the shortest path between two nodes. Which algorithm is most efficient depends on the type of network being analysed. If no edge weights are present, then the breadth-first search algorithm is ideal. If edge weights are present and each edge weight is non-negative, then Dijkstra's algorithm is more efficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Cormen1">[30]</xref>.</p>

<title>Diffusion kernel-based distance measure</title>
<p>The diffusion kernel-based distance measure is another method of calculating distances between pairs of nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Kondor1">[28]</xref>. An advantage of the diffusion kernel-based method over the shortest-paths method is that whilst the shortest-paths method calculates the distance along a single path, the diffusion kernel-based method incorporates distances along multiple paths. Like the shortest paths method, the diffusion kernel-based method can also be applied to networks with or without edge weights. One interpretation of the method is the continuous time limit of a random walk across the network, resulting in highly-connected nodes being associated with smaller node pair distances.</p>

<p>Gene expression data for two subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL): germinal center B-like phenotype (GCB, 112 tumors) and activated B-like phenotype (ABC, 82 tumors), was obtained from the R package DLBCL, version 1.3.7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Dittrich1">[50]</xref>. This package also contains data on patient survival. The data originally comes from a study of patient survival after chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Rosenwald1">[33]</xref>. P-values for differential expression and risk association were produced using Cox regression. These p-values were combined using second-order statistics in order to produce gene-wise association scores which could be applied to the networks. Gene-wise p-values were converted into node weights using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003808.e156">Equation 15</xref>.</p>

<title>Gene Ontology database</title>
<p>The Gene Ontology (GO) database consists of a hierarchical structure of gene annotations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Ashburner1">[1]</xref>. Annotations from this database were used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003808-g006">Figure 6</xref>. The GO database consists of 3 top-level ontologies: molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components, all of which were used in each figure. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> GO term annotations were retrieved from the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org" xlink:type="simple">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>) using the R package org.Sc.sgd.db, version 2.10.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Carlson1">[51]</xref>.</p>

<title>Compactness score</title>
<p>The compactness score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is defined as the mean shortest path distance between pairs of nodes in a set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on graph <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003808-Glaab1">[20]</xref>.<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003808.e160"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003808.e160" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(16)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>In order to measure the significance of the observed compactness score, we compared it to scores produced using sets of randomly permuted hits. An empirical p-value for the observed compactness score is calculated using a Z-test.</p>

<title>Implementation</title>
<p>The methodology described in this work has been assembled as an R package called SANTA, which is available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SANTA.html" xlink:type="simple">http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SANTA.html</ext-link>. This package is distributed with the code (in the form of a vignette, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003808.s007">Text S1</xref>) and the data required to reproduce all of the results given in this paper. The vignette also contains the parameters used with the Barabasi-Albert model of preferential attachment to create the simulated networks. The running time of SANTA depends on the size of the network and the number of permutations being run. Using 1000 permutations, SANTA requires 1GB of RAM and 25 seconds on a single Intel Xeon E5-2640 to measure the strength of association of a single gene set on the raw Costanzo et al. GI network (78,701 interactions between 4,326 genes). SANTA can use parallel computing (where available) to reduce running time.</p>
