        <p>A combination of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements can impose the formation of an early replicating domain in a naturally late replicating region and might constitute the basic unit of early replicating domains.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>The nuclear genomes of vertebrates show a highly organized program of DNA replication where GC-rich isochores are replicated early in S-phase, while AT-rich isochores are late replicating. GC-rich regions are gene dense and are enriched for active transcription, suggesting a connection between gene regulation and replication timing. Insulator elements can organize independent domains of gene transcription and are suitable candidates for being key regulators of replication timing. We have tested the impact of inserting a strong replication origin flanked by the β-globin HS4 insulator on the replication timing of naturally late replicating regions in two different avian cell types, DT40 (lymphoid) and 6C2 (erythroid). We find that the HS4 insulator has the capacity to impose a shift to earlier replication. This shift requires the presence of HS4 on both sides of the replication origin and results in an advance of replication timing of the target locus from the second half of S-phase to the first half when a transcribed gene is positioned nearby. Moreover, we find that the USF transcription factor binding site is the key <italic>cis</italic>-element inside the HS4 insulator that controls replication timing. Taken together, our data identify a combination of <italic>cis</italic>-elements that might constitute the basic unit of multi-replicon megabase-sized early domains of DNA replication.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>All eukaryotic organisms must duplicate their genome precisely once before cell division. This occurs according to an established temporal program during S-phase (when DNA synthesis takes place) of the cell cycle. In vertebrates, this program is regulated at the level of large chromosomal domains ranging from 200 kb to 2 Mb, but the molecular mechanisms that control the temporal firing order of animal replication origins are not clearly understood. Using the genetically tractable chicken DT40 cell system, we identified a minimal combination of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory DNA elements that is able to shift the timing of a naturally “mid-late” replicated region to “mid-early.” This critical group of elements is composed of one strong replication origin flanked by binding sequences for the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) protein. The additional presence of a strongly transcribed gene shifted the region towards an even earlier replication time, suggesting cooperation between <italic>cis</italic>-elements when establishing temporal programs of replication. We speculate that USF binding sequences cooperate with sites of replication initiation and transcribed genes to promote the establishment of early replicating domains along vertebrate genomes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The nuclear genome of higher eukaryotes is replicated according to an established temporal program. Although replication timing has been precisely analyzed in many cell types from several organisms, the molecular mechanisms involved in its regulation are still poorly characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Hiratani1">[1]</xref>. It is now well established that there is an important correlation between replication timing and gene regulation with GC-rich and gene-rich regions replicating early and AT-rich and gene-poor regions replicating late <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-FarkashAmar1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Woodfine1">[4]</xref>. However, two recent genome-wide studies in mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> show that this relationship is indirect, since a large fraction of late-replicating genes (about 20%) are expressed and some genes change transcription without change in replication timing and vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Schwaiger1">[6]</xref>. The simplest explanation is that replication timing is related to chromosomal organization rather than transcription. Several studies suggest that post-translational histone modifications directly regulate replication timing, but the effects of altering particular modifications are relatively minor in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Goren1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Vogelauer1">[8]</xref>. The <italic>cis</italic> tethering of histone acetyltransferase activity adjacent to the human <italic>β-globin</italic> origin of replication induced only a weak shift in replication timing from late to mid-late S-phase in lymphocytes, suggesting that this signal is insufficient to organize the early domain of replication that exists in erythroid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Goren1">[7]</xref>. The disruption of histone modifications <italic>in trans</italic> following the genetic knockout of histone modifying enzymes also results in minor changes in replication timing. Only a minority (5/23) of 23 single copy loci displayed a weak shift of replication timing in a panel of mutant mouse ES cell lines that were disrupted for histone deacetylation; H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 methylation; or DNA methylation activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Jorgensen1">[9]</xref>. Depletion of H3K9me2 has no effect on replication timing genome-wide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Yokochi1">[10]</xref>. A direct role for histone modifications in the regulation of early replication timing remains to be demonstrated in vertebrates. One hypothesis is that they may represent a secondary, fine-tuning role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Wu1">[11]</xref>. In contrast, origin efficiency is not dependent on canonical histone marks such as H3 or H4 acetylation or di- or trimethylation of H3K4 in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Cadoret1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Prioleau1">[17]</xref>. However, it was shown that histone acetylation is critical for replication origin activation at the amplified <italic>Drosophila chorion</italic> locus and that insulator elements protect amplification of this origin from position effect, suggesting that some specific origins might be controlled by histone tails modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Aggarwal1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Lu1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In general, euchromatic domains reside in the interior of the nucleus and replicate in early S-phase, whereas heterochromatic domains localize to the nuclear periphery or near nucleoli and replicate late <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Grasser1">[20]</xref>. In every case examined, the dynamic changes in replication timing observed during development are accompanied by sub-nuclear repositioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Zhou1">[21]</xref>. Moreover, replication timing is re-established during early G1-phase at the timing decision point (TDP), coincident with the repositioning of chromosomal domains in the nucleus after mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Dimitrova1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Li2">[24]</xref>. Therefore, the molecular events that direct the organization of discrete chromosomal domains are also predicted to play an important role in regulating replication timing. The <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA elements that organize such genomic domains, particularly those that are replicated in the first half of S-phase, remain to be determined.</p>
      <p>Insulator elements have been found to set the boundaries of transcriptionally active and repressive chromatin domains and represent candidate regulators of early DNA replication domain organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Gaszner1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-West1">[27]</xref>. Insulators can be used in a transgenic context to shield transgenes from chromosomal position effect, where the chromatin environment around an integration site can dominantly silence or enhance transgene expression. The majority of random integration sites in vertebrates result in pervasive chromosomal silencing, but a minor fraction of loci are permissive to transgene expression, with a slight portion under the control of an endogenous enhancer. The biochemical activities that underlie the protection from these two types of regulatory interference are different, and the elements that are involved have distinct names: those that can block activation by enhancers are known as enhancer-blocking insulators, whereas those that protect against chromosomal silencing are known as barrier insulators.</p>
      <p>The first insulator element to be identified in vertebrates is HS4, which lies at the 5′ boundary of the chicken <italic>β-globin</italic> domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Chung1">[28]</xref>. A 275 bp compound HS4 element harbors separable enhancer-blocking and barrier activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Bell1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-RecillasTarga1">[31]</xref>. HS4's enhancer-blocking activity is mediated by a single binding site (FII) for the ubiquitously expressed zinc finger protein CTCF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Bell1">[29]</xref>. HS4's barrier function depends on four transcription factor binding sites (FI, FIII, FIV, and FV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-RecillasTarga1">[31]</xref>. The FIV site is bound by the ubiquitous transcription factors USF1 and USF2, which recruit a panel of active histone modifications that interrupt the spread of repressive histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Huang1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-West2">[34]</xref>. The remaining barrier sites FI, FIII, and FV, each bound by the broadly expressed zinc finger protein VEZF1, mediate protection from DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Dickson1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Replication origins have been precisely mapped along the chicken <italic>β-globin</italic> locus in the early erythroid cell line 6C2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Prioleau1">[17]</xref>. This region is replicated by a group of four origins located at the 5′ HS4 insulator, 5′ and 3′ of the <italic>ρ-globin</italic> gene, and inside the promoter of the <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> gene. The globin genes are not expressed in 6C2 cells, and only the replication origin overlapping the HS4 insulator is marked by active histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Litt1">[36]</xref>. Moreover, the chicken <italic>β-globin</italic> locus is replicated early in S-phase independently of globin gene expression in contrast to the paralogue human <italic>β-globin</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Prioleau1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Epner1">[37]</xref>. In this study, we explored the possibility that the HS4 insulator may establish early DNA replication timing when inserted into a locus that is normally replicated in late or mid-late S-phase. To do so, we studied the effect of targeting insulator constructs on the timing of a mid-late replicating locus in DT40 lymphoid cells. We also studied the replication timing of insulator containing transgenes that are randomly integrated into erythroid cells.</p>
      <p>Our data show that the introduction of the strong <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> replication origin flanked by HS4 insulator elements can significantly advance the replication timing of a mid-late replicating region. Surprisingly, the insulator activities of the HS4 element are not required for the imposition of earlier replication. We find that the USF protein binding site from the HS4 insulator is sufficient to control replication timing. Moreover, we demonstrate that USF binding sites need to flank the origin in order to drive a replication timing shift. The shift to earlier replication becomes dramatic when a transcriptionally active promoter is combined with HS4 insulators.</p>

        <title>Selection of a 100 kb Mid-Late Replicating Region That Is Devoid of Origins</title>
        <p>Our aim was to identify combinations of <italic>cis</italic>-elements capable of imposing early replication timing in a naturally late replicating region. To do so, we employed the efficient homologous recombination capacity of the chicken lymphoid DT40 cell line as a model system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Caldwell1">[38]</xref>. We decided to target an isogenic locus that is replicated in the second part of S-phase and is devoid of replication origins. Firstly, we determined the genome-wide replication timing profiles of DT40 cells following pulse labeling with BrdU and cell sorting into three fractions (early, mid, and late S-phase). BrdU labeled nascent DNA from early and late fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-BrdU antibody, amplified, differentially labeled, and co-hybridized onto a whole chicken genome oligonucleotide microarray. The log<sub>2</sub>-ratio of the abundance of each genomic probe in the early and late S-phase fractions generates a replication-timing profile that reveals early and late replicated domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Exclusion of the mid-replicated fraction increases the intensity of the differences between early and late replicating domains without changing the global shape of the pattern (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). We made replicate experiments with nascent strands extracted from cells sorted into early and late-replicating DNA fractions, which were reciprocally labeled (“dye-switch”) prior to hybridization. The mirror image of the timing profiles reflects a high degree of correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We also constructed a whole genome map of replication origins in DT40 cells to allow the identification of origin free regions. We prepared four independent biological samples of short nascent strands (SNS) from 10<sup>8</sup> cells as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Prioleau1">[17]</xref>. SNS, by contrast to NS, which are synthesized along the whole genome, are only enriched at replication starting points. SNS were pooled and made double stranded by random-priming and ligation. DNA was then fragmented and two different libraries were constructed and subject to high throughput sequencing. A total of 60 million uniquely mapped reads were generated. We arbitrarily selected a mid-late replicating region on chicken chromosome 1 that is devoid of replication origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g002">2</xref>). The chromosomal landscape of the chosen integration site in DT40 cells is AT-rich and lacks transcriptionally active genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The closest origins, detected by deep sequencing and validated by qPCR, are located 58 kb upstream and 80 kb downstream of the site of insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We analyzed replication timing more precisely by sorting BrdU pulse-labeled cells into four S-phase fractions, from early to late (S1–S4). We quantified nascent strands (NS) across the chromosomal region surrounding the site of integration. The region from 140 kb upstream to 150 kb downstream of the site of integration was found to be mid-late replicating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), in agreement with our genome-wide profiling of replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In conclusion, we identified and selected a 100 kb intergenic region devoid of replication origins that is replicated in mid-late S-phase. The capacity to specifically target this region by homologous recombination gave us a model system in which we can test the effect of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements on replication dynamics in a very controlled manner.</p>

            <p>(A) Replication timing profile along a portion of Chromosome 1 is shown. This profile was obtained with cells sorted into three fractions (early, mid-, and late S-phase). After immunoprecipitation, BrdU pulse-labeled nascent DNA from early and late fractions was differentially labeled and cohybridized to a chicken whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray at a density of one probe every 5.6 kb. The log<sub>2</sub>-ratio (early/late) of the abundance of each probe in the early and late S-phase is shown. Early and late domains are in red and green, respectively. The chosen site of insertion is indicated. Below annotated genes, human proteins and CpG islands are shown. (B) Replicate experiments with nascent strands extracted from cells sorted into two fractions, early and late-replicating DNA, were reciprocally labeled (“dye-switch”) and hybridized. The log<sub>2</sub>-ratio timing profiles were smoothed using the Moving Average option of the Agilent Genomic Workbench 5.0 software with the linear algorithm and 200 kb windows (log<sub>2</sub>(Early/Late) blue and log<sub>2</sub>(Late/Early) pink). The mirror image shows the high degree of correlation between replicates.</p>

        <title>The Combination of a Strong Replicator, Transcription, and Histone Acetylation Is Not Sufficient to Impose Early Replication</title>
        <p>We used homologous recombination in DT40 cells to target transgenes carrying combinations of regulatory elements into one allele at chr1: 74,813,240. We isolated and quantified NS produced at the site of integration on either the allele containing the transgene (With), the wild type allele (Without), or both alleles (Both) during early to late S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). We present analyses from single independent cell sorts, where each data point is the average of at least two independent PCR quantifications. Analyses of both alleles should display an average picture of the profiles obtained on each allele, thus providing a validation of the PCR quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We have analyzed two independent clones or two cell sorts to confirm the robust reproducibility of the timing profiles shown. Finally, in order to compare precisely the extent of the replication timing shift between constructs, we calculate for each cell line the changes occurring on late fractions (ΔL) and on the earliest fraction (ΔE) as follows: ΔL = [%(S3+S4) With−%(S3+S4) Without] and ΔE = [%S1 With]−[%S1 Without] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The addition of S2 to S1 would lead to a number equal in absolute value to the sum of change in S3 and S4. We therefore decided to calculate only the change in S1 that provides complementary information on the extent of the replication timing shift. We consider that we have a significant replication timing shift when ΔL≤−10% and ΔE≥+5%.</p>

        <p>In the first targeting experiment, we introduced a blasticidin resistance transgene under the control of the strong chicken <italic>β-actin</italic> promoter. Cells are maintained in the presence of blasticidin and must therefore continue to transcribe the resistance gene. When comparing the allele carrying the blasticidin resistance gene with the wild type allele, we observe a faint shift in replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) (ΔL = −10% and ΔE = +5%). Analysis of both alleles shows an intermediate profile. Therefore, the introduction of an actively transcribed gene has little impact on replication timing at this chromosomal region. We then added the strong <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> origin (the <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter) to this transgene, which results in a more pronounced shift in replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) (ΔL = −16% and ΔE = +9%). We confirmed that the <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter has strong origin activity at this chromosomal site as it is highly enriched in short nascent strands (SNS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, primer pair 2). We also detected origin activity at the <italic>β-actin</italic> promoter, although lower than that at the <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, primer pair 3). This is in agreement with the observation that the blasticidin resistance transgene under the control of the strong chicken <italic>β-actin</italic> promoter induces a faint replication timing shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays for histone H3 acetylation (H3K9acK14ac) and histone H4 density. We found that the adjacent <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter replicator and <italic>β-actin</italic> promoter are highly enriched for H3 acetylation and are locally depleted of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, these results show that transcriptionally active, open chromatin is not sufficient to trigger a significant shift to early replication, despite the proximity of a strong origin. This replication timing shift is similar to the one previously obtained when the human β-globin origin is located near a site of histone acetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Goren1">[7]</xref> (ΔL = −14% and ΔE = +3%) and therefore suggests that H3 acetylation only acts to fine tune the regulation of replication timing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Wu1">[11]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Flanking a Strong Origin with Insulator Elements Induces a Substantial Shift Toward Earlier Replication</title>
        <p>We next tested whether additional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements might cause a more dramatic replication timing shift toward the first half of S-phase. To this aim, we made use of transgenes flanked by HS4 insulator elements, which are protected from chromosomal silencing and also contain the <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter replicator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-RecillasTarga1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-West2">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Dickson1">[35]</xref>.

We reasoned that such protected chromatin environment could be important for the formation of an early replicated domain. The <italic>IL-2R</italic> reporter transgene with its erythroid-specific regulatory elements and two flanking copies of the HS4 insulator were integrated with the selection marker gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of IL-2R expression that the transgene is weakly transcribed or inactive in the lymphoid DT40 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Despite the lack of transcriptional activity from the transgene, this construct induces a substantial shift in replication timing from the second half to the first half of S-phase (ΔL = −37% and ΔE = +12% for clone 1, ΔL = −31% and ΔE = +9% for clone 2).

        <p>We next assessed whether the addition of only two copies of the 275 bp core HS4 insulator element next to the <italic>β<sup>A</sup></italic> replicator was sufficient to increase a shift toward mid-early replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

This suggests that the HS4 insulator has to flank the <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter replicator in order to control replication timing, although we cannot exclude the contribution of other <italic>cis</italic>-elements found in our construct such as the β/ε enhancer.

        <title>USF Elements Can Regulate Replication Timing</title>
        <p>We next examined which components of the HS4 element contribute to the control of replication. The HS4 insulator is a composite element containing five binding sites (FI-FV) for three different insulator proteins: CTCF (FII), VEZF1 (FI, FIII, and FV), and USF1/USF2 (FIV). The USF binding site is required for the recruitment of active histone modifications to the HS4 insulator and USF1 interacts with histone modifying enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Huang1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-West2">[34]</xref>. Given that histone acetylation was shown to control replication timing in S. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and mildly influence replication timing in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Goren1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Vogelauer1">[8]</xref>, we therefore considered that the USF binding element FIV might be the key regulatory element providing timing information in our system. To address this issue, we assembled a construct where the HS4 insulators were substituted with two copies of 23 bp HS4 fragments containing the USF site FIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We analyzed two independent clones and found that this construct imposes a shift to earlier replication timing which is comparable to the one observed using the whole insulator (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g006">Figure 6A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) (ΔL = −26% and ΔE = +14% for clone 1, ΔL = −32% and ΔE = +8% for clone 2). Therefore, the USF binding site and the activities it recruits is the key component of HS4 that controls replication timing. We also wanted to address whether active transcription was required to provide a significant replication shift. Thus far, every construct that induces a significant shift contains the very efficient <italic>β-actin</italic> promoter and the <italic>blasticidin</italic> resistance gene. Every construct in our targeting experiments was integrated into a DT40 cell line that constitutively expresses an inactivated Cre recombinase fused to the mutated estrogen receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Arakawa1">[39]</xref>. The blasticidin resistance marker gene, which is flanked by two mutant loxP sites, is readily excised by transient induction of Cre recombinase activity with 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. We validated the correct excision by PCR and tested replication timing in a new isolated clone. We generated clones in which the blasticidin gene cassette was excised following Cre induction, leaving the <italic>IL-2R</italic> transgene flanked by FIV sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Replication timing analyses of two independent clones showed that although the <italic>IL-2R</italic> transgene is transcriptionally inactive, this construct has the capacity to induce a significant replication timing shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) (ΔL = −16% and ΔE = +4% for clone 1, ΔL = −19% and ΔE = +4% for clone 2). This effect is weaker than the construct linked to the β-actin promoter, consistent with a cooperation between <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the control of the extent of the replication timing shift (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g006">Figure 6A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

        <p>It has been shown previously that this USF binding site is responsible for the recruitment of several histone modifications associated with open chromatin to the endogenous HS4 insulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-West2">[34]</xref>. We used native chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to monitor histone modifications in DT40 cells following the integration of transgenes flanked by FIV USF sites. Prior to transgene integration, the target locus is highly enriched in the repressive mark H3K27me3, and devoid of active chromatin marks such as acetylated histones H3 and H2A.Z, or methylated H3K4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). We find that the FIV USF site is sufficient to recruit the active chromatin marks H3K4me2 and acetylated H3, and incorporate acetylated H2A.Z at the transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s001">Figure S1C</xref>–E). The level of these marks at the single copy transgene are 40%–50% of the levels observed at the endogenous HS4 insulator, consistent with a similar performance of the transgenic and endogenous USF sites in DT40 cells. The presence of the FIV USF sites also results in a depletion of H3K27me3 at the target site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). Mutation of the FIV USF sites considerably reduces the recruitment of active marks and there is no depletion of H3K27me3 at the transgene site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s001">Figure S1C</xref>–F). Altogether, these data support the hypothesis that active histone modifications may play a role in advancing replication timing.</p>

        <title>USF Binding Sites Need to Flank the Origin in Order to Drive a Replication Timing Shift</title>
        <p>Our experiments have shown that the integration of an origin flanked by HS4 or FIV insulator sequences can induce a shift toward early replication. However, the integration of the β<sup>A</sup> promoter/origin with HS4 insulator sequences only on one side does not significantly increase the replication timing shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that it is necessary to surround an origin with insulator sequences to achieve a significant replication timing shift. In order to confirm this, we analyzed a new construct where four copies of FIV are located just upstream of the β<sup>A</sup> promoter/origin. This 4× FIV (one side) construct has the same genetic content as that containing pairs of flanking FIV sites (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g007">Figure 7B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). We generated two independent clones that carry the 4× FIV construct, both of which showed a very weak replication timing shift (ΔL = −8% and ΔE = −2% for clone 1, ΔL = +5% and ΔE = +1% for clone 2). The significant differences observed in the replication timing shift between the 2× FIV (flanking) and 4× FIV (one side) clones demonstrate that the flanking of an origin with sequences that recruit USF proteins is critical for replication timing advancement. Finally, it remains plausible that USF binding sites can induce a replication timing shift in the absence of a proximal replicator. In order to prove that USF binding sites need to cooperate with a functional replicator, we generated two independent clones containing a construct similar to the one described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g006">Figure 6B</xref> but deleted for the β<sup>A</sup> promoter/origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

        <title>The <italic>β<sup>A</sup></italic> Origin Flanked by USF Binding Sites Creates an Independent Early Replicating Domain</title>
        <p>We next asked whether the early replication timing we observe at the transgene integration site extends into flanking chromosomal regions. This should depend on the presence of active origins nearby, the capacity of transgenic <italic>cis</italic>-elements to influence the replication timing of remote origins, and the speed of replication forks coming from the transgene. We targeted a DT40 cell line containing the 2× FIV (flanking) construct linked to the blasticidin gene on one allele with a similar construct carrying the puromycin resistance gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). The targeting of both alleles with a construct that resulted in the largest timing shift at the integration site allows us to study the advancement of replication timing at remote sites. We then analyzed replication timing using primer pairs located inside the transgene (With), near the site of integration (Both), at the flanking endogenous origins (Ori L and Ori R) and distantly from the site of integration (∼150 kb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g009">Figure 9A</xref>).</p>

        <p>We determined earlier that the replication timing for 150 kb around the integration site is consistently mid-late replicating in non-transgenic DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with our earlier analysis of targeting one allele, integration of the 2× FIV transgene construct at both alleles results in a shift to earlier replication at the integration site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). The replication timing patterns for the With and Both primer pairs are indistinguishable, confirming that both alleles are correctly targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Replication timing at the nearest endogenous origins Ori L (−58 kb) and Ori R (+80 kb) is comparable to the integration site in clone 2, but slightly delayed in clone 1. However, the transgene-induced shift to early replication diminishes significantly at positions −140 kb and +150 kb in both clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). DNA replication in chicken DT40 cells is mostly bi-directional, where the average rate of fork progression is ∼1.5 kb/min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-MayaMendoza1">[40]</xref>. We would anticipate that forks should advance ∼90 kb from the site of replication initiation during the 1 h BrdU pulse labeling. Our observations indicate that only the integrated transgenes contain mid-early firing origins. The advanced replication timing of their chromosomal neighborhood appears to be due to the uni-directional progression of a replication fork initiated at the <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> replicator, showing that replication timing is locally controlled at one individual replicon.</p>

        <title>Insulator Constructs Induce Replication Timing Shifts at Other Chromosomal Loci</title>
        <p>We have shown that the HS4 insulator in cooperation with other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements can induce the early replication of a specific mid-late replicating locus in DT40 cells. Next, we wanted to address whether similar constructs could induce earlier replication at other chromosomal loci and in another cell type.

        <p>We then mapped replication origins across the <italic>IL-2R</italic> transgene by quantifying the abundance of short nascent strands (SNS). We find that the <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter performs as an autonomous replicator as it displays strong replication activity at various exogenous loci. For the two cell lines, SNS enrichment at the transgenic <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter (position 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s002">Figure S2A and C</xref>) is greater or equal to that at the endogenous <italic>ρ-globin</italic> origin of replication (P), and at least 20 times higher than an endogenous negative control locus (N) that is devoid of origin activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). We also find that, like inside the endogenous locus, transgenic HS4 elements (positions 1 and 4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s002">Figure S2A and C</xref>) tend to be enriched in SNS, although never as highly as the <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter.</p>
        <p>We mapped the genomic locations and replication timing of the ΔFII and ΔFIII transgene integration sites. The transgene flanked by ΔFII insulators is located within an AT-rich region lacking CpG islands (CGI) and the nearest known gene is over a megabase away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). The integration site of the ΔFII transgene is a naturally late replicating region and insertion of the transcriptionally active transgene induces a dramatic shift of replication timing to mid-early S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g010">Figure 10C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s002">Figure S2D</xref>) (ΔL = −63% and ΔE = +18%). The transgene flanked by ΔFIII insulators is also located in an intergenic region, but within a more GC-rich context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). We found that the integration site of the ΔFIII transgene is naturally a mid-late replicating region and insertion of the transgene induces a dramatic shift of replication timing to early S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g010">Figure 10C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s002">Figure S2D</xref>) (ΔL = −53% and ΔE = +39%). This replication shift occurs despite the transcriptional silencing and DNA methylation of this transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Dickson1">[35]</xref>. We note that the replication timing shifts observed in these two erythroid 6C2 cell lines are greater than those seen with similar constructs in DT40 cells. This may be due to inherent differences between the chromosomal loci studied or may be due to an additional contribution of the β/ε enhancer which is functional only in erythroid cells.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that the insertion of a transgene containing a strong replicator, flanked by HS4 insulators in proximity to a transcribed gene, shifts the timing of two heterologous late replicating loci to early S-phase in erythroid cells. Moreover, neither the enhancer blocking nor barrier activities of the HS4 insulator are required to induce this important shift. We note that despite the loss of barrier activity and transgene silencing, the ΔFIII mutant insulators in the same cell line we studied here remain bound by USF proteins and recruit active histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-West2">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Dickson1">[35]</xref>. The ΔFIII transgene in erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g010">Figure 10</xref>) therefore functions in the same way as the transgene flanked by FIV USF sites in lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Taken together, our results show that USF binding sites can induce the early firing of a proximal replicator in an otherwise late replicating chromosomal environment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The molecular mechanisms that control the replication timing program in metazoan are not clearly understood. To what degree the firing of individual replicons is controlled by the chromosomal environment and whether they can be regulated independently remain open questions. There is growing evidence that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements known to organize higher order chromatin structure can influence DNA replication in addition to the regulation of gene transcription. In this study, we have addressed whether a well-characterized insulator element that is known to organize discrete chromosomal domains can control the replication timing of proximal origins. We have carried out most of our analyses in a DT40 model system, where different combinations of gene regulatory elements are integrated into an isogenic test locus. This allows the direct comparison of their ability to control the initiation and timing of DNA replication.</p>
      <p>We found that the chicken <italic>β<sup>A</sup>-globin</italic> promoter origin satisfies the definition of a replicator since it is a strong replication initiation site at different chromosomal loci, and its origin activity does not require transcriptional activity. The timing of replication firing from the <italic>β<sup>A</sup></italic> origin follows that of its chromatin environment. However, when the <italic>β<sup>A</sup></italic> replicator is flanked by HS4 insulator elements, it can direct early replication in an otherwise mid-late replicating region. The additional proximity of a transcriptionally active gene can further advance replication from this origin to the first half of S-phase.</p>
      <p>A previous study in murine cells used recombinase-mediated cassette exchange to study the ability of various combinations of <italic>cis</italic>-elements to influence the replication timing of a randomly selected locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Lin1">[41]</xref>. It was found that constructs containing a portion of the human <italic>β-globin</italic> locus control region could advance replication timing, but that the introduction of the antibiotic resistance gene used for selection was already sufficient by itself to drive the observed shift. This differs from our study where the insertion of a similar transgene driven the strong <italic>β-actin</italic> promoter results in a minor shift in replication timing. One explanation could be that the site of insertion used in the previous study is more prone to a replication timing shift than the one we have selected. Irrespective of the potential inherent differences between chromosomal environments, we found that constructs which combine a replicator with insulator sequences and a strong promoter can drive dramatic shifts toward early replication at three different chromosomal loci in two different avian cell types.</p>

        <title>The Potential Role of the Chromatin Environment in Regulating Origin Firing</title>
        <p>This study identifies the chicken <italic>β-globin</italic> HS4 insulator element as a potential regulator of origin firing. The shift to early replication of the <italic>β<sup>A</sup></italic> replicator was achieved only when the origin was flanked on both sides by insulator sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g011">Figure 11B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s006">Table S1</xref>). The HS4 elements may be shielding the <italic>β<sup>A</sup></italic> replicator from processes in its chromosomal environment that suppress early firing. A recent genome-wide study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that H4K16 acetylation (a chromatin modification characteristic of active domains) is more closely correlated with early replication than it is with transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Schwaiger1">[6]</xref>, suggesting that active histone marks such as this might be involved in replication timing control. Our study pinpoints the binding site for USF proteins as the key <italic>cis</italic>-element of the HS4 insulator responsible for the induction of early replication timing control. The USF site is sufficient to direct active H3K4 methylation and histone acetylation, supporting the view that active histone modifications at an origin might favor earlier replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g011">Figure 11C</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) In wt DT40 cells, the selected site of insertion is located in a mid-late replicating region devoid of strong replication origin. One hypothesis is that this locus is naturally located more toward the nuclear envelope (NE). (B) Insertion of a strong replicator linked to two copies of the HS4 insulator or four binding sites for USF (FIV) does not induce a replication timing shift. The replication timing of the transgenic replicator follows that of its chromosomal environment. (C) Flanking the strong replicator with two copies of FIV induces a significant replication timing shift and recruitment of histone modifying enzymes. This could be accompanied by the formation of a small loop that relocates the replicator more toward the interior of the nucleus. The increased accessibility to S-phase kinases could be either due to local decondensation of the chromatin structure and/or to the nuclear repositioning of the modified chromosomal region. (D) The addition of a strong promoter nearby increases the replication timing shift and leads to the formation of an independent mid-early replicon.</p>

        <p>In eukaryotic genomes, DNA replication timing and the positioning of chromosomal domains within the nucleus are linked. During early G1, the replication timing program is re-established at the timing decision point (TDP), which is coincident with the repositioning of chromosomal domains within the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Dimitrova1">[22]</xref>. Early replicating domains tend to be positioned toward the center of the nucleus, whereas late replicating domains are typically near the periphery. Furthermore, the Hi-C method of studying chromosomal interactions reveals a close correlation between replication timing and the spatial separation of chromosomal compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Ryba1">[42]</xref>. It is possible that the histone modifications or other activities recruited to USF binding sites may influence their 3-dimensional nuclear localization, which in turn controls the replication timing of origins within their proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g011">Figure 11C</xref>). Moreover, the observation that replication origins located 58 kb upstream and 80 kb downstream do not fire at the same time as the transgene origin suggests that the advanced timing is restricted to a single replicon and does not involve broader reorganization of a large chromosomal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g011">Figure 11D</xref>). It would be of great interest to study the nuclear positioning of late replicating regions before and after the targeting of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that control replication timing. It would be important to determine whether changes in replication timing are always accompanied by sub-nuclear repositioning.</p>
        <p>Our study shows a correlation between the extent of the replication timing shift and the number of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements surrounding the <italic>β<sup>A</sup></italic> replicator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g011">Figure 11C and D</xref>). In agreement with previous studies, the presence of a replicator is necessary to induce a replication timing shift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Fu1">[43]</xref> and the proximity of a transcriptionally active gene can further advance replication timing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Saha1">[44]</xref>. This suggests that these elements act to increase the probability of the molecular events that govern the early firing of a proximal replication origin. We speculate that USF elements promote chromatin opening and/or position proximal origins into nuclear compartments that increase the accessibility of pre-RCs to replication factors needed for origin firing during S-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Sheu1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Zegerman1">[47]</xref>. It is also possible that the recruitment and activity of factors like DDK (Dfp1/Dbf4-dependent kinase Cdc7) and/or CDK (Cyclin dependent kinase) may be regulated by USF-directed post-translation modifications of either the histones and/or replication factors.</p>

        <title>The Relationship Between Replication Timing and Gene Expression</title>
        <p>Recent genome-wide studies in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse find that replication timing and gene activity are not tightly coupled. Genes replicated in the first half of S-phase have an equal probability of being active and 10%–20% of late replicating genes are expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Schwaiger1">[6]</xref>.

However, analyses of a large subset of genes highlight classes of genes showing a link between their expression and their timing of replication, implying a potential role for replication timing in both transcriptional activation and repression. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, genes related to wing development are replicated earlier in a cell line derived from imaginal discs than in embryonic cells even though these genes are transcriptionally inactive in both cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Schwaiger1">[6]</xref>. This might reflect an open chromatin state poised for subsequent activation. In mouse, analyses of embryonic stem cell differentiation into neuronal cells revealed that high and low CpG-density promoters showed distinct behaviors upon switching to a late-replicating environment: only CpG-poor promoters showed a higher tendency toward transcriptional down-regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Hiratani2">[5]</xref>. Overall, these results favor a model in which only a specific class of genes is affected by replication timing. Furthermore, a reporter plasmid micro-injected into early or late S-phase mammalian nuclei assembled into active hyper-acetylated and inactive hypo-acetylated plasmids, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Zhang1">[48]</xref>. Taken together, these studies indicate that c<italic>is</italic>-regulatory elements involved in the control of replication timing may also help to organize chromosomal domains that assist the regulation of gene expression. This study shows that USF binding sites can regulate the formation of early replication domains in avian cells. The ubiquitous expression and high sequence conservation of USF transcription factors suggest that this regulation would occur in most vertebrate cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-West2">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Corre1">[49]</xref>.

The hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer instructions on 4× 180K Chicken microarrays (Chicken Genome CGH Microarray 4× 180K, custom microarray design, genome reference Gallus gallus V3 May 2006) that cover the whole genome with one probe every 5.6 Kb. Microarrays were scanned with an Agilent's High-Resolution C Scanner using a resolution of 2 µm and the autofocus option. Feature extraction was done with Feature Extraction 9.1 software (Agilent technologies). For each experiment, the raw data sets were automatically normalized by the Feature extraction software. Analysis was performed with Agilent Genomic Workbench 5.0 software. The log<sub>2</sub>-ratio timing profiles were smoothed using the Moving Average option of the Agilent Genomic Workbench 5.0 software with the linear algorithm and 200 kb windows.</p>

The karyotype of the wild type DT40 cell line used for every construct was verified and displayed a typical DT40 karyotype nearly diploid with a trisomy of chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001277.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). For electroporation 10<sup>7</sup> exponentially growing cells were resuspended into 800 µl of DT40 medium. The cell suspension was transferred to an electroporation cuvette with 35 µg of the linearized plasmid DNA (final concentration 1 µg/µl) and maintained for 10 min at 4°C. Electroporation was made using a Biorad electroporator set at 25 µF and 750 V. After a further 10-min incubation on ice, cells were transferred to a plate containing 10 ml of DT40 medium. The following day, cells were diluted six times in DT40 medium containing blasticidin at a final concentration of 20 µg/ml. 200 µl of cell suspension were distributed into three 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates. Plates were left for about 7 to 10 d in the incubator without changing the medium. Isolated colonies were then progressively transferred to larger plates until they reached a 10 ml volume.

Low salt native ChIP was performed on DT40 cell nucleosomes. Nuclei were prepared and treated with lysis buffer (10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.4% NP-40, and 10 mM Tris pH 7.5) for MNase (Sigma) digestion in the presence of 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The MNase concentration required to yield mostly di- and tri-nucleosomes was firstly determined. For ChIP experiments, three equal aliquots of nuclei were incubated with ½×, 1×, and 2× MNase at 37°C for 17 min to obtain representative di- and tri-nucleosomes.

Consistent with the previous reports, we have scored 80 total number of chromosomes in DT40 cells used in this study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001277-Sonoda1">[53]</xref>.

For each clone, 4 ng of genomic DNA was amplified with the three primer pairs (With, Without, and Both) described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001277-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Amplification was also performed in parallel on wild type DT40 genomic DNA with primer pairs Without and Both. The crossing point (cp) was obtained by using the second derivative maximum method described in the LightCycler Software (Roche). Each primer pair has a PCR efficiency around 95%; therefore, the difference in the crossing point (cp) between one and two copies should approximate one cycle. Analysis of transgene copy number shows that for most of the clones, a difference of one cycle is observed between the primer pair With (one copy) and Both (two copies). Three clones have a difference ≥1.5 due to slight variations in the efficiency of this primer pair that we have repeatedly observed. In any case this difference does not account for multiple copy insertion. When comparing the number of copies of the region containing the site of integration with a region located nearby, we also observed a difference of one cycle in every clone in contrast to the wild type DT40 cell line. This result confirms both the fact that only two copies of this genomic region are present in the cell line and that targeted insertion has occurred on one allele.</p>

          <p>PCR validation of clones selected for homologous recombination. (A) Schematic diagram showing genomic region with a site-specific integrated construct. 5′ and 3′ arms of the targeted vector are shown as black boxes. A construct with <italic>β<sup>A</sup></italic> origin (blue) linked to the <italic>IL-2R</italic> transgene (green) and Blasticidin (BsR) gene cassette (orange) flanked by loxP sites (yellow triangles) is shown. Arrows represent primers used for the analysis of integration of constructs by homologous recombination and correct excision of BsR. (B–D) Agarose gels showing PCR products. (B) PCR products amplified with primer #1 and #2 for testing the correctly integrated cell lines of β<sup>A</sup>+BsR (Lane 1), 2xIns+BsR (Lane 2), (2xIns+β<sup>A</sup>)+BsR (Lane 3), 2xFIV+BsR (Lanes 4,5), 2xFIV (Lanes 6,7), 2xFIVmut (Lanes 8,9), 4xFIV-one side (Lanes 10,11), double insertion lines with 2xFIV+BsR and 2xFIV+Puro (Lanes 12,13), and DT40 wild type as negative control (Lane 14). PCRs from genomic DNA extracted from correctly integrated cell lines should give a 2.3 kb product, except those containing 2xIns (Lanes 2 and 3), which should give a 3 kb product. (Bottom gel) Restriction enzyme digestion with <italic>Eco</italic>RI of these PCR products generates two fragments of 1.6 kb and 0.6 kb (2.3 kb amplicon) or 2.4 kb and 0.6 kb (3 kb amplicon) demonstrating the specificity of PCR products. (C) PCR to screen cell lines excised for the BsR gene cassette by expressing the Cre-recombinase. PCR with primers #3 and #4 produces an expected 2 kb product only when the BsR gene cassette has been excised. Gel showing the PCR amplification products of 2xFIV+BsR containing Blasticidin as a negative control (Lane 1), 2xFIV (Lanes 2,3), 2xFIVmut (Lanes 4,5), 4xFIV-one side (Lanes 6,7), IL2RΔβ<sup>A</sup> (Lanes 8,9), and DT40 wild type (Lane 10). (D) To screen cell lines targeted with 2xFIV+BsR vector on one allele and 2xFIV+Puro vector on the other one, a PCR is performed with primers #1 and #5 that flank the insertion point. Thus, genomic DNA extracted from cell lines containing both alleles targeted do not amplify the product. Gel showing the PCR products amplified from genomic DNA from wild type DT40 (Negative control: Lane 1), 2XFIV+BsR with only one allele targeted (Lane 2), and 2XFIV+BsR targeted on one allele and 2xFIV+Puro vector on the other one (Lanes 3,4). DT40 wild type cell line and one allele targeted 2xFIV+BsR amplified a 2.3 kb product, whereas both allele targeted cell lines did not amplify the expected product. (M, DNA marker; *, non-specific PCR product).</p>
