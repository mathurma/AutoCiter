      <abstract>
        <p>The decreasing cost of sequencing is leading to a growing repertoire of personal genomes. However, we are lagging behind in understanding the functional consequences of the millions of variants obtained from sequencing. Global system-wide effects of variants in coding genes are particularly poorly understood. It is known that while variants in some genes can lead to diseases, complete disruption of other genes, called ‘loss-of-function tolerant’, is possible with no obvious effect. Here, we build a systems-based classifier to quantitatively estimate the global perturbation caused by deleterious mutations in each gene. We first survey the degree to which gene centrality in various individual networks and a unified ‘Multinet’ correlates with the tolerance to loss-of-function mutations and evolutionary conservation. We find that functionally significant and highly conserved genes tend to be more central in physical protein-protein and regulatory networks. However, this is not the case for metabolic pathways, where the highly central genes have more duplicated copies and are more tolerant to loss-of-function mutations. Integration of three-dimensional protein structures reveals that the correlation with centrality in the protein-protein interaction network is also seen in terms of the number of interaction interfaces used. Finally, combining all the network and evolutionary properties allows us to build a classifier distinguishing functionally essential and loss-of-function tolerant genes with higher accuracy (AUC = 0.91) than any individual property. Application of the classifier to the whole genome shows its strong potential for interpretation of variants involved in Mendelian diseases and in complex disorders probed by genome-wide association studies.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The number of personal genomes sequenced has grown rapidly over the last few years and is likely to grow further. In order to use the DNA sequence variants amongst individuals for personalized medicine, we need to understand the functional impact of these variants. Deleterious variants in genes can have a wide spectrum of global effects, ranging from fatal for essential genes to no obvious damaging effect for loss-of-function tolerant genes. The global effect of a gene mutation is largely governed by the diverse biological networks in which the gene participates. Since genes participate in many networks, no singular network captures the global picture of gene interactions. Here we integrate the diverse modes of gene interactions (regulatory, genetic, phosphorylation, signaling, metabolic and physical protein-protein interactions) to create a unified biological network. We then exploit the unique properties of loss-of-function tolerant and essential genes in this unified network to build a computational model that can predict global perturbation caused by deleterious mutations in all genes. Our model can distinguish between these two gene sets with high accuracy and we further show that it can be used for interpretation of variants involved in Mendelian diseases and in complex disorders probed by genome-wide association studies.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have considerably reduced the cost of genome sequencing. As a result, there has been an avalanche of personal genomic data with numerous individual genomes sequenced in the last few years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Levy1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Genomes1">[4]</xref>. Variants in protein-coding genes are of special interest due to their stronger likelihood of functional effects. A comprehensive understanding of the functional impact of variants in coding genes requires their integration with various levels of annotations, such as primary sequence of the gene, three-dimensional structures of its protein products and biological networks where genes interact with each other. Functional annotation of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at genomic sequence level results in their classification as nonsynonymous (which includes missense and nonsense), splice site disrupting or synonymous. Similarly, small insertions and deletions (indels) in coding genes can be classified as frame-shift or in-frame. Nonsense and splice site disrupting SNVs as well as frame-shift indels are mostly assumed to lead to loss-of-function (LoF) of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-MacArthur1">[5]</xref>. On the other hand, missense SNVs and in-frame indels may or may not be damaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Ng1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is well understood that genes and their protein products rarely act in isolation but rather work closely with other genes and/or their products to form various networks and pathways which accomplish specific goals, for example, signal transduction, metabolism etc. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the functional impact of variants necessitates the inclusion of these interactions between genes. Network-based approaches are thus often used to study human disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Wang2">[7]</xref>. One feature that has emerged from past studies of disease genes and networks is that protein products of genes associated with similar disorders have a higher likelihood of physical interaction with each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Goh1">[8]</xref>. It has also been noted in many studies that functionally essential genes are more likely to encode for hub (i.e. highly connected) proteins in the physical protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in both yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Jeong1">[9]</xref> and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Goh1">[8]</xref>. Moreover, hub proteins are likely to be under stronger negative selection constraints in humans and positive selection tends to occur on network periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Kim1">[10]</xref>. Similar studies on signaling pathways have revealed that as one goes from extracellular space to the nucleus in the cell, negative selection constraints on genes encoding corresponding proteins tend to increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Cui1">[11]</xref>. Selection studies have also been performed on metabolic pathways where enzyme connectivity signifies the number of other metabolic enzymes that produce the enzyme's reactants or consume its products. For example, in a yeast network of 584 metabolites and comprising about 16% of all yeast genes, Vitkup et al found that highly connected enzymes evolve slower than less connected enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Vitkup1">[12]</xref>. Montanucci et al also reported that genes encoding highly connected enzymes in N-glycosylation metabolic pathway exhibit stronger purifying selection constraints and tend to evolve slowly in primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Montanucci1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In order to obtain a higher resolution understanding of the relationship between selection constraints and networks, some studies have also integrated three-dimensional protein structures with PPI network to obtain structural interaction network (SIN). Kim et al showed that in yeast, hubs in PPI with more than two interaction interfaces are more likely to be essential than those with two or less interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Kim2">[14]</xref>. Using structurally resolved human PPI network, Wang et al showed that disease-causing missense SNVs and in-frame insertions and deletions tend to be enriched at the interaction interfaces of proteins associated with corresponding disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Wang3">[15]</xref>. They also showed that the disease specificity of different mutations of the same gene can be explained by their location on the interaction interfaces. Another important feature that has emerged from studies of genomic variants on protein structure (without consideration of network interactions) is that benign missense polymorphisms tend to occur at solvent exposed sites on protein structure, while disease-causing missense SNVs tend to be more buried <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Saunders1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Previous studies examining the relationship of functional significance and selection properties of genes with network topology have mostly focused on networks with a singular mode of interactions between genes or their protein products, for example physical protein-protein interactions. However, a gene and its protein products can be involved in various biological networks and its role and consequently its centrality can vary across these networks. For example, SIX5 is a transcription factor gene that targets 360 genes in the human regulatory network but interacts with only one protein in the physical PPI network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Gerstein1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Stark1">[18]</xref>. This gene is of high functional significance since its disruption causes Branchio-oto-renal syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by the association of branchial arch defects, hearing loss and renal anomalies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Hoskins1">[19]</xref>. In this study we examine the relationship of functional essentiality and selection with various biological networks – protein-protein interaction (PPI), phosphorylation, signaling, metabolic, genetic and regulatory. This enables us to understand the functional importance and selection constraints on genes in a global systemic approach. Moreover, although it has been shown that low evolutionary conservation of LoF- tolerant genes and their large distance from recessive disease genes in PPI network can be used to predict disease causation of variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-MacArthur1">[5]</xref>, their unique properties in diverse biological networks have not been exploited before. Here, we use the distinguishing network and evolutionary properties of functionally essential and LoF-tolerant genes to build a predictive model for global damage caused by novel variants. Using this model, we are able to compute functional indispensability scores for all protein-coding genes.</p>

        <p>The biological networks studied in this work include – PPI, phosphorylation, metabolic, signaling, genetic and regulatory (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Some of these networks represent direct physical interactions between proteins, for example, PPI. On the other hand, genetic and regulatory networks contain indirect interactions between gene pairs. Additionally, some networks such as phosphorylation, metabolic, signaling and regulatory are directional with an upstream and downstream gene, whereas PPI and genetic interactions are undirected. While a gene can have a vital role in one pathway or network, it might not be as crucial in another network. Therefore, we pool together data from all the above-mentioned biological networks to construct a unified global network, which we term Multinet (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The Multinet enables the analyses of the genes via their roles in the individual networks and the combined network.</p>
        <p>We note that some interactions between two different networks can be shared. For example, an interaction in which gene A phosphorylates gene B can occur in both phosphorylation and PPI networks. However, we find that out of ∼110,000 interactions in our data set, only 881 interactions occur in more than one network. Thus the vast majority of interactions in our data are unique or non-redundant. This observation reiterates the fact that interactions of genes vary across different networks and it is crucial to include all the networks while analyzing the relationship between functional importance and selection constraints with global network centrality. The distribution of 881 interactions which occur in more than one network is shown in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s001">Figure S1</xref>. The numbers of genes and unique interactions in each network are shown in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s003">Table S1</xref>.</p>

        <title>Functional essentiality and network properties of genes</title>
        <p>In this section we investigate the relationship between functional significance of genes and their properties in various biological networks. All human protein-coding genes are divided into four categories based on their known disease susceptibilities and functional impact. A ‘gene significance score’ ranging from 3 to 0 is assigned to each gene: 3 for essential genes, 2 for all genes with disease-causing mutations in HGMD, 0 for LoF-tolerant genes and 1 for all the remaining genes that do not fit into any of the above categories (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We then correlate these significance scores with the degree centralities of the genes in all networks. Degree centrality of a gene in any network is defined as the number of its interacting partners in that network. In order to estimate the total number of interacting partners of a gene, we use its connectivity (number of interactions) in the Multinet (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>We find that gene significance scores show positive correlation with degree centralities in most networks, though it is statistically significant only in PPI and signaling network and Multinet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002886-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002886-g002">2A</xref>; Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s004">Table S2</xref>). Thus, in general, essential genes tend to be more connected in biological systems consistent with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Goh1">[8]</xref>. Surprisingly, we find a small but significant negative correlation between gene significance score and metabolic degree (Spearman correlation coefficient or SCC = −0.07, pvalue = 0.028). We also find that, unlike most other degree centralities, the metabolic degree centrality of genes shows a significant positive correlation with the number of paralogs (duplicated copies) (SCC = 0.15; pvalue = 8.26e-07) (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s005">Table S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Thus, it is possible that in case of a LoF mutation in a participating enzyme, the metabolic pathway can be re-routed to an alternate path, possibly involving a duplicated gene of the disabled enzyme. Our observation in the human metabolic network is in agreement with a previous study by Vitkup et al, in which they found that highly connected enzymes are no more likely to be essential than less connected enzymes in yeast metabolic network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Vitkup1">[12]</xref>. In this study we find that not only are essential genes unlikely to be highly connected in human metabolic network, LoF-tolerant genes (whenever present in metabolic network) are indeed more connected than essential genes (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s009">Table S7</xref>). This result demonstrates a major contrast between the structure of the metabolic network and other networks. In most biological networks, highly connected genes tend to have fewer duplicated copies; hence LoF mutations in them can have serious phenotypic consequences. Since this distinct trend of high degeneracy at hub proteins is observed only in the metabolic network, we further posit that this might be an evolutionary mechanism to increase tolerance towards damaging mutations. The uniqueness of such a ‘protective’ effect somewhat suggests an implicit level of greater functional importance of metabolic pathways as compared to other networks of gene interactions.</p>

        <title>Selection constraints and network properties of genes</title>
        <p>We next examine the relationship between selection constraints on genes and their network properties. We estimate evolutionary constraints over long time-scale by dN/dS (ratio of missense to synonymous substitution rates) computed from human-chimp ortholog alignments (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). dN/dS&lt;1 indicates purifying selection while values close to 1 indicate neutral selection and dN/dS&gt;1 indicates positive selection. We find that dN/dS values of genes are negatively correlated with their degree centralities in all networks, though they reach significance in PPI, phosphorylation, regulatory and Multinet networks (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s006">Table S4</xref>). This shows that highly connected genes tend to be under stronger purifying selection constraints over long evolutionary time-scale, in agreement with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Kim1">[10]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, we analyze patterns of genetic variation in modern-day humans in relation to biological networks. We compute average heterozygosity of each gene to estimate its genetic variability using missense SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and their corresponding allele frequencies in three sets of populations from 1000 Genomes Pilot data (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Genomes1">[4]</xref>. We find that there is a significant negative correlation between Multinet degree and heterozygosity of missense SNPs for all three populations, indicating more genetic variation at the periphery of networks (the correlation is also significant for some populations in PPI, phosphorylation and regulatory networks) (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s007">Table S5</xref>). Interestingly, we do not find a significant correlation of heterozygosity of synonymous SNPs with Multinet degree (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s008">Table S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Putting together, these results suggest that reduced genetic variability of highly connected genes with respect to missense SNPs is indeed due to selection constraints.</p>

        <p>When network edges between two genes correspond to physical interactions between their protein products, molecular level details of the interaction can be obtained by integrating three-dimensional protein structures with the underlying network data. Therefore, in order to understand the reasons for selection constraints in PPI network at higher resolution, we integrated three-dimensional protein structures with network interaction data to create structural interaction network (SIN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002886-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Kim2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Wang3">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Bhardwaj1">[20]</xref>.

        <p>SIN construction allows us to estimate the number of interfaces used by a protein to interact with other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002886-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We find that there is a significant positive correlation between gene significance scores and the number of interfaces used by their protein products in SIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002886-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, protein products of essential genes tend to use more interaction interfaces than those of LoF-tolerant genes. We also find that the number of interfaces used by the protein to interact with other proteins in SIN is positively correlated with their degree centrality in PPI network (SCC = 0.18, pvalue = 1.06e-09). This shows that hub proteins tend to have more interaction interfaces. Thus, it is likely that higher number of interfaces possessed by protein products of essential genes could partly be a result of their higher degree centrality in PPI network.</p>
        <p>We next examine the impact of missense SNVs on protein structure in relation to SIN. We find that, in general, residues with disease-causing missense SNVs tend to be more buried inside protein structure than polymorphic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002886-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Our observation is consistent with previous findings which have reported that missense mutations buried inside protein structure tend to be more deleterious than those on surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Saunders1">[16]</xref>. However, these previous studies treated all proteins equally and did not differentiate between hub and non-hub proteins in PPI network. When we treat hub (degree centrality&gt; = 50) and non-hub proteins separately, we find that accessible surface area for residues with missense disease mutations is higher for hub proteins (Wilcoxon rank sum pvalue = 0.014; Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We also observe a significant positive correlation between the degree centrality of protein and the accessible surface area of their residues undergoing disease mutations (SCC = 0.028, pvalue = 3.12e-03). These results show that hub proteins tend to have a higher fraction of missense disease mutations on their exposed surface. This result is very reasonable in light of our observation that hub proteins tend to have more interaction interfaces (see preceding paragraph), thereby having a higher fraction of their exposed surface under selection constraints.</p>

        <title>Predicting probable functional indispensability of genes using selection and network properties</title>
        <p>In order to further examine the close correlation of network and evolutionary properties with gene essentiality we use a logistic regression model to differentiate essential genes from LoF-tolerant genes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Network features used to train the logistic regression model include degree centralities in Multinet and all networks separately (PPI, phosphorylation, signaling, metabolic, genetic and regulatory), number of networks the gene is involved in and number of interfaces used in SIN. Selection properties used in the model include human-chimp dN/dS ratios and average heterozygosities of both synonymous and missense SNPs in modern human populations.

        <p>Network properties that contribute significantly to the model include degree centralities in regulatory, genetic and metabolic networks as well as number of networks the gene is involved in (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). On further examination of network participation of LoF-tolerant and essential genes, we find that most LoF-tolerant genes are not involved in any network and some of them are involved in a very small number of networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002886-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). On the other hand, most essential genes are involved in many networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002886-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Genes involved in a variety of networks serve as information bottlenecks between different systems and hence are more likely to be essential. We note that absence in some networks could partially be due to missing network data in our study and/or a bias in existing databases. Essential genes are more likely to have been the focus of previous research studies, for example PPI studies, and hence more likely to be present in our PPI network. They also tend to have more regulatory interactions and thus are more likely to be present in our regulatory network (which consists of 118 transcription factors and their target genes: the most comprehensive human regulatory network available to our knowledge) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Gerstein1">[17]</xref>. However, the strength of our model lies in its use of many different network properties to minimize the biases resulting from the use of a single network property or data resource. Furthermore, to test the robustness of our model, we computed the AUC for separation of LoF-tolerant and essential genes multiple times – each time randomly removing 10% of the edges from a network and rebuilding the Multinet. After repeating this for all the networks, we find minimal change in the AUC (ranging from 0.914 to 0.912), which shows that our model is quite robust to changing some edges in individual networks.</p>
        <p>We next perform an independent validation of our model by applying it on all genes that are neither LoF-tolerant nor essential. Interestingly, we find that predicted functional indispensability scores are in the following order: genes with known disease-causing mutations have significantly higher scores than genes identified in genome-wide association (GWA) studies (Wilcoxon rank sum pvalue = 7.62e-05), which are in turn significantly higher than all the remaining neutral genes (Wilcoxon rank sum pvalue&lt;2.2e-16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002886-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Genes identified in GWA studies are associated with phenotypic consequences, while they are not necessarily the causal genes. Hence it is reassuring that genes with known disease-causing mutations in HGMD receive significantly higher scores than those identified in GWA studies. This validation exercise demonstrates that our model can help researchers pick candidate disease genes in clinical sequencing studies. We have provided the predicted scores for all the genes in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s010">Table S8</xref>. We note that the predicted functional indispensability scores are continuous scores unlike the discrete gene significance scores used to compute correlations in an earlier section.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Genes and their protein products work in collaboration with other genes to form biological systems that perform specific tasks. For a systemic understanding of the role a gene plays, there is a need to integrate different modes of gene interactions. In this work we pool together interaction data from various biological systems (PPI, phosphorylation, signaling, metabolic, genetic and regulatory) to create a unified Multinet, enabling the computation of degree centrality of the genes in their individual networks and in the context of the entire Multinet (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002886.s010">Table S8</xref>). Subsequent analysis of functional significance and evolutionary properties of genes allows us to relate genomic sequence variants in individual genes to their functional effects in individual and global networks. We find that highly connected genes in the Multinet and genes that participate in many biological systems tend to be more functionally significant, have fewer paralogs and resist mutations in healthy humans. While we also observe similar trends in most of the constituent networks of the Multinet, the metabolic network seems to be an exception. Highly connected genes in the metabolic network tend to have more paralogs and are more tolerant to LoF mutations.</p>
      <p>Next, we combine three-dimensional protein structural information with PPI network to create structural interaction network (SIN) and understand selection on protein structure at molecular level detail. We find that functionally essential genes (which are more likely to encode for hub proteins) tend to use more interfaces to interact with other proteins. We also observe that hub proteins in PPI network contain a higher fraction of disease-causing mutations on their solvent exposed surface, as compared to non-hub proteins. Thus, although generally missense SNVs on exposed protein surface are more likely to be benign, our results show that those on the surface of hub proteins are more likely to be deleterious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Adzhubei1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Finally, we integrate network and selection properties of genes to build a logistic regression model which can separate LoF-tolerant and essential genes with high accuracy (AUC = 0.91). Application of the model on all genes shows that it predicts higher functional indispensability scores for genes with known disease-causing mutations than genes identified in GWA studies, which themselves have higher scores than remaining neutral genes. The predicted functional indispensability scores for all genes are made publicly available and can be used to predict candidate disease genes in future clinical studies. These scores are indicators of global damage caused by deleterious mutations in coding genes – including nonsense and missense SNVs and in-frame and frame-shift indels. As mentioned above, nonsense SNVs and frame-shift indels are mostly assumed to disable gene function. However, missense SNVs and in-frame indels are more complex since they may or may not have a deleterious impact. Various methods exist to predict the functional effects of missense SNVs, for example, SIFT and PolyPhen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Adzhubei1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002886-Kumar1">[22]</xref>. While these methods examine the tolerance of individual sites in genes to missense mutations, they do not take into account the functional significance of the entire gene. For example, a moderately deleterious missense SNV in a highly significant gene can be equally or more damaging than a strongly deleterious missense SNV in a less significant gene. Our method to compute functional indispensability scores for entire genes can be combined with scores predicted by SIFT and PolyPhen to obtain a more comprehensive view of the functional effects of genomic variation.</p>
      <p>We note that even though our model is very robust to the removal of some edges in individual networks, the incomplete and biased nature of existing biological networks data may constitute a caveat in our study. However, to our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive genome-wide study linking genetic variants at population scale as well as disease variants with a vast body of available network resources. Models developed and applied in this study can be further expanded as more interaction data is obtained and further population genetics projects are undertaken, particularly with the future phases of the 1000 Genomes project.</p>

          <p>Some interactions in SIN are mutually exclusive as they compete for same interaction interface while some of them could occur at the same time, as they use different interfaces (called simultaneously possible interactions). Types of interactions are determined by overlaps in interacting residues. For example, if most residues (&gt;20%) used by protein A to interact with protein B are also used by protein A to interact with protein C, these two interactions of protein A are mutually exclusive and correspond to the same interaction interface. If protein A also interacts with protein D using a completely different set of residues, its interaction with protein D is possible simultaneously to its interactions with protein B or protein C. Thus, for each protein, the interactions it is involved in can be classified into mutually exclusive and simultaneously possible based on the residues used for those interactions. Number of interaction interfaces of a protein is then defined as the number of simultaneously possible interactions involving that protein.</p>
