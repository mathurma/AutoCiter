                <p>Many genetic networks are astonishingly robust to quantitative variation,
                    allowing these networks to continue functioning in the face of mutation and
                    environmental perturbation. However, the evolution of such robustness remains
                    poorly understood for real genetic networks. Here we explore whether and how
                    ploidy and recombination affect the evolution of robustness in a detailed
                    computational model of the segment polarity network. We introduce a novel
                    computational method that predicts the quantitative values of biochemical
                    parameters from bit sequences representing genotype, allowing our model to
                    bridge genotype to phenotype. Using this, we simulate 2,000 generations of
                    evolution in a population of individuals under stabilizing and truncation
                    selection, selecting for individuals that could sharpen the initial pattern of
                    engrailed and wingless expression. Robustness was measured by simulating a
                    mutation in the network and measuring the effect on the engrailed and wingless
                    patterns; higher robustness corresponded to insensitivity of this pattern to
                    perturbation. We compared robustness in diploid and haploid populations, with
                    either asexual or sexual reproduction. In all cases, robustness increased, and
                    the greatest increase was in diploid sexual populations; diploidy and sex
                    synergized to evolve greater robustness than either acting alone. Diploidy
                    conferred increased robustness by allowing most deleterious mutations to be
                    rescued by a working allele. Sex (recombination) conferred a robustness
                    advantage through “survival of the compatible”: those
                    alleles that can work with a wide variety of genetically diverse partners
                    persist, and this selects for robust alleles.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Most so-called “higher organisms” are diploid (have two
                    copies of each gene) and reproduce sexually. Diploidy may be advantageous if one
                    functional copy can mask the effects of a mutation in the other copy; however,
                    it is a liability if most mutations are dominant. Sex can increase genetic
                    diversity and the rate of evolution by creating new combinations of alleles that
                    might function better together but can also disrupt working combinations. Given
                    these trade-offs, why are sex and diploidy so common, and why do they occur so
                    often together? We hypothesize that sex and diploidy allow gene networks to
                    evolve to function more robustly in the face of genetic and environmental
                    variation. This robustness would be advantageous because organisms are exposed
                    to constantly changing environments and all genes undergo mutation. To test this
                    hypothesis, we simulated evolution in a model of the segment polarity network, a
                    well-studied group of genes essential for proper development in many organisms.
                    We compared the robustness of haploid and diploid populations that reproduced
                    either sexually or asexually. Sexually reproducing diploid populations evolved
                    the greatest robustness, suggesting an explanation for the selective advantage
                    of diploid sexual reproduction.</p>

            <p>Phenotypic robustness, also called canalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Waddington1">[1]</xref>, is the ability of a
                phenotype to persist when challenged by a perturbation to the system producing it.
                Many phenotypes are not the product of an individual gene, but rather arise from
                interactions within larger gene networks. The functions of several well-studied
                networks have been shown or predicted to be robust to quantitative variation in the
                biochemical kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Clodong1">[8]</xref>. This variation can
                come from both intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental) sources: Genetic
                diversity (polymorphism) within populations can produce variation in gene expression
                levels and in the activity of gene products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Rockman1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Rahim1">[13]</xref>. In a
                genetically diverse, sexually reproducing population, recombination is continuously
                producing new combinations of alleles, and robustness to genetic variation would
                confer a fitness advantage. This intuition is supported by experiments showing much
                genetic variation is hidden—i.e. quantitative variation between
                individuals has no detectable effect on phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Gibson1">[10]</xref>. Another source of
                perturbation is environmental: Individuals can transiently experience a broad range
                of potentially noxious environments (due to pH, oxygen level, starvation conditions,
                or temperature) that alter protein activity and potentially disrupt gene networks.
                While only genetic effects are heritable, genetic and environmental variation both
                perturb network dynamics, and robustness to one may confer robustness to the other
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Proulx1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Meiklejohn1">[16]</xref>.</p>
            <p>A possible mechanism to increase robustness is diploidy, as mutations can be masked
                by a functional copy (a recessive mutation), allowing greater tolerance to mutation.
                However, it is unclear whether diploidy is an advantage in genetic networks, because
                it is also potentially harmful: a diploid network will have mutations twice as often
                as a haploid, and a single bad allele could break the network (a dominant mutation).
                Most deleterious mutations in enzyme coding genes are recessive to the wild type
                alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Fisher1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wilkie1">[19]</xref>. For metabolic
                networks, Kacser and Burns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Kacser1">[20]</xref> showed theoretically that most mutations are
                recessive because in long metabolic pathways each individual enzyme contributes
                weakly to the total flux. This theory was formulated for metabolic networks where
                all gene products were enzymes, and it may not hold for gene regulatory networks
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Savageau1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Phadnis1">[22]</xref>. Importantly, a majority of disease-causing
                mutations in transcription factors are dominant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-JimenezSanchez1">[23]</xref>. Experimental
                evolution on yeast, which can exist either as haploids or diploids, has shown that
                different ploidies are advantageous under different conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Zeyl1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Thompson1">[26]</xref>. The
                advantage of diploidy depends on the frequency of deleterious dominant mutations,
                mutation rates, and other factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Kondrashov1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Otto3">[30]</xref>. However,
                this is an oversimplification because if most deleterious mutations are recessive,
                the evolutionary advantage of diploidy remains questionable as the effects of rare
                beneficial recessive mutations could likewise be masked. Such masking of beneficial
                mutations in a diploid population has been observed in antibiotic resistance
                evolution in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Anderson1">[25]</xref>. Thus, models investigating the effects of ploidy
                on robustness need to incorporate both the spectrum of possible mutations, and the
                functional context in which they occur (e.g. participation in a network).</p>
            <p>Theory predicts that genetic variation combined with gene interaction favors the
                evolution of phenotypic robustness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Proulx1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Lynch1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Gardner1">[32]</xref>. The evolution of increased robustness to
                mutation (mutational robustness) has been predicted by models of RNA folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Ancel1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner2">[34]</xref> and
                randomly wired transcriptional networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Azevedo1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Siegal1">[36]</xref>. Theory and modeling
                predict that sexually reproducing populations, with recombination shuffling alleles,
                should experience stronger selection for robustness than asexual populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-deVisser1">[37]</xref>, and
                has been shown to hold for randomly-wired interaction networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Azevedo1">[35]</xref>. However, it is
                unknown whether these results hold for real networks because interactions between
                mutations may be more complicated than theoretical studies assume. Additionally,
                real networks may have subtle topological or regulatory architecture that differ
                from randomly-wired model networks in important ways. Sex and diploidy are commonly
                found together, and both may produce greater robustness, but this has not been
                tested for gene regulatory networks.</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate how ploidy and sex (recombination) affect the evolution
                of robustness in a detailed model of the segment polarity network. Previous modeling
                studies focused on highly simplified and abstract networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Ancel1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Siegal1">[36]</xref>, and it
                is essential to test whether these findings hold in a realistic network with a known
                function. The segment polarity network is a canonical example of a pattern forming
                network that is robust to variation in its underlying biochemical kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow2">[38]</xref>. It
                is essential for development in many insects, and the function of its genes and
                their interactions within the network are well-understood. In this network, gene
                expression is regulated at both pre- and post-transcriptional levels, with some
                regulations requiring cell–cell communication. During development prior to
                the operation of the segment polarity network, gap and pair-rule genes activate
                expression of wg and en in a noisy prepattern of stripes. The segment polarity
                network in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development then sharpens and maintains these
                stripes through the lifetime of the organism. Correct location of these stripes of
                expression is essential for development, as they provide positional information to
                activate downstream genes and processes in the proper locations. Previous work
                showed that a haploid model reconstituting the known interactions within this
                network can robustly reproduce the observed pattern of gene expression (i.e. the
                phenotype) despite large changes in the model parameters representing the
                biochemical kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow2">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Ingolia1">[39]</xref>.</p>
            <p>To investigate the evolution of phenotypic robustness of the segment polarity
                network, we developed a novel approach where model parameters were calculated from a
                digital genotype, allowing our model to bridge genotype to phenotype (the pattern of
                gene expression) in a way that can capture the quantitative and qualitative effects
                of mutation and recombination. Mutations can alter the strength of interactions, and
                all connections/processes in the network can vary and evolve in a simulated
                population of organisms. Additionally, we built a diploid model of this network,
                which allows 2 versions of each gene and all resulting gene products to have
                potentially different kinetics. Using these, we explore how and whether a diploid
                model is more robust compared to the haploid. We simulate a population of
                individuals (organisms endowed with the network), with selection only to stabilize
                the correct spatiotemporal pattern of expression (phenotype). Using this more
                biologically detailed representation of the segment polarity gene network we
                compared evolution of robustness in 4 different populations: sexual haploid, asexual
                haploid, sexual diploid, and asexual diploid. We find that diploid sexual networks
                evolve the greatest robustness increase and the combination of the two produces
                greater robustness than either alone.</p>

                        Dassow (2000). The model incorporates regulatory interactions between 5
                        genes in the segment polarity network. mRNAs are indicated by lowercase
                        ovals, proteins by uppercase squares. Solid lines indicate fluxes, dashed
                        lines are regulatory interactions, activators end in arrowheads, inhibitors
                        end in circles. Large rectangles indicate cell membranes. The model
                        simulates a row of 4 cells endowed with identical networks to that shown
                        here. The row of cells has toroidal topology and simulates a 2-D sheet of
                        cells. (B) A piece of the diploid segment polarity network showing the
                        subset of interactions drawn red in (A). In the diploid network, each gene
                        has 2 alleles with the corresponding products that participate in the same
                        regulatory interactions but may do so with quantitative differences between
                        the 2 alleles. The number of regulatory interactions in the diploid network
                        can be more than doubled because of the increased combinatorics in diploid
                        networks. (C) Initial conditions for en and wg gene expression(left), and we

                        have even lower expression by 200 minutes of development, while the cells
                        expressing initially high wg and en must maintain high expression.</p>

            <p>In the following paragraphs, we describe extensions to this model that allow us to
                simulate evolution of the segment polarity network in response to selection on the
                pattern of en and wg expression (the phenotype). We present a diploid version of the
                model that allows us to directly compare evolution and robustness in haploid and
                diploid models. We also use a novel framework of deriving model parameter values
                from a digital genotype, which allows mutations to alter many gene properties (i.e.
                changes in expression level, stability and activity). Using these, we start with
                initially viable identical founders and follow them through 2,000 generations of
                evolution as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g002">Figure 2A</xref>.
                We use the model to calculate phenotype (the en and wg pattern of expression) from
                genotype, apply truncation or stabilizing selection on the phenotype, using a
                multinomial sampling scheme to simulate random mating with a fixed population size
                (N = 200) and a per-gene mutation rate (μ)

                    <p>(A) Flowchart of evolutionary model. A population of individuals is
                        generated, and their genotype determines their phenotype. Individuals are
                        subject to either truncation or stabilizing selection, and viable
                        individuals mate (if sexual) or divide (if asexual). Each gene in the next
                        generation has a small (3%) chance of having a mutation. (B) Each
                        model parameter was determined from genotype represented as a bit sequence.
                        The model parameter value was calculated from the amount of complementarity
                        between 2 different bit sequences with a length of 20 bits (figure shows 10
                        bits for simplicity), representing the shapes of interacting surfaces in the
                        biomolecules. Black and red lines are graphical representations of the
                        shapes these bit sequences represent; 1's indicate protrusions,
                        0's indicate crevices. Each bit is weighted double that to its
                        right, and the strength of the interaction is scaled by the binary exclusive
                        OR (XOR) between the two bit sequences. A perfect fit in a binding
                        interaction would have a low dissociation constant, while worse fits would
                        have corresponding looser binding. (C) Mutations may have specific effects
                        depending on the location in the gene. Each gene had many separate bit
                        sequences, one for each parameter in the model that the gene was involved
                        in, corresponding to the different quantitative effects of mutation. For
                        example, a mutation in the enhancer or promoter sequence (E/P) would alter
                        gene expression levels, while mutations in the 5′ untranslated
                        region or translation initiation site (UTR/SD) would alter translation
                        rates. Mutations in the coding region that alter the binding site for CID on
                        the PTC protein (Red) would alter the ability of PTC to cleave CID.
                        Similarly, the different active sites on the CID protein (green, blue,
                        orange) could be specifically altered by mutations in the coding region.</p>

                <title>Model of the Haploid Segment Polarity Network</title>
                <p>Mathematically, our model of the haploid segment polarity network is the same as
                    described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow2">[38]</xref> with 2
                    modifications: (1) The equations incorporate parameters for transcriptional and
                    translational synthesis rates (which were previously removed by
                    nondimensionalization). Including these parameters does not alter the dynamic
                    repertoire of the system, and allows mutations to alter the expression levels of
                    the mRNA &amp; proteins. (2) Cells were 4-sided (changed from 6-sided) to
                    allow faster computation. This change did not alter the hit rate of successful
                    solutions in a random parameter search, nor did we notice a change in the
                    dynamical behavior of the system.</p>
                <p>The segment polarity network was reconstituted into a system of ordinary
                    differential equations. The dependent variables in this system represent the
                    concentrations of the biomolecules in each cell (for cytoplasmic/nuclear
                    molecules) or membrane compartment (for membrane-bound molecules). The system
                    simulates a row (4 cells wide) of square cells with repeating (toroidal)
                    boundary conditions to represent a 2-D sheet of interacting cells. The
                    concentration of a membrane-bound protein can be different on each of the 4
                    sides of a cell (each side is treated as a separate compartment), and we
                    simulate diffusion by allowing molecules to transfer between cells and membrane
                    compartments where appropriate. The time rate of change for a given
                    concentration is simply the sum of the processes/mechanisms influencing it:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000296.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000296.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the concentration of molecule <italic>X</italic> in side

                <p>Decay, binding, and translation follow standard mass-action kinetics

                    activity and translational activation have not been measured in the segment
                    polarity network, so these processes are constructed from Hill functions as

                    of activation curves with parameters that are commonly used in standard enzyme
                    kinetics and these parameters are, in principle, measurable. Additionally, this
                    function enforces expected qualitative behavior of biological processes:
                    saturation (biological processes tend to saturate above some level of
                    activation, after which further addition of activator ceases to have an effect)

                <title>From Haploid to Diploid Models of the Segment Polarity Network</title>
                <p>The model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure 1A</xref>
                    is a haploid network, with a single form of each gene. We constructed a diploid
                    model of the network with 2 versions of each gene and gene product. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows the diploid
                    network for only the <italic>ptc</italic> and <italic>cid</italic> genes; both
                    the number of distinct biomolecules (boxed items) and the number of interactions
                    (lines) can increase by a factor of 2 or more. In the diploid model, there are 2
                    distinct versions of each mRNA and protein. However, for complexes, such as the
                    Patched-Hedgehog dimer, there are 4 possible distinct dimers (4 ways to combine
                    the 2 HH and 2 PTC proteins).</p>
                <p>In the diploid network, all molecules maintain the same activities as in the
                    haploid, but the presence of two alleles must be correctly implemented to follow
                    the established biology of diploidy. Fluxes/conversions (solid lines in the
                    network diagram) are doublings of the haploid version: translation, decay, exo
                    &amp; endocyctosis, and diffusion. For example, each protein is translated
                    only from the corresponding mRNA; i.e. CID1 protein is translated only from cid1
                    mRNA, while CID2 protein is translated from cid2 mRNA (and we assume it is
                    independent of cid1 translation). Similarly, the two versions of each
                    biomolecule decay independently with 1<sup>st</sup> order kinetics (we assume
                    the decay of one allele does not affect the rate of decay of its homologue).
                    Regulatory interactions (dotted lines in the network) become more complex in the
                    diploid network, as we must account for the combined regulatory activity of both
                    alleles. In the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure
                        1B</xref>, each of the two CID proteins can have a potentially different
                    effect on the activity of each of the ptc target genes, so the number of arrows
                    (regulatory interactions) has quadrupled compared to the haploid case.</p>
                <p>For diploid networks, we construct an extension of the Hill function to allow for
                    two activators controlling expression of a target. Here, we extend the example
                    of Equation 2 for two activators (A1 and A2) that can have different efficacies

                    proteins do not interact with each other in activating X (i.e. we do not
                    consider that A1 might block activity of A2 by nonproductively binding to the

                    activity in binding to the affector for gene X. Furthermore, we assume the
                    cooperativity reflects the number of occupied binding sites on the target gene.

                <p>There are many ways to extend the Hill function (or implement alternative
                    formulations) to approximate the effects of diploidy, and increased realism
                    comes at additional computational complexity. A highly realistic model would
                    ideally track the bound state of each enhancer site for a gene (perhaps
                    including current availability of the site based on histone acetylation, etc.),
                    the affinity of each activator allele for each site, and the contribution of
                    each bound transcription factor to the initiation of transcription. We settled
                    upon the formulation in Equation 5 because it is simple (both to use and
                    understand) but captures attractive features of diploidy. Specifically, our
                    scheme: (1) Captures the same qualitative biological behavior as the Hill
                    function did in the haploid case: saturation and monotonicity. (2) Does not
                    dramatically increase the parameter count or complexity of the model. (3) Allows
                    for direct comparison between the haploid and diploid models. The homozygous
                    diploid model reduces to the haploid equivalent when
                        <italic>A</italic>1 = <italic>A</italic>2
                    and
                        <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>K</italic><sub>2</sub>.
                    This allows us to compare directly the evolution of diploid and haploid
                    networks.</p>
                <p>Our formulation of Equation 5 has consequences for the behavior of heterozygous
                    diploid networks. Activation in the diploid model depends on the average
                    activity (concentration divided by <italic>K</italic> parameter) of the two
                    activators. Thus, the loss of either A1 or A2 can be compensated by a
                    sufficiently large increase in the concentration of the other (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In the case of a
                    homozygous diploid, if
                        <italic>A1</italic> = <italic>A2</italic>
                    and both have the same activity (both have identical
                    <italic>K</italic>'s), then the total activity is the same as the
                    haploid. Depending on the activities of the two activator proteins A1 and A2,
                    the loss of either could result in anything from an insignificant change (if
                        <italic>A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> were both far above their
                    respective <italic>K</italic>'s) to a dramatic change (if
                    <italic>A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> were near their respective
                    <italic>K</italic>'s).</p>
                <p>We emphasize that the segment polarity network has highly nonlinear behavior
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow2">[38]</xref>, and the loss of
                    one allele in an otherwise homozygous individual will usually not result in a
                    simple halving of expression in the affected gene. There is substantial feedback
                    between different genes and different cells, and some perturbations can result
                    in a complete change in the pattern of expression, while others will produce
                    almost no change. Because there are multiple cells in the network that are
                    co-regulating each other, many genes must be expressed within a correct window
                    of expression (above one threshold but simultaneously below another) in each of
                    the cells. Additionally, when there is high cooperativity in Equations 3 and 5,
                    the resulting gene activity may be unchanged (if far from the threshold for
                    activity) or completely lost (if near threshold).</p>
                <p>Our implementation of diploidy does not allow for the possibility of interactions
                    between the two activator alleles: for example that A1 and A2 compete for
                    binding sites in such a way that A1 fails to activate production of X and also
                    (dominantly) blocks the activity of A2 (by binding nonproductively to enhancer
                    sites). Similarly, we do not allow for overdominance effects such as A1 and A2
                    somehow synergizing so that their combination has greater activity than an
                    equivalent amount of either alone.</p>

                <p>The models of the segment polarity network described above are insufficient to
                    predict the effects of mutations on phenotype because many parameters in the
                    model are not properties of individual gene products, but instead reflect
                        <italic>interactions</italic> between biomolecules. For example, many
                    parameters in our model determine how well a transcription factor activates or
                    inhibits its target's gene expression. In reality, the strength of such
                    regulatory interactions could be altered by mutating either the transcription
                    factor or enhancer sequence, resulting in different patterns of inheritance
                    depending which gene combination is passed on to the offspring. Additionally, a
                    single mutation can perturb multiple parameters in the model: a mutation in a
                    transcription factor will affect its ability to recognize both enhancer
                    sequences.</p>
                <p>Biophysically, interactions in genetic networks rely on physical binding of
                    biomolecules in regions with complementary surface chemistry and topology. To
                    capture the qualitative behavior of such binding, we abstract genotype as a bit
                    sequence (digital genotype) comprised of 1's &amp; 0's
                    that can be imagined as a surrogate for the physical surface of molecules that
                    participate in a binding interaction (i.e. an enzyme's active site or
                    the binding surface offered by an enhancer consensus sequence) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. The
                    strength/kinetics of an interaction (represented by biochemical parameters in
                    our model) are determined by the degree of complementarity between two bit
                    sequences, weighted by bit position. Each bit in the sequence is weighted twice
                    that of its neighbor on the right to allow mutations that alter bit-sequences to
                    have graded effects from very small to large (the motivation for this choice is
                    further discussed in the section “simulating mutation”
                    below). The parameter is derived from the interacting bit sequences by simply
                    scaling the normalized bitwise XOR value of the bit sequences according to
                    either a linear<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000296.e012" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>or logarithmic scaling:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000296.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula><italic>bitSequenceA</italic> and <italic>bitSequenceB</italic>
                    are the numeric representations of the binary interacting sequences and

                    simulations. We used linear scaling (Equation 6) for <italic>K</italic>
                    parameters, and logarithmic scaling (Equation 7) for all others. Linear vs. log
                    scaling was used so that mutations usually resulted in a weak/nonexistent
                    interaction as described in the “simulating mutation”
                    section below. Cooperativities were restricted to integer values by rounding the
                    results of Equation 6 to the nearest integer in order to speed numerical
                    integration.</p>
                <p>Several parameters reflect the interaction of the segment polarity genes with
                    genes products outside of the network. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000296.s002">Table S1</xref> lists the general categories of
                    parameters in the model, what they represent, and indicates whether the
                    parameter is derived from two different bit sequences (i.e. is an interaction
                    between 2 genes with the segment polarity network) or is derived from the
                    comparison of a bit sequence from a single gene with 0 (indicating interaction
                    with general cellular machinery that we assume is constant). For example,
                    maximal transcription and translation rates (<italic>C</italic> and
                    <italic>L</italic> parameters) are determined by how well the SPN genes interact
                    with the initiation machinery for these processes. Evolution of global cellular
                    behavior is slow, while transcription factors evolve quickly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-CastilloDavis1">[42]</xref>, therefore we did not allow global machinery to
                    change, and held the corresponding bit sequences fixed at 0 (i.e. all
                    0's in the bit sequence, this was chosen for convenience since again,
                    this sequence did not evolve). This allows the maximum translation rates of
                    genes to be changed and inherited as any other property, but does not allow, for
                    example, heritable ribosomal mutations that would globally alter all translation
                    rates. Thus, our model explicitly represents the genotype of 5 genes in the
                    haploid network (10 in the diploid).</p>
                <p>For the special case of the lifetime of the PTC-HH protein
                        dimer(<italic>H<sub>PH</sub></italic>), we reasoned that the stability of
                    the complex reflects a tripartite interaction involving both proteins with the
                    degradation machinery in the cell: <disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000296.e014" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>Where min and max are the range of allowed values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000296.s003">Table S2</xref>),
                            <italic>H<sub>PHptc</sub></italic> is the bit sequence representing the
                    ability of the PTC part of the PTC HH dimer to interact with the degradation
                    machinery, and <italic>H<sub>PHhh</sub></italic> represents the same for the HH
                    part of the dimer. The lifetime of the dimer is the average of the contribution
                    of the ability of HH to be recognized by the degradation machinery (bit sequence
                    fixed at 0) and the PTC part.</p>
                <p>In the model, different parameters for each gene describe distinct
                    sub-activities/properties such as mRNA stability, protein stability, protein
                    activity, expression level, etc., as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g002">Figure 2C</xref>. In reality, the DNA sequences
                    determining these different activities are usually spatially separated on the
                    gene: enhancer sites (affecting transcription rate) are on the non-coding region
                    usually away from the ribosomal recognition sequence (which affects translation
                    rate) and likewise distant from the coding region of the active site (which
                    affects protein activity). Thus, most point mutations alter only one or a few
                    properties of the gene products: for example a mutation in the coding sequence
                    for a real protein might alter the protein's activity and stability
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Tokuriki1">[43]</xref>, but not its transcription rate. Additionally,
                    mutations in a transcription factor can alter its interactions with a subset of
                    targets while leaving other interactions unaffected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Inga1">[44]</xref>. To capture this in
                    our model, <italic>we use a separate bit sequence for each of a gene's
                        parameters (sub-activities)</italic>. For example, we use separate bit
                    sequences for the maximum transcription rate of a gene, the stability (mean
                    lifetime) of the mRNA, maximum translation rate into protein, stability of the
                    protein, and each of the protein's activities. Thus, though there are 5
                    genes (10 in the diploid model), there are far more bit sequences (∼71
                    in the haploid model, 142 in the diploid) than genes. From these bit sequences,
                    all model parameters (57 haploid, 140 diploid) are determined using Equations
                    6–8. The number of model parameters is more than half the number of
                    bit sequences because several parameters are derived by comparing bit sequences
                    describing properties of segment polarity genes with fixed cellular machinery
                    (fixed at a value of 0, and not included in the bit sequence count). Thus,
                    parameters that reflect interaction with cellular machinery are simply inherited
                    (though they can still be mutated).</p>
                <p>Equations 6 &amp; 7 capture important relationships between different
                    parameters in the model. In a diploid organism, consider a mutation in a
                    transcription factor that affects the surface of the transcription factor that
                    binds the enhancer. Such a mutation will alter the ability of the transcription
                    factor to recognize the enhancer sequences of both target alleles: in Equation
                    4, a mutation that alters the ability of transcription factor A1 to bind to
                    enhancer sites will alter both <italic>K<sub>A1X1</sub></italic> and
                            <italic>K<sub>A1X2</sub></italic>. Conversely, a mutation in an enhancer
                    sequence will alter the ability of both transcription factor alleles to regulate
                    the mutated gene. In Equation 4, a mutation that alters the enhancer sequence of
                    X1 will alter the ability of both transcription factors, A1 and A2, to recognize
                    it and will alter both <italic>K<sub>A1X1</sub></italic> and
                        <italic>K<sub>A2X1</sub></italic>. If bit sequence <italic>B<sub>A1
                            transcription</sub></italic> represents the surface of A1 that binds to
                    enhancers, <italic>B<sub>A2 transcription</sub></italic> represents the surface
                    of A2 that binds to enhancers, <italic>B<sub>X1 enhancer</sub></italic> is the

A single mutated bit sequence can affect multiple parameters,

                    mutations.</p>
                <p>To reiterate, our scheme of calculating parameters from Equations 6–8
                    is attractive because: (1) It is conceptually consistent with the underlying
                    biophysical mechanism of binding. The binding surfaces/active sites are
                    specified either directly by the genotype (i.e. a regulatory consensus sequence)
                    or indirectly (the genotype specifies the 3-D shape of a protein), but the
                    ultimate origin of both is a mutable sequence (the DNA sequence of the gene).
                    (2) It allows us to compute how well a gene product can interact with any
                    partner, allowing us to easily simulate the effects of recombination (which will
                    produce new combinations of alleles that may not have worked together before)
                    and inheritance, as parameter values are interactions (not heritable) that
                    depend on the interacting genes. Our scheme allows us to calculate the strength
                    of an interaction when, for example, both a transcription factor and the
                    enhancer sequence it binds are mutated. (3) It allows us to simulate both
                        <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> mutations. Transcriptional
                    regulation can be altered by a mutation in either the transcription factor or
                    the enhancer, with different consequences depending on which is mutated. Our bit
                    sequence representation allows this aspect of biological reality to be captured.
                    (4) It allows us to capture the general qualitative features of mutations (see
                    next section). (5) It is computationally trivial.</p>

This allows the maximal HH protein concentration to vary from
                    0.2 to 5 times that of PTC. The restriction in Equation 10 was not applied

                    The constraints we impose in Equation 10 enforce that en and wg have a maximal
                    value of 1, and so all founders have similar patterns of wg and en: in cells
                    that should express them highly, wg and en are expressed between 0.8 and 1

                    Thus, we chose a random value for one bit sequence (each bit position was
                    randomly set to 0 or 1 with equal probability), then assign a unique value to

            </sec>
            <sec id="s2e">
                <title>Simulating Mutation</title>
                <p>We emphasize that the bit sequences described in the previous section are
                    abstract surrogates for the 3-D physical surfaces of molecules that participate
                    in an interaction. They do not attempt to represent base pairing between
                    complementary nucleotide sequences as all interactions in the segment polarity
                    network are protein–protein or DNA/RNA-protein interactions. There is
                    no general theory that allows us to calculate the strength of binding between an
                    arbitrary gene product and its partners, nor to predict the effect of a general
                    mutation on the strength of this binding. Quantitatively, a point mutation can
                    have varied effects on an interaction: a complete quenching of an interaction
                    (mutation of the nucleotide/amino acid that is essential for
                    binding/interaction), an almost imperceptible change (mutation at a site
                    peripheral to the key interaction that slightly perturbs the interaction
                    strength), a (less likely) strengthening of the interaction (a mutation that
                    slightly increases the affinity of binding). In general, most mutations lower
                    the expression and activity of gene products, though rare mutations may
                    strengthen them.</p>
                <p>After each mating/division in our evolutionary simulation, we allow a
                    3% chance per gene of a mutation. In a mutated gene, we mutate a
                    randomly-chosen bit sequence, with a recursive 10% chance that an
                    additional bit randomly-chosen bit sequence in the same gene is mutated. Thus,
                    mutations typically change one bit sequence (90% probability per
                    mutation) or more than one (10% probability per mutation) in the
                    gene, allowing mutations to, for example, change both the activity and stability
                    of a gene product. When a bit sequence is mutated, we randomize each position of
                    the bit sequence to a 0 or 1 (mutations result in an independent random draw).
                    The effect of this is the corresponding parameter(s) is/are set to a value
                    between the min and max shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000296.s003">Table S2</xref>. For example, the mean lifetime for
                    a gene product (<italic>H</italic> parameters) will have a log-distributed
                    random value between 1×10<sup>−6</sup> and 100 after a
                    mutation
                        (mean = 1×10<sup>−2</sup>;
                    a factor of 500 lower than the most unstable founder). Thus, 75% of
                    mutations will result in near to complete elimination of a gene product (with a
                    mean lifetime less than 1; in the founders, mean lifetimes vary from
                    5–100). Only a fraction (∼12%) of mutations will
                    produce protein stabilities comparable to those of the founders. Similarly,
                    values for transcriptional regulation (half maximal concentrations or
                    <italic>K</italic> parameters) will have a random value uniformly distributed
                    between 0.001 and 100 (mean = 50, a factor of
                    100 higher than most founders and no gene product in any simulation evolved
                    expression high enough to activate a process with such a weak interaction). This
                    biases the parameter towards extremely high values (i.e. weak activity), with
                    &gt;99% of mutations producing ineffective (or dramatically
                    lowered) transcriptional regulation. For the special case of cooperativities
                        (<italic>ν</italic> parameters), we restricted these values to a
                    narrow range (mutations produce integer cooperativities between 1 and 10), as
                    high cooperativities are computationally expensive. Thus mutations usually
                    produce a limited change in cooperativity, biased towards low cooperativity (log
                    scaled). For all other parameters (&gt;80% of parameters),
                    mutations, on average, produce interactions 2+ orders of magnitude
                    weaker than the founders.</p>
                <p>In our model, mutations usually result in very weak or absent interactions (i.e.
                    the corresponding parameter has a value so the interaction is silent). We have
                    not attempted to reproduce the real distribution of mutational effects. Our
                    model parameters abstract a wide variety of processes (RNA stabilities, protein
                    stabilities, transfer/diffusion rates, etc.). For many processes, the mutational
                    effects are not well known, and capturing the remaining known mutational spectra
                    would require a separate mutational scheme (or genotype→parameter
                    mapping function or both) for each class of parameter. Our goal was to allow
                    mutations to have graded effects that usually disrupt interactions but
                    occasionally strengthen them, and also allow us to calculate the strength of
                    interaction between arbitrary pairs of partners (that may not have co-existed
                    within the same individual before). Additional limitations of our mutation
                    scheme: (1) We do not allow the possibility of whole gene duplications or genes
                    to evolve novel interactions that are absent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure 1A</xref> (i.e. dimerization between en and
                    wg or PTC degrading en). (2) We do not attempt to capture the relative rates or
                    magnitudes of mutational effects: one could imagine that mutations may more
                    frequently alter a protein's mean lifetime than the per-molecule
                    maximal catalytic rate due to the differences in mutational target size.
                    Similarly, the magnitude of mutational effects may differ: individual amino
                    acids may contribute weakly to the overall protein stability while mutations in
                    the active site may dramatically alter catalytic rate.</p>

                <p>In sexual populations, mating was random, with randomly chosen (with replacement)
                    pairs of parents producing a single offspring. Recombination proceeded as
                    follows: In diploid sexual populations, each parent would randomly pass on one
                    of its two alleles for each gene to the offspring (we did not include the
                    effects of genetic linkage in this study). In haploid sexual populations, the
                    haploid offspring produced by mating two haploid parents would randomly inherit
                    (with 50% chance) one of the two parents' alleles for each
                    gene. In both cases, all bit sequences corresponding to an inherited gene were
                    passed on together, and we did not allow recombination within genes. Division in
                    asexual populations was implemented by allowing a randomly chosen individual to
                    produce a clonal offspring that had the same genotype as the parent. In all
                    simulations (sexual and asexual), the genotype was subject to mutation as
                    described above, and individuals reproduced until the specified number of viable
                    offspring reached the population limit. Drift is present in our simulations, as
                    an unlucky individual may stochastically not mate/produce any offspring, and
                    individuals could mate with more than one partner in each generation.</p>

                <p>The developmental function of the segment polarity network is to stabilize
                    stripes of gene expression to pattern subsequent development. From the
                    perspective of this function, mutations that produce insufficiently sharpened wg
                    and en stripes are disastrous while those that result in an over sharpened
                    pattern are viable. To explore the consequences of this, we simulated truncation
                    selection where individuals are dead (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000296.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) if wg and en have expression levels outside of the expression
                    thresholds shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure
                    1C</xref>, or take too long to stabilize their correct patterns. Otherwise,
                    individuals are viable with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000296.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In other words, as long as en and wg are sufficiently high in
                    the correct cells (and sufficiently low in the rest), the developmental
                    processes that depend on wg and en expression are unperturbed and the individual
                    will be viable. These two criteria approximate two biologically plausible
                    extremes, truncation selection penalizing insufficient sharpening of the pattern
                    but allowing the pattern to change, while stabilizing selection penalizes any
                    deviation from the founder pattern.</p>

                <title>Measurement of Robustness</title>
                <p>We tested robustness to 3 types of perturbations that the real segment polarity
                    network might be exposed to: (1) Perturbation of a single bit sequence in a
                    single randomly chosen gene. This usually caused a dramatic change in one or two
                    parameters, and is conceptually similar to a point mutation that produces a
                    specific effect. (2) Perturbation of all parameters. We multiplied each
                    parameter (after calculating it from genotype) by a randomly-chosen
                    (log-sampled) value from 0.66 to 1.5, independently (i.e. all parameters were
                    perturbed by a factor up to 1.5). Extreme environmental stress (pH change,
                    temperature change, starvation, etc.) could alter the cellular environment so
                    many parameters are substantially altered. (3) Perturbation of initial
                    conditions. We multiplied the initial amount of wg and en mRNA by a
                    randomly-chosen (log-sampled) value from 0.5 to 2, independently in each cell
                    (i.e. noise was added to the en and wg prepattern, but this never changed the
                    positions of the cells with the highest initial en and wg). A variety of sources
                    (developmental noise, mutations in genes responsible for the en and wg
                    prepattern, etc) could result in a perturbed prepattern.</p>
                <p>We quantified robustness to these sources of variability and, for clarity, we
                    will use the term ‘survivorship’ when describing results
                    from truncation selection and ‘fitness’ for stabilizing
                    selection. Under truncation selection, we measured the fraction of trials where
                    the ability to sharpen the pre-pattern (according to the criteria in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) continued in the
                    face of perturbation. Under stabilizing selection we measured the fitness
                    decrease (Equation 13) using the distance between the unperturbed and perturbed
                    wg and en expression levels analogously to Equations 14 and 15.</p>

                <p>As described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Models</xref>, we generated 40 viable random haploid genotypes that
                    stabilized and sharpened the pre-pattern to produce the phenotype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure 1C</xref>. These genotypes
                    were not the product of evolution, but of randomly searching for genotypes
                    satisfying the above criteria. We then measured how robustly the phenotype
                    persisted in the face of perturbation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Models</xref>), comparing the randomly
                    generated haploid genotypes with homozygous diploid genotypes (homozygous for
                    the haploid genotype for all genes). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows the robustness of the diploid
                    and haploid networks. Homozygous diploid networks were substantially more robust
                    to perturbations than their haploid equivalents: diploids had a higher chance to
                    maintain the wg and en sharpening and showed a smaller change in their en and wg
                    patterns compared to their haploid equivalents. The diploid robustness advantage
                    varied with the specific genotype we tested, but diploids had greater robustness

                <title>Diploidy and Sex Allow Evolution of Increased Robustness</title>
                <p>We next tested whether the greater robustness of diploid networks persisted when
                    we simulated evolution for 2,000 generations using the same 40 randomly
                    generated, viable genotypes as founders. In these simulations, we used a high
                    mutation rate (μ = 0.03) with small
                    population sizes (N = 200). We used each
                    genotype to generate a genetically identical founder population and simulate
                    evolution under either truncation or stabilizing selection with the following
                    conditions: haploid sexual, haploid asexual, diploid sexual and diploid asexual.
                    Thus, each founder was used in 8 parallel simulations. Our simulations allow us
                    to incorporate key features of diploidy: (1) Genotype is the product of
                    evolution, not from a random search of genotypes that happen to produce the
                    right pattern. (2) There is usually genetic diversity in a population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Rockman1">[9]</xref>,
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Tomso1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Rahim1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Gibson2">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Kidd1">[50]</xref> and diploid
                    individuals can be heterozygous at loci. (3) Diploid individuals experience
                    twice as many mutations as haploids during evolution (assuming a constant
                    per-gene mutation rate).</p>
                <p>Regardless of ploidy or reproduction mode (sexual or asexual), our evolutionary
                    simulations quickly produced a genetically diverse population, with several
                    quantitatively different alleles co-existing for most genes in any given
                    generation (expected since the expected number of mutations per gene per
                    generation μN = 6). Initially,
                    populations were genetically identical at all loci, but the founder allele
                    became extinct within a few hundred generations, after which there was a
                    diversity of several alleles present in the population, and diploid individuals
                    were heterozygous for most genes.</p>
                <p>After simulations were complete, we measured the robustness at each generation to
                    3 types of perturbation; results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g005">Figure 5A–C</xref> for the average of all
                    40 simulations in each condition. Simulations under truncation and stabilizing
                    selection showed the same qualitative behavior. All populations evolved
                    increased robustness to the perturbations. Diploid populations continued to
                    exhibit increased robustness compared to haploid populations, especially when
                    combined with sexual reproduction. Comparing the terminal generations that share
                    a common founder, diploid sexual populations evolved the greatest robustness at
                    generation 2,000 in almost all (38/40 truncation; 39/40 stabilizing) tests of
                    robustness to point mutations, most (32/40 truncation; 31/40 stabilizing) tests
                    of robustness to all parameter perturbations, and a substantial fraction (19/40
                    truncation; 18/40 stabilizing) of tests of robustness to initial conditions.
                    While we cannot determine whether the robustness advantages of diploid sexual
                    populations persist forever (i.e. the asymptotic behavior), extrapolating from
                    data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g005">Figure 5</xref> suggests
                    that diploid sexual populations should maintain higher robustness than other

                <title>Most Mutations Are Recessive in Diploid Networks</title>
                <p>The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g004">Figures 4A</xref>
                    and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g005">5A</xref> suggest that most
                    mutations in the diploid network model are recessive: simulated point mutations
                    had a smaller effect in diploids than haploids. This is not built in; our
                    network allows for the possibility of dominant deleterious mutations. Examples
                    of possible dominant (and lethal) mutations that we observed during simulated
                    evolution: (1) A sufficiently hyperactive WG protein (which is initially
                    expressed at non-zero levels in all cells in our simulation) could disrupt the
                    normal gene expression pattern through excessive global wg autoactivation or
                    global en activation. (2) A mutation in the enhancer of cid that causes loss of
                    inhibition by en would result in overexpression of CID that disrupts the wg and
                    en patterns. In our simulations, mutations usually result in nonproductive
                    interactions, so mutation (1) is far less likely than mutation (2); the former
                    requires the (unlikely) mutation that produces strong autoactivation while the
                    latter requires a (more frequent) loss-of-function.</p>
                <p>There are two mechanisms that may contribute to the increased robustness in
                    diploid populations: First, diploidy allows masking of a perturbed allele by its
                    homologue (i.e. most mutations are recessive). Second, diploid populations may
                    evolve increased robustness faster than their haploid counterparts through a
                    mechanism independent of dominance. To separate these, we measured robustness in
                    diploid populations by simulating symmetric mutations that perturb both versions
                    of an allele by the same amount, so there is no unperturbed homologue to mask
                    the perturbed allele. Symmetric point mutations altered the same bit sequence in
                    both alleles of the perturbed gene by the same amount (both homologous bit
                    sequences were altered by an XOR operation with the same random value). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g005">Figure 5D</xref> shows the results of
                    symmetrically perturbed diploid populations compared to their singly-perturbed
                    haploid counterparts. The robustness of the symmetrically perturbed diploid
                    populations was very close to the haploids, and changed only slightly over time,
                    indicating that the majority of mutations are recessive in our diploid model of
                    the segment polarity network.</p>
                <p>The ability of the network to mask the effects of mutation may itself be evolving
                    (i.e. over time, the network evolves so that more mutations are recessive). Such
                    evolution would manifest in diploid populations as an increase in robustness to
                    (single) point mutation without an increase in robustness to symmetric point
                    mutations. Our data indicates this is the case for diploid sexual populations,
                    as the dramatic increase in robustness to point mutations over time is almost
                    eliminated under symmetric mutation. Diploid asexuals show a far smaller
                    increase, indicating that sex accelerates evolution of greater masking (i.e.
                    greater dominance of functional alleles).</p>

                <title>Diploid Sexual Populations Select Strongly for Compatible Alleles</title>
                <p>Why does sex produce more robust populations? In our simulations, individuals
                    have reduced fitness/survivorship if they fail to sharpen the correct en and wg
                    patterns sufficiently. Fitness/survivorship can be reduced by two sources: a new
                    mutation or, in sexual populations, recombination of alleles that do not
                    function properly together. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g006">Figure
                        6</xref> shows the relative effect of recombination and mutation on
                    survival. During the simulation, we recorded the number of dead individuals and
                    their genotypes, and whether they had a new mutation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g006">Figure 6A</xref> shows the fraction of individuals
                    with a new mutation that were viable. This data is qualitatively consistent with
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, but includes
                    mutations that could alter multiple genes and bit-sequences during evolution. To
                    determine how often recombination produced incompatible allele combinations, we
                    measured the fraction of deaths where individuals did not have a new mutation
                    (i.e. the fraction of the dead due to recombination). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g006">Figure 6B</xref> shows diploid sexual populations
                    showed a near doubling of this fraction compared to the haploid sexual
                    populations. Thus, diploid sexual populations experience a greater pressure to
                    maintain alleles that both produce the correct phenotype and that are also
                    highly compatible with the other alleles in the population. Recombination
                    constantly produces new allele combinations that cause quantitative variation;
                    thus sexual populations (especially diploid sexual populations) more strongly
                    select for genotypes (and alleles) that are robust to quantitative variation.</p>

                    Consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g006">Figure 6B</xref>,
                    we see that recombination produces a higher fitness load in diploid populations
                    (the fitness load is noticeably higher in diploid sexual populations compared to
                    diploid asexuals), but not haploid populations (the fitness load of the two
                    haploid populations are nearly equal). Proulx and Phillips <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Proulx1">[14]</xref> showed the upper
                    bound for selection for mutational robustness is the fitness load minus the
                    mutation rate. All 4 populations have fitness loads higher than μ, with
                    diploid sexual populations having the greatest expected pressure to evolve (and
                    maintain) mutational robustness. Taken together, our data shows that the
                    combination of sex with diploidy synergize to produce the strongest selection
                    for mutational robustness.</p>

                <title>Phenotypes Move Away from Some Selection Thresholds</title>
                <p>Under truncation selection, individuals were dead if they failed to sharpen en
                    and wg sufficiently or if they did so too slowly. Populations under stabilizing
                    selection were penalized if the en or wg pattern was altered, but fitness was
                    independent of the time the prepattern was sharpened. To explore how aspects of
                    the phenotype and network function evolved, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g007">Figure 7</xref> plots the time at which the pattern
                    was sharpened sufficiently and the average wg and en levels at the time
                    selection acted (200–500 min). Under both selection types, populations
                    evolved to sharpen wg more rapidly, with all populations showing similar
                    speeding. In contrast, sexual populations maintained the time to sharpening of
                    the en pattern, but asexual populations (particularly diploid asexual) showed
                    slowed sharpening. Thus, evolution did not exclusively favor faster sharpening.
                    Under truncation selection, the expression levels at which both wg and en
                    stabilized (in the different cells that should express those genes highly)
                    evolved to higher and higher values. Expression of wg showed more change
                    compared to en, and wg expression often decreased in cells that had to express
                    it at low levels. The highest possible en and wg level is 20 in our simulations,
                    and requires both maximal transcription and highly stable products (long mean
                    lifetimes). In general, diploid sexual populations show the greatest tendency to
                    move away from thresholds of failure (high expression in the appropriate cell,
                    and low elsewhere), while diploid asexual populations sometimes move towards
                    expression thresholds (higher expression in cells that should express low
                    levels, and slightly later en sharpening).</p>

                    and wg patterns for both truncation and stabilizing selection after 2,000
                    generations. Faster stabilization of the pattern was associated, on average,
                    with only a modest increase in robustness. The average robustness of the diploid
                    and haploid founders is also plotted (large circles). The best-fit lines
                    indicate the correlation between evolved robustness and sharpening time;
                    intersection of this line with the mean founder behavior indicates the
                    robustness increase was due solely to changes in expression time. However, the
                    best-fit lines lie above the founders, indicating that the robustness evolved
                    through a mechanism independent of a faster time to sharpening. Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g008">Figure 8B</xref> correlates
                    mutational robustness with expression level in the highest-expressing cell for
                    truncation selection; there was little expression change under stabilizing
                    selection. We did not fit lines to the data, as such a fit would be dominated by
                    the outliers; most of the simulations showed little change in expression.
                    However, there is only weak correlation between expression level and robustness,
                    and the robustness that evolves is clearly not due solely to superthreshold
                    buffering. Thus, both stabilization and truncation selection evolves greater
                    robustness, particularly diploid sexual populations through mechanisms that do
                    not have profound changes in phenotype.</p>

                <p>In the previous simulations, mutational robustness was expected to evolve due to
                    the high mutation rate. Theory predicts such robustness should evolve when there
                    is substantial genetic diversity, specifically when μN&gt;1. Sex may
                    allow selection for robustness at lower mutation rates, and this has been shown
                    in randomly-wired transcriptional networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Azevedo1">[35]</xref>. To test whether
                    this holds in our network, we ran simulations with

                    results of this simulation for 38 founders. We observed little robustness
                    evolution in haploid populations, with no significant increase in robustness by
                    generation 5,000. In contrast, diploid sexual populations evolved higher
                    mutational robustness, while asexual diploid populations showed a transient
                    decrease in robustness that stabilized by generation 1,000. As before, symmetric
                    double mutations eliminated the diploid robustness advantage, indicating the
                    diploid advantage was due to dominance of functional alleles. Again,
                    recombination resulted in a greater fitness penalty in diploid populations

            <p>We explored how ploidy and sex shape the evolution in a model of an actual,
                well-characterized, developmental genetic network. The segment polarity network is
                one of the best characterized networks, and comprises a functional module <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">[2]</xref> that
                is conserved across insects and beyond. Previous theoretical and modeling studies
                have predicted mutational robustness can evolve, but we believe it is essential to
                test these findings in as detailed a model as possible. Our model allows us to
                bridge genotype to phenotype and to capture fundamentally important aspects of
                allelic fitness which no previous model has represented. We found that diploidy and
                sex combine to allow populations to evolve the greatest robustness to mutation,
                global perturbations affecting all interactions, and initial conditions. Diploidy
                confers an immediate robustness advantage as most deleterious mutations are
                recessive in our network, and over time the network evolves so that functional
                alleles become more dominant. Recombination, especially in diploid populations,
                produced a greater fitness load that selected for greater robustness evolution even
                at lower mutation rates of μ = 1/N.
                Recombination in our network constantly shuffled alleles and prevented the
                stabilization of matched allele combinations that could be maintained in asexual
                populations. In sexual populations, the constant shuffling of alleles by
                recombination in a genetically diverse population selects for those alleles that are
                highly compatible with others—i.e. alleles that are robust to genetic
                variation and mutation.</p>
            <p>It is useful to compare our evolutionary model to that of previous computational
                studies on robustness evolution. Wagner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">[5]</xref> simulates evolution in
                randomly-wired haploid regulatory networks, which have been used in numerous studies
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Azevedo1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Siegal1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Bergman1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Ciliberti1">[52]</xref>. The Wagner model
                assumes a fixed time step, steep nonlinearities that result in effectively discrete
                expression levels and additive regulatory effects. All parameters reflect the
                strength of transcriptional activation/repression and mutation allows single
                mutations to change an inhibitor to an activator with 50% probability. In
                contrast to this, our model allows continuously variable expression levels with more
                graded nonlinearities (the maximum Hill coefficient in our simulations was 10).
                Previous models with fixed time steps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Siegal1">[36]</xref> reported a dramatic
                increase in speed in generating the target pattern of gene expression, while we
                observed only a slight speeding of wg (but not en) sharpening. In our model,
                molecular half lives can be mutationally altered as they would be in real life,
                which is difficult to translate to a fixed-time step model. It also permits
                non-additive interactions between multiple transcriptional regulators. Our model
                does not allow the sign of a regulatory interaction to change (inhibitors never
                switch to activators), and allows mutations to be <italic>cis</italic> or

                <italic>cis</italic> effects only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">[5]</xref>), thus allowing a meaningful exploration of
                diploidy. In our model, mutations are qualitatively similar to Wagner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">[5]</xref>, as most
                result in nonproductive/weak interactions.</p>
            <p>Other simulations have attempted to capture more accurate quantitative effects of
                mutation and other biological parameters. Robustness evolution has also been
                explored in models of mRNA secondary structure prediction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Ancel1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner2">[34]</xref>. These models allow the
                detailed quantitative prediction of effects of mutation which we cannot do for our
                model; additionally it is difficult to explore the effects of recombination and
                diploidy in these models in a way that would meaningfully translate to genetic
                regulatory networks. It would be possible to alter our model so that the bit
                sequences represented mutable DNA/RNA sequences from which the interaction strength
                is calculated. We did not explore this because we wanted a general scheme to capture
                interactions within the network, and most model parameters reflect protein-protein
                or protein-DNA interactions. If we replaced our binary bit sequences with sequences
                of DNA bases (ATGC) or the 20 amino acids, there is no tractable function to
                describe how well the two would interact, as such a calculation would require
                prediction of the tertiary or quaternary structure. For the case of protein-DNA
                interactions with known binding motifs, the effects of mutations can be approximated
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Benos1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Benos2">[54]</xref>, and it would be an interesting extension to this
                work to incorporate a similar approximation. However, there are many interactions in
                addition to transcriptional regulation in our model, and such a scheme would not
                allow us to model all parameters. One final limitation of computer simulation is
                that we are limited by available computing power to relatively small populations and
                high mutation rates. Real <italic>Drosophila</italic> effective population sizes and
                mutation rates differ from our simulations by more than an order of magnitude.
                    <italic>Drosophila</italic> populations are monomorphic for most genes
                (Nμ&lt;1), so robustness is unlikely to evolve through the mechanism in
                our model. The small population size we use strongly increases the effect of drift,
                and may lead to increased genetic load and heterozygosity compared to
                larger/infinite populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Haag1">[55]</xref>. Additionally, the increased drift due to low
                population sizes can hide the effect of weak selective pressures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Hughes2">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Kimura1">[57]</xref>.
                Despite these limitations, our simulation incorporates a more realistic network and
                mutational effects than those in previous studies, and further advances in computing
                power will allow larger simulations.</p>
            <p>Theory has predicted that sex and diploidy can evolve increased robustness in the
                presence of genetic variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Proulx1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Kondrashov1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Otto2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Lynch1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Gardner1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-deVisser1">[37]</xref>.
                Mutational robustness can evolve without recombination when there is sufficient
                genetic variation (Nμ&gt;1). In randomly-wired haploid transcriptional
                networks, recombination leads to evolution of robustness when
                Nμ = 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Azevedo1">[35]</xref>, a result that we did
                not observe in our haploid segment polarity network, though this may be due to the
                short duration of our simulations (5,000 generations) or small population sizes.
                More generally, Proulx and Phillips<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Proulx1">[14]</xref> predict that selection for robustness depends on
                the fitness load (effect of variation from all sources), and we clearly see diploid
                sexual populations have the greatest load (from mutation and recombination), while
                sex has little effect on haploid populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g009">9</xref>). Our results are generally consistent with
                this theory except for the substantial decrease in mutational robustness under
                conditions of lower mutation rate in asexual populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g009">Figure 9</xref>). The most likely explanation for this
                decrease is because the diploid founders are homozygous for all alleles, and thus
                both ‘halves’ of the network are identical. Theory predicts
                networks would rapidly accumulate deleterious recessive mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Proulx1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Nowak1">[58]</xref> that
                were masked by the working counterpart, and such mutations would persist in asexual
                populations without recombination to remove them. Because there is only a single
                working allele, there is nothing to rescue this network when that allele is mutated,
                resulting in a decrease in robustness compared to the founder. The decrease in
                robustness does not continue forever, reaching a minimum by approximately generation
                1,000. The initial decrease in robustness reflects the loss of functionally
                redundant alleles possessed by the founders, consistent with theory that suggests
                selection to maintain both alleles is weak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Nowak1">[58]</xref>.</p>
            <p>We found diploidy confers a robustness advantage primarily because most deleterious
                mutations are recessive to their working counterparts. Our model allows the
                possibility of dominant mutations, but predicts that most deleterious mutations are
                recessive in the segment polarity network. This is consistent with metabolic
                networks, however, we do not allow for the possibility of interference between two
                alleles (i.e. that wg1 might bind nonproductively to its targets, blocking wg2
                activity as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g003">Figure 3</xref>
                and discussed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Models</xref> section). Because of this, our model may underestimate
                the rate of dominant deleterious mutations, which are important for dominance
                evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Veitia1">[59]</xref>. Future studies could explore the effect of more
                detailed allelic interaction, and incorporate more realistic rates of the different
                types of mutation and their quantitative effect, once such data is available.
                Additionally, our scheme allows us to simulate the effects of both
                <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> mutations, and future studies could
                also explore differences in mutational rates and whether they are consistent with
                genomic data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wittkopp1">[60]</xref>.</p>
            <p>The selection pressure that acts upon the real segment polarity network is not known.
                Since the segment polarity network stabilizes stripes of gene expression that
                activate downstream processes at the proper location, fitness must depend on the
                pattern produced. Our truncation selection explores the simple assumption that the
                expression of a segment polarity gene must be above a threshold for activation of
                those processes in the correct location and below this threshold everywhere else,
                for development to proceed normally. Alternatively, genomic data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Denver1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Rifkin1">[47]</xref> suggest that many
                genetic networks are under stabilizing selection—maintaining specific,
                optimal levels of gene expression through time. Our simulations show truncation
                selection leads to evolution of higher gene expression (far above threshold) in
                those cells that should express the gene. Intuitively, very high gene expression
                levels should buffer the system to tolerate perturbations that cause slight changes
                in expression level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Haldane1">[61]</xref>, and our simulations are consistent with this
                intuition and previous modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Siegal2">[62]</xref>. We do not impose a cost associated with higher
                expression, though presumably greater synthesis comes with a metabolic cost that
                would eventually limit the expression. The ultimate level of expression depends upon
                on the balance of synthesis and degradation, and mutations that solely increase the
                stability of a gene product likely have little metabolic cost, but it is difficult
                to determine the upper limit for gene product stability. Thus, in truncation
                selection, our founders had non-optimal patterns of gene expression that satisfied
                the developmental task; and evolved towards a more optimal phenotype with high
                expression levels of essential genes. However, the increase in expression alone
                shows only a weak correlation with increased robustness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g008">Figure 8</xref>), and robustness in both truncation and
                stabilizing selection shows similar increases despite an unchanging pattern under
                stabilizing selection. Many parameters in our model reflect the activity of a gene
                product (<italic>K</italic> parameters) and so gene activity can change without
                changes in expression. It is likely that the absolute expression level is less
                important than the amount by which the expression exceeds the minimum/maximum
                threshold for activity. Thus, populations rapidly produce increased robustness
                regardless of whether the initial phenotype is optimal, and can evolve increased
                robustness without dramatic changes in phenotype.</p>
            <p>Several extensions of this work warrant future study. We do not allow for the
                possibility of new regulatory interactions or gene duplication events (but we do
                allow for interaction loss) that alter the topology of the network. The topology of
                the segment polarity network to robustly stabilize stripes of wg and en expression
                may be nearly optimal, as indicated by a search of nearby network topologies in a
                simplified network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Ma1">[63]</xref>. It would be interesting to extend our
                simulations to allow the topology to change (i.e. the rise of new regulatory
                interactions) and gene duplication events, to see whether this topology is
                evolutionarily preserved or, if evolution settles on an alternate network. Gene
                duplication events would be particularly interesting because a duplication of all
                genes in the network would effectively increase the ploidy. Many organisms exist as
                tetraploid, octaploid or beyond, and others can amplify their genomic content
                through endoreplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Edgar1">[64]</xref> to attain very high ploidy(&gt;1000C).
                Additionally, some viruses can have high effective ploidy when multiple viruses
                infect the same cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Elena1">[65]</xref>. Our study suggests that having 2 copies of each
                gene can confer a robustness advantage over just one because most mutations are
                recessive and this more than compensates for the doubling of mutation rate. It would
                be interesting to explore under what conditions an increase in ploidy ceases to be
                advantageous in real networks, and why diploidy, as opposed to tetraploidy or beyond
                is so common. Finally, our scheme for translating genotype to model parameters would
                easily extend to randomly-wired networks used in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">[5]</xref>, and
                allow diploid networks to be explored.</p>
            <p>It is an open question as to how general our results are for other real networks.
                Theory and modeling studies indicated that increased phenotypic robustness readily
                evolves under conditions of interacting genes and variation in haploid networks
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Lynch1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Azevedo1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Siegal1">[36]</xref>. Based on these studies and ours, we speculate
                diploid sexual populations will evolve greater mutational robustness in networks
                when most deleterious mutations are recessive, and there is sufficient interaction
                between gene products so that recombination will select for alleles that can combine
                robustly with other alleles. By allowing both masking (by diploidy) and allele
                shuffling (recombination), the two can combine to achieve greater robustness than
                either alone. Thus, a sexual population for which robustness is important would
                likely favor a dominant diploid, not haploid, life cycle.</p>
