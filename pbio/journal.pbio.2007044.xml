<abstract>
<p>The power of forward genetics in yeast is the foundation on which the field of autophagy research firmly stands. Complementary work on autophagy in higher eukaryotes has revealed both the deep conservation of this process, as well as novel mechanisms by which autophagy is regulated in the context of development, immunity, and neuronal homeostasis. The recent emergence of new clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-based technologies has begun facilitating efforts to define novel autophagy factors and pathways by forward genetic screening in mammalian cells. Here, we set out to develop an expanded toolkit of autophagy reporters amenable to CRISPR/Cas9 screening. Genome-wide screening of our reporters in mammalian cells recovered virtually all known autophagy-related (ATG) factors as well as previously uncharacterized factors, including vacuolar protein sorting 37 homolog A (VPS37A), transmembrane protein 251 (TMEM251), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (ALS2), and TMEM41B. To validate this data set, we used quantitative microscopy and biochemical analyses to show that 1 novel hit, TMEM41B, is required for phagophore maturation. TMEM41B is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein distantly related to the established autophagy factor vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), and our data show that these two factors play related, albeit not fully overlapping, roles in autophagosome biogenesis. In sum, our work uncovers new ATG factors, reveals a malleable network of autophagy receptor genetic interactions, and provides a valuable resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.deniclab.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://crispr.deniclab.com</ext-link>) for further mining of novel autophagy mechanisms.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Eukaryotic cells use autophagy to eliminate unwanted structures—such as protein aggregates, intracellular pathogens, and damaged organelles—that are too large to be handled by the proteasome. This unusual vesicle transport pathway begins with packaging of cytoplasmic targets into a double-membrane vesicle (autophagosome) and ends with their degradation in the lysosome. A deeper understanding of autophagy as a regulated mechanism for protein turnover has the potential to provide new therapies for diverse human pathologies, including neurodegenerative disease, cardiometabolic disease, and cancer. Here, we set out to build new reporters for studying mammalian autophagy by genetic screening. This approach allowed us to carry out pooled genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) knockout screens and recover virtually all known mammalian autophagy-related (ATG) factors. In addition, we uncovered several uncharacterized proteins, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B), which we went on to show is required for normal growth of autophagosome precursor membranes around their targets. More broadly, our data set provides a comprehensive resource of genes that affect autophagosome trafficking to the lysosome for further hypothesis testing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autophagy is an umbrella term for a broad family of trafficking pathways that transport cytoplasmic material to the lysosome for destruction. Its most studied form, macroautophagy (hereafter “autophagy”), involves the formation of a double-membrane vesicle (the autophagosome) that sequesters cytoplasm and delivers it to the lysosome by vesicle fusion. The first factors identified in autophagosome biogenesis, the so-called autophagy-related (ATG) factors, were originally identified by genetic screens in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref003">3</xref>]. This list eventually matured to its current state that includes approximately 40 yeast ATGs and distinguishes “core” factors required for all forms of autophagy from those required only for specific substrates (e.g., a damaged mitochondrion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref004">4</xref>]. The inventory of factors involved in autophagy has been further expanded by the discovery of additional autophagy factors not found in yeast, such as ATG101, EPG5, and vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref008">8</xref>]. Whether additional autophagy factors have yet to be discovered remains an open question.</p>
<p>The molecular functions of ATGs in autophagosome biogenesis are still being delineated. Initiation involves construction of a cup-shaped precursor membrane (the phagophore) in close apposition to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref013">13</xref>]. This process is dependent on the RB1 inducible Coiled-Coil 1 (RB1CC1) scaffolding protein and post-Golgi vesicles containing ATG9A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref016">16</xref>]. Next, recruitment of an autophagy-specific phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) complex results in localized phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate (PI3P) formation and recruitment of PI3P effectors such as WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2 (WIPI2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref018">18</xref>]. Nascent phagophores are then elongated concurrent with lipid conjugation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3) family proteins (autophagy-related protein 8 [Atg8] in yeast), although the requirement for LC3 lipidation has recently been challenged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Efficient encapsulation of specific cell material within autophagosomes is mediated by autophagy receptors, adaptor proteins whose defining feature is their ability to bridge cargo with lipidated LC3 present on the autophagosomal membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref022">22</xref>]. Interactions between cargos, receptors, and lipidated LC3 leads to their mutual capture by autophagosomes and subsequent lysosomal destruction. This feature of LC3 has been exploited to establish the most widely used reporter of autophagic flux: tandem-fluorescent (tf) LC3 (tfLC3). In this approach, 2 fluorescent protein tags (red fluorescent protein [RFP] and green fluorescent protein [GFP]) are appended to the amino terminus of LC3. Upon lysosomal delivery of tfLC3, low pH conditions within the lysosomal lumen selectively quench GFP fluorescence, resulting in a dramatic increase in the observed Red:Green fluorescence ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref024">24</xref>]. In a similar manner, tf sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) has been used to measure the flux of this heavily studied autophagy receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we further expanded this approach to include 3 additional SQSTM1-like receptors (nuclear dot protein 52 [NDP52], tax1 binding protein 1 [TAX1BP1], and neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1 [NBR1]) broadly implicated in selective autophagy. With this expanded toolkit in hand, we performed genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens to identify selective autophagy factors in mammalian cells. We recovered virtually all known ATG factors and uncovered several uncharacterized proteins for further study. We validated our list using quantitative cell microscopy and biochemical analyses to define transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B) as an integral ER membrane protein that is required for phagophore maturation in higher eukaryotes. TMEM41B shares a broadly conserved transmembrane domain (pfam09335) with an established autophagy factor, VMP1, and our data show that these 2 factors play related, though not fully overlapping, roles in autophagosome biogenesis.</p>

<title>Expanding the toolkit of autophagic flux reporters for genetic screening</title>
<p>K562 cells (a human myelogenous leukemia line) can be readily cultured in cell suspension, which has led to their frequent use in pooled CRISPR screens. To devise a general strategy for monitoring autophagic flux in K562 cells, we began by constructing 6 homologous gene cassettes: 1 (tfLC3) encoding an N-terminal, tf (RFP-GFP) fusion with LC3B, 4 (tfSQSTM1, tfNDP52, tfTAX1BP1, and tfNBR1) with N-terminal fusions to SQSTM1-related autophagy receptors, and 1 (tfEmpty) as a negative control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). The RFP to GFP fluorescence ratio (Red:Green ratio) of tfLC3 is a widely used metric for autophagic flux predicated on the selective quenching of GFP in low pH environments, such as the lysosomal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Following cassette integration at the adeno-associated virus integration site 1 (AAVS1) locus, we analyzed cells by flow cytometry under basal conditions and following treatment with either Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of autophagosome–lysosome fusion, or torin, a small-molecule inducer of autophagy. Corresponding changes in the observed Red:Green ratio of tfLC3 and tfReceptors provided strong evidence for both basal and induced autophagy in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). By contrast, the Red:Green ratio of tfEmpty cells was unresponsive to either drug treatment, arguing that nonselective reporter engulfment makes a negligible contribution to our flux measurements. We obtained similar results using adherent human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that torin-induced increases in Red:Green ratio were due to selective GFP quenching (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s001">S1C Fig</xref>) and that both basal and induced autophagy were dependent on the known autophagy-related factors RB1CC1 and ATG13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s001">S1D and S1E Fig</xref>). Collectively, these data validated a broad panel of autophagic flux reporters for subsequent use as genetic screening tools in K562 cells.</p>

<title>CRISPR screens for modifiers of autophagic flux recover known ATG factors and reveal new candidates</title>
<p>Next, we performed a series of genome-wide, pooled CRISPR knockout screens in K562 cells co-expressing CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) with each of our autophagic flux reporters. To this end, we utilized the Brunello single guide RNA (sgRNA) library containing 76,441 sgRNAs covering 19,114 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref025">25</xref>]. Following transduction of the sgRNA library, we used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to collect the top and bottom third of cells ranked on the basis of their Red:Green ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Read counts of sgRNAs derived from these cell fractions were obtained by Illumina sequencing and computationally analyzed by model-based analysis of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (MAGeCK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref027">27</xref>].

K562 cells expressing Cas9 were transduced with the Brunello lentiviral sgRNA library. The top and bottom third of cells were collected based on Red:Green ratio. sgRNA sequences from collected cells were obtained by Illumina sequencing and analyzed by MAGeCK. (B) Shown is a heat map of averaged beta scores (similar to fold-enrichment) for the indicated sgRNAs. Scores are color coded based on the effect of the indicated sgRNA (red, sgRNA suppresses autophagy; blue, sgRNA enhances autophagy). For comparison, known ATG factors (regardless of effect size) are presented alongside novel hits. Genes are clustered loosely based on their known function. sgRNAs listed under “other” (e.g., TMEM41B) were chosen from targets whose beta scores placed them in the top approximately 50 hits for 1 or more reporters. sgRNAs listed under “enhancer sgRNAs” target the 6 genes that scored better than the highest-scoring known autophagy regulator, MLST8. Underlying read counts and beta scores are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s009">S2 Data</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s010">S3 Data</xref>, respectively.

<p>From the global analysis of gene hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), we made multiple observations that validated our genetic screening approach. First, virtually all known ATG factors were identified as required for reporter flux. Second, we observed the expected phenotype for positive and negative regulators of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a potent inhibitor of autophagy signaling. Third, we could distinguish protein complexes implicated in autophagy from related complexes with shared subunits. For example, our analysis distinguished the autophagic role of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex from the related class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) complex. Similarly, hits in the BLOC-one-related complex (BORC) disrupted autophagy, but we found no hits among subunits specific to the related biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex (BLOC-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our screening approach also identified several uncharacterized factors as strong modifiers of autophagy. To examine these hits further, we retested them as individual sgRNAs alongside a broad panel of known ATG factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g003">Fig 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s002">S2A–S2D Fig</xref>). Indeed, the vast majority of individual sgRNAs increased or decreased flux proportionate to their beta score ranking (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). By contrast, we found that sgRNAs targeting uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) were spurious hits that modified the Red:Green ratio by drastically enhancing RFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). We also confirmed that tfNBR1 flux in K562 cells was largely independent of ATG factors required for LC3 lipidation (e.g., ATG7), which agrees with our original screen findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). ATG7-independent autophagosome formation has been reported in other cell types, and our work suggests that NBR1 might provide a useful new marker for further dissecting this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref030">30</xref>]. In sum, our genetic screening strategy and hit validation robustly uncovered known ATG factors and unveiled new candidates for further study.</p>

<title>TMEM41B is a conserved ER membrane protein required for autophagy</title>
<p>TMEM41B stood out among our uncharacterized hits because of its strong phenotype (particularly for tfNDP52 and tfTAX1BP1) in K562 cells. This protein is predicted to span the membrane 6 times and to carry a di-lysine, C-terminal Golgi-to-ER retrieval signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref031">31</xref>]. In line with these predictions, an unbiased proteomic analysis of subcellular fractions previously assigned TMEM41B’s residence to the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref032">32</xref>]. Indeed, when we immunoprecipitated TMEM41B we found that N-terminally tagged, but not C-terminally tagged, TMEM41B co-immunoprecipitated a coat protein I (COPI) complex component of Golgi-to-ER vesicles from detergent-solubilized cell lysates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, when we tagged the N-terminus of endogenous TMEM41B with the 11th beta strand of GFP (GFP11) and co-expressed a complementary GFP fragment (beta strands 1 through 10 [GFP1–10]), we observed a reticular GFP fluorescence signal that colocalized with the ER marker calnexin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s003">S3C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether TMEM41B is critical for autophagy in other human cell lines, we knocked out its gene in HEK293T and HCT116 cells, where we observed even more robust effects on autophagy than in our original K562 background. Specifically, immunoblotting (IB) analysis of endogenous SQSTM1, TAX1BP1, NDP52, and LC3 revealed their accumulation in the absence of TMEM41B consistent with the possibility of reduced autophagic turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s003">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>). Two complementary measures of autophagic flux further support this interpretation. First, treatment of <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells with BafA1 was unable to induce further accumulation of lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Second, tfLC3 and tfSQSTM1 flux were strongly repressed in <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells, comparable to <italic>ATG7</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s003">S3F and S3G Fig</xref>). Taken together, these data argue that autophagic flux is substantially inhibited in the absence of TMEM41B.</p>

<title>TMEM41B mediates phagophore maturation</title>
<p>While autophagy was dramatically impeded in the absence of <italic>TMEM41B</italic>, it was unclear whether this defect was caused by the inability to properly initiate autophagy, the failure of phagophores to mature into autophagic vesicles, or the failure of mature autophagosomes to properly traffic and/or fuse with lysosomes. To define the stage of autophagosome formation that is arrested in <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells, we used a series of complementary approaches to systematically probe the autophagosome biogenesis pathway. The accumulation of lipidated LC3 in <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells is inconsistent with an initiation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To further support this view, we analyzed the kinase activity of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), a component of the RB1CC1 complex that regulates phagophore nucleation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref033">33</xref>]. Upon autophagy induction, ULK1 phosphorylates numerous substrates including ATG13. Consequently, the phosphorylation of serine-318 (p-S318) in ATG13 can serve as a proxy for ULK1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref035">35</xref>]. We found that activation of autophagy by torin stimulated the appearance of p-S318 comparably in wild-type and <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). For comparison, this assay robustly detected loss of ULK1 activity in cells lacking RB1CC1, a known ULK1 kinase coactivator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). These data argue that the primary role of TMEM41B is downstream of initiation.</p>
<p>Next, to determine whether initiated phagophores matured properly in <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells, we turned to a protease protection assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref036">36</xref>]. In this assay, properly sealed autophagosomes protect their cargo from proteolysis by an exogenous protease. Cells were treated with BafA1 for 18 h to accumulate autophagosomes prior to lysis by mechanical disruption. As expected, in wild-type extracts, the autophagy receptor NDP52 was protease resistant until membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100 (a nonionic detergent). By contrast, NDP52 was protease sensitive in native extracts derived from <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells and <italic>RB1CC1</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> control cells, consistent with a failure to properly form completed autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We obtained similar results when we analyzed protease protection of LC3-II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s004">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). In sum, these data suggest that TMEM41B is required for phagophore maturation.</p>

<p>To better define the arrested stage of autophagosome biogenesis in <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells, we used confocal microscopy to monitor the recruitment of various ATGs associated with specific steps in autophagosome biogenesis. To validate this approach, we monitored the formation of LC3-positive (LC3+) punctae. Consistent with our earlier biochemical approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g005">Fig 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), we found that <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells displayed approximately 5.5-fold more LC3+ punctae than wild-type cells under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). We reached a similar conclusion when we measured the abundance of LC3+ structures that colocalized with SQSTM1 as an additional marker of autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>).

<p>We next analyzed LC3+ structures for WIPI2, which associates with PI3P-rich phagophore intermediates but not mature autophagosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref037">37</xref>]. We found that the majority of LC3+ structures in <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells colocalized with WIPI2 (79%; <italic>n</italic> = 5,032 LC3+ structures) while those in wild-type cells overlapped poorly with WIPI2 (8%; <italic>n</italic> = 1,394) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Genetic ablation of RB1CC1 abolished accumulation of LC3+ or WIPI2+ structures in <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells, arguing that these structures represent bona fide intermediates in the process of phagophore maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). In addition, we visualized syntaxin 17 (STX17), a SNARE protein that is recruited to late phagophore intermediates prior to vesicle closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref038">38</xref>]. This analysis did not find appreciable amounts of STX17 on the LC3+ structures that accumulate in <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s005">S5D and S5E Fig</xref>).

<p>Collectively, our biochemical and microscopy-based data argue that ablation of TMEM41B arrests phagophore maturation during membrane elongation—specifically, after recruitment of LC3 or WIPI2 but prior to WIPI2 dissociation or STX17 recruitment. To substantiate this interpretation, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as an alternative method of visualizing arrested autophagosomal intermediates at an ultrastructural level. Analysis by TEM revealed the accumulation of single-membrane vesicles (approximately 140 nm in diameter) in <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells but not in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s006">S6A Fig</xref>).

<p>To gain insight into the biochemical function of TMEM41B, we focused on its broadly conserved transmembrane domain (pfam09335) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref039">39</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s003">S3A Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). VMP1 is another broadly conserved ER-membrane protein that also contains a pfam09355 domain and is required for an early stage of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref040">40</xref>]. On the basis of these similarities, we hypothesized that TMEM41B and VMP1 have related activities. To examine this possibility, we looked for increased association of certain ATG factors with ER membranes in the absence of TMEM41B, a hallmark of arrested autophagosome biogenesis in <italic>VMP1</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref041">41</xref>]. Indeed, following differential centrifugation of cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g008">Fig 8A</xref>), we observed a shift in the migration of WIPI2, RB1CC1, and ATG9A from the high-speed pellet (p100) to lower-speed pellets containing ER-derived membranes (p3 and p20) in both <italic>VMP1</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> and <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).

<p>To additionally test the hypothesis that TMEM41B and VMP1 have related activities, we performed a genetic complementation analysis. Specifically, we used our tf gene cassette system to overexpress tagged versions of TMEM41B and VMP1 and evaluated suppression of the <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> phenotype by 2 assays: monitoring receptor accumulation by IB and cargo encapsulation by protease protection. Both tfTMEM41B and tfVMP1 (approximately 15-fold over-expressed [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2007044.s007">S7B Fig</xref>]) complemented <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g008">Fig 8C–8E</xref>). By contrast, only tfVMP1 was able to suppress <italic>VMP1</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> phenotypes. Taken together, these data strongly argue that VMP1 and TMEM41B have partially overlapping roles during phagophore maturation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The power of forward genetics in yeast is the foundation on which the field of autophagy research firmly stands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref046">46</xref>]. Complementary work on autophagy in higher eukaryotes has revealed both the deep conservation of this process, as well as novel mechanisms by which it is regulated in the context of development, immunity, and neuronal homeostasis. Much of this diversification is enabled by autophagy receptors, proteins that connect diverse cellular targets with the core autophagy machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref047">47</xref>]. However, the potential of these receptors as genetic handles for identifying new factors and adaptations of human autophagy has only begun to be explored.</p>
<p>CRISPR-based screens have recently demonstrated their power over previous technologies in identifying novel mammalian autophagy factors and pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref049">49</xref>]. Here, we combined CRISPR screening with an expanded toolkit of tf reporters to identify novel factors required for mammalian autophagy. These data are freely available in their entirety as an interactive resource at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.deniclab.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://crispr.deniclab.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Our screens recovered virtually all known ATG factors as well as uncharacterized factors, including TMEM41B. In follow-up studies, we showed that TMEM41B is an ER integral membrane protein critical for autophagic flux in multiple human cell lines. Using complementary biochemical and fluorescence-microscopy–based assays, we detected the accumulation of unsealed, LC3+, WIPI2-positive autophagy intermediates in cells ablated for TMEM41B (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g006">6</xref>). Furthermore, our ultrastructural analysis by CLEM found that these intermediates correspond to a collection of thin (approximately 50 nm) membranous sheets, tubules, and vesicles, which are hallmarks of immature isolation membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g007">Fig 7</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>TMEM41B contains a conserved transmembrane domain (pfam09335) also found in VMP1, a factor previously known to regulate phagophore maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref050">50</xref>]. Correspondingly, overexpression of VMP1 restored autophagosome formation in <italic>TMEM41B</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2007044.g008">Fig 8</xref>), consistent with the possibility that TMEM41B and VMP1 may be structurally and/or functionally related. VMP1 is absent in yeast but is generally conserved in higher eukaryotes. In <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and other model eukaryotes, cells lacking VMP1 display diverse phenotypes, including defects in autophagy, membrane contact sites, ion homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and phosphoinositide distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref052">52</xref>]. In light of such pleotropic effects, it remains unclear whether the autophagy defects observed in cells lacking VMP1 or TMEM41B are direct or sequelae of a broader defect in ER-organelle dynamics.</p>
<p>During revision of this manuscript, 2 groups independently reported TMEM41B as a novel modifier of mammalian autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref054">54</xref>]. Consistent with the results herein, both observed similarities between TMEM41B and VMP1 deletions. On the basis of these phenotypic similarities, one immediate hypothesis is that TMEM41B and VMP1 function as a complex. Indeed, Morita and colleagues were able to isolate a VMP1/TMEM41B-containing co-complex in the presence of n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside/cholesteryl hemisuccinate (DDM/CHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref053">53</xref>], although such a complex was not observed in other detergents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref055">55</xref>]. It remains an important future goal to establish whether TMEM41B’s function is dependent on its interaction with VMP1. A potential clue comes from studies of DedA proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which share pfam09335 with TMEM41B and VMP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref056">56</xref>] and are distantly related to bacterial LeuT transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref057">57</xref>]. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells lacking the DedA homologs YqjA and YghB have a defect in proton import that can be rescued by overexpressing a Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-H<sup>+</sup> antiporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref059">59</xref>]. Future biochemical and structural studies of VMP1 and TMEM41B will provide new tools for testing their potentially conserved role in ion homeostasis.</p>
<p>A deeper understanding of autophagy has the potential to provide therapeutic insight into numerous pathologies, including neurodegenerative disease, cardiometabolic disease, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref062">62</xref>]. TMEM41B, for example, has been implicated in diverse pathologies, including spinal muscular atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref063">63</xref>], pulmonary carcinoid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref064">64</xref>], and coronavirus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref065">65</xref>]. Our work argues that autophagy should be further examined as a potential etiological factor in these contexts.</p>
<p>The identification of TMEM41B as a novel ATG factor is one facet of this work, but other aspects of our data remain to be explored. These include novel inducers of autophagy, receptor-specific modulators, and additional putative ATG factors. Vacuolar protein sorting 37 homolog A (VPS37A) and VPS25 are 2 factors in the latter category known to assemble into endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT). ESCRT components have long been implicated in autophagy and may function at several steps during autophagosome biogenesis, as well as during autophagosome–endolysosomal fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref067">67</xref>]. Many ESCRT components are required for cell division, which complicates analysis of their mutant phenotypes. By contrast, VPS37A is nonessential and offers a potential future handle for further dissecting the mechanistic details of ESCRT’s role in mammalian autophagy.</p>
<p>In sum, the resource presented herein presents 3 concrete advances. First, it illustrates the robust nature of tf flux reporters as genetic screening tools that can be further applied to other receptors and receptor targets. Second, it yields a rich data set (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.deniclab.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://crispr.deniclab.com</ext-link>) for further hypothesis testing. And lastly, it provides a new molecular handle (TMEM41B) for further dissecting the enigmatic role of the ER membrane in the process of autophagosome biogenesis.</p>

<title>Gel electrophoresis and western blotting</title>
<p>Cells were trypsinized at 75% confluency and quenched in an equal amount of media. Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2X complete protease inhibitor tablet [Roche, Basel, Switzerland]). For phosphorylation analysis, lysis buffer was supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (10X: 100 mM NaF, 10 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 100 mM NaPP<sub>i</sub>). Lysates were cleared 2X at 1,000 g for 5 min. Post-spin supernatants were used as input. Protein levels in supernatants were normalized using a BCA protein assay (#23227, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Normalized samples were boiled in 1X (final concentration) Laemmli Loading Buffer (3X stock: 189 mM Tris [pH 6.8], 30% glycerol, 6% SDS, 10% beta-mercaptoethanol, bromophenol blue). Gel electrophoresis was performed at 195 V for 70 min in Novex 4%–20% Tris-Glycine gels. Total protein analysis was performed using SYPRO Ruby (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (short protocol). For western blotting, samples were transferred for 60 min to 0.2 μm PVDF membranes (#ISEQ00010, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) using a Semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked for 20 min in TBS-T with 5% milk. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. Blots were then rinsed 3× 5 min.

Cells were seeded onto coverslips overnight so that they would be 15% confluent at the time of fixation. When reported, cells were treated with 250 nM torin for 1 to 3 h prior to fixation. Fresh 16% PFA (#15710, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) was diluted to 4% in 1X Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (#14080–055, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Coverslips were removed with forceps and placed into 4% PFA for 15 min. PFA was aspirated and washed twice with PBS (D8537, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA). For LC3 IF, cells were transferred to wells containing prechilled (−20°C) methanol for 5 min. Slides were returned to PBS and washed 2× for 5 min. Slides were blocked at RT for 1 h in blocking buffer (0.3% Triton X-100, 5% NGS in PBS) and washed once in PBS. Primary antibody was diluted in 5% NGS at the dilutions described elsewhere in Materials and methods. The amount of 75 ul of antibody mixture was spotted on parafilm in a humidified chamber, and inverted coverslips were incubated with antibody overnight at 4°C.

<title>Image analysis</title>
<p>Fluorescence microscopy images were processed using a newly developed Python analysis pipeline built around the pyto_segmenter analysis package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref070">70</xref>]. First, regions of images containing cells were identified. To do so, we first fit a Gaussian distribution to the fluorescence intensity distribution for a smoothed green channel (488 nm excitation) z-stack from an empty field. Using this Gaussian fit, we predicted the probability that each pixel in the smoothed green channel z-stack for each field corresponded to background (noncell) or foreground (cell). We assigned each pixel with a <italic>p</italic>(background) &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup> to the cells, thus creating a “cell mask.” After removing small specks (&lt;100,000 pixels volume) to eliminate debris, we removed out-of-focus planes from the cell mask using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref071">71</xref>]. Next, nuclei were segmented from the blue (DAPI) channel by slice-by-slice relative thresholding followed by watershed segmentation using the pyto_segmenter package. Cells were segmented using watershed segmentation from nuclei seeds. Cell edges were eroded to eliminate blurred edge excess included during the <italic>p</italic>-value transformation. Cells contacting the edge of the field were removed from analysis. Next, punctae were segmented in the green and red (561 nm) channels using the pyto_segmenter package with empirically determined Canny edge detection thresholds. The number of total punctae and punctae overlapping with objects in the other fluorescence channel were counted, and tabulated data were saved in .csv format. Plotting was performed using R and the ggplot2 package. See the image analysis package for details.

<p>gDNA was purified from collected cells using the NucleoSpin Blood XL kit (#740950.1, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina sequencing libraries were created by PCR amplifying the genomically integrated sgRNA sequences. All gDNA was used for each PCR. A pool of 8 staggered-length forward primers was used in each PCR reaction to avoid monotemplating during Illumina sequencing. Reverse primers contained unique barcodes designed to allow for sequencing and differentiation of multiple libraries on a single chip during Illumina sequencing. Each 50 μL PCR reaction contained 0.4 μM of each forward and reverse primer mix (Integrated DNA Technologies), 1X Phusion HF Reaction Buffer (NEB, Ipswich, MA), 0.2 mM dNTPs (NEB, Ipswich, MA), 40 U/mL Phusion HF DNA Polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA), 5 μg of gDNA, and 3% v/v DMSO. The following PCR cycling conditions were used: 1X 98°C for 30 s; 25X (98°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s); and 1X 72°C for 10 min. The resulting products were pooled to obtain the sgRNA libraries. The pooled PCR products were size selected by adding 0.95X magnetic bead slurry as outlined by DeAngelis and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2007044.ref072">72</xref>]. The High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used to confirm the absence of primer dimers after purification. Sample libraries were quantified by qPCR using the NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (NEB, Ipswich, MA). Four to five libraries were pooled to a total concentration of 10 nM for simultaneous Illumina sequencing on a single chip. The libraries were sequenced using either the HiSeq 2000 or 2500 system (Illumina). The HiSeq 2000 system was run on High Output Run Mode with the TruSeq SBS version 3 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The HiSeq 2500 system was run on either the Rapid Run Mode with the HiSeq Rapid SBS version 2 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) or the High Output Run Mode with the HiSeq SBS version 4 kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

The cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany) utilizing a Laser diode 405–30 CW (405 nm) and an Ar-Laser Multiline (488 nm). Cells of interest were identified by fluorescence microscopy; a z-stack covering the whole cell volume (voxel size: 83 nm × 83 nm × 438 nm) was acquired. The relative positioning of the cells on the photo-etched coverslips was determined by taking a low magnification DIC image. The coverslips were removed from the object glass, washed with 0.1 M PHEM buffer, and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde/0.1 M PHEM overnight. Cells were postfixed in osmium tetroxide and potassium ferry cyanide, stained with tannic acid and uranyl acetate, and thereafter dehydrated stepwise to 100% ethanol followed by flat-embedding in Epon.
