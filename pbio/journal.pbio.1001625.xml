<p>Oligodendrocyte development and myelination rely on an unusual membrane-associated transcription factor that shares functional domains with bacteriophage proteins.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The myelination of axons is a crucial step during vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) development, allowing for rapid and energy efficient saltatory conduction of nerve impulses. Accordingly, the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, and their expression of myelin genes are under tight transcriptional control. We previously identified a putative transcription factor, Myelin Regulatory Factor (<italic>Myrf</italic>), as being vital for CNS myelination. <italic>Myrf</italic> is required for the generation of CNS myelination during development and also for its maintenance in the adult. It has been controversial, however, whether <italic>Myrf</italic> directly regulates transcription, with reports of a transmembrane domain and lack of nuclear localization. Here we show that <italic>Myrf</italic> is a membrane-associated transcription factor that undergoes an activating proteolytic cleavage to separate its transmembrane domain-containing C-terminal region from a nuclear-targeted N-terminal region. Unexpectedly, this cleavage event occurs via a protein domain related to the autoproteolytic intramolecular chaperone domain of the bacteriophage tail spike proteins, the first time this domain has been found to play a role in eukaryotic proteins. Using ChIP-Seq we show that the N-terminal cleavage product directly binds the enhancer regions of oligodendrocyte-specific and myelin genes. This binding occurs via a defined DNA-binding consensus sequence and strongly promotes the expression of target genes. These findings identify <italic>Myrf</italic> as a novel example of a membrane-associated transcription factor and provide a direct molecular mechanism for its regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Oligodendrocytes are a highly specialized cell type that surround axons of the vertebrate central nervous system with myelin, electrically insulating them and allowing rapid and energy-efficient propagation of nerve signals. We previously identified a protein, MYRF, that is required for the final stages of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Although we proposed that MYRF might act as a transcription factor, it remains uncertain whether this is true, given that MYRF and related proteins contain a transmembrane domain that might preclude localization to the nucleus. Here, we show that the MYRF protein undergoes an activating cleavage event to release the functional transcription factor from the transmembrane domain that otherwise anchors it to the endoplasmic reticulum. Unexpectedly, this cleavage event is mediated by a portion of MYRF that is related to a self-cleaving domain found in bacteriophage proteins. This distinguishes it from other membrane-associated transcription factors that are cleaved via regulated proteolysis within the membrane bilayer. We find that the N-terminal product of MYRF cleavage directly binds to a wide range of genes involved in myelination, stimulating their expression. Many of these MYRF binding sites identify previously uncharacterized enhancers for these myelin genes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the vertebrate CNS; their development and the ensheathment of receptive neuronal axons are vital for the rapid propagation of nerve impulses. Accordingly, the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes and their subsequent myelination of axons are highly regulated processes. At the transcriptional level, the factors involved in the development of the oligodendrocyte lineage have been relatively well characterized. The transcription factor <italic>Olig2</italic> is required for specification of OPCs from subventricular zone precursor cells, at least within ventral regions of the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Lu1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Zhou1">[2]</xref>. <italic>Olig2</italic> is continually expressed in the lineage and has later roles in directing the chromatin-remodeling enzyme <italic>Brg1</italic> to regulatory elements of target genes during differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Yu1">[3]</xref>. A number of other transcription factors are subsequently required for the successful differentiation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes including <italic>Olig1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Xin1">[4]</xref>, <italic>Nkx2.2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Qi1">[5]</xref>, <italic>Ascl1/Mash1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Sugimori1">[6]</xref>, <italic>Zfp191</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Howng1">[7]</xref>, and <italic>Sox10</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Takada1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Stolt1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>We recently identified Myelin Regulatory Factor (<italic>Myrf</italic>; previously known as <italic>Gene Model 98</italic> and <italic>MRF</italic>) as a transcript that is highly induced during oligodendrocyte differentiation and absent in other CNS cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Cahoy1">[10]</xref>. Based on the MYRF protein containing a putative DNA-binding domain (DBD) with homology to that of the yeast transcription factor <italic>Ndt80</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Fingerman1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Montano1">[12]</xref>, we proposed that <italic>Myrf</italic> might act as a direct transcriptional regulator of CNS myelination. Consistent with this hypothesis, conditional ablation of <italic>Myrf</italic> causes severe CNS dysmyelination, with oligodendrocytes stalling at the pre-myelinating stage and showing severe deficits in myelin gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Emery1">[13]</xref>. Inducible ablation of <italic>Myrf</italic> in mature oligodendrocytes of the adult CNS also causes a rapid down-regulation of myelin gene expression followed by a gradual degeneration of CNS myelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Koenning1">[14]</xref>. Unlike previously described transcription factors <italic>Olig1</italic>, <italic>Olig2</italic>, <italic>Sox10</italic>, <italic>Nkx2.2</italic>, and <italic>Ascl1</italic>, <italic>Myrf</italic> is expressed only at the postmitotic stage of the oligodendrocyte lineage, suggesting that its induction is a key step in the regulation of myelination.</p>
<p>While these results identified a vital role for <italic>Myrf</italic> in the generation and maintenance of CNS myelin, they did not address the molecular mechanisms by which it acts. Notably, the assignment of <italic>Myrf</italic> as a transcription factor was recently questioned based on a lack of nuclear localization of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog, <italic>pqn-47</italic>, with <italic>pqn-47</italic> and <italic>Myrf</italic> instead proposed to have a role in secretion of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Russel1">[15]</xref>. Consistent with this, the MYRF protein contains at least one hydrophobic region that originally led to the human ortholog <italic>MYRF/C11Orf9</italic> being classed as a probable transmembrane protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Stohr1">[16]</xref>. Together, these findings raise the question of whether <italic>Myrf</italic> and its orthologs promote myelination through the direct regulation of key myelin genes, or whether they may act via other mechanisms involving the membrane and myelin protein trafficking system previously implicated in myelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Trajkovic1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which <italic>Myrf</italic> mediates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. We find that the MYRF protein is subject to autoproteolytic cleavage within a domain related to bacteriophage tail spike proteins. This cleavage yields an N-terminal nuclear-targeted fragment containing the DBD, and is required for MYRF's promotion of myelin gene expression. Through ChIP-Seq analysis and luciferase assays we show that MYRF binds the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of multiple oligodendrocyte-specific genes involved in myelination. This binding occurs via a defined DNA consensus sequence and strongly promotes transcription from these elements. These findings establish <italic>Myrf</italic> as a membrane-associated transcription factor with a direct role in stimulating myelin gene expression.</p>

<title><italic>In Silico</italic> Prediction of MYRF Features</title>
<p>In spite of its clear role in regulating CNS myelination, little is known about <italic>Myrf</italic> at the protein level. To learn more about the features and likely function of the MYRF protein, we identified functional domains in its 1,139 aa sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Emery1">[13]</xref> by homology analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Predicted features (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) include the previously described proline-rich region (residues 60–330) and putative Ndt80-like DBD (residues 393–540). In agreement with Stohr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Stohr1">[16]</xref>, a transmembrane region was predicted by a number of programs at residues 767–789. In addition, several targeting motif predictors (ELM and NucPred) identified a likely nuclear localization signal (NLS) at residues 252–258. A putative coiled coil domain was identified at residues ∼685–706, though with only moderate confidence. HHpred searches as well as the NCBI conserved domain search function identified a region of similarity to the intramolecular chaperone domain (ICD) of the bacteriophage tail spike proteins at residues 587–647 (see below for further details). These predicted features and the confidence scores associated with them are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s007">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<title>MYRF Protein Is Cleaved to Yield a Nuclear N-Terminal Fragment</title>
<p>The presence of both predicted transmembrane and DBDs raised the possibility that MYRF may be subject to proteolytic cleavage in a similar manner to membrane-associated transcription factors such as Notch and the SREBPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-DeStrooper1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Brown1">[19]</xref>. We therefore performed Western blot analysis on a double-tagged MYRF expression construct (Myc-MYRF-FLAG) in 293T cells. Probing with both anti-Myc and anti-FLAG detected a faint ∼140 kda band corresponding to a full-length protein as well as more intense bands at ∼75 kda and 70 kda, respectively, corresponding to cleavage products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Analysis of a number of truncated MYRF constructs indicated that this cleavage occurred several kDa past the C-terminal end of the predicted DBD (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To confirm that the cleavage was not an artifact of overexpression of the tagged protein or the cell line, we assessed the cleavage of the endogenous protein in primary mouse oligodendrocytes using a monoclonal antibody mapped to the C-terminal cleavage product of MYRF (anti-C-terminal-MYRF-mab). We found that the endogenous MYRF protein undergoes the same cleavage event, giving two bands of equivalent sizes to the anti-FLAG immunoblotting of the Myc-MYRF-FLAG construct. These bands were absent in lysates from MYRF conditional knockout (CKO; <italic>Myrf<sup>FL/FL</sup>; Olig2<sup>WT/Cre</sup></italic>) oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming their identity.</p>
<p>Subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that the Myc-tagged N-terminal cleavage product was predominantly located in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). To further investigate the subcellular localization of the cleavage products we transfected the CG-4 oligodendroglial cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Louis1">[20]</xref> with the Myc-MYRF-FLAG construct. Immunostaining confirmed that the Myc-tagged N-terminal product predominantly localized to the nucleus (though at higher exposure additional extranuclear staining was also apparent). In contrast, the FLAG-tagged C-terminus was excluded from the nucleus, predominantly co-localizing with the endoplasmic reticulum marker calnexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). To determine localization <italic>in vivo</italic>, mouse optic nerve sections were stained with the anti-C-terminal-MYRF-mab and a rabbit polyclonal raised against the N-terminal region of MYRF (anti-N-terminal-MYRF). Co-staining with the two antibodies resulted in labeling of the same cells, with the anti-N-terminal antibody staining the nucleus and the anti-C-terminal monoclonal resulting in extranuclear staining of the same cells and in the majority of Sox10+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g001">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Double-staining with anti-N-terminal-MYRF and the mature oligodendrocyte marker CC1 confirmed that the MYRF-expressing cells were oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). These results show that endogenous MYRF is subject to cleavage both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, resulting in nuclear translocation of the N-terminal domain only.</p>

<title>Activating Cleavage of MYRF Occurs Via an Autoproteolytic ICD Related to Bacteriophage Tail Spike Proteins</title>
<p>We next sought to identify the mechanism of the cleavage event. HHpred and NCBI conserved domain searches using the region of MYRF that we predicted to contain the cleavage site as input (residues 546–763) revealed a region of significant homology to RCBS structural entries 3GUD and 3GW6 (with E-values of 2.8E-17 and 4.9E-12 for 3GUD3, respectively; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s007">Table S1</xref>). These hits represent the ICD of the bacteriophage tail spike proteins, including the GP12 neck appendage and Endo-N-acetylneuraminidase (endosialidase) proteins. Alignment of MYRF and the bacteriophage neck appendage protein (Uniprot Q9FZW3) within this region of 61 amino acids revealed an amino acid identity of 21.3%, with 49.1% similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The ICD mediates folding and subsequent autoproteolytic cleavage of these proteins to release a functional trimeric N-terminal fragment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Schwarzer1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Stummeyer1">[23]</xref>. Although this protein domain has not to our knowledge been reported to mediate proteolytic cleavage of proteins in eukaryotes, the high degree of similarity between MYRF and the ICD of the bacteriophage tail spike proteins at a site closely matching the predicted cleavage site of MYRF was striking.</p>

<p>Autoproteolytic processing within the endosialidase ICD is dependent on a serine-lysine dyad that mediates cleavage at the serine residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Schwarzer1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Schulz1">[22]</xref>. To assess whether this domain may also mediate cleavage of MYRF, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the equivalent amino acids in MYRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Nonconservative mutation of S587 (S587A) or mutation of K592 (K592H, K592R, and K592M) in the Myc-MYRF-FLAG construct was sufficient to block the cleavage of MYRF as assessed by Western blot analysis; in contrast, the cleavage was preserved with a conservative mutation of the S587 residue (S587C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition to the absence of cleavage, the S587A, K592H, or K592R mutants were blocked from the nucleus (shown for the K592H mutation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), demonstrating that the cleavage is a prerequisite for nuclear localization of the protein. To determine the functional consequences of blocking cleavage we co-transfected primary rat OPCs in proliferative conditions with GFP and either empty vector (pcDNA3), or pcDNA containing Myc-MYRF-FLAG or the corresponding S587A and K592H mutant constructs. As previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Emery1">[13]</xref>, forced expression of MYRF results in precocious expression of the mature marker Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) in a subset of cells within 48 h of transfection. In contrast, the S587A and K592H mutants did not increase MOG expression relative to the pcDNA3 control transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g002">Figure 2D–E</xref>), confirming that the uncleavable mutants were unable to promote myelin gene expression.</p>
<p>The predicted NLS within the proline-rich region of MYRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) was consistent with the observed nuclear localization of the N-terminal cleavage product. To assess whether the predicted NLS has a role in nuclear targeting of the N-terminal cleavage product, we mutated the putative NLS sequence in the Myc-MYRF construct (254KRR256 to 254AAA256; Myc-MYRF<sup>ΔNLS</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Unlike mutation of the ICD, mutation of this putative NLS did not inhibit the cleavage of MYRF, however total levels of the Myc-MYRF<sup>ΔNLS</sup> protein invariably appeared to be higher than the unmutated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Immunostaining for the Myc-MYRF and Myc-MYRF<sup>ΔNLS</sup> proteins showed that mutation of the NLS shifted the predominant localization of the N-terminal region from nuclear to extranuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g002">Figure 2H and I</xref>), indicating that this NLS largely mediates the nuclear localization of the N-terminal portion of the protein.</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that the MYRF protein is cleaved via a domain related to the ICD chaperone domain of bacteriophage tail spike proteins to yield a nuclear-targeted N-terminal fragment consisting of the proline-rich region and DBD. The C-terminal cleavage product containing the transmembrane region is excluded from the nucleus.</p>

<title>MYRF Directly Targets Genes Induced During Oligodendrocyte Differentiation</title>
<p>To examine whether the N-terminal cleavage product of MYRF binds directly to the genome in oligodendrocytes, we performed a ChIP-seq experiment immunoprecipitating the Myc-tagged MYRF construct and associated chromatin from cultured primary rat oligodendrocytes using anti-Myc. Previously published ChIP-Seq comparisons between expressed tagged and endogenous transcription factors have shown a high degree of agreement between the peaks identified with each method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Mazzoni1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Yao1">[25]</xref>. Oligodendrocytes transfected with an untagged MYRF served as a negative control. ChIP-Seq analysis identified 2,102 peaks in the Myc-MYRF condition; 17 of these peaks had a corresponding peak in the untagged-MYRF control condition, indicating that they represented false positive peaks. These 17 peaks were removed from analysis leaving 2,085 peaks specific to the Myc-MYRF condition. No peaks were identified in the untagged-MYRF condition that did not have a corresponding peak in the Myc-MYRF condition. Genomic coordinates of all peaks are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s006">Supporting Information S1</xref>.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that many of the oligodendrocyte-specific genes induced during differentiation (including abundant myelin genes such as <italic>Mbp</italic> and <italic>Plp1</italic>) are reliant on MYRF for their expression, however whether MYRF directly targets these genes is unknown. To determine whether MYRF binding sites are preferentially located proximal to these genes, we generated lists of the 200 most enriched genes in neurons, astrocytes, or postmitotic oligodendrocytes based on our published transcriptome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Cahoy1">[10]</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s008">Table S2</xref> for the gene lists) and screened for the presence of MYRF peaks relative to their transcription start sites (TSSs).</p>
<p>Based on the 2,085 observed MYRF peaks and an estimated size of the rat genome of 2.75 Gb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Gibbs1">[26]</xref>, we would expect a peak to occur every 1.3 Mb on average. The number of peaks observed proximal to the TSSs of the 200 neuron and astrocyte-specific genes (which would not be expected to be regulated by MYRF) were relatively close to this expected background, with 39 and 40 peaks detected within 100 kb of their collective TSSs, respectively (expected = 30.8). In contrast, the oligodendrocyte-enriched genes showed a ∼3-fold increase in the density of peaks within 100 kb of their TSSs relative to the neuron and astrocyte genes, with multiple peaks detected for a number of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This enrichment was particularly evident within 1 kb of the TSS and intronic regions of the oligodendrocyte-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and was highly statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001 by Chi-squared test).</p>

<p>For a more detailed analysis of the positioning of the MYRF peaks relative to TSSs, we plotted the incidence of MYRF peaks relative to the TSS of an unbiased gene list (17,090 rat refseq IDs) as well as the neuron-, astrocyte-, and oligodendrocyte-specific gene lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Plotting of MYRF peaks relative to the TSS of the unbiased gene list revealed a slight increase in MYRF binding in the 5 kb immediately upstream of the TSS, suggesting a modest overall relationship between MYRF binding and the TSS of genes in general. When we plotted MYRF binding relative to the TSSs of neuronal and astrocyte-specific genes, no relationship between the TSS and MYRF binding was evident. In contrast, there was a substantial increase in the incidence of MYRF binding around the TSS of the oligodendrocyte-specific genes. This enrichment was also evident for approximately 50 kb downstream of the TSS of the oligodendrocyte-specific gene list, again suggesting binding within intronic and downstream enhancers. MYRF occupancy at several well-established oligodendrocyte genes (<italic>Plp1</italic>, <italic>Mbp</italic>, <italic>Mag</italic>, <italic>Trf</italic>, and <italic>Cntn2</italic>), showing identified peaks for each, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g004">Figure 4</xref>.

<p>Somewhat intriguingly, although the Chip-Seq background signal (“noise”) was low throughout most of the genome, high background was observed within a number of genes highly expressed by oligodendrocytes including <italic>Plp1</italic>, <italic>Mbp</italic>, <italic>Cnp</italic>, and the oligodendrocyte-enriched miRNA <italic>miR219-2</italic>. This background was present in both the Myc-MYRF and the untagged MYRF transfected samples (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s002">Figure S2</xref> for several examples), suggesting it did not reflect MYRF binding <italic>per se</italic>, nor was it identified as peaks by the MACS algorithm. The source of this background and its specificity to a small number of highly expressed transcripts is not clear, though it may be due to the “sono-seq” effect, in which open chromatin is preferentially fragmented by sonication and therefore overrepresented in sequencing data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Auerbach1">[27]</xref>. Although this background did not result in false-positive called peaks, it may have masked additional intronic MYRF binding sites within these highly expressed genes.</p>
<p>These findings indicate that the MYRF binding sites are not distributed randomly throughout the genome, but instead are overrepresented around genes usually induced during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Consistent with this, when we submitted the peak coordinates to GREAT (Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-McLean1">[28]</xref>), “axonal ensheathment” and “myelination” were the top two enriched gene ontology biological process terms for genes proximal to the MYRF peaks (<italic>p</italic> = 3.29e-6 and 5.50e-6, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001625-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>MYRF ChIP-Seq Peaks Identify Novel Enhancers of Myelin Gene Transcription</title>
<p>The positioning of the MYRF binding sites relative to oligodendrocyte-specific genes indicated that MYRF binding may identify <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements/enhancers for these genes. We therefore cloned a number of 400–700 bp DNA sequences encompassing the MYRF peaks shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g004">Figure 4</xref> into the pGL3-promoter construct upstream of the SV40 promoter and the luciferase gene (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s010">Table S4</xref> for genomic coordinates of regions used and expression profiles of the associated genes). When transfected into CG-4 cells, these DNA regions modestly increased luciferase activity by several-fold relative to the control vector. Co-transfection of a MYRF expression vector with these putative enhancers induced luciferase expression by a further 4–12-fold. In contrast, MYRF co-expression had no effect on luciferase expression from the pGL3 vectors lacking enhancers (pGL3-Promoter), with an irrelevant SV40 enhancer (pGL3-Control) or with a control DNA region 1 kb upstream of the MYRF binding site identified within intron 1 of the <italic>Cntn2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

The enhancers increased luciferase expression ∼60-fold in control oligodendrocytes relative to the promoter-only constructs, indicating that these ChIP-Seq-identified regions represent powerful oligodendrocyte enhancers.

<p>MYRF and its human ortholog (MYRF/C11Orf9) were initially identified as putative transcription factors due to apparent conservation of several basic amino acids required for the DNA binding activity of yeast Ndt80 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Fingerman1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Montano1">[12]</xref>.

<title>MYRF, Sox10, and Olig2 Display Overlapping Genomic Binding Sites</title>
<p>Given the overrepresentation of the Sox10 consensus motif in the regions bound by MYRF, as well as the similar CNS dysmyelination phenotype displayed in the absence of Sox10 and MYRF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Takada1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Stolt1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Emery1">[13]</xref>, it is tempting to speculate the two factors may target the same genes and/or regulatory elements. To assess this, we compared the MRF ChIP-Seq dataset with an independently generated Sox10 ChIP-Seq dataset generated from the developing rat spinal cord, in which 17,659 Sox10 peaks were identified (J. Svaren, unpublished data). Despite the independent generation of these datasets, there was a relatively high degree of direct overlap between the peaks for the two factors, with 30.3% of the MYRF peaks having an overlapping Sox10 peak. This overlap was particularly striking for regions near myelin genes. Nevertheless, in addition to the shared peaks, there were clear examples of peaks highly specific for each factor. These factor-specific peaks confirm specificity in the signal obtained for binding in each experiment, and also indicate the ability for each factor to bind independently of the other (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s003">Figure S3</xref> for examples surrounding the <italic>Mobp</italic>, <italic>Mbp</italic>, <italic>Cntn2</italic>, and <italic>Josd2</italic> genes). We extended this analysis by including a recently published dataset of 25,787 binding sites for the transcription factor Olig2 in differentiating rat oligodendrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Yu1">[3]</xref>. There was also a significant degree of overlap between the binding sites for MYRF and Olig2 (40.2% of the MYRF peaks having an overlapping Olig2 peak). Overall, there were 517 sites of overlap between the peaks for all three transcription factors. This overlap points to a likely important functional relationship between these three factors in regulating key genes in the CNS myelination program.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that <italic>Myrf</italic> is required for oligodendrocyte differentiation and the generation and maintenance of CNS myelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Emery1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Koenning1">[14]</xref>. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanisms by which MYRF acts to drive these processes. We find that MYRF is a transmembrane transcription factor that undergoes a proteolytic cleavage event to separate the N-terminal transcription factor from the transmembrane domain-containing C-terminal region. The N-terminal component of MYRF is targeted to the nucleus by at least one nuclear localization sequence and directly binds to the regulatory elements of genes involved in myelination to stimulate their transcription. The C-terminal cleavage product remains excluded from the nucleus. These results reconcile previous reports that propose transmembrane/endoplasmic reticulum localization and nontranscription factor function of the family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Russel1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Stohr1">[16]</xref> and reports that have proposed a family of transcription factors defined by yeast <italic>Ndt80</italic> and including <italic>MrfA</italic> in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and <italic>MYRF</italic> in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Fingerman1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Emery1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Senoo1">[32]</xref>.</p>

<title>MYRF Is a Novel Example of a Membrane-Associated Transcription Factor That Cleaves by a Unique Mechanism</title>
<p>There are varied examples of membrane-associated transcription factors in nature, including Notch, the SREBPs, and ATF6, which are synthesized as inactive membrane-bound precursors linked to the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. Upon a biological signal (binding of Jagged or Delta in the case of Notch, cholesterol in the case of the SREBPs and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the case of ATF6), these proteins are cleaved by Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis (RIP) to release nuclear targeted products that effect transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-DeStrooper1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Brown1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Haze1">[33]</xref>. Like these factors, MYRF undergoes a cleavage event to release its DNA-binding N-terminal region from the transmembrane domain. Consistent with this, we found that overexpression of truncated MYRF constructs consisting of the proline-rich, DNA-binding, and CID domains (residues 1–763) but not the C-terminal region were sufficient to drive myelin gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to Notch, the SREBPs, and ATF6, however, the activating cleavage of MYRF occurs several hundred residues away from the transmembrane domain in a region homologous to the ICD of bacteriophage tailspike proteins. Mutation of key residues required for autoproteolytic cleavage of the tailspike proteins also blocks cleavage of MYRF, confirming that MYRF cleaves via this ICD rather than the RIP mechanism common to these previously described membrane-associated transcription factors. It is extremely tempting to speculate that the cleavage of MYRF is regulated in response to a biological signal, as is the case for other known membrane-associated transcription factors. To a large extent, however, MYRF's cleavage appears to be consitutive, as we observed cleavage when MYRF was expressed in cultured primary oligodendrocytes, the CG-4 oligodendrocyte cell line, 293T cells, or even when a GST-fusion construct including MYRF amino acids 330–765 was expressed in bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Similarly, probing optic nerves with the anti-N-terminal and C-terminal antibodies at a series of ages ranging from postnatal day 8 to adult indicated at all stages the majority of MYRF protein in oligodendrocytes was present in the cleaved form, with the N-terminal antibody giving primarily nuclear staining. This is consistent with the function of the ICD in the bacteriophage endosialidase protein, which mediates autoproteolytic cleavage of the protein upon homotrimerization and proper folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Schwarzer1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Stummeyer1">[23]</xref>. As such MYRF's activating cleavage may simply occur following correct folding and self-association of the protein. Whether this is the case or whether it occurs in response to a biological signal will be an extremely important point to clarify in future work.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, within vertebrates this bacteriophage ICD is only represented by <italic>MYRF</italic>, the closely related paralog <italic>Myelin Regulatory Factor-like/Gene Model 239</italic>, and their orthologs. This cleavage mechanism appears to extend well back in evolution, however, with the DNA-binding portion of the MrfA protein in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> having recently been reported to run as a ∼75 kda protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Senoo1">[32]</xref> and the serine/lysine dyad required for cleavage of the ICD also being present in the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> protein and other orthologs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The domain is not present in Ndt80, however, raising the intriguing possibility that the ICD may have arisen in bacteriophages and been transferred to eukaryotes via lateral gene transfer.</p>

<title>MYRF Directly Targets Genes Underpinning Oligodendrocyte Differentiation and Myelination</title>
<p>Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that MYRF directly regulates the expression of genes underlying myelination. Peaks in MYRF binding in the genome of primary oligodendrocytes were strongly overrepresented near oligodendrocyte-specific genes, many of which we have previously found to be reliant on MYRF for their expression. Luciferase assays confirmed that these MYRF-bound regions acted as strong MYRF-dependent enhancers of transcription. Due to the limitations of previous methods, studies looking at the direct targets of oligodendrocyte transcription factors have typically focused on activity at the promoters or nearby <italic>cis</italic> regulatory elements of well-defined myelin genes. For example, Sox10 and Olig1 have been shown to promote transcription at the <italic>Mbp</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Stolt1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Li1">[34]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that MYRF more commonly targets intronic or upstream enhancer regions than the direct promoter regions of target genes. Although we only focused on the 100 kb either side of the TSSs, enhancers can be located at distances of at least a megabase distal to target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Amano1">[35]</xref>. This represents a substantial challenge in definitively linking ChIP-Seq identified binding sites to their likely target genes.</p>
<p>In spite of this challenge, the use of ChIP-Seq methods in conjunction with genome-wide expression analysis offers an opportunity for broad target identification. MYRF binding sites were present proximal to genes encoding important protein components of myelin including <italic>Mbp</italic>, <italic>Plp1</italic>, <italic>Mag</italic>, and <italic>Mog</italic>. In addition, we were able to identify MYRF binding sites for genes with varied demonstrated roles in myelination/oligodendrocyte biology (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s009">Table S3</xref>). These include genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins (<italic>Tppp</italic>, <italic>Kif21a</italic>), receptors (<italic>Fgfr2</italic>, <italic>Gpr37</italic>), oligodendrocyte/neuron junctional proteins (<italic>Cntn2</italic>, <italic>Hapln2</italic>, <italic>Nfasc</italic>), transmembrane proteins (<italic>Kai1</italic>, <italic>Odz4</italic>), lipid metabolism proteins (<italic>Aspa</italic>, <italic>Elovl7</italic>, <italic>Fa2h</italic>, <italic>Ldrap1</italic>, <italic>Ugt8</italic>, <italic>Slc45a3</italic>), as well as other transcription factors (<italic>Sox10</italic>, <italic>Nkx6-2</italic>, <italic>St18</italic>, <italic>Smad7</italic>). In addition, we were able to identify MYRF binding sites proximal to many oligodendrocyte-enriched genes whose roles in myelination have not yet been investigated, such as <italic>Josd2</italic>, <italic>Rffl</italic>, <italic>Nipal4</italic>, and <italic>Rnf220</italic>. These targets give a broader perspective of the cellular mechanisms by which MYRF coordinates the differentiation of oligodendrocytes and their myelination.</p>

<title>MYRF Binds DNA Via a Defined Consensus Sequence</title>
<p>Based on the ChIP-Seq data, we were able to identify a novel seven base-pair consensus motif for MYRF (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTGGYAC</named-content>). Mutation of this sequence in luciferase constructs was sufficient to prevent the activity of MYRF and prevent interaction with the DBD of MYRF in DNA pull-down assays. This motif is distinct from the binding motif for Ndt80 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACAAA[A/G]</named-content>) and also from recently described binding sequences for the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> ortholog <italic>MrfA</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Senoo1">[32]</xref>, suggesting that the binding preferences for this transcription factor family have diverged significantly during evolution. Although the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTGGYAC</named-content> motif could be found near the centre of the majority of the strong MYRF peak sequences, it is unlikely to be the only determinant of MYRF binding to DNA. Intriguingly, the second most enriched motif identified in our ChIP-seq sequences was a good match for the consensus sequence of the oligodendrocyte transcription factor Sox10, and consistent with this, a strong degree of overlap was seen for ChIP-Seq peaks obtained for both MYRF and Sox10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s003">Figure S3</xref>). It seems likely that interactions between MYRF and Sox10 or other oligodendrocyte transcription factors as well as chromatin prepatterning by Olig2 and Brg1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Yu1">[3]</xref> will play a large role in determining binding patterns and expression of key myelin genes.</p>
<p>Alignment of the MYRF protein with the ICD of the phage neck appendage protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001625-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) revealed an overall 49.1% similarity within this region, with two sections showing notable amino acid identity. The first of these is the serine lysine dyad (serine 587 and lysine 592) that we demonstrate is required for MYRF cleavage. The second is the perfectly conserved GVIAQ sequence corresponding to the region required for trimerization of the phage proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Schwarzer1">[21]</xref>. An implication of this is that MYRF, like the endosialidase proteins, may function as a homotrimer. This proposition is supported by a recent report that the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> ortholog MrfA binds DNA via three distinct elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Senoo1">[32]</xref> and the findings of a co-submitted manuscript by Li and colleagues investigating the human MYRF/C11Orf9 protein. In our <italic>de novo</italic> DNA consensus sequence analysis, we found that when the MEME output parameters were set to exclude short motifs, the most enriched motif returned was a repeat of the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTGGYAC</named-content> motif separated by 3 bp. Similarly, entering the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTGGYAC</named-content> motif as both the primary and secondary motif in SpaMo (Spaced Motif Analysis Tool, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Whitington1">[36]</xref>) found a significant paired incidence of the motif with 3 bp spacing within the 2,085 input sequences (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). This finding is consistent with MYRF binding DNA as a multimer, though the majority of ChIP-Seq-identified binding sites had a single <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CTGGYAC</named-content> motif, suggesting that a single copy is adequate for biologically relevant levels of binding. The exact stoichiometry of optimal binding sites and how this relates to MYRF's regulation of gene expression will be an important point to clarify in future work.</p>

<title>How Is MYRF Regulated During Oligodendrocyte Differentiation?</title>
<p>This study greatly clarifies the molecular mechanisms by which MYRF promotes myelination, demonstrating that it directly binds to and promotes the expression of genes underpinning the myelination process. A number of important questions remain for future studies. Firstly, what is the role of the C-terminal portion of MYRF? Is its role simply to ensure the correct folding, self-association, and cleavage of the protein, or does it have additional binding partners and regulatory roles that influence the function of MYRF in myelination? Secondly, the consensus sequence for Sox10 was overrepresented in regions targeted by MYRF, indicating these two factors likely interact in their regulation of target genes. Consistent with this, mutations for each gene result in a block in oligodendrocyte differentiation at the premyelinating stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Takada1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Emery1">[13]</xref>. Clarification of the functional relationship between these factors will be important to clarify. Finally, although the expression of MYRF is strongly induced during oligodendrocyte differentiation, the signals regulating this induction are essentially unknown. Recent reports indicate that its expression may be influenced by the coordinated activity of <italic>Olig2</italic> and <italic>Brg1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Yu1">[3]</xref> and by posttranscriptional regulation by miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001625-Letzen1">[37]</xref>. Elucidation of the upstream pathways and signals that induce MYRF will be important both for understanding the molecular control of the myelination program, but also potentially for identifying strategies to promote remyelination in demyelinating disease.</p>

<title>Luciferase Assays</title>
<p>Luciferase assays were performed using the Promega dual luciferase reporter assay kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. All cells were co-transfected with both the test pGL3 luciferase construct and a constitutive renilla construct, and luciferase readings normalized to the renilla levels. All luciferase results are shown as the mean and SEM of at least three independent experiments, with two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttests used to calculate statistical significance. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s010">Table S4</xref> provides a list of the genomic regions cloned into the pGL3 promoter as putative enhancers, as well as the oligodendrocyte-specific genes with which they are associated.</p>

<title>PCR Mutagenesis</title>
<p>Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Thermo Scientific Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Kit and primers as indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s011">Table S5</xref>. Forward and reverse primers were used in separate reactions with 50 ng template DNA. After an initial denaturation at 98°C for 45 s, reactions were run in 10 cycles of 15 s denaturation at 98°C and 6 min combined annealing and extension at 72°C. Following combination of 25 µl forward and reverse reactions and addition of 0.75 µl fresh Phusion DNA Polymerase, another initial denaturation and 18 cycles as described above were performed. Methylated template DNA was then digested by incubation with DpnI, products purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), and used to transform OneShot Top10 chemically competent bacteria (Invitrogen). Single colony clones were verified via DNA sequencing.</p>

<title>DNA Pulldown Assay</title>
<p>For DNA pulldown assays CG-4 cells were transfected with the MRF Myc-DNA-C constructs (Myc-tagged residues 328–1139 or respective mutants for that construct) for 24 h before being lysed in NP40 buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM PMSF). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000× <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4°C and adjusted to a total protein concentration of 1 µg/µl. To prepare oligonucleotide-conjugated beads, 30 µl Dynabeads MyOne Steptavidin T1 (Invitrogen) were washed three times in 500 µl buffer A (5 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) and then incubated in 100 µl buffer A containing 1 µg biotinylated, annealed oligonucleotides for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. The oligonucleotide-conjugated beads were washed twice with 500 µl buffer A, three times with 500 µl buffer C (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl) before being resuspended in 100 µl buffer C and added to 300 µl cell lysate and sheared salmon sperm (final concentration 0.2 µg/µl). Beads were incubated with cell lysates for 30 min at room temperature with rotation and then washed three times in 500 µl buffer C. Bound protein was eluted boiling the beads in 2× Laemmli buffer and subject to gel electophoresis and detection by Western blot with anti-Myc (clone A46; Merck Millipore). Forty µl of pre-bead cell lysate and 40 µl of nonbound protein from the beads served as 10% input and eluate controls, respectively.</p>

<title>Bacterial Expression of GST-Fusion Constructs</title>
<p>MYRF constructs encoding residues 393–540 or 393–766 were ligated into pGEX-6P-3 vector (GE Healthcare) in frame with GST and transformed into the BL21(DE3)pLysS-T1<sup>R</sup> stain (Sigma). Expression was induced by addition of 0.2 mM IPTG for 2 h at 28°C before bacteria were lysed and the fusion proteins column purified using glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The eluted GST-MYRF<sup>393–766</sup> protein was used to generate monoclonal antibodies (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute monoclonal facilities), also confirming the presence of the cleavage in bacterial expression systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001625.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Mice for immunohistochemistry were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused with PBS and 4% PFA. Tissue was harvested and postfixed for 2 h in 4% PFA before being sunk in 30% sucrose and processed for cryosections. Cells for immunostaining were fixed for 10 min in 4% PFA and washed in PBS. For immunostaining, cells on coverslips or cryosections were blocked for 1 h in 10% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated overnight in primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. Coverslips or cryosections were then washed three times in PBS and stained with appropriate fluorescent conjugated antibodies (Alexa Fluor; Life Technologies) for 1 h, washed three times in PBS, and coverslipped. Primary antibodies were anti-N-terminal MYRF (1∶10,000, Wegner lab internal polyclonal, raised against the N-terminus of MYRF), anti-C-terminal MYRF mAb (1∶500, Emery lab internal monoclonal raised against GST-MYRF<sup>393–766</sup> and mapped to the C-terminal fragment), anti-Myc tag (1∶500, Millipore 4A6), rabbit anti-Flag (1∶500, Cell signaling #2368), mouse anti-Flag (1∶500, Sigma F3165), mouse anti-gm130 (1∶100, BD Biosciences #610822), rabbit anti-calnexin (1∶500, Sigma C4731), CC1 monoclonal (1∶500, Calbiochem OP80), rabbit anti-Sox10 (1∶500, Millipore AB6727), and chick anti-GFP (1∶20,000 Abcam ab13970).</p>

<p><bold>Posttranslational cleavage of MYRF maps to shortly after the DBD in both mammalian and bacterial cells.</bold> (A) Western blot analysis of N-terminal Myc-tagged truncated MYRF constructs expressed in 293T cells. All constructs that include the proline-rich region, DBD, and up to or including the transmembrane region (Myc-MYRF, Myc-Proline-TM−, and Myc-Proline-TM+) give the same 75 kDa N-terminal cleavage product. The Myc-Proline-DBD construct (including resides 2–540 of MYRF) gives a product several kDa smaller. Similarly, the truncated Myc-DBD-C construct (residues 328–1139) product runs several kDa larger than the Myc-DBD construct (residues 328–540). Anti-Actin and anti-GFP are used to confirm protein loading and transfection levels, respectively. (B) Expression of GST-fusion constructs including residues 393–540 of MYRF (the DBD; predicted size 52.5 kDa) or residues 393–766 (the DBD and up to the transmembrane domain; predicted size 76.3 kDa). As in mammalian cells, the bacterially expressed MYRF fusion construct is subject to cleavage shortly after the DBD. Both constructs are expressed in the BL21 (DE3) pLysS-T1<sup>R</sup> <italic>E. coli</italic> strain at 28°C, purified 2 h after IPTG induction, and visualized with coomassie blue on a denaturing gel.</p>
