        <p>During cell division the genetic material on chromosomes is distributed to daughter cells by a dynamic microtubule structure called the mitotic spindle.

We find that Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 (RCC1), the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Ran, can induce bipolar spindle formation. Remarkably, RCC1 beads oscillate within spindles from pole to pole, a behavior that could be converted to a more typical, stable association by the addition of a kinesin together with RCC1. These results identify two activities sufficient to mimic chromatin-mediated spindle assembly, and establish a foundation for future experiments to reconstitute spindle assembly entirely from purified components.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The mitotic spindle is a bipolar structure that is responsible for separating the two sets of duplicated chromosomes in a dividing cell, thereby delivering one set to each of the two daughter cells. It is built from dynamic filaments called microtubules, as well as hundreds of other components that contribute to the organization and dynamics of the microtubules and to chromosome movement. To understand which proteins are essential for spindle formation and function, we would like to be able to build it from purified components. As a step towards this goal, we coupled individual proteins to inert glass beads (as a substitute for chromosomes), to determine what combination of proteins can induce spindle assembly in a complex cytoplasm derived from frog eggs. We found that a single enzyme called RCC1 is sufficient to activate a pathway that stabilizes and organizes microtubules into a bipolar structure around the bead, but that this bead then oscillated back and forth between the poles of the spindle. By coupling a microtubule-based motor protein together with RCC1 on the bead, we were able to balance the bead in the center of the spindle. Thus, two proteins immobilized on a bead can substitute for a chromosome and induce stable spindle formation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The spindle is a highly dynamic structure composed of microtubule polymers and hundreds of other factors including motor proteins and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Walczak1">[1]</xref>. Its purpose is to attach to chromosomes and accurately segregate them to daughter cells. Once thought to be passive participants, chromosomes are now known to play an active role in spindle assembly, since immobilized mitotic chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Dinarina1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Heald1">[4]</xref>, or chromosome fragments containing microtubule attachment sites (kinetochores) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-OConnell1">[5]</xref>, have been shown to direct the formation of spindle structures. However, the minimal chromosome components sufficient to generate a spindle have not been defined.</p>
      <p>One candidate enzyme associated with chromatin that could drive spindle assembly is RCC1, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Ran. RCC1 generates a steep gradient of RanGTP near chromosomes, activating a subset of mitotic motors and MAPs that are cargoes of the importin β family of nuclear transport receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Kalab1">[6]</xref>. Addition of a hydrolysis-deficient mutant of Ran bound to GTP (RanQ69L-GTP) stabilizes microtubules that are organized by motor proteins into asters and small spindle-like structures in metaphase-arrested cytoplasmic extracts prepared from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> eggs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-CarazoSalas1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Wilde1">[10]</xref>. RanQ69L-GTP disrupts the RCC1-generated RanGTP gradient and spindle assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Kalab3">[11]</xref>, while flattening the gradient eliminates spindle assembly around chromatin beads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Maresca1">[12]</xref>. These experiments demonstrate that a RanGTP gradient is required for chromatin-dependent spindle assembly in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, but is it sufficient? We set out to test whether immobilized RCC1 in the absence of other chromatin factors can reconstitute a mitotic spindle.</p>

      <title>Results and Discussion</title>
      <p>To test whether a single protein factor, RCC1, is sufficient to direct spindle formation in egg extracts, we developed a novel substrate consisting of single 10 µm diameter porous NeutrAvidin beads. This approach alleviates the need for small beads to cluster or align by generating a high surface area to which biotinylated molecules can be tightly bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). RCC1 (α isoform) engineered to contain a single amino-terminal biotin was coupled to the beads, which were then incubated in metaphase-arrested egg extracts containing rhodamine-labeled tubulin and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Whereas uncoupled or bovine serum albumin (BSA)-coupled NeutrAvidin beads had no activity (unpublished data), microtubule arrays formed around RCC1 beads that could be sorted into five major categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Robust bipolar structures made up greater than 30% of the arrays, with a distribution of categories similar to single chromatin-coated beads under the same reaction conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, however, RCC1 bead spindle morphology differed from that of individual chromatin beads, which induced larger spindles that contained more microtubules as determined by microtubule fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g001">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Furthermore, whereas chromatin bead spindle microtubules were most dense in the center, RCC1 bead spindle microtubules had a higher density at the poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, immobilization of a single chromatin component, RCC1, is sufficient to induce bipolar spindle formation in <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts, but spindle morphology is different, suggesting that the pathway is not completely active, or that other chromatin proteins contribute to microtubule stabilization and organization.</p>

      <p>To determine whether RCC1 beads fully recapitulate RanGTP-driven mitotic cargo activation, we added the FRET probe Rango-2, which measures the level of cargo release from importin β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Kalab3">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Kalab4">[13]</xref>. Rango gradients surrounding RCC1 beads appeared similar to those formed around chromatin beads, and both were further enhanced by addition of wild-type Ran, indicating that the RCC1 beads have similar activity compared to chromatin and that cargo gradients are limited by the amount of Ran that can be loaded with GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, varying the amount of RCC1 per bead 4-fold had little effect on the distribution of microtubule structures (unpublished data), whereas addition of wild-type Ran up to three times its estimated endogenous concentration of ∼3 µM resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in monopolar and bad bipolar structures, while the percentage of multipolar structures indicative of enhanced microtubule polymerization increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001225.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Further evidence of equivalent Ran pathway activity by RCC1 beads compared to chromatin was the similar localization of the cargo TPX2 to spindle microtubules, and sensitivity to spindle disruption by a truncation mutant of importin β (amino acids 71–876) that still binds cargo but does not bind RanGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001225.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Kalab5">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Nachury1">[15]</xref>. Despite their morphological differences, chromatin and RCC1 bead spindle dynamics and organization were similar. Both spindle types displayed poleward microtubule flux at similar rates, indicating kinesin-5 activity (unpublished data) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Wilde2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Yang1">[17]</xref>, and spindle morphology was similarly disrupted upon inhibition of the microtubule cross-linking spindle pole protein NuMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001225.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Merdes1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, RCC1 beads appear to fully activate the RanGTP cargo release pathway and generate spindles that possess structural and dynamic features of spindles formed around sperm chromosomes or chromatin-coated beads.</p>

      <p>One distinctive behavior observed by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy was the tendency of single RCC1 beads to oscillate within the spindle from pole to pole, whereas chromatin beads were stationary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001225.s003">Video S1</xref>). We observed a range in bead oscillatory activity, which sometimes dampened over time. Interestingly, when a monopolar microtubule array formed, the RCC1 bead moved unidirectionally, appearing to be pushed along by a trail of polymerizing microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g003">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001225.s004">Video S2</xref>). This motility was reminiscent of actin polymerization-driven propulsion of the bacterium <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> or beads coated with its actin nucleation promoting protein ActA, which does not require motor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Cameron1">[19]</xref>. We therefore propose that the oscillatory movement of an RCC1 bead occurs because the bead does not connect to spindle microtubules and is pushed from pole to pole by polymerizing microtubule plus ends. Analogous to a bead uniformly coated with ActA that induces polarized actin assembly, a symmetry-breaking event might initiate RCC1 bead motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-vanOudenaarden1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Cameron2">[21]</xref>. Because of the antiparallel orientation of microtubules in bipolar structures, the RCC1 bead is driven towards the opposite spindle pole where it encounters a higher density of polarized microtubules polymerizing in the opposite direction. Such a polar ejection force of spindle microtubules has been well documented, although oscillatory chromosome movement also requires kinetochore fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Rieder1">[22]</xref>. We cannot rule out that bead movement is regulated by egg extract factors, but biochemical association of specific extract proteins was not observed (unpublished data). We therefore reasoned that additional chromatin factors normally act to stabilize interaction with spindle microtubules.</p>

      <p>Plus end-directed chromatin-associated kinesins (chromokinesins) contribute to multiple aspects of mitosis, regulating spindle microtubule dynamics and organization, as well as chromosome compaction and segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Vanneste1">[23]</xref>, and represent excellent candidate factors for mediating chromatin-spindle interactions. Furthermore, kinesin-coated beads can move directionally along microtubules in a reconstituted system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Uppalapati1">[24]</xref>. To determine whether plus end-directed microtubule-based motor activity in the absence of other chromokinesin functions was sufficient to stabilize RCC1 bead spindles, we first coupled conventional kinesin-1 motor domain (amino acids 1–560) together with RCC1 to the beads at a 1∶1 ratio of proteins. Although bipolar spindles initially formed around the hybrid beads, the poles eventually collapsed together and pushed the bead out of the spindle, generating a “push pole” morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001225.s004">Video S3</xref>). These observations suggest that, like around chromatin and RCC1 beads, microtubules are nucleated in random orientations and quickly attain an antiparallel organization due to the activity of kinesin-5 and other motors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Heald1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Walczak2">[25]</xref>. Once microtubule plus ends become oriented toward the bead, however, the strong processive motor activity of kinesin-1 appeared to dominate microtubule organization, clustering plus ends at the surface of the bead. Interestingly, the glass bead often cracked once the poles were pushed together and outward, indicating that the kinesin motor can generate significant force against the bead (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001225.s004">Video S3</xref>, right panel).</p>

      <p>In contrast to kinesin-1, chromosomal kinesins -4 and -10 have slower motility and are weakly processive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Bieling1">[26]</xref>. We therefore mutated the motor domain of kinesin-1, changing residue 203 from arginine to lysine (R203K) to reduce its ATPase activity and motility, but preserve microtubule binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Klumpp1">[27]</xref>. Remarkably, beads coated with a 1∶1 ratio of RCC1 and kinesin-1(R203K) induced bipolar spindle assembly but were stationary like chromatin beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001225.s005">Video S4</xref>). Whereas no obvious effect on spindle morphology was observed, the percentage of bipolar spindles formed after 1 h increased by approximately 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These results show that by mediating bead-microtubule interactions and centering within the spindle, a non-motile kinesin strongly enhances the stability of bipolar microtubule arrays induced by RCC1 beads.</p>
      <p>To investigate whether other microtubule binding activities were sufficient to stabilize RCC1 bead spindles, we substituted the microtubule plus end binding protein EB1 for kinesin-1(R203K). EB1 associates with growing microtubules and functions to recruit a large set of proteins that regulate microtubule dynamics and interactions with cellular structures including kinetochores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Akhmanova1">[28]</xref>. Unlike kinesin-1(R203K), the presence of EB1 on RCC1 beads did not decrease the percentage of beads oscillating or their movement amplitudes, which appeared indistinguishable compared to RCC1 beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g004">Figures 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g003">3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001225.s006">Video S5</xref>). Nevertheless, the percentage of bipolar spindles formed at 1 h increased, similar to the RCC1/kinesin-1(R203K) hybrid beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001225-g004">Figure 4C,E</xref>). EB1 may be mediating bead-spindle microtubule interactions that promote spindle bipolarity, but through a distinct microtubule binding mechanism. Alternatively, EB1 on beads may be acting directly or indirectly to stabilize spindle microtubules, thereby facilitating the activity of kinesin-5 and other motors to sort them into bipolar arrays. These results indicate that bead oscillations per se do not impair spindle bipolarity, and differential effects on the spindle likely reflect the distinct properties of EB1 and kinesin. We hypothesize that molecular motor domains provide the microtubule interaction best suited to stabilize RCC1 bead or chromosome arm position within a spindle. Evaluation of additional microtubule binding proteins or domains, and careful analysis of bead spindle phenotypes and dynamics will be necessary to elucidate underlying mechanisms.</p>
      <p>In summary, stable bipolar spindle assembly can be induced in the absence of chromosomes, chromatin, or kinetochores by coupling two proteins, RCC1 and kinesin-1 (R203K), to beads. These results demonstrate that the anisotropy of RanGTP distribution in the cytoplasm is sufficient to drive mitotic spindle assembly. However, chromatin spindles are still larger and more robust, indicating that other chromatin-associated factors must also contribute to normal spindle morphology. One possible activity is the Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates and inactivates microtubule-destabilizing proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Lan1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Sampath1">[30]</xref> and makes important contributions to kinetochore-driven spindle assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Maresca1">[12]</xref>. Enrichment of mitotic kinases on beads in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts has previously been achieved by adding beads coupled with IgGs specific for Aurora A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Tsai1">[31]</xref>, or for the chromosome passenger complex protein INCENP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Maresca1">[12]</xref>, which binds Aurora B. While neither kinase was found to be sufficient for spindle assembly, they clearly play supporting roles. Crucial also may be bona fide chromokinesins such as Xklp1, which has been shown to recruit the bundling MAP PRC1 to generate the antiparallel microtubule arrays of the central spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001225-Bieling2">[32]</xref>. Our system establishes a foundation to test the roles of other chromatin and spindle factors and forms the basis for spindle reconstitution entirely from defined components.</p>
