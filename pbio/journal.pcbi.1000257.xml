                <p>Maintaining balanced growth in a changing environment is a fundamental
                    systems-level challenge for cellular physiology, particularly in microorganisms.
                    While the complete set of regulatory and functional pathways supporting growth
                    and cellular proliferation are not yet known, portions of them are well
                    understood. In particular, cellular proliferation is governed by mechanisms that
                    are highly conserved from unicellular to multicellular organisms, and the
                    disruption of these processes in metazoans is a major factor in the development
                    of cancer. In this paper, we develop statistical methodology to identify
                    quantitative aspects of the regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular
                    proliferation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We find that the
                    expression levels of a small set of genes can be exploited to predict the
                    instantaneous growth rate of any cellular culture with high accuracy. The
                    predictions obtained in this fashion are robust to changing biological
                    conditions, experimental methods, and technological platforms. The proposed
                    model is also effective in predicting growth rates for the related yeast
                        <italic>Saccharomyces bayanus</italic> and the highly diverged yeast
                        <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, suggesting that the underlying
                    regulatory signature is conserved across a wide range of unicellular evolution.
                    We investigate the biological significance of the gene expression signature that
                    the predictions are based upon from multiple perspectives: by perturbing the
                    regulatory network through the Ras/PKA pathway, observing strong upregulation of
                    growth rate even in the absence of appropriate nutrients, and discovering
                    putative transcription factor binding sites, observing enrichment in
                    growth-correlated genes. More broadly, the proposed methodology enables
                    biological insights about growth at an instantaneous time scale, inaccessible by
                    direct experimental methods. Data and tools enabling others to apply our methods

                <p>A major challenge for living organisms is the regulation of cellular growth in a
                    fluctuating environment. Sudden changes in nutrient availability or the presence
                    of stress factors typically require rapid adjustments of cellular growth. The
                    misregulation of growth control in higher organisms is a major factor in the
                    development of cancer. A statistical characterization of cellular growth based
                    on gene expression levels provides a quantitative perspective to understand the
                    regulatory network that controls growth. We develop a model of cellular growth
                    in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, grounded in the
                    expression levels of a small set of genes. The model is able to predict the
                    growth rate of new cellular cultures from expression data and is robust to
                    changing biological conditions, experimental methods, and technological
                    platforms. The predictions are informative about changes in growth at very short
                    time scales, which direct experimental methods cannot generally access. The
                    model also predicts growth rates in <italic>Saccharomyces bayanus</italic> and
                    in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, a yeast diverged by approximately
                    a billion years of evolution. Our findings suggest that the model describes
                    fundamental characteristics of the unicellular eukaryotic growth regulatory
                    program. A case study explores the role of nutrient sensing in the yeast growth
                    regulatory system.</p>

            <p>Proper regulation of growth rate is a key systems-level challenge for all cells,
                particularly microorganisms facing a fast-changing and often hostile environment.
                Cell growth, defined as an increase in cellular biomass due to biosynthetic
                processes, is one of the primary functions that must be coordinated with the
                environment in order for cells to maintain viability and reproduce. The
                determination of how cells integrate information from the external environment with
                information from their internal state to mount an appropriate
                response—growing in the presence of nutrients, arresting growth when
                stressed, and resuming afterwards— is of central importance to our
                understanding of basic biology. From a genomic perspective, growth also raises the
                issue of disentangling correlated systems-level behaviors. When the expression
                levels of thousands of genes change due to a growth-related stimulus, which
                underlying regulatory parameters are responsible?</p>
            <p>In this paper, we identify quantitative aspects of the transcriptional regulatory
                mechanisms underlying cellular growth in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>,
                and we develop a model to predict instantaneous growth rates of cellular cultures
                based on gene expression data. The model enables the estimation of growth rates
                under any conditions for which expression data is available, even on a very short
                time scale, where standard experimental techniques cannot measure cellular growth
                directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Amberg1">[1]</xref>. For example, a culture undergoing continuous growth
                in a chemostat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Hayes1">[2]</xref> can be perturbed from steady state by means of a brief
                heat pulse, but the departure from and the return to steady state growth is too
                brief to capture with optical density measurements. Our model allows such a decrease
                (and subsequent resumption) of growth rate to be quantified under a variety of
                conditions: batch or chemostat cultures, different microarray platforms, and under
                any environmental stimulus for which gene expression can be assayed. Surprisingly,
                this model also successfully predicts growth rates from <italic>Saccharomyces
                    bayanus</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> expression data,
                the latter of which is evolutionarily diverged from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>

            <p>Our findings suggest that the proposed statistical model of cellular growth provides
                a broadly applicable biological characterization of the transcriptional regulatory
                network underlying growth rate control. We have previously observed that the
                expression of ∼25% of the yeast genome responds to changes in
                growth rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Brauer1">[4]</xref>. The response is functionally cohesive, with genes
                up-regulated with increasing growth enriched for translational and ribosomal
                functions, and with down-regulated genes enriched for oxidative metabolism and the
                peroxisome. This functional portrait provides a rich environment in which to study
                transcriptional regulation of growth; for example, production of new proteins at the
                ribosome is vital to cellular proliferation, and yeast devotes some
                ∼60% of its transcriptional throughput to ribosomal RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Warner1">[5]</xref>.
                Similarly, growth rate regulation is highly interconnected with a variety of other
                cellular processes (e.g. the environmental stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Gasch1">[6]</xref>, metabolic cycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Klevecz1">[7]</xref>, and
                the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Pramila1">[8]</xref>), and we discuss potential causative regulatory
                signals from the Ras/PKA pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Wang1">[9]</xref> and growth-related transcription factors.</p>
            <p>Our recent analysis of gene expression measurements from a collection of <italic>S.
                    cerevisiae</italic> chemostat cultures across several nutrient limitations and
                growth regimes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Brauer1">[4]</xref> offered intriguing evidence for a notion of
                instantaneous growth rate. In this paper, we develop a model to characterize such a
                notion quantitatively, in a statistically principled fashion. We further assess the
                robustness of the proposed characterization by presenting new computational evidence
                on six additional published data sets and on four newly collected data sets. More in
                detail, we demonstrate that the model can accurately predict relative growth rates
                under a variety of conditions and is robust to the conditions of the originating
                culture, the technological platform used to assay gene expression, and evolutionary
                conservation to other organisms (<italic>S. bayanus</italic> and <italic>S.
                pombe</italic>). The model allows us to predict growth rates for published
                genome-wide collections of expression data (e.g. the stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Gasch1">[6]</xref> or gene
                deletions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Hughes1">[10]</xref>) and for four new data collections we have generated
                for this work (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000257.s005">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000257.s006">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000257.s007">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000257.s008">S4</xref>), providing biological insight into the growth
                rate response at very short time scales—minutes, rather than the hours
                necessary to experimentally assay doubling times. This biological validation of the
                predictions is accompanied by an out-of-sample validation and outlier analysis to
                assess the statistical accuracy of the model. We have made an implementation of this
                model available to the public at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://function.princeton.edu/growthrate" xlink:type="simple">http://function.princeton.edu/growthrate</ext-link>.</p>
            <p>Additional analyses offer biological insights that support and further substantiate
                the empirically observed robustness of the predictions based on the newly
                characterized growth-rate genes. Our insights rely, in part, on the quantitative
                identification of binding motifs of known (and uncharacterized) transcription
                factors associated with the genes responding to growth. Moreover, our model enables
                a quantitative characterization of growth profiles underlying puzzling experimental
                evidence that provides a first convincing explanation of observed cell death in
                response to a perturbation in the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway. More in detail, we apply our
                model to study two important aspects of cell growth regulation: nutrient sensing and
                the cell cycle. Artificial activation of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway has been
                previously observed to recapitulate approximately 85% of the expression
                response associated with increased growth in the presence of glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Zaman1">[11]</xref>; here,
                we show that the cell's regulatory state during this activation is
                indicative of an up-regulated growth response, even in the absence of appropriate
                nutrient availability. This conflict between internal regulatory state and the
                external environment leads to rapid cell death. In contrast, analysis of growth rate
                regulation during metabolic cycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Tu1">[12]</xref> and synchronous cell cycles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Pramila1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Spellman1">[13]</xref> indicates that growth
                rate regulation is not specific to cell cycle phases, but it is strongly limited to
                the oxidative phase of the metabolic cycle. These observations, coupled with an
                analysis of putative transcription factors mediating the growth response, establish
                a substantial foundation on which to base further experimental work on the
                systems-level control of cellular growth rate.</p>

                <title>Background: Measuring Growth</title>
                <p>Cellular growth is typically quantified in one of two experimental environments:
                    batch culture or the chemostat. In a batch culture, cells are provided with a
                    saturating amount of nutrient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Amberg1">[1]</xref>. Growth is quantified by measuring the optical
                    density (OD) of the culture over time, X. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000257-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates three typical phases of
                    an OD growth curve: a slow initial phase (lag), a fast exponential growth phase
                    (exp), and a slow saturation phase (stationary). Solving the appropriate
                    differential equation leads to an exponential model of cellular growth,
                    X = e <sup>μ·t</sup>. In
                    practice, the OD of a culture is sampled at discrete points over time, and the
                    growth rate parameter μ (in units of inverse hours
                    h<sup>−1</sup>) is estimated from an exponential fit to the OD
                    measurements.</p>

                    principle behind the chemostat. A limited concentration (S<sub>0</sub> in the
                    tank) of the controlling growth factor is provided in media flowing continuously
                    into a growth tube of limited capacity. Changes in density of the culture, X,

                    driven by Michaelis-Menten dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Monod1">[15]</xref>. In this regime, the
                    growth rate is a function of the concentration of the controlling nutrient,

                    dX/dt = [μ(S)−D]

                    controlling growth factor also stabilizes,
                    dS/dt = 0. The growth rate then equals the flow

                    with time. In a chemostat, the growth rate is controlled by setting the nutrient

                <title>Linear Models and Identification of Growth-Specific Signature</title>
                <p>We sought to identify a small set of genes providing a quantitative summary of
                    cellular growth rate regulation. Genome-wide expression measurements underlying
                    the 36 chemostat cultures provided us with the opportunity to determine which
                    genes were responding linearly to changes in growth rate, and not to differences
                    in nutrient limitation. To identify such gens in a statistically principled
                    fashion, we performed four steps, beginning by using maximum likelihood to fit a
                    linear model of each gene <italic>g</italic>'s expression under all
                    training conditions (<bold>Y</bold><italic>
                        <sub>g</sub>

                <p>This step yields two learned parameters per gene, a baseline expression level
                            <italic>α<sub>g</sub></italic> and a growth rate response
                            <italic>β<sub>g</sub></italic>. The model is fit to minimize the
                    residual error <bold>ε</bold><italic>
                        <sub>g</sub>
                    </italic>, which can capture either non-growth-related biological variability or
                    technical noise. We fit this model for the yeast genome using the expression
                    levels from our 36 chemostat conditions, recording each gene's
                            <italic>α<sub>g</sub></italic> and
                    <italic>β<sub>g</sub></italic> parameters and its goodness of fit (total

                    </italic>.</p>
                <p>We next used the bootstrap (i.e. a randomized re-sampling technique) to assess
                    the expected background distributions of these parameters in the absence of a
                    growth-related biological signal (i.e. the null distributions). We constructed
                    100,000 randomized expression vectors of length 36 by sampling each component
                    (with replacement) from the collection of gene expression values in the
                    corresponding condition, i.e., the same combination of growth rate and nutrient
                    limitation. For example, the first value randomly chosen for such a vector could
                    be drawn from any gene or nutrient limitation in our chemostat data at a flow
                    rate of 0.05 h<sup>−1</sup>, the second from any flow rate of 0.1
                        h<sup>−1</sup>, and so forth. Note that by re-sampling the
                    expression values of putative genes column-by-column, we do not wash away the
                    average transcriptional response that is expected to be associated with
                    nutrient-growth rate pairs. In this sense, the null distribution we derive
                    carries information about how genes respond to growth across nutrient
                    limitations, on average. As a consequence, the statistical significance of the
                    differential response we compute is biologically justified. In other words, this
                    sampling scheme maintains average nutrient specific and growth rate specific
                    information, and leads to an estimate of the null distribution in the absence of
                    gene-specific growth related and nutrient related gene expression. This process
                    yields null distributions for parameters <italic>α<sub>g</sub></italic>,
                            <italic>β<sub>g</sub></italic>, and the goodness of fit R<sup>2</sup><italic>

                    </italic>.</p>
                <p>Third, from these null distributions, we assign false discovery rate corrected
                    p-values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Benjamini1">[17]</xref> to each gene's

                    response to changes in growth rate if it fit this model well (R<sup>2</sup><italic>

                <title>Model-Based Prediction of Instantaneous Growth Rates from Expression Data</title>
                <p>The set of growth-specific genes identified with the four-step procedure above
                    represents a quantitative signature of a cellular culture's
                    transcriptional regulation of growth rate, i.e. the speed at which cells are
                    proliferating. By examining these genes' expression levels in a new
                    collection, we can predict the instantaneous growth rate of the cellular culture
                    the expression measurements correspond to. This notion of instantaneous growth
                    rate is comparable to the derivative of an optical density growth curve, but it
                    can be inferred robustly by our model on any time scale, e.g. minutes, from
                    expression data, without the need to measure one or more full doubling times of
                    a culture.</p>
                <p>Given expression data for a new experimental condition, we use an iterative
                    maximum likelihood approach to infer its growth rate using the parameters
                    captured by our linear model. Formally, consider a vector of expression
                    measurements for <italic>n</italic> growth-specifc genes,
                            <bold>Z</bold><sub>1:<italic>n</italic></sub>. As described above, the
                    expression of these growth-specific genes varies primarily in response to
                    changes in a condition's growth rate, which we model as the mean
                        <italic>μ</italic> of a Gaussian with variance
                        <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>. Using our previously calculated

                        <bold>β</bold><sub>1:<italic>n</italic></sub>, the expected value of

                <p>Here, <italic>δ</italic> is a condition-specific parameter that captures
                    the condition's baseline gene expression, i.e. an average offset
                    between a new experimental condition and our training expression data. In
                    dual-channel data, this parameter may capture differences between a new
                    condition's reference channel and our training data's
                    reference channel; for a single-channel array, <italic>δ</italic> may
                    capture the absolute difference between the platform baseline and our training
                    data. In any event, the expected variability of a new measurement is:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000257.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p>

                <p>Note that the estimate of <italic>δ</italic><sub>ML</sub> depends on the

                    to convergence. In practice, individual growth-specific genes with residuals

                    outliers and do not participate in that condition's growth rate
                    inference procedure. This allows outlier genes responding to non-growth related
                    stimuli (which are, in general, infrequent, e.g. six in one of our most variable
                    conditions as discussed below) to be noted for further investigation, while also
                    decreasing the cross-validated error of predicted growth rates.</p>

            <p>We apply our linear model of growth rate regulation to predict instantaneous growth
                rates for a variety of expression data. This includes new chemostat cultures used to
                assess prediction quality, publicly available stress response and gene deletion

                            sets to infer relative and absolute growth rates. (A) A brief
                            (&lt;30 s) heat pulse was administered to a steady state chemostat
                            culture immediately before time zero, and gene expression was assayed
                            with an expression time course (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000257.s002">Figure
                            S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000257.s005">Table S1</xref>). The relative growth rates
                            inferred from this data show an abrupt departure from steady state
                            growth, followed by a return to steady state (including a brief
                            regulatory overshoot). Our predictions monitor these changes in growth
                            rate at an instantaneous time scale (&lt;5 m) inaccessible by
                            standard experimental assays for growth rate. (B) Predicted growth rates
                            for a portion of the environmental stress response data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Gasch1">[6]</xref>, assaying the response to a
                            30–37°C heat shock. Our model captures the cessation
                            and resumption of growth induced by the stress, even for a batch culture
                            in which the growth rate is not fixed a priori. (C) A collection of 24
                            chemostats were run at four growth rates (0.05 hr<sup>−1</sup>
                            through 0.2 hr<sup>−1</sup>) and limited on six different
                            nitrogen sources. Using only expression data from each condition, our
                            model predicts accurate relative growth rates. However, when provided
                            with the known growth rate for a single condition, the model is

                            sharing that condition's mRNA reference channel. Note that the
                            actual growth rate is measured empirically and thus deviates slightly
                            from an ideal straight line due to technical variation in the growth

                    for complete results). These data represent yeast batch cultures assayed using a
                    variety of different reference mRNA samples on a custom spotted microarray
                    platform, none of which differences from our training data impair the growth
                    rate estimation process. While there are no direct measurements of growth rate
                    in these non-steady-state conditions, our predictions are consistent with known
                    yeast biology and agree with expected growth behavior. Most shock time courses,
                    including all heat shocks, peroxide, diamide, and hyper-osmotic stress, provoke
                    an initial sharp decrease in growth rate followed by a return to initial or
                    near-initial rate; shorter shocks, such as DTT, menadione, and peroxide
                    responses, capture only the rate decrease. Batch growth proceeds at a fairly
                    constant rate until nutrients become depleted, at which point the rate decreases
                    sharply; this pattern is also seen in intentional nitrogen depletion. Growth
                    rates across varying temperatures peak as expected at 25 C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Amberg1">[1]</xref>, falling off at
                    lower and higher temperatures. Finally, response to varying carbon sources is
                    also as expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Granot1">[22]</xref>, with ethanol inducing the slowest growth and
                    fructose, sucrose, and glucose allowing the most rapid. Our model's
                    inference of growth rate from gene expression data alone allows both post hoc
                    growth analysis (e.g. years after the original experiment) and an estimation of
                    growth rates for cultures where direct growth measurements would be unfeasible,
                    difficult, or time consuming.</p>
                <p>When applied to expression data from yeast mutant strains, in which one or more
                    genes have been deleted, predicted growth rates can be used to quantify single
                    mutant fitness. We used our model to analyze the knockout collection assayed in
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Hughes1">[10]</xref>; predictions on the complete data set are
                    available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000257.s010">Table S6</xref>. Direct fitness measurements for 199 of the ∼300
                    mutants assayed via microarrays is available as supporting information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Hughes1">[10]</xref>.
                    Our predictions for these 199 growth rates correlate very strongly with the
                    direct fitness measurements (ρ = 0.473,
                        p&lt;10<sup>−11</sup>) and are derived solely from expression
                    data. In contrast, methods for experimentally estimating single mutant fitness
                    from high-throughput growth curves showed substantially less agreement
                    (ρ = 0.321,

                    with the original publication's direct fitness measurements. These

                <title>Absolute Growth Rate Prediction with One Shared Reference</title>
                <p>With a small amount of additional information (i.e., a scalar) the relative
                    growth rates inferred by our model can be made absolute, in units of chemostat
                    flow rate (hr<sup>−1</sup>). Our model's predicted rates for
                    a collection of arrays are relative estimates, to one another. This is due to
                    the unknown quantitative effects of the reference mRNA in our dual-channel
                    training data; it is impossible to know a priori the relationship between this
                    reference channel and the relative (for dual-channel) or absolute (for
                    single-channel) expression levels in new microarray data. However, if the
                    absolute growth rate is known for some array in a given collection, our model
                    can make absolute rate predictions for other two-color arrays in the collection,
                    given that they all share the same reference channel.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000257-g004">Figure 4C</xref> shows actual growth
                    rates (dotted, black lines) for a collection of chemostats at various flow rates
                    limited on one of several different nitrogen sources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000257.s006">Table S2</xref>)
                    along with estimates of the relative instantaneous growth rates (red, dashed
                    lines) and of the absolute instantaneous growth rates (solid, blue lines).
                    Absolute growth rates are estimated by recording the growth rate in the Proline
                    limited chemostat at μ = 0.35
                        hr<sup>−1</sup>, and shifting all the estimates accordingly, since
                    the dual-channel microarrays in this study all share the same transcriptional
                    readout in the reference channel. We sought to evaluate the goodness of the
                    predictions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000257-g004">Figure 4C</xref> by
                    computing the statistical significance of their correlation with the actual
                    growth rates. To this end, we computed the correlation between the true growth
                    rates and the predicted instantaneous growth rates. The correlation is the same
                    for both absolute and relative predicted rates, as they differ by a constant,
                    and equals ρ = 0.956
                    (p-value≈0). This computation provides statistical support to the
                    goodness of the predictions produced with the proposed model. More in general,
                    on normalized dual-channel microarrays, the doubling of any gene's mRNA
                    level in these conditions results in the same increase in its expression
                    readout. Thus one unit of predicted relative rates to corresponds to one unit of
                    absolute chemostat flow rate. However, since the reference channel differs from
                    that of the arrays used to train the model, all rate predictions are typically
                    off by a corresponding constant factor. By normalizing to any one of the
                        <italic>N</italic> arrays' known growth rates, this shift can be
                    automatically corrected for the <italic>N-1</italic> other arrays, employing the
                    same reference channel.</p>

                <p>We assessed the quality of our growth rate predictions using 1,000 out-of-sample
                    experiments, according to a hybrid bootstrap/cross-validation setup, using the
                    data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Brauer1">[4]</xref>. Results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000257-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. In each experiment, we randomly
                    withheld 12 of the 36 conditions for testing, fit our linear model on the
                    remaining 24, derived bootstrapped null distributions using only these data, and
                    determined growth-specific gene sets to use for growth rate inference on the
                    held-out conditions. This experimental setup leads to absolute growth rate
                    predictions directly, as all the dual-channel microarrays share the same
                    transcriptional readout in the reference channel. This out-of-sample validation
                    allowed us to assess the accuracy and variability of our predictions on
                    conditions with known growth rates not included in the model building procedure.
                    In addition to the performance indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000257-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, the out-of-sample experiments
                    demonstrated robustness of p-value cutoffs and number of growth-specific genes;
                    these ranged in number from ∼50 to ∼110 across the randomized
                    validations (of a total ∼5,500 possible genes), and changes of this
                    magnitude in the final calibration gene set had little impact on predicted
                    growth rates. We further quantified a notion of reliability for each of the 72
                    growth-specific genes. Specifically, we computed the percentage,

                    selected as a member of the growth-specific gene set. The percentages provide an

                            times. We refit our linear model in each random sample, calculated
                            bootstrapped null distributions for all gene parameters, and found sets
                            of the most significant growth-specific genes. These were then used to
                            infer growth rates for the 12 held-out conditions, providing an estimate

                            When predicting the growth rate of a new collection of expression data,
                            our model excludes any calibration gene with an expression level outside
                            the inner fence (1.5 times the inter-quartile range below or above the
                            first or third quartiles). This improves predicted growth rate accuracy
                            while also calling out genes potentially responding to specific
                            non-growth stimuli under some biological condition. For example, in the

                                selected in the set of growth-specific genes. Results suggest that

                <p>In the process of estimating growth rates and determining this confidence score,
                    growth-specific genes with outlying expression values are also detected. While
                    most conditions induce few outlying growth-specific genes, when they occur, they
                    are <italic>not</italic> indicative of the quality of growth rate predictions.
                    We have found that neither the number of outliers nor their variability
                    correlates with prediction error (data not shown), but they call out genes that
                    may be responding to non-growth stimuli under specific biological conditions.
                    Excluding outliers from the growth rate estimation process improves the accuracy
                    of the predictions, and these outliers can in turn be biologically informative:
                    an outlying growth-specific gene is likely responding specifically to a stimulus

                            Exposure to HU decreases growth over time, and this effect is

                    particularly in unicellular organisms. While this model would become less
                    meaningful in metazoans, where the growth of individual cells is subjugated to
                    the growth and differentiation of the organism as a whole, certain

                    organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Rudra1">[31]</xref>. This is particularly true of the ribosome, one
                    of the main contributors to our model's predictive power; rRNA
                    regulation is purely transcriptional, and ribosomal proteins must be expressed
                    stoichiometrically. Since any cellular growth requires translation, observation
                    of ribosomal transcription is a strong indicator of unicellular growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Warner1">[5]</xref>.

                    data published by Tu et al. was obtained for cells grown at high density in a
                    glucose-limited chemostat. Under this regime, cells within the culture become
                    metabolically synchronized and undergo periodic consumption of oxygen (defined
                    as the oxidative phase of the metabolic cycle) followed by periods of
                    undetectable oxygen consumption (termed the reductive building and reductive
                    charging phases). The cell cycle data sets by Spellman et al and Pramila et al
                    were obtained from experiments in which cells were uniformly arrested in the
                    cell division cycle using a variety of methods and then released to undergo

                    concert with the metabolic cycle as defined by Tu et al. Specifically, the
                    culture's growth rate is predicted to be at minima during the reductive
                    phase of the metabolic cycle, when oxygen consumption is at a minimum, and reach
                    maxima during the peak of the oxidative phases when oxygen consumption is

                    have shown that under their specific experimental conditions, DNA replication
                    and cell division is restricted to the reductive phases of the metabolic cycle.
                    It is conceivable that growth per se (i.e. the accumulation of biomass) is
                    paused during the reductive phases of the metabolic cycle so that the cell can
                    replicate and segregate DNA and complete the complex processes of cell division;
                    growth may then be restricted to the oxidative phase of the metabolic cycle.
                    Alternatively, it is possible that as any heterogeneous culture grows faster, a
                    greater fraction of cells are in the oxidative phase at any point in time. Thus,
                    the growth rate gene expression signature we detect might reflect the fraction
                    of cells in the oxidative and reductive phases of the metabolic cycle in a
                    metabolically unsynchronized population.</p>

                    previous claim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Brauer1">[4]</xref> that the growth rate expression signature is
                    unrelated to the cell cycle. Moreover, since the published cell cycle
                    experiments were performed in rich media using a fermentable carbon source, the
                    results suggest that rapidly growing cells (which are almost exclusively
                    fermenting) do not partition metabolic activity into discrete phases, as their
                    energetic requirements are met in a continuously reductive metabolic state. It
                    is only when slowed growth is imposed upon the cell, due to stress, nutrient
                    limitation, or other suboptimal environments, that the metabolic cycle is
                    required.</p>
                <p>We sought to distinguish whether nutrient availability directly determines the
                    transcriptional state related to growth rate or whether nutrient availability is
                    integrated through an internal signaling pathway that controls the appropriate
                    transcriptional state. To address this issue, we examined the regulatory circuit
                    responsible for transcriptional changes in response to glucose availability in
                    yeast. Glucose addition to cells growing on glycerol elicits a rapid and massive
                    change in the pattern of gene expression, with more than half of all genes
                    changing at least twofold in expression. Previous work has shown that the
                    Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway is the major source for eliciting this transcriptional
                    change in response to glucose addition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Wang1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Zaman1">[11]</xref>. Activation of the

                    (<italic>RAS2</italic><sup>G19V</sup>), recapitulates in magnitude and direction
                    more than 85% of the changes observed by glucose addition, and

                <p>We used a <italic>gal1</italic>Δ strain carrying the activated allele
                        <italic>RAS2</italic><sup>G19V</sup> under control of the galactose
                    inducible <italic>GAL10</italic> promoter. Addition of galactose activates the
                    Ras/PKA pathway, but since galactose cannot be metabolized by this strain, the
                    metabolic state of the cell remains unaltered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Wang1">[9]</xref>. When grown on
                    glycerol our model predicts a relative growth rate of ∼0.2 for this
                    strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000257-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), which
                    changes to ∼0.6 within twenty minutes following glucose addition,
                    consistent with the change in doubling time from 5.8 hr to 2.6 hr. When we
                    performed the same experiment on glycerol media and induced the
                        <italic>RAS2</italic><sup>G19V</sup> by means of galactose addition, we
                    detected a transcriptional response within sixty minutes. The predicted growth
                    rate of the <italic>RAS2</italic><sup>G19V</sup> mutant strain was comparable to
                    the addition of glucose despite the fact that galactose addition does not yield
                    an increase in growth, as measured by optical density, since the cells are
                    unable to metabolize galactose. In fact, while the model's
                    summarization of gene expression state indicates that the culture is attempting
                    to increase growth, induction of the <italic>RAS2</italic><sup>G19V</sup> allele
                    results in an immediate decrease in growth rate and complete cessation of growth
                    within four hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-FedorChaiken1">[33]</xref>. These results are consistent with the cell
                    setting its growth-specific transcription program on the basis of its
                        <italic>perception</italic> of nutrients present in the environment, rather
                    than on the direct availability of energy or metabolites produced from such
                    nutrients. The mechanism by which the cell integrates this external state in
                    order to set the appropriate growth rate expression state must be mediated, at
                    least in part, through the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway.</p>

                            galactose, and to galactose with a constitutively active RAS2G19V
                            allele. On glucose, rapid growth is induced within ∼40 m; growth
                            on galactose falls to low levels within ∼40 m, as it cannot be
                            metabolized by this mutant. However, when glucose sensing is emulated by
                            artificial activation of the Ras/PKA pathway, the transcriptional
                            regulatory network attempts to induce rapid growth within
                            ∼60–80 m despite the unavailability of appropriate
                            nutrients. This disconnect between actual and perceived cellular state
                            leads to cell death within 4–6 hours and suggests that
                            nutrient sensing (as opposed to metabolic activity or internal cellular
                            state) is responsible for a large portion of the transcriptional growth

                <p>To investigate the regulatory basis of growth-associated gene expression, we
                    identified motifs enriched in the 3′ and 5′ regions of genes
                    with strong growth rate responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000257-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). We assigned genes to clusters based on their growth rate
                    response parameter (<italic>β<sub>g</sub></italic>) using k-means

                    identification program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Elemento1">[34]</xref>, we identified enriched motifs in seven of
                    the resulting ten clusters. Consistent with the functional enrichments of
                    negatively growth rate correlated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Brauer1">[4]</xref>, we identified known
                    binding sites associated with the stress responsive transcription factors Msn2p
                    and Msn4p in genes negatively correlated with growth rate. Conversely, genes
                    that increase in expression with increased growth rate are enriched for the
                    Rap1p consensus motif, which is commonly found upstream of genes encoding
                    protein components of the ribosome.</p>
                <p>We also found enrichment of the Ino4p binding site in genes upregulated with
                    increasing growth rate. Ino4p forms a heterodimer with Ino2p to activate genes
                    involved in phospholipid, fatty acid, and sterol biogenesis, all of which are
                    required in greater abundance with increased growth rates. Furthermore, Ino4p
                    has been proposed to have an inhibitory effect on a number of genes, including
                    those that encode the heat shock proteins (Hsp12p, Hsp26p) and catalase (Ctt1p)
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Santiago1">[35]</xref>. We also identified two additional enriched
                    motifs in the 5′ UTR for which the binding factor is not known,
                    suggesting that additional activators of growth-related transcriptional programs
                    remain to be determined.</p>
                <p>In addition to 5′ upstream motifs, we identified five enriched
                    3′UTR motifs, which are potential binding site for proteins that
                    promote mRNA degradation. Only a small number of mRNA binding consensus
                    sequences are known in yeast, all of which belong to the Puf family of mRNA
                    binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Gerber1">[36]</xref>. Our analysis identified five enriched motifs
                    in 3′UTRs. Two of these motifs, found in genes positively correlated
                    with growth rate, were identified by the FIRE program as being targets of Puf4p.
                    As an independent test, we compared the distribution of growth rate responses in
                    the known gene targets of the five Puf proteins with the overall distribution of
                    growth rate slopes. Targets of both Puf3p (220 genes) and Puf4p (205 genes) are
                    enriched for genes that are upregulated with increasing growth
                    (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two sample p-values
                    9×10<sup>−23</sup> and

                    The consensus motifs of Puf3p and Puf4p are very similar; investigation of the
                    PUF4 motif identified by FIRE suggests that the enrichment signal for at least
                    one of the motifs denoted PUF4 is likely to result from a composite of Puf3p and
                    Puf4p target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000257-g008">Figure

                <p>Overall, this analysis is consistent with tight transcriptional regulation
                    underlying the cellular growth program; it is likely that mRNAs involved in this
                    process are also subject to extensive post-transcriptional control.
                    Interestingly, since our growth-rate prediction method is sensitive to changes
                    in gene expression levels that occur within minutes of a perturbation, we expect
                    that post-transcriptional regulation (both mediated decay of and stabilization
                    of transcripts) is involved in this response. Experimental analyses of the
                    effects of perturbations within this regulatory network promise to shed further
                    light on its organization.</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>We present a statistical model of the gene expression response to changes in growth
                rate in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Developed on expression levels from a
                variety of steady state growth rates and nutrient limitations, the model captures
                information regarding each gene's linear response to growth rate. As
                detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Brauer1">[4]</xref>, approximately half of the genome shows a significant
                transcriptional response to growth rate with strong functional cohesiveness; here,
                we extend this model to show its robustness, applicability to new data, and ability
                to provide insight into the biological systems driving cellular regulation of growth
                rate. New experiments with more complex models (quadratic and hierarchical)
                demonstrated that additional model parameters did not provide substantial
                performance gains, in terms of growth rate prediction accuracy, particularly
                relative to their added complexity (data not shown). Similarly, variations in the
                definitions of responding genes or of growth-specific genes did not substantially
                alter results. This stability is reflected in the out-of-sample validation results,
                which quantify the model's accuracy in predicting relative growth rates
                from gene expression data, and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000257-t002">Table 2</xref>, which suggest that growth-specific signal is localized to a
                small number of genes consistently across experiments.</p>
            <p>The model can be applied to new gene expression data to estimate the instantaneous
                growth rate of the originating cellular culture. The estimated instantaneous rate
                represents a measurement of the transcriptional state of cellular growth rate
                control, and it provides insight into the cell's growth rate at arbitrarily
                short time scales inaccessible by experimental measurements (e.g. optical density).
                Moreover, genes with unexpectedly high or low expression values can be detected
                during growth rate inference, and may indicate biological responses to non-growth
                stimuli. The predictions based on the proposed model are robust to changing
                biological conditions, experimental methods, and technological platforms; they also
                extend to the related yeast <italic>S. bayanus</italic> and the highly diverged
                yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic>, suggesting that the transcriptional control of
                growth rate captured by the model are a fundamental aspect of unicellular biology.</p>
            <p>Through further analysis, we discovered several putative transcription factor binding
                sites enriched in growth-correlated genes, most notably the stress-responsive Msn2p
                and Msn4p, the Rap1p ribosomal factor, and Ino4p. Importantly, we have identified a
                likely role for post-transcriptional regulation in modulating transcriptional states
                related to growth rates. This finding is consistent with our ability to measure
                changes in growth rate over very short time scales using gene expression signatures.
                The abundance of any messenger RNA is a function of both its rate of production and
                of its rate of degradation; however, since transcription is relatively slow, changes
                in mRNA abundance can be most rapidly instantiated by altering the stability of the
                existent mRNA population. The Puf proteins have known roles in mediating mRNA
                degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Olivas1">[37]</xref> and in mediating the association of functionally
                related transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Gerber1">[36]</xref>. It has recently been proposed that modulation of
                mRNA stability is an important factor in metabolic regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Palumbo1">[38]</xref>. The association of
                Puf protein binding domains in the 3′ UTRs of genes with increased
                expression at higher growth rates suggests that modulating mRNA stability is also
                important in the regulation of the growth response at short time scales.</p>
            <p>From a statistical perspective, it is notable that a simple linear model accurately
                and robustly captures a specific biological phenomenon. The model represents a
                concise, functionally cohesive set of expression profiles regarding the
                genome's transcriptional response to growth. This functional interpretation
                of the model agrees with known aspects of the growth response, such as the
                transcription of ribosomal components, and provides insight as to the mechanistic
                roles of internal feedback, environmental sensing, and the stress response as growth
                rate varies. By monitoring a small ensemble of genes—with few parameters
                per individual gene—the model is easily applicable to new conditions and
                organisms and is robust to technical and biological sources of variation. These
                features enable our model to serve both as a practical tool for growth rate
                estimation (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://function.princeton.edu/growthrate" xlink:type="simple">http://function.princeton.edu/growthrate</ext-link>) and as a mechanistic
                building block in the pursuit of a systems-level understanding of cellular growth
                processes.</p>

                        brief (&lt;30 s) heat pulse at time zero; see Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000257.s005">Table

                        from steady state as the heat pulse is administered immediately before time
                        zero, followed by a gradual return to steady state and regulatory overshoot.
                        This behavior is consistent across growth rates, with the lowest growth
                        rates potentially showing a lesser shock response due to stress tolerance.</p>

                        arrays in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000257-Gasch1">[6]</xref>. These predictions are generally
                        consistent with known yeast biology and agree with expected growth behavior;
                        most shock time courses, including all heat shocks, peroxide, diamide, and
                        hyper-osmotic stress, provoke an initial sharp decrease in growth rate
                        followed by a return to initial or near-initial rate. Shorter shocks, such
                        as DTT, menadione, and peroxide responses, capture only the rate decrease.
                        Batch growth proceeds at a fairly constant rate until nutrients become
                        depleted, at which point the rate decreases sharply; this pattern is also
                        seen in intentional nitrogen depletion. Growth rates across varying
                        temperatures peak as expected at 25 C, falling off at lower and higher
                        temperatures. Response to varying carbon sources is also as expected, with
                        ethanol inducing the slowest growth and fructose, sucrose, and glucose
                        allowing the most rapid. The model's inference of growth rate from
                        expression data alone thus allows both post hoc growth analysis (e.g. years
                        after the original experiment) and an estimation of growth rates for
                        cultures where it would be difficult or time consuming to measure directly.</p>
