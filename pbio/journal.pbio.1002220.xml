<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genome duplication is a major evolutionary process that has shaped the genomes of several eukaryotic lineages including vertebrates, plants, and fungi. The sequencing of the baker's yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> in the 1990s revealed the presence of conserved blocks of duplicated genes, indicating an ancestral duplication of the entire genome. Subsequent work has clarified when this event occurred and what genomic rearrangements followed, but the underlying mechanistic origin of such a large-scale event remains poorly understood. Here we used a large-scale phylogenetic approach to examine the individual evolutionary histories of all yeast genes and assessed the time at which each duplication occurred. This survey revealed evidence for an ancient hybridization event between two ancestral species in the lineage in which the whole-genome duplication had occurred. We further characterize this hybridization event and the properties of the putative parental species. We propose that the whole-genome duplication was a direct consequence of this hybridization, providing a means by which the initially sterile hybrid could regain fertility. This scenario provides a mechanistic understanding of the origin of the ancient yeast whole-genome duplication and brings a radically different perspective on the interpretation of the origin and evolutionary consequences of whole-genome duplications in eukaryotic lineages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ancient whole-genome duplications (WGDs) are major evolutionary events that have impacted several eukaryotic lineages, including plants, animals, and fungi [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among plants, ancestral WGDs have been identified in monocots and core eudicots [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and more recent events are apparent in many lineages such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, maize, and soybean [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In vertebrates, the existence of two ancestral WGDs (but also more recent ones in teleost fishes and frogs) has been proposed [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Earlier work has focused on establishing the periods at which these events occurred [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and on assessing the functional and evolutionary aftermath of the doubling of the entire genetic complement [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, we still do not fully understand what initially triggered these events. Perhaps the best-studied WGD is the one affecting an ancestor of the baker's yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, an event supported by the finding of numerous blocks of paralogs with conserved synteny [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is now established that this event occurred just before the separation of <italic>Vanderwaltozyma polyspora</italic> from the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> lineage, originating a clade of post-WGD species (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that the genome doubling was followed by extensive genome rearrangements and rampant gene loss that have since shaped these species' genomes, resulting in only a minor fraction of the WGD-derived paralogs (ohnologs) being retained [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Based on the high level of synteny found between reconstructed ancestrally duplicated gene blocks, it has been proposed that the yeast WGD has its origin in an autopolyploidization event [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This proposition has important implications with respect to the possible initial selective advantages that played a role after the polyploidization event. Polyploidy has been considered to promote evolutionary innovation because it facilitates neo- and subfunctionalization and buffers deleterious mutations. However, these mechanisms only provide an advantage after some time has passed and a number of mutations have accumulated. Conversely, simple increase in ploidy has been considered to put barriers to fast adaptation, as it masks beneficial recessive mutations and avoids rapid purging of deleterious mutations. Furthermore, most experimental work comparing populations of different ploidy generally provides support for the superiority of the normal ploidy versus increased ploidies in a given species [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, the nature of the initial evolutionary advantage of the yeast WGD remains an open question.</p>

<title>Evidence of a duplication peak pre-dating the WGD.</title>
<p>(A) Evolutionary relationships of the analysed species. The tree was built using a maximum likelihood approach on a concatenated alignment of 516 widespread orthologs. All branches had maximal bootstrap support (100%). The WGD and the pre-KLE (<italic>Kluyveromyces</italic>, <italic>Lachancea</italic>, and <italic>Eremothecium</italic>) branch are marked with coloured circles. Branches in the lineage leading from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> to the root are numbered from more ancestral (n1) to more recent (n8). (B) Duplication densities (duplications per gene per branch) calculated for each annotated branch, either using the entire set of gene trees (green dots) or only the ohnologs (yellow dots). (C) Sequence divergence between yeast sequences belonging to two populations: duplication mapped at the WGD branch (blue) and duplication mapped at the pre-KLE branch (red). Graphs represent frequencies of normalized blast scores, Kimura distances, and estimated divergence age, respectively. Normalized blast score is the result of dividing the blast score obtained when aligning the seed yeast protein to the ohnolog pair by the blast score obtained from aligning the seed yeast protein to itself. The Kimura distance between the two sequences was calculated using protdist as implemented in the phylip package after aligning the two sequences. PL-R8s [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was used to assess the divergence times in individual trees that contained two ohnologous genes. Data on which this figure is based are provided in <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Data</xref>.</p>

<p>WGDs leave a footprint in the form of cohorts of homologous genes that duplicated in the same period. Phylogenetic analysis of gene families informs on the relative age of duplications [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and hence is a powerful tool to study WGDs. When ancestral duplications are inferred from the genes encoded in a genome and their relative dates are mapped to a reference species tree, ancient WGDs are expected to lead to an accumulation of duplications mapped to the lineage in which the event occurred. Earlier analyses have used such approach to detect ancient duplications in vertebrates [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and plants [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, despite extensive phylogenetic work [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], no study has assessed the global phylogenetic congruence of gene duplications and the WGD that occurred in the lineage leading to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Here, we set out to investigate patterns of past duplications in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> by analysing genome-wide sets of gene phylogenies (i.e., phylomes).</p>

<title>Gene Phylogenies Reveal Waves of Ancestral Duplications</title>
<p>We based our analyses on a set of 26 completely sequenced genomes, for which we reconstructed a reference species phylogeny based on the alignment concatenation of 516 widespread, single-copy orthologs (See <xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). Subsequently, we used the phylomeDB pipeline [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to reconstruct the evolutionary history of every protein encoded in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> genome. These gene family trees were used to detect and date well-supported duplication events, using a phylogeny-based method described elsewhere [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In brief, the method exploits the temporal information provided by the branching patterns in a given gene tree: a duplication must be older than the lineages diverging subsequent to it and younger than lineages branching earlier. Using this information, we can map duplications to the reference species tree and compute duplication densities per gene and branch (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Unexpectedly, our analyses revealed the largest duplication peak (0.28 duplications per gene) at the branch preceding the divergence between <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> and a clade containing the genera <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic>, <italic>Lachancea</italic>, and <italic>Eremothecium</italic> (<italic>Ashbya gossypii</italic>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], hereafter referred to as KLE (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To assess whether this peak was indeed related to the WGD event, we limited our analysis to those duplications leading to conserved pairs of WGD-ohnologs as defined in the Yeast Gene Order Browser (YGOB) database [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Note that YGOB uses a synteny criterion which is independent of the specific gene phylogeny. We found that the pre-KLE duplication peak was more apparent in the subset of duplications leading to conserved pairs of ohnologs, which indicates that this ancestral duplication peak is indeed related to the observed WGD paralogous blocks (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Of note, not all duplications resulting in pairs of conserved, syntenic ohnologs mapped to the pre-KLE peak (n3). A second accumulation of duplications appeared at the branch preceding the divergence of a clade formed by <italic>Zygosaccharomyces rouxii</italic> and <italic>Torulaspora delbrueckii</italic> (referred to as ZT hereafter) with the post-WGD species (n4). A smaller fraction of duplications mapped to the expected WGD location (n5) or subsequent branches. We assessed the degree of divergence between syntenic ohnologs derived from duplications at the pre-KLE peak and those from duplications at the WGD node, as the two more divergent points of interest, and found that the former had significantly larger divergences (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). This supports that gene pairs whose duplications are predicted to be more ancestral by a topological approach are also more divergent at the sequence level. It also indicates that the genes in paralogous blocks may be composed of distinct sets of genes, diverged at different times.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>The Ancestral Duplication Peak Is Robust</title>
<p>To discard the possibility that our unexpected result was artifactual and to understand what may have caused the dispersion of the duplication mappings outside the WGD node, we carefully assessed possible methodological and interpretation pitfalls. First of all, given that the pre-KLE branch is among the longest in our species phylogeny, the ancestral peak could simply indicate a higher number of duplications accumulated over a longer period of time. We thus measured the correlation between duplication densities and branch lengths for the whole phylogeny. While a high correlation was indeed observed when considering all the duplications (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.92 Pearson), this was not the case when the analysis was restricted to only those duplications leading to syntenic ohnologs (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.00). We next assessed the effect of using alternative yeast species as a seed in the phylome reconstruction and observed that the use of <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> or <italic>V</italic>. <italic>polyspora</italic> phylomes resulted in similar patterns of duplication densities (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Another, always contentious point is the use of a reference phylogeny. Although the reconstructed species tree was highly supported and congruent with earlier reconstructions [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], an alternative branching order for the KLE species had been previously presented [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This alternative topology suggested that the <italic>Lachancea</italic>, <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic>, and <italic>Eremothecium</italic> are not monophyletic but rather stem out sequentially from the lineage leading to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Such organization could potentially affect our results if, for instance, the pre-KLE duplications were found to be partitioned among the new internodes (i.e., branches) created by this topology. To test this, we repeated the analysis using the alternative topology as a reference. Our results show that the underlying topology does not affect the central finding that an apparent duplication peak existed before the divergence of KLE species (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Finally, we tried an alternative method to map the duplication events of ohnologs by using the reconciliation-based algorithm implemented in Notung [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which rendered similar results (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, a different species topology and a different duplication detection method do not alter the main result that the majority of ohnologs have apparently diverged before the expected WGD.</p>
<p>We next tried to assess the possible effect of stochastic errors or artifacts in the gene trees. We did so by focusing on the trees that contained pairs of conserved ohnologs in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Short sequences tend to be less reliable and more prone to stochastic errors. First, we examined the signal present in subsets of sequences of varying lengths (&lt;500 aa, 500 to 1,000 aa, and &gt;1,000 aa). As seen in (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>), the three groups of genes consistently provide a very low duplication signal at the WGD, while signals at the two previous branches (pre-ZT and pre-KLE) are much larger.</p>
<p>Secondly, we assessed the robustness of our main result across a range of different methodological approaches for gene tree reconstruction. We tested three different maximum likelihood programs: PhyML [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], RAxML [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Fasttree [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; and one program based on Bayesian inference (BI): Phylobayes [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to the best-fitting evolutionary model used in our standard analyses, we used PhyML to test the effect of using two different, more complex models (C20-CAT [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Covarion [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) and a different search heuristic, subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR), instead of the default nearest-neighbour interchange (NNI). Finally, we tested two different support methods in RAxML (rapid bootstrapping and Shimodaira–Hasegawa (SH) support) and in PhyML (approximate likelihood ratio test [aLRT] and bootstrapping). A summary of the different methods can be found in <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. Results of different methods are not directly comparable because different subsets of trees pass the filters for a given procedure (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). However, when a tree passed the filters for any given two methods, the result was highly consistent in most cases (86% overall agreement). Overall, our main result that duplications are apparently older than the expected WGD remained consistent (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). The fraction of ohnolog duplications mapped to the expected WGD node is minimal (&lt;15% in all datasets), while more ancestral duplications are prominent with &gt;50% of the duplications being mapped to the two nodes preceding the WGD (pre-ZT and pre-KLE), although the balance between these two prominent peaks differed between the methods. These differences notwithstanding, the main conclusion of the duplication density analysis is consistent across methods: the majority of ohnologs have inferred duplication ages that predate the expected time of the WGD.</p>
<p>Finally, phylogenetic artifacts such as long-branch attraction (LBA) can produce wrong topologies with high support [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is possible that trees containing paralogs diverging at very unequal rates may have been affected by LBA, misplacing duplications closer to the root. In fact, differential rates among paralogs are expected when processes of neofunctionalization are acting. One way to ascertain whether LBA is affecting the topology is reconstructing the tree with and without the out-groups. In the absence of LBA, the in-group topology is expected to remain stable [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We applied this test to the trees containing ohnologs and found that the majority of trees (85%) gave consistent mappings of the duplication of the ohnologs, indicating that the effect of LBA is not widespread and does not significantly affect the duplication mapping. We performed a second test to see whether LBA could explain the observed patterns. For this, we devised sequence simulations in which one of the ohnologs was made to evolve 20 times faster than its paralog. Despite the use of such extreme values, the duplication peak at simulations was detectable at the expected location, and artifactual peaks were significantly smaller and not apparent at the pre-KLE lineage (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). Gene conversion among duplicates may result in underestimation of duplication ages, possibly accounting for part of the disappearance of the WGD peak, but not for the presence of the pre-KLE peak. Thus, LBA and gene conversion may have blurred the signal of the WGD peak but cannot account for the prominent pre-KLE peak.</p>
<p>Our results show compelling evidence that a majority of yeast genes defined as ohnologs have diverged before the expected period of the WGD. This overall result holds even though the exact mapping from individual gene trees may vary across methodologies and datasets. The event under study is very ancient, and genes contain a limited amount of information; thus, degradation of the signal is expected. However, stochastic noise would explain a diffusion of the signal but not the existence of a stronger, more ancient duplication peak. We have also shown that distorting processes such as LBA cannot account for the observed patterns. We thus turned to assess other possible biological explanations for our observation.</p>

<title>Hybridization Accounts for the Observed Phylogenetic Patterns</title>
<p>We further considered possible evolutionary scenarios that could result in the observed patterns of ancestral duplications seen for the ohnologs. We reasoned that an interspecies hybridization would result in phylogenetic patterns reminiscent of duplications that would be mapped to the common ancestor of the two hybridizing species (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), providing a possible scenario to explain our puzzling results. The process of hybridization originates a new lineage by bringing together two diverged genomes. Orthologous genes coming from each of the parental species would appear as paralogs in standard analyses, since they are homologous genes encoded in the same genome [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A phylogenetic analysis, however, would map the apparent duplication to the time of divergence of the two parental species (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). This necessarily predates the time of the formation of the hybrid: that is, the hybridization point does not coincide with the point at which the apparent duplications would be mapped. As we will see below, our hypothesis is that the hybridization may have shortly predated the actual WGD point (i.e., occurred at node n5 in <xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In support of this, we calculated the duplication densities on the well-studied yeast interspecies hybrid <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pastorianus</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This species is the result of a recent hybridization between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>eubayanus</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The sequenced genome of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bayanus</italic> is the closest related genome to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>eubayanus</italic>, and therefore we expect the highest duplication peak to appear at the common ancestor between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bayanus</italic>. The duplication density analysis, as predicted, yielded an apparent duplication peak at the common ancestor <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bayanus</italic>, but not at the lineage where the hybridization and the doubling of the genome is known to have occurred (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>The results found for the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> lineage could thus be readily explained by a past hybridization between lineages diverging just after the observed peak and before the post-WGD species. Considering this and the current genomic sampling, species close to, but not necessarily within the KLE and ZT clades, would be the prime suspects of potential partners in the proposed ancestral hybridization (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). To explore this possibility further, we inferred properties of the two putative parental lineages from the current genomic sampling. We did so by inspecting individual <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> gene phylogenies in the above-mentioned phylomes (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> as an example) and by measuring phylogenetic affiliations using phylomes reconstructed with reduced taxonomic sets (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Tables). Phylogenetic affiliations were measured by scanning the gene tree topologies to examine the species contained in the sister groups (i.e., neighbouring clades) of the sequences from post-WGD species (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). We categorized them according to one of the two lineages that diverged after the pre-KLE peak and the origin of the post-WGD species: the KLE clade and the ZT clade. From now on, we consider the ZT cluster as the extant clade closest to one of the parents (parent A), while the KLE cluster will be considered as the closest to the other parent (parent B). Although, for simplicity, we refer to ZT and KLE clades as parental lineages, it must be clearly stated that it is our understanding that the actual parents may have been close to, but not necessarily within, these clades. Accordingly, three possible topologies can be considered: two in which the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> seed sequence groups with either parental species (A or B, respectively) and a third one in which the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> sequence has the two parental lineages as a sister group (C) (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Our results (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) indicated that a large majority (60%–82%, depending on the choice of species used in the reduced phylome; see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>) of the trees showed a topology congruent with the currently accepted phylogeny, i.e., the post-WGD species grouping with the ZT clade. When only the trees that contain <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> proteins with a conserved ohnolog are considered, the results remain very similar (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) (54%–78%, depending on the choice of species used in the reduced phylome; see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). This suggests that this or a related lineage would have been involved in the hybridization (parent A) and that genes derived from this parental species constitute a majority of the genome in extant post-WGD species. In contrast, a remarkably low fraction of genes showed an affiliation only to the KLE lineage (4%–14%), whereas a larger percentage (14%–28%) of genes had as a sister group a combination of the two putative parental clades (C). This would suggest that one of the actual parental lineages did not belong to the KLE but rather diverged before. The analysis repeated using different phylogenetic methodologies confirmed these results (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The high percentage of trees supporting the A topology could be the result of total or partial gene conversion, which is common in recent hybrids [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We can only clarify this matter by analysing gene trees that contain pairs of conserved ohnologs. Depending on the distribution of the two ohnologous genes when compared to KLE and ZT, we can distinguish between nine different topologies (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Fig</xref>). Forty percent of the trees contained a topology in which the two yeast ohnologs grouped together (topologies A–A 1, B–B 1, and C–C 1). This could be due to total or partial gene conversion from one of the parents to the other. The gene conversion events seem to favour genes from parent A, since in 30% of the mentioned cases both retained genes are more closely related to this parent. We performed sequence evolution simulations including different degrees of gene conversion to estimate what levels would be necessary to alter the tree topology (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). In our settings (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>), conversion of 25% of the gene sequence was sufficient to lead to a higher probability of the duplication being mapped to a younger node. Thus, gene conversion, which renders duplications to appear younger, has a much larger effect than LBA.</p>
<p>These analyses underscore the difficulty of correctly determining the position of parent B. There is a strong signal for the parent B to have diverged just before the KLE clade (shown by topology A–A 2 and B–B 2), which is present in 33% of the trees. As we will discuss below, we consider that recombination between the two parental subgenomes, including total or partial gene conversion, must have been common in the period following the hybridization, explaining not only the bias in descent among ohnologs and singletons but also the widespread mixture of phylogenetic signals in gene trees that is typical for this clade [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
<p>The availability of genomes from fungal species in which recent hybridizations or WGDs have been described allows us to assess the patterns of phylogenetic affiliations and compare them with the patterns observed for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. On the one hand, <italic>Rhizopus delemar</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and <italic>Hortaea werneckii</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] are thought to have undergone a recent WGD. On the other hand, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pastorianu</italic>s [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and the wine strain <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> x <italic>S</italic>. <italic>kudriavzevii</italic> VIN7 [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] are recognized as recent hybrids for which the putative parental species are known. It is important to remark that some of the described WGD species may indeed be as well the result of hybridizations, as it is proposed here for the post-WGD clade, but that the current sampling of species prevents the detection of the alternative parental signals. We reconstructed the phylomes of these four species (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>) and computed phylogenetic affiliations as explained above, but adjusting A and B to the known parents or the corresponding neighbouring clades. Putative WGD species showed a clear dominance of the immediate preceding clade (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). The recent hybrids, on the other hand, presented a split topology distribution, with roughly half of the trees supporting the A topology and another half supporting the B topology (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). This clearly provides evidence of the dual origin of these species. As negative controls, we examined the phylomes of two species without anomalous ploidy, <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and the above-mentioned simulated yeast phylome in which one of the ohnologs was evolving at a faster rate (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). This analysis shows that hybrids present a clear dual pattern of phylogenetic affiliations when the gene phylogenies are examined in the presence of the two parental lineages. This pattern is clearly distinct from what is in genomes with normal ploidy or in recent WGDs. This dual pattern is also present in the analysis of the yeast genome. Of note, in this case the two alternative phylogenetic affiliations are not equally represented. This difference with respect to recent hybrids can be attributable to the larger period of time since the hybridization and the preferential loss or conversion of genes coming from one of the parental lineages, which necessarily altered the balance between the two phylogenetic affiliations.</p>

<title>Reinterpreting Gene Order Conservation in Light of Hybridization</title>
<p>As mentioned above, inferred ancestral collinearity has been used to favour simpler WGD scenarios involving autopolyploidization [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, such studies indistinctly used KLE and ZT clades to infer ancestral gene arrangements and thus could not inform about differences between the putative parents. Although the position of the parental species cannot be ascertained with confidence, we can take KLE and ZT clades as the two extremes of their possible divergence. We therefore assessed the level of micro- and macrosynteny conservation among the KLE, ZT, and post-WGD clades, by considering them separately. To do this, we reanalysed the information of orthology and syntenic blocks provided by YGOB [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We first assessed the differences between ZT and KLE by searching for gene arrangements conserved within ZT and KLE, but different between the two groups. These differences can be considered ancestral to the two groups and thus likely present at the time of the proposed hybridization. Only 32 cases of broken synteny and 11 translocations of a single gene were noted (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). When searching for these synteny breaks in post-WGD species, we found that they had inherited the arrangement present in either KLE or ZT in similar amounts (15 and 17, respectively) (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Of note, the patterns shared by KLE and post-WGD species could result from lineage-specific rearrangements in the lineage leading ZT clade so we cannot unequivocally impute them to the hybridization. This result is consistent with the absence of disagreements between syntenic ohnologous blocks noted earlier [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p>However, an autopolyploidization scenario would predict a larger number of shared syntenic arrangements between the post-WGD and its closest clade (ZT). Furthermore, the absence of disagreements in such a small number of blocks can be explained by other factors, including gene conversion, so it cannot be considered a definitive proof of autopolyploidization. In addition, we found that the number of conserved pairs of adjacent orthologs between KLE and ZT clade was high, as was the number of conserved pairs between post-WGD species and any of the KLE and ZT clades (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.s021" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s022" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> Tables). Finally, we found no differences in terms of the minimal amount of rearrangements [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] between each <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> syntenic block [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and those in either ZT or KLE species (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). These results speak for the high collinearity of the two putative parental clades at the proposed time of hybridization (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> Tables), which is congruent with the small divergence time estimated between the two clades at the time when the post-WGD clade originated (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14 Fig</xref>). In addition, considering the high level of collinearity between the ZT and KLE clades, and the lack of differences in terms of synteny conservation when compared to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, the proposed hybridization is as compatible with the observed level of conserved synteny between duplicated blocks as a simpler autopolyploidization scenario. Recent yeast hybrids have been shown to present extensive recombination between parental genomes, including total or partial gene conversion [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], which breaks the initial correlation between phylogenetic origins of neighbouring genes and removes sequence and structural differences between homologous chromosomes. This and extensive differential gene loss and genome rearrangements that have occurred within the post-WGD clade have presumably eroded the few initial differences between the two parents that we can reconstruct. We conclude that, given the similar levels of collinearity implied by both scenarios and the confounding effects of extensive gene loss, homologous recombination, gene conversion, and genome rearrangements, synteny cannot be used in this case to disentangle whether the WGD was triggered by an autopolyploidization or a hybridization event.</p>

<title>A Proposed Model for the Origin of the Yeast WGD through Hybridization</title>
<p>The proposed hybridization is a very ancient event, and thus, the remaining signal must be necessarily weak. We have shown that gene order differences between the putative parental species involved in the hybridization were extremely low, and we consider that this signal may have been completely eroded, which explains why the hybridization was not evident from earlier analyses based on synteny. Our phylogenetic results, however, do provide clear support for the existence of an ancient interspecies hybridization and are not compatible with a simple autopolyploidization scenario. The observed phylogenetic affiliations in ohnologs and singletons, biased towards one of the putative parental lineages, as well as the absence of synteny disagreements in ohnologous blocks, can be reconciled with the assumption that the proposed hybridization was followed by widespread recombination events between the two parents subgenomes, some of which would have led to partial or total gene conversion. As noted before, this process is common in recent yeast hybrids [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and it is natural to expect that this would have occurred in an ancient hybridization. Notably, hybridization followed by recombination between parental subgenomes also explains another long-held observation of the post-WGD clade: that there is a variable mixture of disparate phylogenetic signals present across different gene trees [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results also indicate that an apparently more ancestral duplication peak occurred in addition to duplications around the expected WGD point. We hypothesize that the occurrence of these two rare events in the same lineage is not the result of coincidence. We propose two possible scenarios that naturally link the two events and explain the observed patterns (<xref rid="pbio.1002220.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). In the simplest scenario, two diploid cells from distinct species form an allotetraploid. Subsequent recombination and massive gene loss would render a lineage in which the number of chromosomes has effectively doubled. In this case, hybridization directly results in the observed WGD, because a fraction of the final gene set is retained as “ohnologous” pairs, either from the same or from different parental species. Alternatively, two haploid cells from different species form an allodiploid. Such hybrids are largely unstable and cannot undergo the sexual cycle, but they can propagate clonally [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. An additional duplication by autopolyploidization would stabilize the hybrid by enabling meiotic recombination. This mechanism, which also prevents backcross with the parental lineages, has been proposed as a necessary step to stabilize some interspecies hybrids [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and is a scenario commonly considered in recent plant hybrids [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Both scenarios cannot be distinguished with the data at hand, but the ability of haploid cells to fuse through mating provides a possible mechanism for the latter. Further investigation of how these two mechanisms participate in the formation of natural hybrids is necessary [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Importantly, some of the steps proposed by our model were also contemplated in models considering autopolyploidization scenarios [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Our results provide compelling evidence for an ancient hybridization in the yeast lineage and bring about novel implications in our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic genomes and the origin of functional divergence after WGDs. Remarkably, besides the pattern of ancient duplications, the proposed model provides plausible explanations to other common observations in the post-WGD clade. The phylogenetic relationships within and around the post-WGD clade have always been difficult to resolve, and a great diversity of phylogenetic histories among different genes has been noted [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A chimeric origin of the clade, combined with events of recombination between genes from different parents—as observed in current hybrids [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]—would readily explain an increased variability in phylogenetic signals recovered from different genes. Such intragenic recombinations, together with full gene conversion and differential gene loss, may as well partially explain the observed dispersion of the phylogenetic mapping of duplications from syntenic ohnologs around the expected WGD point. Furthermore, ohnologs have been shown to present selection pressures intermediate of singleton genes and those from small-scale duplications of a similar age [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Finally, notable exceptions to expectations from the gene balance hypothesis, which posits that WGD would favour duplications of entire complexes rather than single subunits, have been noted [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Most of these observations have been interpreted in the light of an assumed rapid sequence and functional divergence after duplication. However, under a hybridization scenario, a fraction of the predicted ohnologs originate from distinct species, and thus, sequence and functional differences are expected from the start. In contrast, an autopolyploidization scenario poses the problem of how reproductive isolation was achieved and faces the lack of a clear selective advantage before neo- or subfunctionalization occurs. Interspecies hybridization brings together different physiological properties and isolates sexually the newly formed lineage, hence providing an initial selective advantage to explain observed WGDs in eukaryotes. Considering the widespread presence of hybrids among current species, this scenario should also be considered when interpreting ancient polyploidies. The proposed approach and an increased genome sampling around the relevant lineages will enable testing the possible implication of interspecies hybridization in other eukaryotic WGDs.</p>

<title>Phylome Reconstruction</title>
<p>Phylomes—complete collections of phylogenetic trees for each gene encoded in a given genome—were reconstructed using the automatic pipeline described in Huerta-Cepas et al. [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Briefly, the pipeline starts with a seed genome and proceeds as follows: for each protein encoded in the seed genome, a Smith-Waterman similarity search was performed against a database containing the proteomes listed above. Results were then filtered based on e-value (&lt;1e-05) and sequence overlap (&gt;50% coverage over the query sequence). The query and the selected hits (homologous sequences) were then aligned using a sophisticated multiple sequence alignment strategy in which three different alignment programs were used (Muscle v3.8 [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], Mafft v6.712b [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and Kalign v2.04 [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]) to align the sequences in forward and reverse orientation. The resulting six alignments were combined into a consensus alignment using M-coffee [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This alignment was then trimmed to remove poorly aligned columns with trimAl v1.3 [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] using a consistency-score cutoff of 0.1667 and a gap-score cutoff of 0.9. Trees were reconstructed using the best-fitting evolutionary model. The selection of the model best fitting each alignment was performed as follows: a neighbour joining (NJ) tree was reconstructed as implemented in BioNJ [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]; the likelihood of this topology was computed, allowing branch-length optimization, using seven different models (JTT, LG, WAG, Blosum62, MtREV, VT, and Dayhoff), as implemented in PhyML v3.0 [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; the two models best fitting the data, as determined by the AIC criterion [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], were used to derive maximum likelihood (ML) trees. Four rate categories were used, and invariant positions were inferred from the data. Branch supports were computed using an aLRT based on a chi-square distribution, as implemented in PhyML [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p>

A simulated phylome using <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> as seed was also reconstructed (see below).

In these reduced phylomes, for the seed species, only one sequence was present in the tree; all paralogs for this species were removed to ensure that a clear phylogenetic position could be established.

From the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> phylome, we selected 516 protein-coding genes found in single copy across the 26 species considered.

<title>Calculation of Duplication Density per Branch</title>
<p>Each tree in a phylome was scanned to detect and date duplications using a phylogeny-based algorithm described earlier [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In brief, this algorithm traverses the tree and uses a so-called species-overlap algorithm to detect duplication nodes. Duplication nodes are defined as those nodes where the two daughter branches share at least one species. The relative age of this duplication is assumed to be at the last common ancestor of the species diverged after the duplication (i.e., those contained in the two daughter branches). Each duplication was then mapped onto the corresponding ancestral lineage in the species tree. The total number of duplications was divided by the total number of trees that were rooted at a deeper branch in the species tree (i.e., those that are informative for the evaluated lineage). For instance, to estimate the duplication density at the WGD branch, only trees that contain at least one pre-WGD species were considered. <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> shows a schematic representation of the duplication mapping process. This analysis was performed using three different phylomes, in which <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>V</italic>. <italic>polyspora</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> were used as seed, respectively. For each phylome, two different datasets were used. In the first one, all the trees in the phylome were used (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, green dot, and <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>, lighter dots), the second was based on trees in which a pair of retained ohnologs was present, and only the duplication node leading to the two seed ohnologs was used (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, yellow dot, and <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>, darker dots). Ohnologs were obtained from YGOB [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which uses a synteny criterion combined with sequence similarity but is not phylogenetically informed. Only trees that contained both ohnologs were considered. This second set ensured that the duplication density was not affected by duplications not related to the WGD event. We plotted the correlation between duplication densities and branch lengths.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Comparison of Sequence Divergence</title>
<p>We mapped the duplication event of the two ohnologs to the species tree and only kept those <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> sequences whose duplication point mapped to the WGD node or to the pre-KLE node (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Only trees that contained at least one ZT sequence, one KLE sequence, and one out-group sequence were considered. Blast scores were normalized by dividing the blast score obtained when searching from a seed yeast protein to the ohnolog pair by the blast score obtained from searching the seed yeast protein to itself. In a separate analysis, pairwise alignments of the conserved ohnologs were reconstructed using Muscle v3.8 [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The Kimura distance between the two sequences was calculated using protdist as implemented in the phylip package [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The frequency of distances of the two different distributions and blast score frequencies were plotted with R [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Significance of the difference in distributions was assessed using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The two populations were significantly different, with a <italic>p</italic>-value for the blast scores of 2e-04 and for the Kimura distance of 2.9e-05.</p>

<title>Reconstruction of Trees Using Different Phylogenetic Methods</title>
<p>A set of 846 trees were selected from the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> phylome where pairs of conserved ohnologs were found, as predicted by YGOB [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The alignments were taken from the phylome reconstruction done previously. Then, for each tree, several additional phylogenetic reconstruction methods were used. Fasttree [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was used with default values. PhyML [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was run again three times; in all cases, four rate categories were applied and invariant positions were calculated from the data. The first time the CAT model C20 was used [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the second time the Covarion model [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was used (—cov_free –cov_ncats = 3), and finally, the same models as in the phylome were used, but instead of using NNI to estimate the tree topologies, SPR was used. For the three methods, the aLRT support was calculated. A fourth run with PhyML was performed using the same method as during the phylome reconstruction, but instead of calculating aLRT support values, bootstrap values based on 100 replicates were computed. RAxML [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was applied using the PROTGAMMALG model and rapid bootstrapping to obtain the branch support. The SH support as implemented in RAxML was calculated over the same set of trees. A Bayesian approach was also used. Phylobayes [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was used to reconstruct the trees; for each tree, two chains were run for a minimum of 500 cycles; every 100 cycles, the two chains were automatically compared; and if the discrepancies were lower or equal to 0.3 and the effective sizes were larger than 50, the process was stopped. The majority rule consensus, annotated with posterior probabilities, was obtained for each tree.</p>
<p>For each set of trees, the duplication density for the duplication point that led to the diversification of the two <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> ohnologs was calculated. Results can be found in <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>. Only nodes in which the support value at the common ancestor of the two ohnologous sequences has an aLRT &gt; 0.95 or a bootstrap &gt; 95 or a posterior probability &gt; 95 were considered.</p>

<title>Tree Reconstruction without Out-groups</title>
<p>The same set of 846 trees was reconstructed with no out-group sequences using the same methodology used for phylome reconstruction (see above). The trees included only the post-WGD sequences and the ZT and KLE sequences. Trees were then checked to see whether the two <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> ohnologs had a common ancestor that contained no sequences of the ZT and KLE groups, therefore giving support to the WGD, or if they had sequences of either group in between. Only trees in which the common ancestor of the two <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> sequences has a support over 0.5 were considered. The same procedure was performed in the same set of trees taken from the phylome. Out-groups in this case were used to root the tree, and then the same analysis was performed. Fifteen percent of the trees gave a different prediction when the two methodologies were performed.</p>

<title>Simulations to Test for Long Branch Attraction</title>
<p>For each sequence encoded in the yeast genome that had one-to-one orthologs in all the species considered, alignments obtained during the phylome reconstruction were trimmed to remove all positions with gaps. The number of species considered was reduced to 12, including <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, all the species belonging to the ZT and KLE clades (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>delbrueckii</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>rouxii</italic>, <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic>, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>gossypii</italic>, <italic>Lachancea kluyveri</italic>, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>thermotolerans</italic>, and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>waltii</italic>) and four outgroups (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, and <italic>Wickerhamomyces anomalus</italic>). The species tree (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) was pruned to match this set of species. The existing tree branch that contained <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> was bifurcated to create two new branches containing simulated yeast paralogs. The first branch contained the original <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> leaf, but its branch length was cut in half. The second branch contained a new <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> leaf with a branch length ten times longer than the original.

Tree-puzzle [<xref rid="pbio.1002220.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] was used to obtain the mutation frequency observed at each site of the alignment. Tree-puzzle was run with the JTT model; the gamma distribution was estimated from the data using 16 rate categories. These mutation frequencies produced very conserved, unrealistic alignments with few mutations; therefore, the frequencies were multiplied by 20, resulting in more realistic alignments. Indel frequency was set at 0.0003. The resulting sequences were then treated as a newly simulated phylome, which was run through the phylome pipeline. Duplication densities were then mapped onto the species tree (see <xref rid="pbio.1002220.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>

In addition, for the seed species, only the seed sequence was included; other paralogs in this organism were excluded from the tree.

Then, the support of the clade containing the seed sequence and its most immediate neighbouring clade was evaluated using aLRT values. Only clades with support higher than 0.95 were considered. The phylogenetic affiliation of the seed sequence was classified into one of the following groups, according to the species that were present in its neighbouring clade (i.e., sister branch): A, the species located in the sister branch belonged to the ZT clade formed by <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>rouxii</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>delbrueckii</italic> (putative parent A); B, they belonged to the clade formed by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>gossypii</italic>, <italic>K</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>thermotolerans</italic>, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>waltii</italic>, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>kluyveri</italic> (KLE clade, putative parent B); and C, they contained a mix of both clades.

<p>For each pair of genes located next to each other in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> genome, we checked whether the orthologs in each of the ZT-KLE species were also contiguous. The same procedure was repeated in order to compare the ZT and KLE species.</p>

<title>Schematic representation of the duplication mapping process used in this work.</title>
<p>(A) Graph representing the mapping of the phylome trees onto the species tree. Duplication events, as predicted by the species overlap algorithm, are marked as black dots. The loss of a gene in a given branch is marked in light grey. Duplications are mapped onto the species tree according to the lineages that diverged before and subsequent to it: A/B and C/E, respectively, for the tree in the top. (B) Representation of set 2, only ohnologous duplications are considered in this case. Grey trees represent phylome trees that were not used in this dataset, whereas black trees represent trees that contained ohnologous pairs. Red dots in the tree represent duplications that are considered since they give rise to the ohnologous pairs (red branches), while grey dots represent duplications that were ignored in this analysis.</p>
