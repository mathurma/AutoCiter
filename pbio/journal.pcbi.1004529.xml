<abstract>
<p>Familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD)-causing mutant presenilins (PS) interact with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels resulting in enhanced IP<sub>3</sub>R channel gating in an amyloid beta (A<italic>β</italic>) production-independent manner. This gain-of-function enhancement of IP<sub>3</sub>R activity is considered to be the main reason behind the upregulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the presence of optimal and suboptimal stimuli and spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals observed in cells expressing mutant PS. In this paper, we employed computational modeling of single IP<sub>3</sub>R channel activity records obtained under optimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and multiple IP<sub>3</sub> concentrations to gain deeper insights into the enhancement of IP<sub>3</sub>R function. We found that in addition to the high occupancy of the high-activity (H) mode and the low occupancy of the low-activity (L) mode, IP<sub>3</sub>R in FAD-causing mutant PS-expressing cells exhibits significantly longer mean life-time for the H mode and shorter life-time for the L mode, leading to shorter mean close-time and hence high open probability of the channel in comparison to IP<sub>3</sub>R in cells expressing wild-type PS. The model is then used to extrapolate the behavior of the channel to a wide range of IP<sub>3</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and quantify the sensitivity of IP<sub>3</sub>R to its two ligands. We show that the gain-of-function enhancement is sensitive to both IP<sub>3</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and that very small amount of IP<sub>3</sub> is required to stimulate IP<sub>3</sub>R channels in the presence of FAD-causing mutant PS to the same level of activity as channels in control cells stimulated by significantly higher IP<sub>3</sub> concentrations. We further demonstrate with simulations that the relatively longer time spent by IP<sub>3</sub>R in the H mode leads to the observed higher frequency of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which can account for the more frequent global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals observed, while the enhanced activity of the channel at extremely low ligand concentrations will lead to spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in cells expressing FAD-causing mutant PS.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling caused by IP<sub>3</sub>R gating dysregulation is implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Spinocerebellar ataxias, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced brain damage. Thus understanding IP<sub>3</sub>R dysfunction is important for the etiology of these diseases. It was previously shown that FAD-causing mutant PS interacts with the IP<sub>3</sub>R, leading to its gain-of-function enhancement in optimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and sub-saturating IP<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Here, we use data-driven modeling to provide deeper insights into the upregulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R gating in a wide range of ligand concentrations and quantify the sensitivity of the channel to its ligands in the presence of mutant PS. Our simulations demonstrate that these changes can alter the statistics of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> events and we speculate that they lead to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling dysregulations at the whole cell level observed in FAD cells. These models will provide the foundation for future data-driven computational framework for local and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that will be used to judiciously isolate the primary pathways causing Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation in FAD from those that are downstream, and to study the effects of upregulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R activity on cell function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that leads to cognitive, memory, and behavioral impairments followed by progressive cell death. The symptoms of AD include the extracellular deposition of amyloid <italic>β</italic> (A<italic>β</italic>) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles—aggregates of microtubule-associated protein <italic>τ</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref001">1</xref>]. According to the amyloid hypothesis, the accumulation of A<italic>β</italic> oligomers or plaques due to the imbalance between synthesis and clearance of A<italic>β</italic> is the driving force for AD pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref002">2</xref>]. However, whether <italic>τ</italic> and A<italic>β</italic> aggregates are the causes or symptoms of AD remains a matter of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>A<italic>β</italic> is produced by the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), an integral membrane protein. APP is cleaved sequentially by <italic>β</italic> and <italic>γ</italic>-secretases to generate A<italic>β</italic> monomers that are released to the extracellular space and form oligomers. The <italic>γ</italic>-secretase complex contains four different proteins including presenilins (PS) that are synthesized and localized in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref001">1</xref>]. Mutations in PS alter the APP processing, thus leading to A<italic>β</italic> oligomarization either through higher production or relatively higher proportion of amyloidogenic A<italic>β</italic> types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref004">4</xref>]. It is well established that mutations in PS and APP are the main causes of Familial AD (FAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref005">5</xref>]. What is not clear is how PS mutations and A<italic>β</italic> accumulation lead to the impairment of brain function and neurodegeneration. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> hypothesis of AD, which is based on the enhanced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during AD, accounts for early memory loss and subsequent cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>There is strong evidence in favor of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal exaggeration by FAD-causing PS mutations as an early phenotype that could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref009">9</xref>]. The exaggerated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are ascribed mainly to the enhanced release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) store due to overloading of ER lumen by up-regulated sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref010">10</xref>]; disruption of ER-membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref011">11</xref>]; or enhanced gating of IP<sub>3</sub>R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>], the ubiquitous ER-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel crucial for the generation and modulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in animal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref016">16</xref>]. Single channel studies in multiple cell lines show that the sensitivity of IP<sub>3</sub>R to its agonist IP<sub>3</sub> increases significantly in the presence of FAD-causing mutant PS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>], leading to a several fold increase in the open probability (<italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>) of IP<sub>3</sub>R channel in subsaturating IP<sub>3</sub>. These studies were performed in the absence of A<italic>β</italic>, suggesting that the modulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R is a major mechanism for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal dysregulation in cells expressing FAD-causing mutant PS. Furthermore, altered IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release has been suggested as the fundamental defect and highly predictive diagnostic feature in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref017">17</xref>]. Suppression of IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was recently shown to restore normal cell function and memory tasks in M146V (FAD-causing PS mutation) knock-in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref018">18</xref>] and triple-transgenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref019">19</xref>] mice models of FAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>IP<sub>3</sub>R gates in three distinct modes: an “L” mode with very low <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, in which brief openings are separated by quiescent periods with long mean closed channel durations (<italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>); an “I” mode with intermediate <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, in which the channel opens and closes rapidly with short <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> and mean open channel durations (<italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub>); and an “H” mode with high <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, in which the channel gates in bursts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref021">21</xref>]. All three modes are observed under all conditions in which the channel gates, and the channel spontaneously switches among all three modes even under constant ligand conditions. The <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of the channel remains remarkably consistent in each gating mode in all ligand conditions so the ligand dependencies of overall channel <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> come from the ligand dependencies of the relative prevalence (normalized occupancy) <italic>π</italic><sup>M</sup> of the gating modes (M can be L, I, and H) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Due to the significant role of IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling dysregulation in AD, a comprehensive understanding of the IP<sub>3</sub>R function is important for both the etiology of the disease and designing effective therapeutic reagents. It was discovered that IP<sub>3</sub>R channels in cells expressing FAD-causing mutant PS exhibit relatively higher <italic>π</italic><sup>H</sup> and lower <italic>π</italic><sup>L</sup> in comparison to IP<sub>3</sub>R in cells expressing wild-type PS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>] in non-optimal ligand conditions. <italic>π</italic><sup>I</sup>, on the other hand, remains largely the same. The switch in the prevalence of H and L modes causes the increase in <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R in the presence of FAD-causing mutant PS.</p>
<p>In this paper, we employ a data-driven modeling approach to gain further insights into the gating behavior of IP<sub>3</sub>R in the presence of wild-type and FAD-causing PS. We focus on the channel gating behaviors of endogenous IP<sub>3</sub>R in the presence of human wild-type (PS1-WT) and FAD-causing mutant (PS1-M146L) PS expressed in the Sf9 cells, an insect cell line derived from the moth Spodoptera frugiperda. Other FAD-causing mutant PS1 (PS1-L116P, PS1-G384A) and PS2 (PS2-N141I) have similar effects on IP<sub>3</sub>R channel gating as PS1-M146L. On the other hand, non-FAD-associated mutant PS1 (PS1-L113P and PS1-G183V), wild-type PS2 and EVER1 (an irrelevant ER transmembrane protein) have little to no effects on IP<sub>3</sub>R channel gating, like PS1-WT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>]. Therefore, the conclusions from studying IP<sub>3</sub>R channel in the presence of PS1-WT (IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub>) and IP<sub>3</sub>R channel in the presence of PS1-M146L (IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub>) can be generalized to other FAD-causing mutations as well. We used the data-driven kinetic model developed to describe <italic>all</italic> observed gating behaviors of the endogenous IP<sub>3</sub>R channels in Sf9 cells: channel <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> distributions in various steady Ca<sup>2+</sup> and IP<sub>3</sub> concentrations (𝓒 and 𝓘, respectively); modal gating behaviors in various steady 𝓒 and 𝓘; and kinetic response of IP<sub>3</sub>R channels to abrupt changes in 𝓘 and/or 𝓒 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref022">22</xref>] as the starting point of our approach. By modifying a minimum number of model parameters, the data-driven model was applied to fit observed gating behaviors: channel <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>, and modal prevalence, in optimal (1 <italic>μ</italic>M) 𝓒 and sub-saturating (100 nM) 𝓘, of the Sf9 IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (used as control) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>] as well as <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub>, and <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> in 33 nM and 10<italic>μ</italic>M 𝓘 at 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M. In addition to elucidating the kinetics and factors contributing to the gain-of-function enhancement of IP<sub>3</sub>R activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>], we extrapolate, using our modified model, the gating behavior of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> for a wide range of 𝓒 and 𝓘. We also quantify and compare the ligand sensitivities of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub>. Simulations of local Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release events based on the results of the data-driven model demonstrate that the gain-of-function enhancement of IP<sub>3</sub>R activity leads to larger, longer, and more frequent local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases events in cells expressing FAD-causing PS mutants. The models derived here will provide the foundation for developing future data-driven computational framework for global intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that will be used to judiciously isolate the primary factors causing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling dysregulation in FAD from those that are downstream, and to study the effects of upregulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R activity on cell functions such as ATP production.</p>

<p>The main experimental data used in this paper for fitting the models were previously published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>]. Basic experimental data (<italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub>, and <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>) at 𝓘 = 33nM, and 10<italic>μ</italic>M for both IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>] were also used to generate our model. The full details of experimental methods are given in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>] and summarized below.</p>
<p>Two Sf9 cell lines expressing recombinant PS1-WT and PS1-M146L, respectively, were generated and maintained as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Nuclei isolated from transfected Sf9 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>] were used for nuclear patch clamp experiments in on-nucleus configuration at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref024">24</xref>]. All experimental solutions contained 140 mM KCl and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3). Bath solution contained 90 nM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (buffered by 0.5 mM BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid). Pipette solution contained 1 <italic>μ</italic>M free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (buffered by 0.5 mM 5, 5′-dibromo-BAPTA), 0.5 mM Na<sub>2ATP</sub> and sub-saturating 100 nM IP<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>Segments of current records exhibiting current levels for a single IP<sub>3</sub>R channel were idealized with QuB software (University of Buffalo) using SKM algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref026">26</xref>]. The idealized current traces were further analyzed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref021">21</xref>] to characterized the modal gating behaviors of IP<sub>3</sub>R channels. Short closing events, presumably caused by ligand-independent transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref027">27</xref>], were removed by burst analysis. Gating modes were assigned according to durations of channel burst (T<sub><italic>b</italic></sub>) and burst-terminating gaps (T<sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref021">21</xref>], using a critical T<sub><italic>b</italic></sub> of 100 ms and a critical T<sub><italic>g</italic></sub> of 200 ms to detect modal transitions.</p>

Although the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g001">Fig 1</xref> seems to suggest simultaneous binding/unbinding of multiple ligands as the channel goes from one state to another (for instance <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004529.e001"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004529.e001g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004529.e001"/><mml:math id="M1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>00</mml:mn><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> to <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004529.e002"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004529.e002g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004529.e002"/><mml:math id="M2" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>20</mml:mn><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, or <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004529.e003"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004529.e003g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004529.e003"/><mml:math id="M3" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext><mml:mn>24</mml:mn><mml:mi>H</mml:mi> </mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> to <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004529.e004"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004529.e004g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004529.e004"/><mml:math id="M4" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>20</mml:mn><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>), in reality, there is no such direct transition in our model. Each one of such transitions actually involves one or more intermediate states that are not explicitly shown in order to keep the scheme simple. As discussed in detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref022">22</xref>], the simplifying approximations were made by considering the fact that the intermediate states have relatively low occupancy and therefore can be aggregated into the main states. The rates for the composite transitions between those main states explicitly shown in the scheme were actually derived with the intermediate low-occupancy states carefully taken into consideration.</p>

<p>To simulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs and blips (local Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events from the ER due to nearly simultaneous opening of multiple channels and a single channel, respectively, in a cluster of several IP<sub>3</sub>R channels), we followed a procedure developed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref028">28</xref>] and consider a cluster of ten IP<sub>3</sub>R channels arranged in a two dimensional array with an inter-channel spacing of 120 <italic>nm</italic>. The gating of each channel is given by the twelve-state model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration on the cytoplasmic side of the cluster is controlled by diffusion; the flux coming out from the ER through IP<sub>3</sub>R channels, <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>; and the concentration of free dye, <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>.

<p>To derive the probability flux parameters used in the transition rates between different gating states (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t002">Table 2</xref>), we fit the model to idealized current traces recording openings and closings of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> by minimizing the likelihood score <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e034">Eq (6)</xref> of the data.

<title>Flux parameters used in the model.</title>
<p><italic>j</italic><sub><italic>ijmn</italic></sub> represent a flux parameter between a state with <italic>i</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and <italic>j</italic> IP<sub>3</sub> molecules and a state with <italic>m</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and <italic>n</italic> IP<sub>3</sub> molecules bound. Superscripts are used to distinguish between different flux parameters that connect different pairs of states that have the same numbers of ligands bound. For example, in both transitions <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004529.e147"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004529.e147g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004529.e147"/><mml:math id="M147" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>24</mml:mn> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup> <mml:mo>⇌</mml:mo> <mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>24</mml:mn> <mml:mtext>I</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004529.e148"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004529.e148g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004529.e148"/><mml:math id="M148" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>24</mml:mn> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup> <mml:mo>⇌</mml:mo> <mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>24</mml:mn> <mml:mtext>H</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, the channel is bound to the same number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and IP<sub>3</sub>. However, the two transitions have different flux parameters because the channel is in different gating modes.

<p>The mean gating properties of the channel as a function of 𝓒 at different 𝓘 values are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Theoretical values of the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, solid lines) and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, dashed lines) were generated by using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e029">Eq (2)</xref> and the occupancy parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t001">Table 1</xref>. The <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> at 𝓘 = 33nM (turquoise dashed line and turquoise circle) and 100nM (blue dashed line and blue circle) are significantly larger than <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> at 𝓘 = 100nM (solid blue line and blue square). In fact, the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> at 𝓘 = 33nM is comparable to <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (magenta square and solid line) or IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>noPS1</sub> (magenta triangles from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref023">23</xref>]) at saturating 𝓘 = 10<italic>μ</italic>M. The <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> data for IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>noPS1</sub> at saturating 𝓘 = 10<italic>μ</italic>M is shown for comparison to emphasize that IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> is already maximally activated at a significantly lower 𝓘 of 100nM. This clearly indicates that IP<sub>3</sub>R in the presence of FAD-causing mutant PS is highly sensitized to activation by IP<sub>3</sub>, and is maximally activated at significantly lower 𝓘 than IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> or IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>noPS1</sub>. For 𝓒 &gt; 800nM, <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> at 𝓘 = 10<italic>μ</italic>M (magenta dashed line and magenta circle) is higher than that of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>noPS1</sub> or IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> at the corresponding 𝓘 and 𝓒, mostly due to the higher saturating <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (0.86 ± 0.03) as compared to those of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>noPS1</sub> (0.72 ± 0.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref023">23</xref>] and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (0.72 ± 0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>]. A close examination of <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) and <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) reveals that the increase in <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> is mostly due to the substantial shortening of <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> with relatively modest increase in <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub>. Theoretical values of <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> were calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e035">Eq (7)</xref> and the parameters in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t003">3</xref>. Gating properties (<italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub>, and <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>) of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>noPS1</sub> in 𝓘 = 100nM and 10<italic>μ</italic>M observed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref023">23</xref>] (triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>) are similar to theoretical values calculated for IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub>, since IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> gating is generally similar to that of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>noPS1</sub>, as observed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>], albeit with some noticeable differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>). The open triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref> representing data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref023">23</xref>] of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>noPS1</sub> in wild type Sf9 cells is shown here to demonstrate that the model for IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> can replicate reasonably well the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub>, and <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R channel gating in the absence of PS1.</p>
<p>Next, we calculated with our modified data-driven model the prevalence of the three gating modes using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e030">Eq (3)</xref> and occupancy parameters given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t001">Table 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Both experimental (symbols) and theoretical (lines) results show a significant increase in <italic>π</italic><sup>H</sup> (green), and decrease in <italic>π</italic><sup>L</sup> (red) for IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (dashed lines and circles) as compared to IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (solid lines and squares) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) at 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M and 𝓘 = 100 nM. <italic>π</italic><sup>I</sup> (orange), on the other hand, remains largely unchanged. Comparison with the prevalence data from IP<sub>3</sub>R in untransfected Sf9 cells at saturating 𝓘 = 10<italic>μ</italic>M (triangles) from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref021">21</xref>] confirms the saturating activation of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> at relatively low 𝓘. The mean life-times of the three gating modes follow a similar trend as seen in their prevalences. <italic>τ</italic><sup>H</sup> is longer, <italic>τ</italic><sup>L</sup> is shorter, while <italic>τ</italic><sup>I</sup> remains unchanged for IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> as compared to IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). The theoretical modal mean life-times were calculated from our modified model by using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e037">Eq (9)</xref> and parameters in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t003">3</xref>.</p>
<p>The open and closed dwell-time distributions were calculated from the model as described in the Dwell-Time Distributions section Eqs (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e045">14</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e046">15</xref>) using occupancy and flux parameters in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t003">3</xref> respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g004">Fig 4</xref>, the model (red lines) fits the observed dwell-time distributions (gray bars) very well. Consistent with the <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub> observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), there is a minor right-shift in the open dwell-time distribution of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) as compared to IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Thus, PS1-M146L does not have significant effect on <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub> of the IP<sub>3</sub>R channel. The close dwell-time distribution of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), on the other hand, shows significant shift to the left when compared to IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), leading to the shorter <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> and therefore the higher <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> observed.</p>

<p>The Dwell-Time Distributions section also describes the derivation of the open and closed dwell-time distributions in H and I modes from the model. The dwell-time distributions from the model for 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M and 𝓘 = 100nM in the H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g005">Fig 5A–5D</xref>) and I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g005">Fig 5E–5H</xref>) modes calculated by using Eqs (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e049">18</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e050">19</xref>) and parameters in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t003">3</xref> are given by red lines. The experimental data are presented by the gray bars for comparison. A close inspection of the modal open and closed dwell-time distributions of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> provides useful insight into the modal behavior of the channel. In line with the over-all open dwell-time distribution, the open dwell-time distributions in the H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g005">Fig 5A, 5C</xref>) and I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g005">Fig 5E, 5F</xref>) modes do not change significantly. The closed dwell-time distributions in the two modes in IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g005">Fig 5D, 5H</xref>) on the other hand, shift significantly to the left as compared to IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g005">Fig 5B, 5G</xref>). Furthermore, the shift in the closed dwell-time distribution in the H mode is more significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g005">Fig 5B, 5D</xref>). This suggests that the relatively shorter time spent by IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> in the H mode’s closed state plays a major role in the shortening of <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> and hence enhancement of <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of the channel in the presence of FAD-causing mutation as compared to wild-type PS1.</p>

<p>To gain further insights and quantify the extent of IP<sub>3</sub>R sensitization due to PS1-M146L, we extrapolate the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>, and the mean modal properties of IP<sub>3</sub>R at different values of 𝓒 and 𝓘 from our model using parameters tabulated in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004529.t003">3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6A</xref> shows <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (black solid lines) and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (blue dashed lines) as a function of 𝓒 at different 𝓘, calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e029">Eq (2)</xref>. Even at 𝓘 = 8nM, <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> is already higher than that of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> at 𝓘 = 100nM (thick solid black line) for all 𝓒. Thus, whereas IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> in 8 nM IP<sub>3</sub> are minimally active (<italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> ∼ 0.005) in resting 𝓒 (∼ 70 nM), IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> under the same ligand conditions can have sufficient activity (<italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> &gt; 0.04) to initiate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.</p>

<p>The <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> of the channels from simulation <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e035">Eq (7)</xref> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6B</xref> correlate well with the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> values (notice that at fixed 𝓘, <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> decreases as <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> increases and vice versa). This close correlation between the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> is the consequence of the lack of dependence of the <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub> on 𝓘 (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e035">Eq (7)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Thus for 𝓘 &gt; 8 nM, <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (blue dashed lines) is shorter than that of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> at 𝓘 = 100nM (black solid line) for all physiological 𝓒 values. Whereas the strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> between 𝓒 = 0.01 and 0.5 <italic>μ</italic>M remains the same as 𝓘 is raised from 16 to 100 nM, channel <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> for higher 𝓒 does increase as 𝓘 increases from 16 nM to 1 <italic>μ</italic>M, confirming the higher saturating <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and is in line with observations (Table S1 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>]).</p>
<p>To quantitatively compare the sensitivity of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> to activation by IP3, we plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6C</xref> the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> as a function of 𝓘 at fixed 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M (black line) and the experimentally observed <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> at 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M and 𝓘 = 100 nM (black square). The plot reveals that <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> at 𝓘 = 8 nM already exceeds that of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> at 𝓘 = 100 nM (see black dotted lines).

Correspondingly, <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) becomes shorter than the observed <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (red square) at 𝓘 = 100nM as 𝓘 is raised beyond 8nM.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, we show the ratio of simulated <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> to that of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> as a function of 𝓘 at 𝓒 = 70nM, 100nM, 250nM, 500nM, 1<italic>μ</italic>M, and 2<italic>μ</italic>M. For 𝓘 &lt; 200nM, IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> is more than twice as active as IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> for all 𝓘 and 𝓒 values. For physiological resting 𝓒 = 70nM, IP<sub>3</sub>R channel activity is enhanced by 265% in cells expressing PS1-M146L relative to that in PS1-WT expressing cells. For optimal 𝓒, IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> exhibits a gain-of-function enhancement by over 100 folds as compared to IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub>, with maximum enhancement occurring around 𝓘 = 7–8 nM IP<sub>3</sub>. The drop in the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> ratio for 𝓘 &gt; 8nM is due to the fact that <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> peaks much faster than IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> as a function of 𝓘.</p>
<p>At fixed 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M, the theoretical <italic>π</italic><sup>L</sup> <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e030">Eq (3)</xref> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> decreases for 2nM &lt; 𝓘 &lt; 100nM and plateaus outside this window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, dashed red line). <italic>π</italic><sup>H</sup> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (dashed green line) changes in the opposite direction for 2nM &lt; 𝓘 &lt; 100nM. <italic>π</italic><sup>I</sup> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (dashed orange line), on the other hand, remains largely constant. Around 𝓘 = 8 nM, both the <italic>π</italic><sup>L</sup> and <italic>π</italic><sup>H</sup> curves of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> crosses the observed <italic>π</italic><sup>L</sup> (red square) and <italic>π</italic><sup>H</sup> (green square) levels, respectively, of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> measured at 𝓘 = 100nM and 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M. <italic>π</italic><sup>I</sup> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> gets close to but does not exceed that of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> observed at 𝓘 = 100nM and 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M (orange square). This indicates that the increase in <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R in the presence of PS1-M146L is mainly due the switching of the channel from L to H mode. Interestingly, the 𝓘 value (∼ 10nM) where <italic>π</italic><sup>L</sup> and <italic>π</italic><sup>H</sup> cross each other is almost the same as where <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> reaches half (0.41) of its peak value (0.82) (see black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This is in line with the observations that mode switching is the major mechanism of ligand regulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref021">21</xref>]. Our results confirm that the mechanism of ligand regulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R is mainly due to the switching of the channel between L and H modes with minimal contributions from I mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref021">21</xref>]. Furthermore, switching of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> from L to H mode in comparison to IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> translates into the gain-of-function enhancement of IP<sub>3</sub>R gating. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6E</xref> also shows how theoretical values of the prevalences of the three gating modes for IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> vary with 𝓘 at 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M (solid lines).</p>
<p>Theoretical values of the mean life-times of I (orange) and H (green) mode calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004529.e037">Eq (9)</xref> at 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M remain largely unchanged for all values of 𝓘 &gt; 3nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). In that range of 𝓘, <italic>τ</italic><sup>H</sup> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (dashed green line) is shorter than <italic>τ</italic><sup>H</sup> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (solid green line), while <italic>τ</italic><sup>I</sup> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (dashed orange line) remains almost the same as <italic>τ</italic><sup>I</sup> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (solid orange line). For 𝓘 &lt; 4nM, <italic>τ</italic><sup>I</sup> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> drops below the observed value for IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> at 𝓘 = 100nM. Simulated <italic>τ</italic><sup>L</sup> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (dashed red line), on the other hand, decreases significantly as 𝓘 increases. As 𝓘 increases beyond 15 nM, simulated <italic>τ</italic><sup>L</sup> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> becomes shorter than that of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> measured at 𝓘 = 100nM (red square). Relatively speaking, this does not correlate very closely with the 𝓘 = 8nM where the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> crosses the observed <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) when compared to the prevalences where this critical value of 𝓘 is 8nM. Nevertheless, the shorter <italic>τ</italic><sup>L</sup> will increase the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub>. Thus the shorter <italic>τ</italic><sup>L</sup> and longer <italic>τ</italic><sup>H</sup> contribute to its increased sensitivity to IP<sub>3</sub> as compared to IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub>.</p>
<p>To investigate how the remodeling of single IP<sub>3</sub>R channel gating kinetics in the presence of mutant PS1-M146L affects the dynamics of IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events, we simulated such events at a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release site consisting of a cluster of ten IP<sub>3</sub>Rs as described in the Methods Section. 400 s-long records of Ca<sup>2+</sup> blips and puffs (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release events involving just one, or multiple IP<sub>3</sub>R channels in the cluster, respectively) from the IP<sub>3</sub>R cluster were generated, and statistics about these Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release events were derived as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref028">28</xref>]. In line with observations reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref012">12</xref>], the site produces significantly potentiated puffs in the presence of FAD-causing PS1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g007">Fig 7</xref>, the behavior of puffs and blips arising from a cluster of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> (dashed lines with circles) is significantly different from that of a IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> cluster (solid line with squares). Puffs from a IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> cluster have significantly larger amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), longer life times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), and take longer to terminate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Furthermore, puff frequency in cells expressing PS1-M146L is significantly higher than that in PS1-WT-expressing cells (10.33/sec versus 1.83/sec) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Interestingly, the statistics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> blips are very similar in both case. Although the life times of blips in PS1-M146L-expressing cells is slightly longer than that in PS1-WT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g007">Fig 7E</xref>), frequencies of the blips are almost the same (10.67/sec versus 9.99/sec) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). Thus the higher number of single-channel events caused by higher sensitivity of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> to activation by IP<sub>3</sub> translates into triggering more frequent and longer puffs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Accumulation of A<italic>β</italic> aggregates and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of <italic>τ</italic> protein are the main symptoms of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref001">1</xref>]. However, most drugs focused on restricting A<italic>β</italic> production and accumulation or enhancing its clearance from the brain have yielded disappointing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref036">36</xref>]. This could be due to the fact that these drugs target the late stage features of the disease, i.e. plaque formation—whereas there is poor correlation between A<italic>β</italic> deposits and the progressive memory loss and cognitive decline observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref037">37</xref>]. Compelling evidence suggests that FAD-causing mutant PS disrupt intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling before A<italic>β</italic> deposition, pointing towards the up-regulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as a proximal event that could be involved in disease pathogenesis. Previously, we showed that FAD-causing mutant PS interact with ER-localized IP<sub>3</sub>Rs, leading to their gain-of-function enhanced channel activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>]. However, further analysis is needed to elucidate the modified gating properties leading to the gain-of-function enhancement of IP<sub>3</sub>R channel activity and to quantify their sensitization due to FAD-causing PS mutations.</p>
<p>Our modeling results show that there is a significant increase in the H mode prevalence, and a corresponding significant reduction in the L mode prevalence of IP<sub>3</sub>R channels in the presence of PS1-M146L. This change in the prevalence of L and H modes arises mainly from the shorter mean life-time of the L mode and longer mean-life-time of the H mode. On the other hand, both the life-time and prevalence of I mode remain constant. Our model predicts that the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> saturates at significantly lower IP<sub>3</sub> concentrations and its peak value is higher compared to that of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub>. Furthermore, our model predicts that the channel’s gain-of-function enhancement is sensitive to both IP<sub>3</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Interestingly, our model predicts that the higher <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> as compared to IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> is mainly due to the lower occupancy of <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004529.e173"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004529.e173g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004529.e173"/><mml:math id="M173" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>32</mml:mn> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> state and higher occupancy of the <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004529.e174"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004529.e174g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004529.e174"/><mml:math id="M174" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>24</mml:mn> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> state (with small change in the occupancies of <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004529.e175"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004529.e175g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004529.e175"/><mml:math id="M175" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>24</mml:mn> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004529.e176"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004529.e176g" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004529.e176"/><mml:math id="M176" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mtext> <mml:mn>14</mml:mn> <mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>). This means that PS1-M146L interacts with IP<sub>3</sub>R in such a way that the closed configuration of the channel with 3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and 2 IP<sub>3</sub> bound is less likely and the open configuration in the H mode with 2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and 4 IP<sub>3</sub> molecules bound more easily attainable.

<p>Our goal in this study was to use all the data at our disposal to model the gating kinetics of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub>; and use resulting models to simulate the behavior of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> in a wide range of ligand concentrations to gain a better understanding of how the gain-of-function enhancement of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> alters the characteristics of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events at IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters.</p>
<p>Because of the considerable technical difficulties in obtaining single-channel current records of IP<sub>3</sub>R channels in their native membrane milieu by nuclear patch clamp electrophysiology, the most comprehensive set of such single-channel data (including steady-state gating records over a broad range of combinations of cytoplasmic IP<sub>3</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref023">23</xref>], long gating records in multiple constant ligand conditions suitable for modal gating analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref021">21</xref>], records of response kinetics of IP<sub>3</sub>R channel to rapid changes in cytoplasmic ligand conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref038">38</xref>]) was obtained in the study of the endogenous IP<sub>3</sub>R from insect Sf9 cells. This set of data was used to develop the twelve-state kinetic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref022">22</xref>] that provides the basis of the models we develop here to simulate the behavior of the endogenous Sf9 IP<sub>3</sub>R in the presence of exogenous recombinant human PS1 (WT and mutant). Until a comparable or more comprehensive set of single-channel data for a mammalian IP<sub>3</sub>R becomes available, our approach is the best that can be achieved to simulate gating behaviors of IP<sub>3</sub>R interacting with WT and mutant PS1. Although Sf9 IP<sub>3</sub>R does not interact with human PS1 in its natural environment, the study in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>] showed that endogenous IP<sub>3</sub>R in human lymphoblasts in presence of PS1-M146L exhibits very similar changes in its gating characteristics (increase in <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>o</sub> with corresponding reduction in <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>) and modal gating behavior (rise in <italic>π</italic><sup>H</sup> with simultaneous drop in <italic>π</italic><sup>L</sup>) when compared to IP<sub>3</sub>R in the presence of PS1-WT. Therefore, we have reason to be confident that simulation results from our modeling effort do reflect the gating behaviors of IP<sub>3</sub>R naturally interacting with WT and mutant PS1, and that the insights our effort provides about the effects of mutant PS1 on IP<sub>3</sub>R single-channel gating and local intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events can improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of FAD.</p>
<p>The higher prevalence and longer life-time of H mode and shorter life-time of L mode for IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> may have important implications for cell physiology. Since the open time in the H mode is significantly higher than that in the L mode, in which the channel has near-zero mean open time, IP<sub>3</sub>R gating in the H mode will have higher probability of activating neighboring channels through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced-Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR), thus leading to higher frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). The higher sensitivity of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> to activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and IP<sub>3</sub> also increases the number of open channels in an IP<sub>3</sub>R channel cluster during a puff, leading to bigger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004529.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) puffs, which in turn will cause more frequent global Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and oscillations at the cellular level, in line with observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref012">12</xref>]. The higher prevalence of IP<sub>3</sub>R channel being in the H mode resulting in the higher probability of inducing global Ca<sup>2+</sup> events can account for the higher frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in B lymphoblasts from FAD patients and DT40 cells expressing FAD-causing mutant PS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Our model reveals that even at resting level of 𝓘 (8 nM), IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1M146L</sub> exhibits significant <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of 0.35 (40% of the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> when the channel is in saturating 𝓘) at 𝓒 = 1<italic>μ</italic>M whereas the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>PS1WT</sub> in the same ligand condition is negligible. This will lead to stronger CICR among channels in the same cluster and between IP<sub>3</sub>R channel clusters, thereby generating more global spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in cells expressing FAD-causing mutant PS as observed experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>To conclude, our study provides insights into the gating modulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R that leads to the gain-of-function enhancement due to FAD-causing mutations in PS. Furthermore, significant activity exhibited by IP<sub>3</sub>R at resting IP<sub>3</sub> concentration in cells expressing FAD-causing mutant can explain the spontaneous global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals observed in those cells. The models developed here for single-channel IP<sub>3</sub>R channel gating and local Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release events can provide part of the foundation for building whole-cell models to judiciously separate the key pathways leading to the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling dysregulation in AD from those that are by-products due to the CICR nature of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. For example, what are the relative contributions of gain-of-function enhancement and over-expression of ryanodine receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref020">20</xref>] to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling dysregulation in AD? Does the down-regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers such as calbindin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref041">41</xref>] and higher resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004529.ref042">42</xref>] play a role (through CICR mechanism) in the exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals? What are the conditions or factors that would reverse the exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling back to normal state? These and many other interesting questions are the focus of our future research and the models developed here will play a key role in addressing them.</p>
