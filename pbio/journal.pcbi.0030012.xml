The unprecedented completeness, accuracy, and volume of genomic and molecular data necessitate a new kind of computational biology for translational research. Key challenges are standardization of data capture and communication, organization of easily accessible repositories, and algorithms for integrated analysis based on heterogeneous sources of information. Also required are new ways of using complementary clinical and biological data, such as computational methods for predicting disease phenotype from molecular and genetic profiling. New combined experimental and computational methods hold the promise of more accurate diagnosis and prognosis as well as more effective prevention and therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the last two decades, our knowledge of cancer and its causes has increased greatly. However, we still have few examples of cures. This underscores the need for a clearer understanding of the alterations in the biological circuitry that lead to tumor development and growth. Sequencing of the human genome and biotechnological advances have led to the generation of large volumes of genome-scale data. Combining this genome-scale molecular data with clinical information provides new opportunities to discover how perturbations in biological processes lead to disease. This knowledge can be used to improve disease diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and therapy. However, the large scale and diversity of both experimental and clinical data necessitate that they be well-organized and computationally accessible to research scientists for analysis and interpretation. This review focuses on the challenges and opportunities to combine clinical and genome-scale molecular data, using computational approaches, to better understand cancer biology and to translate this knowledge into improved disease prevention and therapy.</p><sec id="s1a"><title/><sec id="s1a1"><title>Translational cancer research to improve disease prevention and therapy.</title><p>Cancer is a complex disease, involving multiple and specific changes at the DNA level that can be inherited or induced by environmental factors. There are many different types and subtypes of cancer marked by specific sets of molecular changes. Most of our current cancer treatment efforts are focused on surgery for a curative treatment and radiation and/or toxic drugs (chemotherapy) to induce remissions. Candidates for successful cancer therapy with surgery are few, and radiation and chemotherapy suffer from lack of target specificity, leading to serious side effects. Identifying cancer-specific molecular changes and discovering how they can be used to increase therapeutic specificity will lead to higher success rates and fewer side effects.</p><p>Translational cancer research seeks to identify and understand the cause and effect of cancer-specific molecular defects and to translate this “bench” knowledge to the clinic to improve disease prevention and therapy. Examples of research questions include, from a clinical perspective: what are the molecular subtypes of cancer? What reliable molecular markers are available for early cancer detection (diagnostic) and for predicting the course of disease (prognostic)? How do we find better drugs and optimize therapy (development of more specific drugs with lower toxicity) to suit an individual patient's molecular profile? From a molecular biology perspective: can we accurately predict vulnerable point(s) in molecular pathways that are potential therapeutic targets? What specific drug or drug combination can target these vulnerable points in the pathway? Can genotype and pathway information be combined to predict the effect of a mutation on disease or therapy?</p><p>Advances in our understanding of cancer-specific molecular defects have led to improved cancer treatments. For example, the protein kinase inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec) was designed to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) based on knowledge of the causative molecular defect—translocation and dys-regulated BCR–ABL kinase. Protein kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) are showing therapeutic promise by targeting known molecular abnormalities of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Similarly, antibody therapies such as Rituximab (Rituxan), an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody for non-Hodgkin lymphoma; Cetuximab (Erbitux), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-binding antibody for colorectal and head and neck cancer; Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody that allows targeted therapy in HER2 positive breast cancer; and Bevacizumab (Avastin), a recombinant humanized antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for metastatic colorectal cancer are promising.</p><p>While these treatments based on molecular knowledge of the cancer show promise, major challenges remain. For instance, development of compensatory mutations induces resistance to Gleevec and limits its use, while humanization and effective delivery of antibodies is difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b001">1</xref>]. Furthermore, the discovery and development of a new and effective drug can cost US$0.8–US$1.7 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b002">2</xref>]. A new drug entering Phase I testing, where the drug is initially introduced to human subjects, is estimated to have only an 8% chance of reaching the market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b002">2</xref>]. Failures can largely be attributed to poor target selection or poor candidate drug selection, leading to low drug effectiveness or toxicity. Development of safe and effective therapies, such as small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, at a reduced cost, requires better understanding of therapeutic interaction of the inhibitor with a range of targets and their effect on diverse cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b003">3</xref>].</p><p>Cancer cells can now be profiled on a genome scale using new experimental techniques. We thus have an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively study cancer-specific molecular processes. This study requires computational tools to handle the large volume and diversity of available information. Collection, standard organization, aggregation, storage, integration, and analysis of diverse genome-scale molecular data along with patient data collected in the clinic will broaden our understanding of how cancer-specific molecular defects affect clinical outcome and will lead to improved disease prevention and therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030012-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030012-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030012.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Data Integration for Translational Cancer Research</title><p>Archival of clinical and molecular data in easily retrievable standardized formats, aggregation, integration, and data analysis will provide opportunities for the next-generation biomedical discoveries that can impact cancer research and treatment.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030012.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s2a"><title>Genome-Scale Molecular Data for Cancer Research</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Genomic variation.</title><p>Cancer is a genetic disease involving point mutations, translocations, segmental amplifications, and deletions in the genome that alter specific vulnerable molecular points in cellular regulatory pathways. Analysis of chromosomal changes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-based cytogenetic approaches including comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), spectral karyotyping (SKY), and multiplex-FISH (M-FISH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b004">4</xref>] have led to the characterization of many cancer-associated chromosomal abnormalities. Microarray techniques, e.g., array-CGH or matrix-CGH, have become available to map regions of DNA sequence from the cancer tissue that are amplified or reduced compared to normal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b005">5</xref>]. Array-based technologies also allow genome-wide measurement of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b006">6</xref>]. The international HapMap project has identified millions of SNPs in different populations. The data has been processed into haplotypes, sets of co-occurring SNPs, and tag SNPs (SNPs that distinguish a set of common haplotypes) that can be used to reduce the complexity of gene association studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hapmap.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.hapmap.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA silencing are involved in regulating many cellular processes, including development, via gene silencing (chromatin structure and transcription regulation) and genetic imprinting. Specific DNA methylation alterations have been identified in various neoplasms.

A software pipeline was developed to parse gene expression data, raw or log-transformed, from native formats into numeric matrices of reporter rows and sample columns excluding study-specific normalization. Comprehensive mapping of probe identifiers (IDs) from oligonucleotide arrays or IMAGE clone IDs from cDNA arrays to a common Unigene build, Genbank accession numbers, and other commonly used database identifiers that link to gene annotation was also critical. Samples were renamed and reassigned using NCI nomenclature for consistency across studies. Lack of adherence of the individual datasets to any common standards, such as MIAME, complicated the data aggregation process. Another major hurdle was the complexity and non-uniformity of sample description information. For example, diverse representations of clinical sample description make it difficult to compare histological data, such as Gleason score for prostate tumors or Estrogen receptor status for breast carcinomas. This problem was addressed by mapping to a common data format using parameter/value pairs. Finally, each study was independently normalized and archived in a relational database. A large amount of software engineering work was required to deal with the structure and large size of gene expression data and provide a robust query and analysis tool.</p><p>Software platforms such as Oncomine are important for discovery and algorithm development.

Integration of heterogeneous data is useful not only to validate and to improve confidence in experimental results but also to develop more complete models of biological systems. For instance, real time quantitative RT–PCR data are routinely used to validate cDNA array experiment results. Integration of gene expression and proteomics data, for example, could be used to identify post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications. It could also provide insights into the advantages and shortcomings of particular experimental methods.</p><p>The integration of diverse experimental data to build models of biological processes, or pathways, will boost our ability to identify clinical markers and therapeutic targets and to interpret genotype information. For instance, a marker such as prostate specific antigen (PSA) may be widely known and used clinically without much knowledge about its biology. Knowing the pathway involving the marker gene allows other pathway components, or the entire pathway, to serve as a more specialized marker.</p><p>Clinical data, securely and ethically accessed, can be integrated with molecular data from basic research to gain insight into disease state and lead to better treatments. Molecular and clinical data has been integrated for identification of clinically relevant subtypes of leukemia with 100% sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b054">54</xref>]. Analysis of molecular profiles on biospecimens from patients before, during, and after therapy can lead to identification of drug-responsive or nonresponsive profiles that could be used to optimize choice of therapy. In the case of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a significant difference in response to the kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) was observed for patients with mutations or amplifications in the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b056">56</xref>]. Comparison of patient molecular profiles with poor and favorable outcomes can be used to predict disease outcome (prognosis). For example, in breast cancer patients, the estrogen-receptor status of the primary tumor and other clinical features have been used to construct nomograms that predict the likelihood of developing non-sentinel lymph node (non-SLN) metastases. Such information can be used to assess metastatic risk and the need for complete axillary lymph node dissection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b057">57</xref>]. Additionally, a 32-gene expression signature distinguished p53-mutant and wild-type breast tumors of different histologies, and this strategy outperformed sequence-based assessments of p53 in predicting prognosis and therapeutic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b058">58</xref>]. Combination of molecular profiles with clinical profiles can also help select patients for targeted treatment.</p><p>Effective integration of heterogeneous data is difficult since important information necessary to decipher data semantics, such as context, could be missing. It is often possible for the human brain to infer this information using prior knowledge, but such tasks have remained impossible to encode into a model or rule-based computational procedure. Thus, missing information can lead to errors during integration. For example, a query may identify relevant datasets labeled with the term <italic>metastasis</italic>. However, metastatic processes could be different among tissues, so tissue information is required to avoid errors in dataset selection. Also, datasets labeled with alternate descriptions of metastasis may be missed in the search. As another example, proper mapping of genes and proteins between microarray and mass spectrometry data is an important requirement for integrating the datasets. This task could be confounded if the measured gene transcript is a different splice variant than the measured protein product. Thus, correct data integration requires semantic compatibility among datasets and context resolution.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pcbi-0030012-box002">Box 2</xref> we present two successful examples of how integration of heterogeneous data from different sources can help in biological discoveries.

In the other example, the discovery of the central role of micropthalmia-associated transcription factor <italic>(MITF)</italic> amplification to malignant melanoma was accomplished using experimental and computational approaches to integrate copy number data, with publicly available gene expression and genome information. These examples provide proof of principle that there already exists a wealth of biological data in the public domain, and data integration approaches can be used to better understand biology and development of disease, including cancer.</p></sec><sec><title/><boxed-text id="pcbi-0030012-box002" position="float"><sec id="sb2"><title>Box 2.

However, clinical and biochemical data suggest that a mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder is involved. From a genome-wide association study that mapped LSFC to Chromosome 2p16–21, Mootha et al. collected 15 known and 15 predicted genes using the UCSC genome browser. Microarray databases from the Whitehead, RIKEN array database and the Genomics Institute of the Novartis research foundation were then used to identify genes that coexpressed with known mitochondrial genes. <italic>LRPPRC,</italic> which mapped to the LSFC candidate genomic region, showed the highest correlated gene expression with known mitochondrial genes. <italic>LRPPRC</italic> was also found in a list of mitochondrial-associated proteins identified by mass spectrometry.

Thus, data integration overcame the incomplete coverage, low sensitivity, or specificity limitations of the individual experimental approaches.</p></sec><sec id="sb2b"><title><italic>MITF</italic> in malignant melanoma.</title><p>Garraway et al. used an integrative approach to identify <italic>MITF</italic> as a “lineage survival” or “lineage addiction” oncogene required for development and maintenance of malignant melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b077">77</xref>]. The authors used the NCI60 panel, which is a collection of 59 human cancer cell lines derived from nine different types of tissues. SNP arrays of NCI60 cell lines were used to define genomic subclusters that were specifically amplified in the melanoma subset. This information was then integrated with the publicly available NCI60 gene expression data generated by the genomics institute of the Novartis foundation to correlate gene expression with the copy number gain. Remarkably, <italic>MITF</italic> was the only highly expressed gene in the amplicon identified in the SNP array analysis. This result was validated using FISH and automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) of MITF protein levels in patient samples. As before, public availability of gene expression data was instrumental for the authors to integrate expression data with their own SNP data in defining the function of a gene in the context of cancer.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec id="s3a3"><title>Software systems and algorithms for data analysis.</title><p>The volume of the data generated by modern biomedical studies is too large to be processed by the human brain alone. Data storage, querying, and presentation software systems and computational algorithms are required for effective interpretation of large-scale experimental data. Automated methods are now available to find genes or pathways that are significantly differentially expressed using molecular profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b063">63</xref>]. The GOALIE algorithm maps the temporal evolution of biological processes from time-course gene expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b064">64</xref>]. An algorithm for general integration of heterogeneous data that differ in type and size has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b065">65</xref>]. Further studies of pathways in the context of gene expression and complementary genome-scale data will lead to the discovery of new pathway components, some of which could be new vulnerable points and therapeutic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b066">66</xref>].</p><p>Pathway simulations, requiring detailed cellular models, have been used in model organisms, such as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> and budding yeast, to find pathway regulators and to design new experiments that test hypotheses about the function of the pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030012-b067">67</xref>]. Applying these methods to predict the result of a tumor-specific mutation in multicellular organisms using human pathway information is an important research direction and major challenge for computational biology.</p><p>Development of software systems that integrate diverse biomedical research data types promise to support the study of disease biology and development. For instance, the REMBRANDT (Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data) framework attempts to integrate clinical and molecular data from the Glioma Molecular Diagnostic Initiative (GMDI)—a collaborative effort of the NCI and the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rembrandt.nci.nih.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://rembrandt.nci.nih.gov</ext-link>). REMBRANDT can be used to query and generate statistical reports across all component glioma (brain tumor) datasets.</p><p>Computational prediction of the biological effects of drugs based on structure–function relationships across many targets can help increase the success rate of clinical trials and may forewarn of possible adverse events associated with the small-molecule therapy. This strategy could also be used to develop drug combinations to target multiple vulnerable points to shut down tumor growth. ADME/Tox (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) prediction based on molecular profiles can help eliminate candidate drugs that have unacceptable toxicity early in the drug discovery process and thus reduce the cost of drug development.</p></sec><sec id="s3a4"><title>Social challenges for computational approaches.</title><p>Aggregating, integrating, and analyzing experimental data from multiple sources must overcome social as well as technical challenges. Critically, while archives of datasets from molecular studies are often publicly available, a public clinical counterpart remains largely unavailable due to patient privacy concerns. Securely providing de-identified patient data obtained with adequate patient consent, for example, as per the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa" xlink:type="simple">http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa</ext-link>), is a viable solution.</p><p>Data collected from biological samples must be clearly annotated using standard representations, including descriptions of the sample and experimental conditions. Without such information data integration is significantly more difficult, inefficient, and error-prone. Effort must be spent to make data publicly available, to agree on and use community standards, and most importantly to make computational tools easy to use for biologists; these steps will significantly improve the effectiveness of translational cancer research. Computing infrastructure for facilitating data aggregation/integration can use either centralized systems wherein an investigator accesses a central computer system that holds all the data, or, alternatively, federated systems where an investigator sends a query and the system assembles pertinent information from where it exists. Two examples of research computer systems for data integration are caBIG and BIRN's cyber infrastructure. The Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) is a network to enable sharing of data and software tools across individuals and cancer research institutions to improve the pace of innovations in cancer prevention and treatment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cabig.cancer.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://cabig.cancer.gov</ext-link>). The Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) is a distributed virtual community of shared resources that currently supports the sharing and analysis of neuroimaging data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nbirn.net" xlink:type="simple">http://www.nbirn.net</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4a"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Computational biology is pivotal for effectively using large and diverse data resources to provide insights into disease biology and to optimize treatment. Modeling and simulation techniques, standards, and software systems must be enhanced to deal with expanding molecular and clinical information. Making well-organized experimental datasets widely accessible will spur algorithm development, testing, and comparison, leading to the development of better computational methods. These new computational tools will allow us to effectively interpret available genome-scale datasets to improve disease diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, and prevention. </p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We apologize to those whose publications we were not able to refer to in this review because of space limitations.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>caBIG</term><def><p>Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CGH</term><def><p>comparative genomic hybridization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FISH</term><def><p>fluorescent in situ hybridization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mRNA</term><def><p>messenger RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>miRNA</term><def><p>microRNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MITF</term><def><p>micropthalmia-associated transcription factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCI</term><def><p>National Cancer Institute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SNP</term><def><p>single nucleotide polymorphism</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pcbi-0030012-b001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" xlink:type="simple">
