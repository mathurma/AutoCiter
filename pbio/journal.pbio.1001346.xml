      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>How small heat shock proteins (sHsps) might empower proteostasis networks to control beneficial prions or disassemble pathological amyloid is unknown. Here, we establish that yeast sHsps, Hsp26 and Hsp42, inhibit prionogenesis by the [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] prion protein, Sup35, via distinct and synergistic mechanisms. Hsp42 prevents conformational rearrangements within molten oligomers that enable <italic>de novo</italic> prionogenesis and collaborates with Hsp70 to attenuate self-templating. By contrast, Hsp26 inhibits self-templating upon binding assembled prions. sHsp binding destabilizes Sup35 prions and promotes their disaggregation by Hsp104, Hsp70, and Hsp40. In yeast, Hsp26 or Hsp42 overexpression prevents [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>] induction, cures [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>], and potentiates [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>]-curing by Hsp104 overexpression. In vitro, sHsps enhance Hsp104-catalyzed disaggregation of pathological amyloid forms of α-synuclein and polyglutamine. Unexpectedly, in the absence of Hsp104, sHsps promote an unprecedented, gradual depolymerization of Sup35 prions by Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40. This unanticipated amyloid-depolymerase activity is conserved from yeast to humans, which lack Hsp104 orthologues. A human sHsp, HspB5, stimulates depolymerization of α-synuclein amyloid by human Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40. Thus, we elucidate a heretofore-unrecognized human amyloid-depolymerase system that could have applications in various neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Amyloid fibers are protein aggregates that are associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, for which there are no effective treatments. They can also play beneficial roles; in yeast, for example, they are associated with increased survival and the evolution of new traits. Amyloid fibers are also central to many revolutionary concepts and important questions in biology and nanotechnology, including long-term memory formation and versatile self-organizing nanostructures. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how we can promote beneficial amyloid assembly, or reverse pathogenic assembly, at will. In this study, we define the mechanisms by which small heat-shock proteins synergize to regulate the assembly and disassembly of a beneficial yeast prion. We then exploit this knowledge to discover an amyloid depolymerase machinery that is conserved from yeast to humans. Remarkably, the human small heat shock protein, HspB5, stimulates Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40 chaperones to gradually depolymerize amyloid fibers formed by α-synuclein (which are implicated in Parkinson's disease) from their ends on a biologically relevant timescale. This newly identified and highly conserved amyloid-depolymerase system could have important therapeutic applications for various neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Amyloid fibers are thread-like protein polymers with cross-β structure. These unusually stable, self-templating structures were first identified in various systemic amyloidoses and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Cushman1">[1]</xref>. In isolation, many proteins can form amyloid fibers, suggesting that amyloidogenesis is an intrinsic property of polypeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Cushman1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Chiti1">[3]</xref>. Indeed, amyloid conformers have been captured during evolution for various beneficial purposes, including prion-based transmission of advantageous phenotypes, long-term memory formation, melanosome biogenesis, drug resistance, and biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Fowler1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Suzuki1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, as stable self-organizing polymers, amyloids are interesting nanomaterials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Scheibel1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Baldwin1">[19]</xref>. Thus, in diverse fields there is an urgent need to understand how we can promote or reverse amyloidogenesis as necessary.</p>
      <p>We hypothesized that small heat shock proteins (sHsps) might enable control of amyloidogenic trajectories. sHsps are the most widespread family of molecular chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Waters1">[21]</xref>. sHsps protect cells from diverse environmental stresses by suppressing amorphous aggregation of denatured proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Ecroyd1">[23]</xref>. All sHsps harbor a conserved C-terminal α-crystallin domain of ∼90 residues, but are otherwise diverse in size and sequence. Typically, sHsps form large dynamic oligomers and function as ATP-independent chaperones that bind denatured proteins to prevent aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Ecroyd1">[23]</xref>. sHsps maintain proteins in a soluble form that can be reactivated by Hsp70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Lee1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck2">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The yeast cytosol harbors two sHsps: Hsp42 and Hsp26. Both form large dynamic oligomers of 24 subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck3">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-White1">[30]</xref>. Hsp42 is more abundant and prevents protein aggregation at physiological and heat shock temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck4">[28]</xref>. By contrast, Hsp26 is activated as a chaperone at elevated temperatures via complex changes in the quaternary dynamics of its oligomer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck3">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Benesch1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Franzmann1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Franzmann2">[32]</xref>. Hsp26 and Hsp42 display overlapping and broad substrate specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck4">[28]</xref>. Incorporation of Hsp26 into denatured aggregates can promote their dissolution and renaturation by Hsp104 and Hsp70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck2">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Cashikar1">[33]</xref>. However, if Hsp26 is added to preformed denatured aggregates, then it cannot assist Hsp104 and Hsp70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Cashikar1">[33]</xref>. Much less is known about Hsp42, which might be involved in aggregate partitioning in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Specht1">[34]</xref>. Whether Hsp42 interacts directly with Hsp104 or Hsp70 is unknown.</p>
      <p>Despite these advances in understanding how sHsps handle denatured proteins, much less is known about how sHsps might interface with amyloidogenic folding pathways. sHsps might inhibit different steps in amyloidogenesis of various disease proteins, such as α-synuclein (α-syn), polyglutamine, or Aβ40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Ecroyd1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Cashikar1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Raman1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Hsu1">[38]</xref>. Yet it is unknown whether sHsps enable the proteostasis machinery to disassemble pathological amyloid. Furthermore, it is unknown whether sHsps regulate beneficial amyloid.</p>
      <p>In this study, we address these issues by first employing the yeast translation termination factor, Sup35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Sup35 forms infectious amyloids (prions) that transmit heritable reductions in translation termination fidelity and comprise the yeast prion [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter1">[8]</xref>. [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>]-encoded reductions in translation termination fidelity confer phenotypic diversity and selective advantages to yeast in diverse environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-True1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Tyedmers1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Halfmann1">[13]</xref>, but can be deleterious in other settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-McGlinchey1">[39]</xref>. Sup35 is a valuable paradigm for studying prion-folding events, with analytical tools that are unavailable for other amyloids or prions. Indeed, these tools have helped clarify how Sup35 prions assemble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Roberts1">[41]</xref>. They have also revealed various aspects of Sup35 prion structure at the resolution of spatial arrangements of individual amino acids involved in inter- and intra-molecular contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Wang1">[42]</xref>. These tools provide unique opportunities to establish a detailed understanding of how sHsps affect prion assembly and disassembly.</p>

          <title>Mechanism of Sup35 prion assembly.</title>
          <p>Sup35 is composed of a C-terminal GTPase domain (amino acids 254–685, black) that confers translation termination activity, a highly charged middle domain (M, amino acids 124–253, dark grey), and a prionogenic N-terminal domain (N, amino acids 1–123, light grey) enriched in glutamine, asparagine, tyrosine, and glycine. Together N and M (NM) confer all the properties needed to form a stable prion in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Liu2">[94]</xref>. Hence, NM is termed the prion domain. Within N, prion recognition elements termed the “Head” (red) and “Tail” (green), which flank a “Central Core” (blue), play important roles in prionogenesis. After a lag phase (steps 1–3), Sup35 prions assemble rapidly (steps 4 and 5). Prion recognition elements within N make homotypic intermolecular contacts such that Sup35 prions are maintained by an alternating sequence of Head-to-Head (red) and Tail-to-Tail (green) contacts. The Central Core (blue) is sequestered by intramolecular contacts. The amino acids that comprise the Head, Core, and Tail region when NM is assembled at 25°C are indicated. The steps antagonized by Hsp26 and Hsp42 are indicated.</p>

      <p>The two N-terminal domains of Sup35, termed NM, confer all the properties needed to form a stable prion in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter1">[8]</xref>. In isolation, NM spontaneously forms prions by a well-defined mechanism that involves a lag phase and assembly phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Serio1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Tanaka1">[44]</xref>. Early in lag phase, NM partitions between a monomeric (∼90% total NM) and oligomeric (∼10% total NM) pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Serio1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Scheibel2">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Scheibel3">[46]</xref>. NM monomers are largely unstructured and populate multiple transient conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Mukhopadhyay1">[47]</xref>. However, the specific intermolecular contacts required for prion formation ultimately form in molten NM oligomers. NM monomers within structurally fluid oligomers gradually reorganize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 2) to form amyloidogenic oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 3), which are structurally distinct to fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Serio1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter3">[49]</xref>. The intermolecular contacts that define prions form very rapidly once these obligate, transient intermediates appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Wang1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter3">[49]</xref>. Amyloid fibers then seed their own rapid bidirectional assembly by capturing and converting monomers to the cross-β form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Serio1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Scheibel3">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-DePace1">[50]</xref>. Short prion recognition elements within the N-terminal domain (N), termed the “Head” and “Tail”, are proposed to make homotypic intermolecular contacts in assembled prions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Wang1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Tessier1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Dong1">[52]</xref>. Thus, prions are maintained by alternating Head-to-Head and Tail-to-Tail contacts that separate a central core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Both the Head and Tail regions can nucleate prion assembly, although the rate-limiting step of lag phase is the establishment of the Head-to-Head contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Wang1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Tessier1">[51]</xref>. This well-defined sequence of prion-folding events provides an unparalleled opportunity to understand how sHsps affect prion formation at a molecular level.</p>
      <p>How Hsp26 and Hsp42 might affect prion-folding events in yeast is unclear. Both Hsp26 and Hsp42 are found to be associated with ex vivo SDS-resistant prion aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Nevzglyadova1">[53]</xref>, but deletion of Hsp26 does not affect [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>] propagation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Eaglestone1">[12]</xref> and overexpression of Hsp26 or Hsp42 does not cure [<italic>RNQ<sup>+</sup></italic>] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Cashikar1">[33]</xref>. However, beyond these observations nothing is known about how these sHsps might affect prion-folding events. It is also unclear whether sHsps contribute to the dissolution of amyloid or prion conformers by the proteostasis network. In yeast, the protein disaggregase and AAA+ ATPase, Hsp104, can rapidly disassemble amyloid conformers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter3">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-LoBianco1">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Liu1">[58]</xref>. Overexpression of Hsp26 or Hsp42 together with Hsp104 can increase soluble levels of polyglutamine in yeast, but whether this reflected enhanced disaggregation or inhibition of aggregation remains unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Cashikar1">[33]</xref>. Curiously, metazoan proteostasis networks lack an Hsp104 homologue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter5">[59]</xref>. Thus, it is unclear how amyloid dissolution is catalyzed in these systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Bieschke1">[60]</xref>. We have recently defined a mammalian disaggregase machinery composed of Hsp110 (Apg-2), Hsp70 (Hsc70 or Hsp70), and Hsp40 (Hdj1), which resolves denatured aggregates, but does not rapidly remodel amyloid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter6">[61]</xref>.

Whether proteostasis networks capitalize on this molecular recycling to promote gradual amyloid depolymerization is unknown.

        <title>Hsp26 and Hsp42 Synergize to Inhibit Spontaneous Sup35 Prionogenesis</title>
        <p>Using complementary methods, including Thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence and SDS-resistance, we demonstrated that Hsp42 potently inhibited (IC<sub>50</sub>∼0.67 µM of Hsp42 monomer) spontaneous NM fibrillization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref> blue markers). Marked inhibition was observed at a ratio of NM∶Hsp42 of 10∶1 and assembly was abolished at an NM∶Hsp42 ratio of 1.67∶1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Hsp26 also inhibited (IC<sub>50</sub>∼1.1 µM) spontaneous NM fibrillization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref> red markers). Hsp26 was not as effective as Hsp42, but inhibition was observed at a ratio of NM∶Hsp26 of 4∶1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). A 5-fold molar excess of Hsp26 was needed to completely block NM fibrillization. These inhibitory effects truly precluded prion formation because NM incubated in the presence of sHsps failed to transform [<italic>psi</italic><sup>−</sup>] cells to [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

        <p>Remarkably, the inhibitory activities of Hsp26 and Hsp42 were synergistic. The combination of an equimolar mixture of Hsp26 and Hsp42 was a more potent inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub>∼0.16 µM, i.e. 0.08 µM of each sHsp) of NM assembly than either sHsp alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g002">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Hsp26 and Hsp42 also synergized to inhibit spontaneous prionogenesis of full-length Sup35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

        <title>Hsp26 and Hsp42 Inhibit De Novo Sup35 Prionogenesis by Distinct Mechanisms</title>
        <p>The synergistic inhibition of Sup35 prionogenesis by Hsp26 and Hsp42 suggested that the two sHsps might inhibit prion formation by distinct mechanisms. The ability of the sHsps to abrogate prion formation at substoichiometric concentrations also suggested interference with a specific conformer or intermediate that is initially present at low concentrations. Two non-mutually exclusive possibilities emerge. First, sHsps might mask the ends of <italic>de novo</italic> formed NM fibers and thus prevent seeded assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 5). Second, sHsps might antagonize the formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 1) or reorganization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, steps 2–4) of transient molten oligomers. Only a small fraction (∼10%) of the total NM accesses molten oligomeric forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Scheibel2">[45]</xref>, which are obligate reaction intermediates for spontaneous fibrillization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter3">[49]</xref>.

        <p>After their initial formation, molten NM oligomers gradually reorganize into amyloidogenic forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, steps 2 and 3) that ultimately elicit assembly phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 4). This maturation process can be tracked using single cysteine NM mutants labeled with acrylodan at specific positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Roberts1">[41]</xref>. Sequestration of labeled sites from solvent yields increases in acrylodan fluorescence. Specific portions of N (∼residues 21–106) gradually become solvent inaccessible in molten oligomers prior to fiber assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, steps 2 and 3). This process begins immediately and the maximal increase in acrylodan fluorescence signals the end of lag phase and the start of assembly phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>. To determine whether Hsp26 or Hsp42 interfered with this process we utilized NM with acrylodan attached to cysteines replacing Asn21, Gln38, Gly96, or Tyr106. These mutated and labeled NM variants retain wild-type assembly kinetics and ability to access infectious forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Wang1">[42]</xref>. We measured acrylodan fluorescence after 15 min, when the assembly reaction remained in lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Hsp26 had only a slight inhibitory effect on increases in acrylodan fluorescence at all positions tested, suggesting that Hsp26 does not interfere with oligomer maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, steps 2 and 3). By contrast, Hsp42 inhibited increases in acrylodan fluorescence at all positions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We conclude that Hsp42 inhibits spontaneous NM fibrillization by preventing the maturation of molten NM oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, steps 2 and 3). Remarkably, Hsp26 and Hsp42 together caused the greatest inhibition of increased acrylodan fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, we determined how Hsp42 or Hsp26 affected an obligate on-pathway oligomeric intermediate in spontaneous Sup35 assembly, which accumulates during lag phase and is specifically detected by the conformation-specific antibody A11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter3">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Kayed1">[69]</xref>. This oligomeric species is most abundant at the end of lag phase and then rapidly disappears during assembly phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter3">[49]</xref>. We performed a kinetic experiment where NM assembly was initiated for 10 min at which time either buffer, Hsp26, or Hsp42 were added (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>) and the reaction was then allowed to continue. After 10 min, A11-reactive species had already accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), whereas no fibers had assembled as determined by the lack of ThT fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Addition of buffer after 10 min had no effect on assembly and A11-reactive species continued to accumulate until the end of lag phase (∼30 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, grey markers). A11-reactive species then rapidly declined as fiber assembly initiated (∼40 min, compare grey markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3C</xref> to black markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Addition of Hsp42 after 10 min caused a rapid disappearance of A11-reactive species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, cyan markers) and fiber assembly was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, blue markers). Thus, Hsp42 reversed the formation of A11-reactive conformers.</p>
        <p>By contrast, addition of Hsp26 had no effect on the accumulation of A11-reactive species during lag phase or their rapid decline after 40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, orange markers). Yet very little fiber assembly occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, red markers). Thus, in contrast to Hsp42, Hsp26 does not inhibit or reverse oligomer maturation events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, steps 1–4). Rather, these data suggest that Hsp26 inhibits the growth of newly formed fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 5). Indeed, electron microscopy revealed that a few very short fibers assembled in the presence of Hsp26 (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). By contrast, oligomeric structures persisted in the presence of Hsp42, or Hsp26 and Hsp42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
        <p>To pinpoint which steps of Sup35 prionogenesis are antagonized by Hsp42 or Hsp26, we experimentally bypassed the requirement for oligomer maturation in spontaneous prion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, steps 2–4). Thus, we crosslinked single cysteine NM mutants in specific positions with the flexible 11 Å crosslinker: 1,4-bis-maleimidobutane (BMB). NM that is BMB-crosslinked at cysteines at position Gly25 or Gly31 assembles into fibers without a detectable lag phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Krishnan1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Roberts1">[41]</xref>. Hsp26 or Hsp42 potently inhibited the assembly of uncrosslinked NM, and the combination of Hsp26 and Hsp42 was the most effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). By contrast, Hsp26 but not Hsp42 inhibited assembly of NM that was BMB-crosslinked at position 25 or 31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). The combination of Hsp26 and Hsp42 was less effective against NM that had been BMB-crosslinked at position 25 or 31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). These data suggest that Hsp26 selectively antagonizes events after lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 5), whereas Hsp42 selectively antagonizes oligomer-remodeling events during lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, steps 2–4). Thus, Hsp26 antagonizes events that occur after prion recognition elements have initially formed intermolecular contacts, whereas Hsp42 prevents initial formation of these contacts. These data suggest that Hsp26 and Hsp42 synergize to directly antagonize Sup35 prionogenesis prior to intermolecular contact formation by prion recognition elements.</p>

        <p>The induction of [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] by Sup35 overexpression depends on the presence of another prion [<italic>RNQ<sup>+</sup></italic>], which is comprised of infectious Rnq1 amyloid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Derkatch2">[73]</xref>. Rnq1 prions are proposed to template the initial formation of Sup35 prions in vivo, and this activity has been reconstituted in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Derkatch3">[74]</xref>. Thus, we tested whether Hsp26 and Hsp42 inhibited NM fibrillization cross-seeded by Rnq1 fibers in vitro. Hsp26 or Hsp42 inhibited NM assembly that was cross-seeded by Rnq1 fibers, whereas a control protein (BSA) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The ability of Hsp42 to inhibit this seeding reaction was unexpected and might suggest that Rnq1 fibers accelerate events in the lag phase of NM assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, steps 1–4), rather than acting as a direct template for NM fibrillization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Derkatch3">[74]</xref>. Hsp26 and Hsp42 might interact directly with Rnq1 fibers to prevent interactions with NM. Alternatively, interactions between Hsp26 or Hsp42 and NM might prevent interactions with Rnq1 that drive cross-seeding. Importantly, the combination of Hsp26 and Hsp42 was more potent than either sHsp alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g005">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that the two sHsps work together to prevent cross-seeding.

By contrast, the same pretreatment reduced the ability of Hsp26 to inhibit spontaneous NM assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, at elevated temperatures Hsp26 might switch from inhibiting prion assembly to suppressing aggregation of denatured substrates.

        <title>Hsp26 Interacts with NM Fibers to Prevent Seeding</title>
        <p>To determine whether Hsp26 inhibited seeded assembly by interacting with NM fibers or monomers or both, we pretreated NM fibers with Hsp26 or Hsp42. We then recovered the fibers by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended the material to use as seed. Hsp26 or Hsp42 did not disassemble NM fibers in this timeframe and equal amounts of NM were recovered for each condition. NM fibers pretreated in this way with BSA or Hsp42 could still seed, whereas those pretreated with Hsp26 were unable to seed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

Both Hsp42 and Hsp26 were recovered in the pellet with NM fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) and thus were present in the seeded assembly reaction. The residual concentration was estimated to be ∼50 nM for Hsp26 and ∼20 nM for Hsp42. These concentrations are not sufficient to cause significant inhibition of seeded assembly without pretreatment of fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, Hsp42 binds to NM fibers in a manner that does not affect seeded assembly. By contrast, Hsp26 binds to NM fibers and occludes prion recognition elements to inhibit seeded assembly.</p>

This inhibition is due to an interaction between the fiber and Hsp70 and Hsp40 because neither Ssa1:Ydj1 nor Ssa1:Sis1 interact with NM monomers directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter4">[55]</xref>. We tested whether the seeding activity of NM fibers that had been pretreated with Hsp42 were more sensitive to inhibition by increasing concentrations of Ssa1:Sis1 or Ssa1:Ydj1. We first confirmed that adding Ssa1, Ydj1, or Sis1 alone had no effect on seeding by NM fibers or seeding by NM fibers pretreated with Hsp42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g009">Figure 9A–C</xref>). Next, we titrated Ssa1:Sis1 or Ssa1:Ydj1 into seeded assembly while maintaining the Ssa1∶Hsp40 ratio at 1∶1. As expected, both Ssa1:Sis1 and Ssa1:Ydj1 inhibited seeded assembly of buffer-treated NM fibers with an IC<sub>50</sub> of ∼1.1 µM and ∼1.6 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g009">Figure 9D,E</xref>). However, Hsp42-treated NM fibers were more susceptible to inhibition by Ssa1:Sis1 and Ssa1:Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g009">Figure 9D,E</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> was reduced about 5-fold to ∼0.21 µM for Ssa1:Sis1 and about 3-fold to ∼0.49 µM for Ssa1:Ydj1. These marked decreases in IC<sub>50</sub> suggest that Hsp42 binds NM fibers and promotes interactions between the prion and Ssa1:Sis1 or Ssa1:Ydj1 that preclude seeded assembly. Thus, Hsp42 may direct Hsp70 and Hsp40 to fiber ends to prevent assembly.</p>

Although Hsp26 and Hsp42 did not disassemble NM fibers after a brief incubation, they both induced a slight decrease in the thermal stability of NM fibers in 1.6% SDS.

Thus, sHsp binding to NM fibers might weaken or subtly alter the intermolecular contacts between NM protomers, and shift the monomer-fiber equilibrium in favor of dissociation. In this way, sHsps might render amyloid forms more susceptible to dissolution by protein disaggregases.</p>

        <p>The destabilization of Sup35 prions by Hsp26 or Hsp42 binding could be exploited by Hsp104 to rapidly disaggregate prions. Thus, we assembled NM fibers and incubated them with increasing concentrations of Hsp104 in the presence or absence of Hsp26 or Hsp42. In the absence of other components Hsp104 effectively disassembled NM fibers, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of ∼0.15 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g011">Figure 11A</xref>). Remarkably, Hsp42 enabled Hsp104 to disassemble NM fibers at concentrations where it would usually be inactive (0.01–0.1 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g011">Figure 11A</xref>). Hsp42 reduced the Hsp104 EC<sub>50</sub> to ∼0.075 µM. By contrast, Hsp26 inhibited Hsp104 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g011">Figure 11A</xref>).

Ssa1:Sis1 relieved the inhibition of Hsp104 by Hsp26 and potentiated Hsp104 remodeling activity, reducing the EC<sub>50</sub> to ∼0.06 µM.

In remarkable contrast, Hsp26 (red filled circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>), Ssa1:Sis1 (blue open triangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>), and Ssa1:Ydj1 (black open circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B</xref>), which inhibit seeded assembly (6A, 6B, 9D, 9E), slowly disassembled preformed NM fibers over a time period of 28 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>). Consistent with their efficacy to inhibit seeded assembly, Ssa1:Sis1 (blue open triangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>) was more effective than Ssa1:Ydj1 (black open circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>) or Hsp26 (red filled circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>). Notably, the combination of Sse1 (Hsp110), Ssa1 and Sis1 (green filled squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>), or Sse1, Ssa1, and Ydj1 (cyan filled triangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>) yielded more rapid disassembly, whereas Sse1 combined with Ssa1 (red filled squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>), Sis1 (black filled circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>), or Ydj1 (red filled triangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12B,C</xref>) had no effect. Electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12D</xref>) and prion transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12E</xref>) confirmed that prions had been eliminated by Sse1:Ssa1:Sis1, Sse1:Ssa1:Ydj1, Ssa1:Sis1, Ssa1:Ydj1, and Hsp26, but not by Sse1:Ssa1, Sse1:Sis1, Sse1:Ydj1, Sse1, Ssa1, Ydj1, Sis1, or Hsp42.</p>
        <p>Disassembly was contingent on the number of fiber ends, as unsonicated fibers were more refractory to disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12F</xref>). Indeed, we confirmed that disassembly entailed depolymerization from fiber ends using “capped” fibers. Thus, NM fibers comprised of untagged NM were resuspended in buffer containing high concentrations of C-terminally his-tagged NM. This procedure allowed NM fibers to be rapidly elongated creating NM fibers with NM-his “caps” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g013">Figure 13A</xref>). We established conditions where ∼50% of the total NM in fibers was his-tagged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g013">Figure 13A</xref>). If NM fibers with NM-his “caps” were treated for extended periods with Sse1:Ssa1:Sis1, Sse1:Ssa1:Ydj1, Ssa1:Sis1, Ssa1:Ydj1, or Hsp26, then only NM-his was released into the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g013">Figure 13B,C</xref>). Conversely, if NM-his fibers were capped with untagged NM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g013">Figure 13A</xref>), then only untagged NM was released into the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g013">Figure 13D,E</xref>). When capped fibers were sonicated prior to incubation to randomize the form of NM at fiber ends, approximately equal amounts of NM and NM-his were released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g013">Figure 13F,G</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Sse1:Ssa1:Sis1, Sse1:Ssa1:Ydj1, Ssa1:Sis1, Ssa1:Ydj1, and Hsp26 slowly depolymerize NM fibers from their ends. The most effective depolymerization is promoted by the combination of Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40.</p>

        <title>sHsps Can Promote Depolymerization of NM Fibers by Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40</title>

Thus, NM fibers were pretreated with Hsp26 or Hsp42 prior to addition of Sse1:Ssa1:Sis1 or Sse1:Ssa1:Ydj1. Pretreatment with Hsp26 or Hsp42, which subtly alters NM fiber structure and stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g010">Figure 10A,B</xref>), facilitated more rapid depolymerization by Sse1:Ssa1:Sis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g013">Figure 13H</xref>) or Sse1:Ssa1:Ydj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g013">Figure 13I</xref>). For Sse1:Ssa1:Sis1, the D<sub>1/2</sub> (the 50% disassembly time) was reduced from ∼12.8 d to ∼7.4 d by Hsp26 and to ∼7.7 d by Hsp42. For Sse1:Ssa1:Ydj1, D<sub>1/2</sub> was reduced from ∼16.1 d to ∼10.5 d by Hsp26 and ∼10.9 d by Hsp42. Thus, sHsps render amyloid forms more susceptible to depolymerization by the Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40 disaggregase machinery.</p>

        <title>Human HspB5 Promotes Depolymerization of α-Syn Fibers by Human Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40</title>
        <p>Our newly discovered amyloid-depolymerase activity was not restricted to yeast chaperones and yeast prions. Indeed, human Hsp70 (Hsc70) and Hsp40 (Hdj1) slowly disassemble preformed α-syn fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g014">Figure 14A,B</xref>). This activity was stimulated by addition of human Hsp110 (Apg-2) or the human sHsp, HspB5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g014">Figure 14A,B</xref>). HspB5 potentiated α-syn fiber disassembly by Apg-2, Hsc70 and Hdj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g014">Figure 14A,B</xref>). Indeed, HspB5 reduced the D<sub>1/2</sub> to ∼14 d for Apg-2, Hsc70, and Hdj1. We confirmed that the combination of Apg-2, Hsc70, Hdj1, and HspB5 depolymerized fibers from their ends by employing α-syn fibers capped with his-α-syn. Thus, during the initial disassembly phase of unsonicated fibers, Apg-2, Hsc70, Hdj1, and HspB5 liberated only his-α-syn into the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g014">Figure 14C</xref>), which indicates that disassembly proceeds via depolymerization. These data suggest that the human proteostasis network, like its yeast counterpart, is equipped with an amyloid-depolymerase modality. Although depolymerization is relatively slow, it occurs on a biologically relevant timescale, especially considering the lifespan of neurons in the human brain.</p>

        <p>Could Hsp104 interface with the human sHsp, HspB5, and the Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40 disaggregase machinery? Remarkably, the combination of Apg-2, Hsc70, Hdj1, and HspB5 enabled even more effective and rapid disaggregation of α-syn fibers by Hsp104 than with just Apg-2, Hsc70, and Hdj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g014">Figure 14D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter6">[61]</xref>. The ability of Hsp104 to interface effectively with the human disaggregase machinery and enable effective clearance of α-syn amyloid suggests that Hsp104 might be developed further to target pathological α-syn conformers.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have established that the sHsps from yeast, Hsp26 and Hsp42, exert tight control over the formation of beneficial Sup35 prions. Both sHsps exerted a strong and direct inhibitory effect on Sup35 prion formation at substoichiometric concentrations. These results were surprising because sHsps commonly bind 1 substrate per ∼2–3 sHsp monomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Lee1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck3">[27]</xref>. Thus, the strong inhibitory effect at substoichiometric concentrations indicates that the sHsps might inhibit a rare or transient NM conformer that is critical for prion formation. Surprisingly, our results suggested that this conformer was different for each sHsp. Hsp42 targeted molten Sup35 oligomers, whereas Hsp26 targeted the self-templating ends of newly assembled prions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although little was known about Hsp42, it had been suggested to work by a mechanism similar to Hsp26 to inhibit protein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck4">[28]</xref>. Surprisingly, however, Hsp42 inhibited spontaneous Sup35 prionogenesis by a distinct mechanism to Hsp26. Hsp42 specifically antagonized events in the lag phase of prion formation. Hsp42 prevented and reversed the maturation of Sup35 oligomers into prion-nucleating species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, steps 2 and 3). By contrast, Hsp26 bound to newly formed prions and inhibited their seeding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g001">Figure 1</xref>, step 5). These two activities synergized to inhibit <italic>de novo</italic> Sup35 prionogenesis in vitro and in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of two distinct sHsps working together in a synergistic manner to prevent prion formation.</p>
      <p>The mechanistic differences between Hsp26 and Hsp42 are likely conferred by their divergent N-terminal domains. Hsp42 has an extended N-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Wotton1">[80]</xref>, which displays no homology to other sHsps. The extended N-terminal domain of Hsp42 might enable insertion into molten Sup35 oligomers in a way that precludes prion formation.</p>
      <p>Hsp26 chaperone activity is usually activated at heat shock temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Haslbeck3">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Benesch1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Franzmann1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Franzmann2">[32]</xref>. Unexpectedly, we found that pretreatment of Hsp26 at high temperature reduced its ability to inhibit Sup35 prionogenesis, while simultaneously enhancing its ability to prevent aggregation of a chemically denatured substrate. Our result thus reveals a fundamental difference in how Hsp26 antagonizes the aggregation of a denatured protein (GDH) and a yeast prion (Sup35). Hsp26 conformations that are ineffective against heat-denatured substrates are effective against Sup35 prions and vice versa. This difference might reflect distinct driving forces of GDH and Sup35 aggregation. GDH aggregation likely involves inappropriately exposed hydrophobic surfaces, whereas NM fibrillization likely involves polar interactions or backbone interactions or both because polar residues outweigh hydrophobic residues by ∼16 to 1. At physiological temperatures, Hsp26 may be primed to inhibit prion formation, but at elevated temperatures, Hsp26 loses this ability and switches to inhibiting the aggregation of heat-denatured proteins. This switch in Hsp26 activity likely contributes to the increased levels of [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>] induction at elevated temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Tyedmers1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Both Hsp26 and Hsp42 bind to preformed Sup35 fibers, but only Hsp26 binding inhibited seeding activity. However, Hsp42 increased the ability of Hsp70 and Hsp40 (Ssa1:Sis1 or Ssa1:Ydj1) to inhibit seeded assembly, potentially by recruiting Hsp70 to fiber ends. These data help explain why overexpression of Hsp26 or Hsp42 cures cells of [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>].</p>
      <p>Unexpectedly, Hsp26 or Hsp42 binding destabilized Sup35 prions. Hsp26 and Hsp42 binding reduced excimer fluorescence at intermolecular contact regions. The most marked effect was at residues N-terminal to the Head region, which appeared to be forced further apart in adjacent protomers by Hsp26 or Hsp42 binding. These data suggest that Hsp26 or Hsp42 harness binding energy to alter prion architecture. Notably, these sHsp-induced alterations facilitated the disaggregation of Sup35 prions by Hsp104.</p>
      <p>Pretreatment of Sup35 prions with Hsp42 rendered them more susceptible to rapid disassembly by Hsp104. Curiously, Hsp26 alone inhibited Hsp104. However, Ssa1 and Sis1 alleviated this inhibition and promoted more effective prion disassembly. These findings might suggest that the mechanism of Sup35 prion disassembly by Hsp104 is different in the presence of Hsp26 versus Hsp42. Further experiments are needed to explore this possibility. Importantly, Hsp26 and Hsp42 promoted elimination of Sup35 prions by Hsp104 in vivo, as overexpression of Hsp26 or Hsp42 increased [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>] curing by elevated Hsp104 concentration.</p>
      <p>Hsp26 and Hsp42 also promoted rapid Hsp104-catalyzed disassembly of α-syn fibers that are connected with PD. We further demonstrated that Hsp104 directly disassembles polyglutamine fibers that are connected with HD. Hsp26 or Hsp42 boosted this activity and disaggregation was maximal in the presence of Hsp104, an sHsp, Ssa1, and Sis1.</p>
      <p>We have established an important dichotomy between how Hsp26 and Hsp42 collaborate with Hsp104. Hsp26 promotes the disaggregation of both amyloid and non-amyloid substrates by Hsp104 in the presence of Hsp70 and Hsp40. By contrast, Hsp42 selectively promotes the disassembly of amyloid substrates by Hsp104. Thus, Hsp42 is an amyloid-specific adaptor for Hsp104. In yeast, Hsp42 appears to preferentially localize to peripheral inclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Specht1">[34]</xref> that might harbor amyloid conformers that can be solubilized by Hsp104 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Nevzglyadova1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-DiSalvo1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Kaganovich1">[81]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Tyedmers2">[82]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have shown that in the absence of Hsp104, the Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40 disaggregase system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter6">[61]</xref> can slowly depolymerize amyloid fibers. Depolymerization was a slow process that required many days to complete and appeared to occur on a timescale similar to molecular recycling within amyloid fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Carulla1">[62]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Carulla2">[67]</xref>. Thus, the proteostasis network might exploit this process to slowly eradicate amyloid by either accelerating monomer dissociation from fiber ends (i.e., increasing <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12A</xref>) or inhibiting monomer reassociation with fiber ends (i.e., decreasing <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12A</xref>) or both. Consistent with the possibility of inhibiting monomer reassociation (decreasing <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12A</xref>), agents that inhibit seeded polymerization of Sup35 prions (e.g., Hsp26 or Ssa1:Sis1) slowly depolymerized them over the course of many days. The relatively low number of Hsp26 monomers per molecule of substrate required for Hsp26 disaggregation activity might indicate that Hsp26 acts selectively at fiber ends. The combination of Sse1, Ssa1, and Sis1 yielded the most effective depolymerization. Given the capability of this disaggregase system to extract and refold proteins from large denatured aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter6">[61]</xref>, we suggest that Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40 might also accelerate monomer dissociation events (increasing <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12A</xref>). Importantly, destabilization of NM fibers by Hsp26 or Hsp42 accelerated prion depolymerization by Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40.</p>
      <p>Intriguingly, this activity is not confined to yeast but is conserved to humans. Thus, the human sHsp, HspB5, accelerated the depolymerization of α-syn amyloid (which is connected with PD) by human Hsp110 (Apg-2), Hsp70 (Hsc70), and Hsp40 (Hdj1). Collectively, these data suggest that in metazoa, which lack an Hsp104 homologue, Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40 can slowly eliminate amyloid forms by specifically exploiting the molecular recycling process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figure 12A</xref>). Although amyloid depolymerization is slow and requires many days to complete, it occurs on a biologically relevant timescale, especially considering the lifespan of humans. Indeed, a massive therapeutic advance will likely come with the ability to stimulate the proteostasis network to dissolve α-syn fibers in a few days in Parkinson's patients. Our data provide proof of principle that this may indeed be possible and that pure, individual components can drive this process. Although released monomers could have a chance to reassemble into toxic oligomers, we suspect that components of the proteostasis network would prevent toxic oligomer formation. Shutting down expression of an amyloidogenic protein enables mammalian cells to slowly clear protein aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Yamamoto1">[83]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Mallucci1">[84]</xref>. Our findings suggest that sHsps and the Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40 disaggregase system might play a crucial role in this clearance. Moreover, they suggest that potential RNA interference therapies to deplete the aggregating protein should be combined with targeted upregulation of sHsps and the Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40 disaggregase system to promote clearance of existing aberrant conformers.</p>
      <p>Another way to accelerate the disaggregation of α-syn fibers is to introduce Hsp104 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-LoBianco1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter6">[61]</xref>. Indeed, the combination of Hsp104 with Apg-2, Hsc70, Hdj1, and HspB5 disaggregated α-syn fibers most effectively and rapidly. Importantly, Hsp104 expression counteracts neurodegeneration associated with α-syn misfolding and polyglutamine misfolding in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-LoBianco1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter5">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Vacher1">[85]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Perrin1">[86]</xref>. Thus, our findings suggest that boosting sHsp levels or activity might provide a powerful strategy to facilitate clearance of deleterious amyloid by either the endogenous human Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40 disaggregase machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter6">[61]</xref> or by Hsp104 in targeted therapeutic strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-LoBianco1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter5">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Vacher1">[85]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Vashist1">[87]</xref>.</p>

For Sup35 (5 µM) fibrillization, AB was supplemented with 1 mM GTP and 10% glycerol.

        <title>Fiber Disassembly</title>
        <p>For NM disassembly reactions, NM (5 µM) was assembled with agitation for 6 h in AB as described above. Wild-type or A53T α-syn fibers were assembled as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-LoBianco1">[54]</xref>. Polyglutamine (GST-Q62) (10 µM) was incubated for 1 h at 25°C with thrombin in AB to separate GST from Q62, and then incubated for a subsequent 16 h with agitation to generate fibers. Q62 fibers were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended at 5 µM. “Capped” NM fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g013">Figure 13A</xref>) were generated by incubating preformed NM fibers (2.5 µM monomer) with NM-his (5 µM), and the seeding reaction was allowed to proceed until 50% of NM-his had been converted to amyloid. This was verified empirically by determining the amount of SDS-resistant NM-his by quantitative immunoblot using an anti-Penta-His antibody in comparison to known quantities of NM-his. Fibers were recovered by centrifugation and washed (without resuspending the pellet) prior to disassembly reactions. Capped α-syn fibers were generated in the same way.</p>
        <p>Assembled NM, α-syn, or Q62 fibers (0.5–2.5 µM monomer) were then incubated in AB with the indicated components and times (refer to figure legends). ATP was added (5 mM) plus an ATP regeneration system comprising creatine phosphate (40 mM) and creatine kinase (0.5 µM). For long-term incubations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g012">Figures 12</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g013"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g014">14</xref>), reactions were conducted in AB supplemented with sodium azide (0.001%) and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche). Sodium azide and protease inhibitors were removed by dialysis prior to transformation into yeast cells. For short-term incubations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001346-g011">Figure 11</xref>), sodium azide and protease inhibitors were omitted. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that for long-term incubations the total amount of NM or α-syn remained constant throughout the incubation. Fiber disassembly was assessed by ThT fluorescence, electron microscopy, or by sedimentation analysis (436,000 g for 10 min at 25°C) followed by determination of the amount of SDS-soluble protein in the supernatant or the amount of protein in the pellet fraction by quantitative immunoblot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter3">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-LoBianco1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter4">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001346-Shorter6">[61]</xref>. For disassembly of “capped” NM or α-syn fibers, an anti-Penta-His antibody (Qiagen) was used to detect the his-tagged protein, which migrates slower than untagged protein by SDS-PAGE. Thus, untagged and his-tagged protein could be readily distinguished and quantified in comparison to know amounts of untagged or his-tagged protein.</p>
