				<article-title>From One to Many and Back Again: A Systemic Signal Triggers Tunicate Regeneration</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Regeneration in adult chordates is confined to a few model cases and terminates in restoration of restricted tissues and organs. Here, we study the unique phenomenon of whole body regeneration (WBR) in the colonial urochordate <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Botrylloides leachi</named-content> in which an entire adult zooid is restored from a miniscule blood vessel fragment. In contrast to all other documented cases, regeneration is induced systemically in blood vessels. Multiple buds appear simultaneously in newly established regeneration niches within vasculature fragments, stemming from composites of pluripotent blood cells and terminating in one functional zooid. We found that retinoic acid (RA) regulates diverse developmental aspects in WBR. The homologue of the RA receptor and a retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-related gene were expressed specifically in blood cells within regeneration niches and throughout bud development. The addition of RA inhibitors as well as RNA interference knockdown experiments resulted in WBR arrest and bud malformations. The administration of all-<italic>trans</italic> RA to blood vessel fragments resulted in doubly accelerated regeneration and multibud formation, leading to restored colonies with multiple zooids. The <italic>Botrylloides</italic> system differs from known regeneration model systems by several fundamental criteria, including epimorphosis without the formation of blastema and the induction of a “multifocal regeneration niche” system. This is also to our knowledge the first documented case of WBR from circulating blood cells that restores not only the soma, but also the germ line. This unique <italic>Botrylloides</italic> WBR process could serve as a new in vivo model system for regeneration, suggesting that RA signaling may have had ancestral roles in body restoration events.</p>

          <p>Whole body regeneration (WBR) in Animalia is rare, confined to morphologically less complex taxa such as sponges, cnidarians, and flatworms. In the chordate phylum, only colonial ascidians (invertebrate chordates also known as sea squirts) have the documented ability to wholly regenerate. Once separated from the colony, any minute fragment of peripheral blood vessel (about 1 mm in length, containing 100–300 blood cells) of the colonial ascidian <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Botrylloides leachi</named-content> regenerates an entire functional adult within one to three weeks. By following cellular and molecular events in <italic>Botrylloides</italic> WBR, we revealed that this system proceeds differently from regeneration events in other model organisms by several fundamental criteria. This is, for example, to our knowledge the first documented case of WBR initiating from circulating blood cells that restore not only the body tissue, but also the germ line. We found that retinoic acid (RA) signaling, previously reported in the regeneration of specific vertebrate tissues and organs, plays a major role in WBR via RA receptor expression throughout the entire regenerating animal. This suggests that RA signaling may have had ancestral roles in body restoration events. Elucidating the processes involved in this WBR system will improve our understanding of the nature of regeneration and the reduced regeneration capabilities represented in so many vertebrates.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Some of the most fundamental issues in developmental biology concern the ability of metazoans to regenerate. In most multicellular organisms, adult stem cells maintain organs' homeostasis throughout life and facilitate tissue repair after injury or disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b001">1</xref>]. Several organisms are capable of regrowing amputated organs and body parts, for example, amphibian limbs, lens, and retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b004">4</xref>]. Phylogenetic perspectives reveal a decrease in regenerative abilities concomitant with an increase in animal body complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b005">5</xref>]. Thus, only a few adult animals manifest massive regeneration events, and these events occur mostly in less complex multicellular organisms such as sponges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b006">6</xref>], cnidarians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b007">7</xref>], and flat worms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b008">8</xref>]. An exception is the phenomenon of whole body regeneration (WBR) in the highly evolved urochordates subfamily, <italic>Botryllinae</italic>. In this group of sedentary colonial organisms, which are the closest living relatives of vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b009">9</xref>], a fully functional adult can regenerate within 10–14 d from any isolated minute fragment (0.1 mm) of a blood vessel containing a limited number (<italic>n</italic> = 100–300) of blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b011">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>The filter-feeding Atlantic urochordate <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. leachi</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) is a common encrusting colonial sea squirt, probably a Mediterranean species that has spread ubiquitously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b012">12</xref>]. Animals are found in very shallow waters, under stones, on algae, pilings, floats, and other substrata. Each colony is composed of several to thousands of genetically identical modules (zooids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, arrowheads), each 2–3 mm long, embedded within a gelatinous matrix called the tunic. Zooids are arranged in systems of two parallel elongated and often serpentine rows. A network of blood vessels connects all zooids within a colony, from which pear-shaped vascular termini (ampullae) extend toward the colony margins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, arrows). Once the planktonic larva metamorphoses into the founder individual (called the oozooid), a colony of zooids develops by a weekly budding process. This process is comprised of four successive phases (A–D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b013">13</xref>], during which new zooids bud from the thoracic body wall of the oozooid and the subsequent zooids, a phenomenon called palleal budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b014">14</xref>] or blastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b017">17</xref>]. Each blastogenic cycle ends in a massive apoptotic event (Phase IV—the takeover phase) in which parental zooids are resorbed concurrently with the maturation of buds into adult, functional zooids. A unique WBR event, in which buds develop at the bases of vascular ampullae, was observed in congener botryllid species under adverse environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b019">19</xref>], a regeneration phenomenon that had also been induced experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b011">11</xref>], providing a unique model system for WBR.</p>

      <p>Retinoic acid (RA) is a low molecular weight biologically active metabolite of Vitamin A, which plays diverse functional roles in a wide variety of tissues and organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b022">22</xref>]. It plays a conserved role in controlling positional information and cellular differentiation during embryonic development. RA action is mediated at the metabolism and signaling levels. RA-synthesizing enzymes, such as retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (Raldh), together with degrading enzymes (Cyp26) create the spatiotemporal distribution of RA during development and refine it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b023">23</xref>]. Signaling is mediated through RA binding to two nuclear receptors, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoic X receptor, through which it acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b025">25</xref>], subsequently inducing gene transcription. RA has also been recorded as being involved in restricted regeneration of tissues and organs in adult vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b026">26</xref>]. In urodele amphibians, administering RA into amputated limbs resulted in regeneration of extra limb tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b029">29</xref>]. In adult rat lung, RA induces alveolar regeneration, and systemic RA treatment can reverse pathological features of experimental emphysema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b030">30</xref>]. In adult rat spinal cord, RAR isoform RARβ2 is able to promote functional regeneration of sensory axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b031">31</xref>].</p>
      <p>Despite the identification of RA receptors exclusively in chordates, and the consideration of RA signaling as a chordate innovation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b032">32</xref>], remarkably little evidence exists connecting the activation of RA signaling to conserved chordate biological traits of regeneration. A single RA receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b033">33</xref>] in lower chordates (such as urochordates and cephalochordates) offers an advantage when searching for direct RA-signaling functions. This is not the case in vertebrates where, due to redundancy in RAR genes, RAR localization fails to provide sufficient information on RA-signaling functions. Here, we endeavor to elucidate cellular processes and RA signaling during WBR in the urochordate <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. leachi</named-content> in order to reveal traits and evolutionary routes of regeneration similar to those recorded in its vertebrate counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b033">33</xref>].</p>

        <title>Morphological Changes in Amputated Ampullae</title>
        <p>Experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 95) were conducted on small <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. leachi</named-content> fragments (each containing 1–92 isolated ampullae, cut from different colonies) that were well attached to the substrate. Whole body restoration was observed in 80 fragments, irrespective of the number of blood vessels, the blastogenic stage (A–D) of the colony on the day of operation, the original colony size (1–6 systems, 3–41 zooids), or the amputated vasculature location (peripheral, marginal, or from vessels located centrally) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Following surgery and isolation of vessel fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), we observed an immediate vasculature contraction and restriction of blood flow. The next day, vascular connections grew between ampullae within each fragment, creating a new circulatory system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">1</xref>D, arrows). Then, blood flow was restored and blood cells were observed traveling (as in untreated colonies) in opposite directions, briefly in one direction and then back. At the same time, the lumen of some blood vessels became opaque and shrank progressively. During the first seven days, isolated ampullae were highly dynamic, changing their orientations and shapes within the tunic matrix, coalescing into each other, and moving within the tunic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">1</xref>F). These directional movements and new vascular connections created a dense network of anastomosed vessels at selected locations within the tunic embedment. Vasculature movements were more conspicuous when blood vessels were spaced out, creating a dense mass of vessels on one side of the fragment and a semitransparent gelatinous tunic matrix deprived of blood vessels on the other side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>F).</p>
        <p>Blood propulsion in the newly formed vascular network slowed down progressively. Concomitantly, an opaque mass of blood vessels was formed, followed by formation of an internal small transparent vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>G, arrow) that grew and developed two openings in opposite corners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>H). By days 10–14, a fully operating filter-feeding zooid, equipped with functional atrial and peribranchial siphons (both facing upwards, as in normal zooids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>H, arrows), developed from the opaque mass of blood vessels. The first generation of zooids was larger (1.18 mm<sup>2</sup>) than regular zooids (0.78 mm<sup>2</sup>) and exhibited a spherical shape, unlike the elongated pear-like shape of regular colony zooids. Irrespective of the number of blood vessels (1–92) presented in each fragment and of the number of buds (1–24) developing throughout the amputated fragment, only one zooid per fragment (<italic>n</italic> = 80) was fully formed. Yet, successful regeneration, indicated by the opening of siphons, varied between fragments, being faster (within 10 d) in fragments characterized by spacious blood circulation or fragments exhibiting early onset of a new vascular system. When a new vascular system failed to form properly between blood vessels, buds developed in between ampullae at vessel's joints. WBR was not documented in cases (<italic>n</italic> = 15) where fragments failed to separate completely from colonies, leaving a single zooid fragment or an intact blastogenic bud.</p>

Circulating haemocytes (see below) in isolated blood vessel fragments were stained by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (a proliferation marker), whereas weak or no PCNA staining was documented in haemocytes of intact blood vessels. No PCNA staining was documented in the surrounding peripheral epithelium. In isolated fragments, a dense network of cell connections formed gradually in the lumens of blood vessels. Within one day of separation, the epithelium detached from the surrounding tunic embedment, exposing a flattened and squamiform single-cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, arrows). From day 2 onward, divisions within the blood vessel created dozens of small compartments (termed by us regeneration niches) varying in sizes and locations (see below).</p>

              <p>(F–L) Phase III events: 1 d later, continuous cell proliferation increased the size of cell aggregates and formed blastula-like structures of different shapes (F and G) (arrowheads). At this stage, multibuds developed simultaneously in various regenerating niches (G) (arrowheads and red arrows, respectively), although separation between compartments had not been completed (G) (arrow). PCNA specifically stained newly formed bud spheres and blastula-like structures inside the regeneration niches (H). As development proceeded, axial polarity was observed with the appearance of differential cell layers (I) (arrowheads). From day 5, two invaginations from both corners of the thick vesicle wall creating two elongated double-walled folds were observed (J) (arrows). Between 10–14 days postseparation, the regeneration process reached the final stages, whereby a fully functional adult zooid was developed, including the formation of palleal buds (K). Only one zooid per regenerating fragment reached this final stage, while the others degenerated (L) (arrow).</p>

          <title>Phase II: Initial stages of regeneration.</title>
          <p>Multinucleated giant cells appeared at numerous locations throughout vasculature two days after dissection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b011">11</xref>]. Afterwards, aggregates of haemocytes, of 2–32 cell clusters, developed inside regeneration niches. These haemocytes that initially were observed peripherally next to the surrounding epithelium, are characterized by high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, strong hematoxylin staining, round shape, and small cell size (4–5 μm). Haemocyte aggregates varied in size (8–20 μm in diameter) and form small spherically shaped cell masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, arrows) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t001">Table 1</xref>). In time, continuous cell divisions (see below) increased the numbers of cells in the aggregates, forming an opaque ball of cells (up to 35 μm in diameter) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">2</xref>E) with heterogeneous cell numbers (up to 100). From day 2, the distinct PCNA staining was observed exclusively in the aggregated foci of haemocytes inside regeneration niches and in the cell balls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). The blood vessels' lumen was about 100–110 μm in diameter, and each large blood cell aggregate occupied about one-fifth of the vasculature volume. In fragments with many blood vessels (up to 92 in our experiments), a larger number of regeneration niches formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>G, red arrows), culminating in the simultaneous development of many small buds (as many as 24 buds per experiment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>C; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t001">Table 1</xref>).

          <p>From day 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t001">Table 1</xref>), changes within aggregates resulted in the formation of a single-layer epithelial sphere, enclosing an internal cell-free transparent space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). These blastula-like structures varied in size (10–95 μm in diameter), cell numbers (20–200), and shape, from round spheres and bell shapes to elliptic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">2</xref>G, arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">2</xref>H, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">2</xref>I). In three-day-old isolated fragments, PCNA specifically stained newly formed bud spheres inside regeneration niches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>H). By day 4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t001">Table 1</xref>), structural changes created blastula-like forms that revealed axial polarity on the cellular level. A thin single squamiform layer characterized the distal (from the vessel epithelium) side of the spheroid. Numerous cell layers were observed at the opposite pole facing the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>I).</p>
          <p>Continuous cell proliferation led to bud enlargement, which was significant because small buds failed to develop further (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t001">Table 1</xref>). As of day 5, development proceeded by two invaginations from both corners of the thick vesicle wall, creating two elongated double-walled folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>J, arrows). These folds gradually extended inward until the vesicle divided into a median and two lateral chambers, from which the prospective central pharyngeal chamber and a pair of lateral atrial chambers developed. Subsequently, both double-walled folds thickened, forming the sites for the future gill slits. In all cases but one, only a single bud per fragment reached this stage of organogenesis. Thereafter, internal organs continued to grow into a functional, sexually reproductive, filter-feeding adult zooid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>K). In all cases observed, the fastest developing buds reached final stages of organogenesis, whereas the development of other buds halted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>L, arrow); then they degenerated through an apoptotic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">Figure 2</xref>M–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g002">2</xref>P) and were subsequently absorbed.</p>

        <p>To gain insight into the temporal expression pattern of RAR during regeneration, total RNA was extracted from fragments of regenerating blood vessels at different developmental stages, and RT-PCR was performed using specific primers.

Characteristics of early-stage regeneration were similar between experimental cases (<italic>n</italic> = 22) and controls (<italic>n</italic> = 12) and also showed similarity to the previously characterized cases (<italic>n</italic> = 95). DEAB-treated regenerating ampullae shrank. While blood vessels in these fragments started directional movements inside the tunic matrix (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t002">Table 2</xref>), complete ampullar aggregations in the form of opaque masses of ampullae were never documented (<italic>n</italic> = 22). Instead, vessel coalescence had gradually slowed down and stopped completely after day 2, leaving blood vessels in an intermediate state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g005">Figure 5</xref>A; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). In control fragments, as in the former studied cases, zooids appeared 10–14 days postsurgery. In contrast, no single zooid had ever developed in any of the DEAB-treated fragments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t002">Table 2</xref>), even after a follow-up observational protocol of 30 d (<italic>n</italic> = 11) in which all DEAB-treated blood vessel fragments eventually degenerated. Similar results were obtained with the RA synthesis inhibitor Geranial, 3,7-Dimethyl-2,6-Octadienal (Citral). Two experimental groups were conducted using different concentrations of Citral, showing a dose-dependent phenotype, ranging from complete attenuation of vessel movements (at 60 μM) to complete aggregations (at 20 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g005">Figure 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g005">5</xref>C, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t002">Table 2</xref>).

            <p>Early stages of bud regeneration were blocked by different concentrations of RA inhibitors. With the administration of 100 μM of DEAB, vessel coalescence gradually slowed down and stopped completely after day 2 (A). Similar results were obtained with 60 μM of Citral (B), while with 20 μM of the same inhibitor ampullae changed orientation and migrated within the tunic but never regenerated a functional zooid (C). At the 100 μM DEAB concentration, buds had not developed, and multinucleated giant cells appeared, scattered throughout the vessel lumen (D, arrows). At the 10 μM DEAB concentration, morphologically abnormal buds were formed, which failed to develop organ structures, and retained a simple epithelial morphology (E). In severe cases, masses of undifferentiated aggregated cells occupied the interior of the vessel lumen (F). All malformed buds subsequently degenerated. PCNA immunostaining revealed distinctive proliferations at aggregated masses while no staining was detected in blood vessels (G). Scale bar in (A–C) represents 1 mm.

        <title>Disruption of RAR Function during Regeneration Causes Bud Malformations Similar to RA Synthetic Inhibition</title>
        <p>We disrupted RA receptor function by way of RNA interference (RNAi) as well as the RAR pan-antagonist BMS-493 separately. Ampullae, surgically separated from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. leachi</named-content> colonies, were soaked for 6 d in seawater containing control small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and siRNAs generated against Bl-RAR, as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b037">37</xref>]. Outcomes were morphologically monitored daily followed by histological analyses. Knockdown of Bl-RAR expression was verified in intact colonies after 6 d of incubation by comparing the abundance of RAR to actin transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). As clearly seen in siRNAs-treated colonies, RAR expression was nearly eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, lane 2) while no significant change was observed in the RNAi control experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, lane 1) compared to naïve colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, lane 3). Differences between control RNAi and RNAi experiment fragments were visible as of day 2, when blood vessels moved actively in control fragments, compared to arrest movement in siRNAs-treated fragments (unpublished data). After 6 d, control experiments using control siRNAs completed vasculature movements, forming opaque vessel masses as previously specified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). In contrast, no single opaque vessel mass appeared in RNAi affected experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 14). Instead, blood vessels remained apart, situated haphazardly within the tunic matrix as in the premature stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). In several experiments, vessel movement halted in an intermediate state, similarly to the chemically inhibited experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g006">Figure 6</xref>D).

        <p>Next, we examined the gain-of-function effects of RA on WBR by the systemic administration of 10 μM or 50 μM all-<italic>trans</italic> RA to regenerating blood vessel fragments (<italic>n</italic> = 28) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t002">Table 2</xref>). Control blood vessel fragments (<italic>n</italic> = 11) were immersed in seawater containing DMSO alone. On day 6, control fragments were still in the midregeneration stage, characterized by movements within the tunic matrix. However, in RA-treated fragments, vessels had already completed orientation within the tunic matrix (day 1), completed vasculature aggregations (days 1–4), and developed into opaque vessel masses. Furthermore, at the early day-6 stage, 11 of the RA-treated fragments (39%) had already developed fully functional adult zooids from the vessel masses with active atrial and peribranchial siphons.</p>
        <p>On day 6, all RA-treated fragments were sacrificed for histological examinations. Results showed further accelerated regeneration throughout the entire vasculature. Haemocytes aggregated systemically along blood vessels and not only near the vessel epithelium. Buds were present in many blood vessels and revealed extremely high variation in developmental states, from cell aggregates to well-developed zooids. The regenerating zooids manifested fully differentiated organ systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g007">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t001">Table 1</xref>), including stigmata with cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, arrows), a completed digestive system, and a pair of contracting siphons carrying normally developed tentacles. Different from normal blastogenic buds, blood cells colonized extensively these regenerating buds between atrial folds and throughout internal cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g007">Figure 7</xref>B, arrows). The consecutive generation of palleal buds, at progressive developmental stages, had already started to grow from both sides of the regenerating zooids. In one case, the regenerating bud progressed to the stage where secondary buds formed on the primary palleal buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g007">Figure 7</xref>C, arrow and arrowhead, respectively). In marked contrast to control regenerating fragments where only a single bud developed, numerous buds at different regeneration niches had simultaneously reached the final stages of organogenesis (2–5 functional zooids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050071-g007">Figure 7</xref>D, arrows), exhibiting fully differentiated organ systems that reproduced asexually through palleal budding.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Whereas most animals share the ability to repair damaged tissue, the phenomenon of massive body restoration is a rare event in highly complex animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b005">5</xref>]. Here, we studied the unique whole body regeneration phenomenon in a colonial urochordate, revealing the capability of rebuilding the entire zooid body from minute vasculature fragments. We defined three consecutive developmental phases, shedding light on a unique regeneration process that differs from known regeneration model systems in several fundamental criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t003">Table 3</xref>). In other epimorphic regenerations, restoration starts with the formation of a transient structure termed blastema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b038">38</xref>]. However, in the <italic>Botrylloides</italic> WBR, instead of blastema, regeneration niches are structured de novo inside vasculature. Furthermore, while a single restoration center is induced in all other model systems studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b005">5</xref>], a “multifocal regeneration niche” system is generated in the <italic>Botrylloides</italic> WBR. A possible explanation for this regeneration strategy in <italic>Botrylloides</italic> is the presence of a systemic inductive regeneration cue. Regeneration in Animalia is regularly induced by inductive signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b040">40</xref>]. In model systems, such as regeneration of limb in salamander or fin in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b042">42</xref>] it is regulated by locally induced signals. We suggest that in <italic>B. leachi,</italic> WBR, in contrast to other cases, signals might be propelled throughout circulation (cellular and humoral elements), leading to many regeneration foci in any single regeneration entity. The <italic>Botrylloides</italic> system is also the first documented case, to our knowledge, of WBR originating from circulating blood cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050071-t003">Table 3</xref>) and reveals the capability of restoring not only the soma, but also the germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b011">11</xref>].</p>

Any haphazardly isolated peripheral ampulla (out of hundreds of ampullae fringing in a single colony), containing only 100–300 circulating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b011">11</xref>], is capable of successful WBR. What is the cellular source of the regenerating bud? Their small cell size, cellular morphology, and strong ubiquitous hematoxylin staining suggest primitive stem cell origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b019">19</xref>]; however, direct proof should be addressed in further controlled studies.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Botrylloides</italic> WBR, as in embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b043">43</xref>], the transformation of the initial state of aggregated cells into complete animal structures reveals a fundamental attribute of animal development. Both processes have very different starting points (a fertilized egg versus pluripotent blood cells); yet both converge at a common endpoint of adult morphology through the establishment of body axes, self-assembly, and differentiation of tissues and organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b045">45</xref>]. We can draw close morphological similarities between the initial developmental stages in <italic>Botrylloides</italic> WBR (cell aggregates, development of blastula-like structures, and invaginations of epithelial layers) and fundamental embryonic developmental stages (morula, blastula, and gastrula). A similar resemblance transpires when comparing <italic>Hydra</italic> WBR from dissociated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b046">46</xref>] to embryonic development, implying a basic evolutionary root underlying whole body restoration events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b048">48</xref>].</p>
      <p>The conserved signaling pathways governing the development of tissues and organs are one of the major objects in developmental biology. Redeployment of these embryonic signaling pathways at different biological contexts enables quicker responses by multicellular organisms to adverse environmental conditions, such as RA signaling in the regeneration of specific tissues and organs in various vertebrate model systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b050">50</xref>]. A functional example of redeployment of a developmental mechanism comes from the mammalian central nervous system. Embryonic central nervous system undergoes regeneration through RARβ2-stimulated RA signaling, unlike adult central nervous system, which does not express RARβ2. Redeployment of RA signaling through overexpression of RARβ2 indeed promotes functional regeneration of adult central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b031">31</xref>].</p>
      <p>It had already been shown that RAR is expressed in mesenchymal cells of developing buds in the colonial tunicate <italic>P. misakiensis,</italic> where it regulates developmental aspects in normal budding processes, including the induction of a secondary axis in developing buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b053">53</xref>]. Following the evaluation of the biological redeployment strategy, this study reveals, for the first time to our knowledge, the important roles of RA in botryllid ascidian WBR. We show that RAR is expressed during WBR, specifically in haemocytes within the vasculature. In contrast to tissue- and organ-specific expression patterns of RA receptors in vertebrates, RAR expression in botryllid regeneration does not follow developmental processes expressed in normal blastogenesis of tissue and organ structuring, but is expressed ubiquitously throughout the entire body. This observation suggests that in addition to its role in early stages of regeneration, RAR expression also represents other RA activities, such as maintenance or other yet unknown proceedings. We further show that the entire body of developing zooids is susceptible to RA signaling. The use of both DEAB, Citral, BMS-493, and RNAi-mediated knockdown of Bl-RAR to disrupt RA synthesis and RA receptor function, collectively result in WBR arrest and bud malformation. The administration of all-<italic>trans</italic> RA into fragments of blood vessels results in accelerated regeneration and the unusual development of multibuds, leading to restored colonies with multiple functional zooids. This observation could indicate that in regular <italic>Botrylloides</italic> WBR, the systemic developmental inhibition of all buds but one, could be achieved by controlling the levels of RA transcriptional cascade. We found, during early stages of WBR, that highly Aldedh-positive macrophages form foci of expression that correspond to foci of multiple initiations of regeneration, strengthening the notion that RA is required for the early stages of this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b055">55</xref>].</p>
      <p>Regeneration as a central discipline in biology holds great promise not only for the understanding of species-specific developmental issues, but also for deduction of its evolutionary roots and for medical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b056">56</xref>]. In the past few years, ascidians have become model organisms for the study of a wide variety of biological phenomena, including developmental processes, embryogenesis, stem cell biology, and immunology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b060">60</xref>]. This group of organisms demonstrates basic mechanisms of biological phenomena, similar to those observed in vertebrates. In light of the unique regenerative power of botryllid ascidians, WBR in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. leachi</named-content> may serve as a model system for studying the evolutionary roots of organ regeneration, lost in most vertebrate taxa.</p>

        <p>Colonies of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. leachi</named-content> were collected from underneath stones in shallow waters along the Mediterranean coast of Israel. The colonies, with thin layers of stony material attached to them, were carefully pealed off from the substratum using industrial razor blades and individually tied with fine threads onto 5 × 7.5-cm glass slides. Colonies were cultured on slides placed in 17-l tanks of standing seawater system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b033">33</xref>]. Within several days of culture, ampullar contractions and expansions resulted in complete or partial sliding of colonies from their natural calcareous substrate onto the glass slides. Colonies were cleaned weekly by carefully removing debris (empty substrates and other settled organisms) from the glass slides with industrial razor blades and fine brushes.</p>
        <p>Isolation of marginal ampullae and blood vessel fragments was performed under a dissecting microscope using an industrial razor blade and a fine tungsten needle. Next, the dissected colonies were removed from the glass slides onto other slides, and the colonial fragments were cut further into smaller fragments using a fine tungsten needle. Blood vessel fragments were left to regenerate in 17-l tanks and were monitored daily by observing slides under a dissecting microscope. Whole fragment pictures were taken with a Supercam camera (Applitec, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.applitec.co.il" xlink:type="simple">http://www.applitec.co.il</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>Immunohistochemistry and general histology were performed as described by Lapidot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050071-b061">61</xref>]. Dissected blood vessels were fixed in Bouin's solution for 1 h, dehydrated in 70% ethanol, and embedded in paraffin wax. For general histological observations, we used the regular hematoxylin-eosin staining protocol. For immunohistochemistry, serial 5-μm thick sections were prepared, attached to SuperFrost Plus microscope slides (Menzel-Glaser, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.menzel.de" xlink:type="simple">http://www.menzel.de</ext-link>), dewaxed, and antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving (480 W) the sections for 30 min in 10-mM citrate buffer (600 ml, [pH 6], 30 min). After a 5-min cooling period, up to 1 l in volume distilled water was added, and the slides were incubated for additional 10 min at room temperature, followed by several washes with TBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity in the sections was blocked by incubation in Dako EnVision<sup>+</sup> System Peroxidase block (AEC, catalogue number K4005, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dako.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.dako.com</ext-link>,) for 6 min, and the slides were washed with water.

The slides were washed with TBS for 10 min, stained with a mouse anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (Dakocytomation, 1:100 in TBS, 100 μl per slide) for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing with TBS for 5 min × 3, peroxidase-labeled polymer-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dako EnVision<sup>+</sup>) was added; the sections were incubated for 1 h and washed with TBS for 5 min × 3. Then, 2–3 drops of AEC substrate, chromogen (3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole hydroperoxide, Dako, EnVision<sup>+</sup>) was added for 20–60 min (upon judgment), and the reaction was stopped by rinsing with distilled water.
