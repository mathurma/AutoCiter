The prevalence of CpG substitutions is due to their mutational origin, which is dependent on DNA methylation. In comparison, other single nucleotide substitutions (for example those occurring at GpC dinucleotides) mainly arise from errors during DNA replication. Here we analyzed high quality BAC-based data from human, chimpanzee, and baboon to investigate regional variation of CpG substitution rates.</p><p>We show that CpG substitutions occur approximately 15 times more frequently than other single nucleotide substitutions in primate genomes, and that they exhibit substantial regional variation. Patterns of CpG rate variation are consistent with differences in methylation level and susceptibility to subsequent deamination. In particular, we propose a “distance-decaying” hypothesis, positing that due to the molecular mechanism of a CpG substitution, rates are correlated with the stability of double-stranded DNA surrounding each CpG dinucleotide, and the effect of local DNA stability may decrease with distance from the CpG dinucleotide.</p><p>Consistent with our “distance-decaying” hypothesis, rates of CpG substitution are strongly (negatively) correlated with regional G+C content. The influence of G+C content decays as the distance from the target CpG site increases. We estimate that the influence of local G+C content extends up to 1,500∼2,000 bps centered on each CpG site. We also show that the distance-decaying relationship persisted when we controlled for the effect of long-range homogeneity of nucleotide composition. GpC sites, in contrast, do not exhibit such “distance-decaying” relationship. Our results highlight an example of the distinctive properties of methylation-dependent substitutions versus substitutions mostly arising from errors during DNA replication. Furthermore, the negative relationship between G+C content and CpG rates may provide an explanation for the observation that GC-rich SINEs show lower CpG rates than other repetitive elements.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Mutations are raw materials of evolution. Earlier studies have shown that mutations occur at different frequencies in different genomic regions. By investigating the patterns and causes of such “regional” variation of mutations, we can better understand the mechanisms of underlying mutagenesis. In the human and other mammalian genomes, the most common type of mutation is caused by DNA methylation, which targets cytosines followed by guanine (CpG dinucleotides). Methylated cytosines are then subject to spontaneous deamination, which will cause a C to T (or G to A) transition (CpG substitution). Because this mutational process is unique to CpG substitutions, we reasoned that they might show different patterns of variability from other substitutions. Using high quality genomic sequences from primates and by separately analyzing variability of CpG substitutions and other substitutions, we demonstrate that CpG substitutions occur approximately 15 times more frequently than other substitutions, and show a distinctive pattern of regional variability. Particularly, we propose and provide evidence that because the deamination step requires temporary strand separation, G+C composition near 1,500–2,000 bps each direction from a target CpG affects the probability of a CpG substitution. Incorporating the difference in CpG and other substitutions discovered in this study will help build more realistic evolutionary models.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>SVY is supported by funds from the Georgia Institute of Technology.

While most studies consider all types of point mutations together, different types of mutations arise from distinctive molecular processes. In this paper, we contrasted regional variations of two types of mutations that are prevalent in mammalian genomes according to their molecular origins.</p><p>The first type of point mutations we consider are transitions at CpG dinucleotides, which are caused primarily by methylation of cytosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Sved1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Bird1">[8]</xref>. Methylation followed by deamination causes a C to T transition (or G to A transition in the complementary strand) at a CpG dinucleotide. We refer to C to T (or G to A) substitutions at a CpG site as “CpG substitutions”. These are the most frequent point mutation in the human genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Consortium1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Arndt1">[9]</xref>, and often the basis of human genetic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Li1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Keshet1">[11]</xref>. In contrast, most other point mutations are believed to occur from errors in DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Li2">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Here we show that CpG substitutions occur over one order of magnitude more frequently than other substitutions in primate genomes, and that they exhibit substantial regional variability. We investigated the causes of regional variability of CpG rates. We pay a particular attention to the role of regional sequence context, based upon the differences in mutational mechanisms.</p><p>In particular, efficiency of the deamination step may affect regional variation of CpG substitutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell1">[13]</xref>. A prerequisite for the deamination process is the insertion of a water molecule between the DNA strands, via temporary <italic>melting</italic> or strand separation, which requires thermodynamic energy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Frederico2">[15]</xref>. Bonds between G and C nucleotides require more thermodynamic energy to break, compared with A and T nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Wartell1">[16]</xref>. Therefore, the substitution rate at CpG dinucleotides may be negatively correlated with GC content (defined as the percentage of G and C nucleotides). There are conflicting conclusions on this relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Meunier1">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, it is unlikely that the G+C content of the whole sequence segment affects the probability of a CpG site to mutate. Rather, the effect of G+C content on CpG substitution may be confined to sites that are nearby the CpG site. In other words, the effect of sequence context on a CpG substitution is likely to be <italic>local</italic>. Moreover, we predict this effect will decay as the distance to the target CpG site increases. Therefore, we predict that G+C content has a strong <italic>distance-decaying</italic> influence on the CpG substitution rate, because only <italic>local DNA melting</italic> is required for deamination to occur. We present evidence that is consistent with our <italic>distance-decaying local GC influence hypothesis</italic>.</p><p>In addition to our main results on the distance-decaying relationship, we discuss other causative factors of regional heterogeneity of CpG substitution rates. These include differential methylation of some transposable elements and potential variation of mismatch repair efficiency. The factors causing regional CpG substitution rate variation outlined in this paper are important in the study of genome evolution, and in the inference of phylogenetic histories. Our work also highlights the distinct properties of mutations that are dependent on DNA methylation as opposed to those mainly caused by errors during replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CpG Substitution Rate Exhibits Substantial Regional Variation</title><p>We analyzed approximately 38 million orthologous sites from human, chimpanzee, and baboon obtained by aligning genomic DNA segments from these species. We used only high quality Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) based sequences in all of our analyses. Sequences that resulted from low-coverage whole genome shotgun sequencing projects, which may harbor errors in sequencing and assembly, were not used. We then extracted only non-coding sequences (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Methods</xref>) to analyze patterns of substitution rate variation free from the effect of natural selection. Our final non-coding data set included approximately ∼14.7 million aligned sites from 17 chromosomes.</p><p>We used a parsimony method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Meunier1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Taylor1">[23]</xref> to identify sites that have been part of a CpG dinucleotide in the recent past (“CpG sites”). In addition, using the same method, we identified sites that have been part of a GpC dinucleotide (“GpC sites”, see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Methods</xref> section for details). Because GpC dinucleotides consist of the same bases (C and G) as CpG dinucleotides, while not involved in DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Razin1">[24]</xref>, they are often used as a dinucleotide control for CpG sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Zhao1">[25]</xref>. We also analyzed all sites that have not been a part of a CpG dinucleotide during the given evolutionary timescale (“non-CpG sites”, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Meunier2">[22]</xref>). Note that GpC sites are a subset of non-CpG sites. Results from non-CpG sites were similar to that from GpC sites (see below).</p><p>It is important to note that a great majority of CpG sites in certain regions, called CpG islands, of mammalian genomes are typically hypo-methylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Bird2">[26]</xref> and hence do not undergo methylation-origin mutation process. Therefore, it is crucial to exclude CpG islands from our analyses. We used similar but slightly more stringent criteria to those proposed by Takai and Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Takai1">[27]</xref>, a widely used method, to identify and exclude CpG islands in our data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Methods</xref>). We chose to use a shorter length cutoff than the conventional length as proposed in an earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-GardinerGarden1">[28]</xref>, so that our method will be conservative in terms of masking true CpG islands.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000015-t001">Table 1</xref> describes the numbers of CG-&gt;TA transition substitutions in CpG and GpC sites in our dataset. Note that even though there are over an order more GpC sites than CpG sites in our data, the total numbers of CpG and GpC transition substitutions are similar. This observation confirms that CpG substitutions occur much more frequently than other types of substitutions in the human genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Consortium1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Nachman1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Siepel1">[30]</xref>. For simplicity, we refer to the proportion of the number of transition substitutions to the total number of (CpG or GpC) sites as the “rate of substitution” in the rest of our paper, which implies that the unit of timescale is since the divergence of the genomes of humans and chimpanzees. The rate of CpG substitution in intergenic regions and introns are 14.29±0.4%, and 13.88±0.5%, respectively. The rate of GpC substitution in intergenic regions and introns are 1.12±0.037% and 0.98±0.043%, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="pcbi-1000015-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000015.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Description of the Dataset.</title></caption><!--===== Grouping alternate versions of objects =====--><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi-1000015-t001-1" mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000015.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><table><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Type of site</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Intergenic</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Introns</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">No. sites</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">No. substitutions<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">*</xref></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">No. sites</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">No. substitutions<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">*</xref></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">CpG</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Repetitive</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">11257</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1761</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">6941</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">985</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Non-repetitive</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">11277</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1460</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">7631</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1038</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Total</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">22534</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">3221</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">14572</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2023</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">GpC</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Repetitive</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">154760</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1844</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">84577</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">827</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Non-repetitive</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">152695</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1619</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">111815</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1106</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Total</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">307455</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">3463</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">196392</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1933</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>The number of CpG and GpC sites identified in our dataset and the number of CG-&gt;TA transition substitution in these sites.</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><label>*</label><p>CG-&gt;TA transition substitutions only.

Because the average length of the introns in our dataset was only ∼5.5 kb [small as compared to the average length of intergenic regions (119 kb)], a large proportion of CpG sites in introns will have a large portion of their sliding windows lie in exons (the sliding windows extended up to 5 kb around each CpG site, see below). Therefore, we used only intergenic CpG sites in this analysis, to minimize the effects of constraints related to coding for amino acids and natural selection. When we included a subset of intronic CpG sites that are at least 3 kb away from an exon in our analyses, the results were the same (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000015.s006">Figure S5</xref>). Thus, the observed pattern is a common feature of non-coding regions in primate genomes.</p><p>At each distance, we binned CpG sites with similar G+C content (as measured from the 200 bps sliding window) at that distance from the site. The cutoffs used for binning were &lt;38%, 38%–45%, 45%–52%, &gt;52%. These cut-offs divided the data into similar bin size and also roughly corresponded to the traditional definition of isochores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Bernardi1">[31]</xref>. For each distance <italic>i</italic>, and each G+C content bin, we then calculated the rate of CpG substitution (as the proportion of CpG sites that are mutated). More formally, for each G+C content bin <italic>B</italic>, we considered:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000015.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p><p>The results of this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. We observed a clear effect of G+C content of windows close (less than 2,000 bps in each direction) to the target CpG site. Higher G+C content in the window lowers the CpG substitution rate (as expected from the negative relationship between G+C content and CpG rate, reported in the previous section). This effect is the most pronounced at distances very close to the target CpG site. For example, ∼17% of the CpG sites exhibiting low G+C content (GC&lt;38%; red color curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) at distance 100 bps are mutated, while the same measure for CpG sites with high G+C content (GC&gt;52%; black color curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) at distance 100 bps is ∼11%. As we move farther away from the CpG site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; left to right along the X axis), the rate of CpG substitution in the low G+C bin (red color curve) and the high G+C bin (black color curve) progressively become closer to each other, displaying the distance-decaying effect of G+C content on the rate of CpG substitution. This effect appears to vanish at around 2,000 bps from the CpG site (i.e., 4,000 bps around the CpG site).</p><fig id="pcbi-1000015-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000015.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Sliding window analysis of the relationship between CpG substitution rate and G+C content of windows.</title><p>(A) At each distance (along the X-axis), CpG sites were divided into four bins based on G+C content at that distance from the site (as measured from the G+C content of the 200 bps window centered at that distance; G+C&lt;38: red curve, 38&lt; = G+C&lt;45%: green curve, 45&lt; = G+C&lt;52%: blue curve, G+C&gt;52%: black curve).

At distances closer to the CpG site, the rate of substitution in high local-GC bins (black curve) is clearly lower compared to that of low local-GC bins (red curve). This relationship progressively declines as we move farther away from the site, suggesting a distance-decaying relationship between G+C content and CpG substitution rate.

Even when variation in <italic>GC<sub>global</sub></italic> was removed, we found the same decaying effect of local G+C content on the rate of CpG substitution (CpG curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g004">Figure 4A, and 4B</xref>).

A similar distribution of G+C content was observed in case of 100 kb segments surrounding GpC sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000015.s003">Figure S2B</xref>). These bimodal distributions occur because the number of CpG sites and GpC sites are expected to increase with the G+C content of the non-coding region. To reduce variation in <italic>GC<sub>global</sub></italic>, we analyzed these two distributions (which we call as low- <italic>GC<sub>global</sub></italic> and high-<italic>GC<sub>global</sub></italic> regions) separately.</p><p>We performed the sliding window analysis to test for the distance-decaying effect of local G+C content in low-<italic>GC<sub>global</sub></italic> and high-<italic>GC<sub>global</sub></italic> regions (without normalizing). In the case of CpG sites in low-<italic>GC<sub>global</sub></italic> regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000015.s004">Figure S3A and S3B</xref>), we obtained similar results as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g004">Figure 4A</xref>.

These fluctuations are caused by the reduced sample size in this bin (data not shown). Nevertheless, the distance-decaying effect is clear when we consider the curves of high and low local-G+C content bins (black and red curves CpG, respectively, in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000015.s005">Figure S4A</xref>). Consistent with the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the distance from the CpG site at which the curves converged was ∼1,500 bps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000015.s004">Figure S3A</xref>).

These results were robust to using the flanking 5 kb or 20 kb window for the normalization, different window sizes, and non-overlapping windows (results not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Other Factors That Cause Variation of CpG Substitution Rates</title><p>The previous sections analyzed the effect of the efficiency of deamination step on CpG substitution rates. In this section we briefly discuss other factors that cause regional heterogeneity of CpG substitution rates.</p><p>For this purpose we consider that a CpG substitution occurs in a three-step process (this is a simplification, but for our purposes this view suffices). First, DNA methylation in mammals (and other warm-blooded vertebrates) occurs specifically at the cytosine bases of CpG dinucleotides. Second, the methylated cytosine undergoes spontaneous deamination. Deaminated methyl-cytosine is identical to thymine, creating a C to T mismatch at the CpG dinucleotide. Third, if this mismatch is left un-repaired, it causes a C to T transition (or a G to A transition in the complementary strand) in the next replication cycle. Based upon such molecular mechanism of the origin of CpG substitution, their rates may vary due to differences in (i) levels of germline methylation, (ii) efficiency of deamination of a methylated cytosine, and (iii) repair efficiency of a transition that occurred via deamination of a methylated cytosine.</p><p>A strong support for the first cause, differential methylation, is the observation that transposable elements have generally higher rates of CpG substitutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Meunier1">[19]</xref>. Proliferation of transposable elements can potentially impose several deleterious effects on a genome, because insertion of transposable elements can disrupt gene regulation, or cause deleterious recombination events, translocations and other rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Yoder1">[32]</xref>. Hence, some organisms may use DNA methylation as a defense mechanism against the proliferation of transposable elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Meunier1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Selker1">[33]</xref>.</p><p>In our data, we found that transposable elements as a whole exhibit ∼14% higher CpG substitution rate as compared to that of non-repetitive regions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000015.s001">Text S1</xref>). Overall, there is a significant positive correlation between CpG rates and the proportion of transposable elements in a non-coding segment (<italic>ρ = </italic>0.142; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 and <italic>ρ<sub>tr</sub> = </italic>0.199; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), consistent with the idea that transposable elements have higher CpG substitution rates as a consequence of increased methylation.</p><p>Interestingly, when transposable elements were divided into different classes of elements (LTR, LINE, SINE and DNA elements), SINEs showed similar level of CpG rates to non-repetitive sequences. This was also observed by Meunier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Meunier1">[19]</xref>, who proposed that it might be a consequence of the complex methylation pattern of SINEs in germline cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Chesnokov1">[34]</xref>. However, another possibility is that SINEs show lower CpG rate because their G+C content is in general higher compared to other classes of transposable elements, in light of our finding that there is a negative relationship between CpG substitution rates and G+C contents (see above). SINEs have the highest G+C content among the classes of transposable elements considered in our analyses (50.7%, while 36.6%, 44.0%, 36.4%, for LINEs, LTRs and DNA transposons). This mechanism can at least partially explain why SINEs have lower CpG substitution rates. Because a major proportion of CpG sites in the transposable elements of introns were contributed by SINEs, the rate of CpG substitution in intronic transposable elements is comparable to that of intronic non-repetitive regions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000015.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p><p>If the efficiency of the third step, namely mismatch repair, affects regional variation of CpG substitution rates, we expect to see a significant negative correlation between recombination rates and CpG substitution rates. Indeed, we did find a significant negative correlation between recombination rates and the rates of CpG transition substitution (Spearman’s <italic>ρ</italic> = −0.165, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). This can be due to the direct effect of biased gene conversion acting on mutations at CpG sites, repairing the TG mismatches (caused by deamination of methyl-cytosine) to correct CG base pairs, the efficiency of which depends on the rate of recombination. Alternatively, biased gene conversion may increase G+C content, which in turn reduces the intensity of DNA melting, leading to a lower rate of substitution at CpG sites. In the first scenario, a significant correlation between CpG substitution rate and recombination rate is expected independent of the effect of G+C content. In the second scenario, the effect of recombination may disappear after correcting for G+C content. In our case, there was no significant correlation after removing the effect of G+C content using partial correlation analysis (<italic>ρ</italic><sub>recombination, CpG rate | GC</sub> = −0.03, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). However, this question needs to be revisited with more data, most certainly when a higher-quality whole genome alignment of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque becomes available.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Even though the prevalence and importance of CpG substitutions is long recognized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Bird1">[8]</xref>, the causes and patterns of their regional variation have been relatively little explored. In this study, we analyzed a large amount of high-quality genome sequence data (based upon BAC-clones) to provide a better understanding on the patterns and causes of variation of CpG substitution rates in primate genomes.</p><p>The negative relationship between CpG substitution rate and G+C content is consistent with the idea that variations in the efficiency of the deamination process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Frederico2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell2">[17]</xref> cause regional variation of CpG substitution rates. On the other hand, biased gene conversion can also explain this relationship. Even though we cannot distinguish the relative contributions of these two processes by our analysis, the distance-decaying relationship between G+C content and CpG substitution rate strengthens the former hypothesis.</p><p>Our distance-decaying hypothesis is contradictory to conclusions drawn by Fryxell and Moon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell2">[17]</xref> and Zhao and Jiang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Zhao1">[25]</xref>. Fryxell and Moon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell2">[17]</xref> conclude that G+C content of short and long segments surrounding each CpG site has similar degrees of correlations with the rate of CpG substitutions; this is clearly counter to the distance-decaying influence hypothesis. However, their analysis was based on a considerably smaller dataset (a total of 4437 CpG and GpC sites, as compared to 497467 sites used in this study; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000015-t001">Table 1</xref>), and only two length scales (564 bps and 163 kb) were analyzed. In another study, Zhao and Jiang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Zhao1">[25]</xref> analyzed a larger human SNP dataset (292216 CpG and GpC sites) and observed that the absolute value of the slope of the relationship between log (CpG substitution rate) and G+C content <italic>increased</italic> with the length over which G+C content was measured (segment lengths of 101 bps to 1,001 bps around the CpG site). Their results are counter to the thermodynamic mechanisms which were first suggested by Fryxell and Zuckerkandl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell1">[13]</xref> and now drive our hypothesis. The discrepancy is likely due to the different method and dataset used by Zhao and Jiang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Zhao1">[25]</xref>, as compared to our study (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000015.s001">Text S1</xref> for details). Our results in this vein support the thermodynamic mechanism.</p><p>Our analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g004">Figure 4</xref>) show that the CpG substitution rate has a significantly stronger relationship with the <italic>local</italic> G+C content. The influence of the G+C content decays with the distance to the target CpG site, subsiding at around 1,500–2,000 bps for each direction. There are at least two immediate questions raised by our analysis. First, what are the causes of the local distance-decaying relationship, which extends up to 1,500–2,000 bps? Given the absence of evidence for the effect of transcription coupled repair or transcription induced deamination (only intergenic regions were analyzed), or change in mutational biases over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Arndt1">[9]</xref>, we propose that the distance-decaying relationship may be a consequence of the poorly understood mechanism of DNA melting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Lilley1">[35]</xref>, which is required for the deamination process.</p><p>The second question is whether there is both global and local effect of G+C content on CpG substitution rate. We raise this question because it is possible that only the local G+C content may affect the CpG substitution rate, and the global effect is a consequence of the so-called “isochore” structure, which causes a positive correlation between local G+C content and global G+C content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Bernardi1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-EyreWalker1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Nekrutenko1">[37]</xref>. Although the answer to this question is still unclear and more direct experiments are required, the convergence of CpG curves when the data is divided into low-GC<italic><sub>global</sub></italic> and high-GC<italic><sub>global</sub></italic> distributions (For example, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000015.s003">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>) despite the fact that there is some variation in GC<italic><sub>global</sub></italic> even within these distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000015.s002">Figure S1A</xref>) suggests that GC<italic><sub>global</sub></italic> may not have a direct effect on the rate of CpG substitution.</p><p>We found a negative relationship between GpC substitution rate and G+C content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As suggested by Fryxell and Moon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Fryxell2">[17]</xref>, this relationship can be explained by biased gene conversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Galtier1">[38]</xref> or by regional differences in the deamination of unmethylated cytosines (an underlying mutational bias). In the absence of a distance-decaying relationship between GpC substitution rate and local G+C content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000015-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), which is expected if deamination plays a major role in causing GpC substitution rate variation, it seems more likely that biased gene conversion is the cause of the negative relationship between G+C content and GpC substitution rate.</p><p>Our results demonstrate the significance of the distinctive properties exhibited by methylation dependent substitutions versus substitutions caused by other molecular mechanisms. Models of molecular evolution and methods of phylogenetic inference, especially those concerned with mammalian and bird genomes (which have high rates of CpG substitutions), may benefit by considering the local effect of G+C content on CpG substitution rates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Hwang1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Arndt2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Siepel1">[30]</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>General Approach</title><p>We can use a parsimony method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Meunier1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Taylor1">[23]</xref> to infer CpG sites and determine the substitution rate in humans and chimpanzees using baboon as an outgroup.

Because methylation of the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides is a prerequisite for the CG-&gt;TA mutation to occur (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Introduction</xref>), it is crucial for our analyses to exclude CpG sites in CpG islands. Takai and Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Takai1">[27]</xref> proposed that a good definition of CpG islands is- a region of the genome with (a) G+C content &gt;55%, (b) length &gt;500 bps and (c) observed/expected proportion of CpG dinucleotides (OE) &gt;0.65.

Specifically, CpG sites are the middle base of the sites having the following human/chimpanzee/baboon patterns: XNG/XCG/XCG or XCG/XNG/XCG, where X is any nucleotide except G. Given the evolutionary distances considered here, in spite of the hypermutability of CpG sites, such a definition is shown to be quite accurate by a simulation study in Meunier and Duret <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000015-Meunier2">[22]</xref>. GpC sites are sites having the following human/chimpanzee/baboon pattern GNY/GCY/GCY or GCY/GNY/GCY, where Y is any nucleotide except G. The restrictions on X and Y were imposed to avoid overlapping CpG and GpC sites. Non-CpG sites are defined as sites not preceded by a C and not followed by a G. Sites following the complementary patterns of the above definitions were also considered as CpG and GpC and non-CpG sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Substitution Rate Estimates and Statistical Tests</title><p>To obtain better estimates of substitution rates, we pooled together substitutions in human and chimpanzee lineages.
