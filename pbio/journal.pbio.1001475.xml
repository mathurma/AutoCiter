      <abstract>
        <p>Multiple epigenetic marks have been proposed to contribute to the regulation of antigen receptor gene assembly via V(D)J recombination. Here we provide a comprehensive view of DNA methylation at the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene locus prior to and during V(D)J recombination. DNA methylation did not correlate with the histone modification state on unrearranged alleles, indicating that these epigenetic marks were regulated independently. Instead, pockets of tissue-specific demethylation were restricted to DNase I hypersensitive sites within this locus. Though unrearranged diversity (D<sub>H</sub>) and joining (J<sub>H</sub>) gene segments were methylated, DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions created after the first recombination step were largely demethylated in pro-, pre-, and mature B cells. Junctional demethylation was highly localized, B-lineage-specific, and required an intact tissue-specific enhancer, Eμ. We propose that demethylation occurs after the first recombination step and may mark the junction for secondary recombination.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is implicated in the regulation of gene expression in mammals. However, the regulation of DNA methylation itself is less clear despite recent advances in identifying enzymes that add or remove methyl groups. We have investigated the dynamics of DNA methylation during genome rearrangements that assemble antigen receptor genes in developing B lymphocytes to determine whether methylation status correlates with rearrangement potential. Two recombination events generate immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes. The first step brings together diversity (D<sub>H</sub>) and joining (J<sub>H</sub>) gene segments to produce DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions. We show that both gene segments are methylated prior to rearrangement, whereas the DJ<sub>H</sub> product is demethylated. DJ<sub>H</sub> junctional demethylation is tissue-specific and requires an enhancer, Eμ, located within the IgH locus. The latter observations indicate that localized demethylation of the DJ<sub>H</sub> junction occurs after the first recombination step and thus does not guide this first step of IgH gene assembly. Our working hypothesis is that recombination induces demethylation of recombinant product and may mark the junction for the second step of IgH rearrangement, juxtaposition of variable (V<sub>H</sub>) gene segments to rearranged DJ<sub>H</sub> products to produce fully recombined V(D)J alleles.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Tissue-specific gene expression requires multiple epigenetic changes. These include nuclear location, chromatin remodeling, covalent histone modifications, and DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Bird1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Sexton1">[4]</xref>. Recent genome-wide analyses reveal several important correlations between gene activity and epigenetic modifications. Transcriptionally inactive genes are marked by histone H3 methylation at lysines 9 and 27 (H3K9me, H3K27me), whereas histone acetylation and H3K4 methylation are associated with gene activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Lee1">[5]</xref>. H3K9 acetylation and H3K4 methylation have been inversely correlated with CpG methylation, consistent with the long-established view that transcriptionally active promoters are hypomethylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Vaissiere1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Most studies of CpG methylation vis-à-vis transcription have focused on gene promoters, particularly those that contain CpG islands (CGI). Such promoters are typically un-methylated and are transcriptionally active; conversely, methylated CGI promoters are usually transcriptionally silent. The role of CpG methylation in non-CGI promoters is less clear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Jones1">[7]</xref>. Many tissue-specific promoters fall in this category and, in a limited number of cases where examined, such promoters also have reduced CpG methylation in tissues where they are active. Most recently, the advent of whole genome CpG mapping has drawn attention to possible functions of CpG methylation within gene bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Maunakea1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Deaton1">[9]</xref>. Proposed functions for such CpGs include transcription elongation and the regulation of splicing. The lack of a coherent picture for the role of CpG methylation in non-CGI contexts indicates an ongoing need for analysis of CpG methylation, particularly in tissue-specific genes that lack CGIs.</p>
      <p>Antigen receptor genes of B and T lymphocytes serve as excellent paradigms for developmentally regulated gene expression. Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes are assembled during B lymphocyte development by juxtaposition of variable (V<sub>H</sub>), diversity (D<sub>H</sub>), and joining (J<sub>H</sub>) gene segments by a process known as V(D)J recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Bassing1">[10]</xref>. The mouse genome contains approximately 150 V<sub>H</sub> gene segments, 10 to 13 D<sub>H</sub> gene segments, and four J<sub>H</sub> gene segments, dispersed over 2 Mb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Chevillard1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Johnston1">[12]</xref>. D<sub>H</sub> to J<sub>H</sub> recombination occurs first, followed by V<sub>H</sub> recombination to the rearranged DJ<sub>H</sub> junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These two steps produce a fully recombined V(D)J allele, with the potential to encode heavy chain protein. IgH expressing cells develop into pre-B cells where immunoglobulin κ or λ light chain genes rearrange. Cells that make both IgH and IgL polypeptides express cell surface immunoglobulin, and are exported out of the bone marrow to become mature functional B cells.</p>

Histone H3 and H4 acetylation are shown in orange and presence of heterochromatic H3K9 methylation by the red line. Vertical red arrows represent the tissue-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites in the germline state. Next two lines show sequential stages of VDJ recombination at the IgH locus. D<sub>H</sub> to J<sub>H</sub> rearrangement occurs first resulting in a DJ<sub>H</sub> junction and, depending on which D<sub>H</sub> rearranges, residual upstream unrearranged D<sub>H</sub>s may be present. V<sub>H</sub> rearrangement occurs to the DJ<sub>H</sub> junction to generate a VDJ<sub>H</sub> junction; during this process unrearranged D<sub>H</sub>s are lost from the genome.</p>

      <p>DNA methylation was the earliest epigenetic mark associated with immunoglobulin gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Mather1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Storb1">[14]</xref>. Using a variety of cell lines, these pioneering studies showed that Vκ promoters that were rearranged, and therefore transcriptionally active, lacked CpG methylation. Because these studies used restriction enzyme isoschisomers, it was difficult to define the extent of demethylation on recombined κ alleles in these studies; however, a site located approximately 10 kb 5′ of the promoter of a rearranged Vκ21 remained methylated. Subsequently, studies by Bergman, Cedar and colleagues showed that one κ allele is preferentially demethylated at a site close to the Cκ exons at the pre-B cell stage of B cell differentiation. Preferential Vκ recombination of the demethylated allele led them to propose that demethylation permits Vκ to Jκ recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Mostoslavsky1">[15]</xref>. Analyses of transgenic mice containing synthetic recombination substitutes were also consistent with the idea that demethylated alleles recombine preferentially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Engler1">[16]</xref>,. Additionally, de-methylation state of this site has also been proposed to play a role in somatic hypermutation in germinal centers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Fraenkel1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Compared to these extensive studies at the κ locus, relatively little is known about developmental regulation of DNA methylation at the IgH locus. Two relatively recent studies evaluated the role of methylation in V<sub>H</sub> gene rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Johnson1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Espinoza1">[20]</xref>. Within the small family of V<sub>H</sub>S107 genes, the methylation status of one CpG in pro-B cells correlated with recombination potential. Both studies also examined the status of the 3′-most V<sub>H</sub> gene segment, V<sub>H</sub> 81X, that rearranges most frequently. Two CpG sites within the coding region remained methylated in pro-B cells whereas a CpG near the recombination signal sequence was demethylated. However, the extent of demethylation of all genes examined was comparable in pro-B cells where V<sub>H</sub> genes recombine and in non-B lineage cells where V<sub>H</sub> genes do not recombine. Thus, methylation status could not be directly correlated with rearrangement potential. More importantly, virtually nothing is known about CpG methylation in D<sub>H</sub>–Cμ part of the locus, where V(D)J recombination is initiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Ji1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we used the bisulfite modification method to assay DNA methylation in the D<sub>H</sub>–Cμ domain of the IgH locus prior to the onset of recombination and as recombination proceeds. The only sites of extensive tissue-specific DNA demethylation in the unrearranged locus corresponded to a promoter close to DQ52 and the intronic enhancer Eμ. Additionally, sequences close to the intergenic control region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Featherstone1">[22]</xref>, which marks the 5′ boundary of the D<sub>H</sub>-Cμ domain, were partially demethylated. These regions correspond to the only known DNase1 hypersensitive sites in this part of the IgH locus. All CpGs close to, or within, other re-arrangeable D<sub>H</sub> or J<sub>H</sub> gene segments remained hypermethylated regardless of whether they were marked with activation or inactivation histone modifications. However, DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions that were generated after the first recombination step were completely demethylated. Junctional demethylation was highly localized, B lineage-specific, and required the presence of an intact Eμ. These observations suggest that localized demethylation of the DJ<sub>H</sub> junction occurs after the first recombination step and may mark the junction for subsequent V<sub>H</sub> gene rearrangements.</p>

        <title>Tissue-Specific DNA Demethylation Coincides with DNase I Hypersensitive Sites</title>
        <p>Histone modifications across the unrearranged D<sub>H</sub>–Cμ domain of the IgH locus show marked heterogeneity. The region encompassing the J<sub>H</sub> gene segments is marked by the highest levels of histone acetylation and histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Chakraborty1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Chowdhury1">[25]</xref>. The 5′- and 3′ D<sub>H</sub> gene segments, DFL16.1 and DQ52, are also associated with these active modifications, whereas the six to nine DSP gene segments that lie in between are marked by repressive H3 dimethylation at lysine 9 (H3K9me2). Two tissue-specific DNase l hypersensitive sites (DHS) in this part of the locus correspond to a promoter associated with DQ52 and the intronic enhancer Eμ. A cluster of three DHSs was recently identified just 5′ of DFL16.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Featherstone1">[22]</xref>. These latter regions contain binding sites for the transcription factor CTCF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Degner1">[26]</xref> and have been proposed to serve as the 5′ boundary of the D<sub>H</sub>–Cμ domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Guo1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To investigate the DNA methylation state of the unrearranged locus, we purified genomic DNA from pro-B cells obtained from the bone marrow of RAG2-deficient mice to use in bisulfite modification assays modified from Frommer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Frommer1">[28]</xref>. We used at least two independent DNA preparations starting with cells obtained from six mice for each sample. Methylation profiles of the regions amplified from two independent experiments were comparable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001475.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We sequenced approximately 12–50 alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001475.s007">Table S1</xref>), of which 12 representative clones are shown throughout the text.

In contrast, unrearranged DFL16.1 and DSP gene segments, which are marked by active and inactive histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Chakraborty1">[23]</xref>, respectively, were methylated. While the methylation status of DSP gene segments was consistent with earlier association of H3K9me2 modification with CpG methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Esteve1">[31]</xref>, the methylated state of DFL16.1 did not follow this paradigm. An amplicon that included the J<sub>H</sub>1 gene segment located within the peak of active modifications was partially demethylated in pro-B cells compared to kidney. Note that the DQ52 and J<sub>H</sub>1 amplicons, that are demethylated and partially methylated, respectively, are separated by only about 170 nucleotides that contain two CpGs. These observations indicate that the prominent peak of H3ac and H3K4me3 encompassing the J<sub>H</sub> gene segments is not sufficient to direct CpG demethylation of this region. Moreover, the J<sub>H</sub> region has been shown to bind the highest levels of recombinase proteins RAG1 and 2, to form a recombination center at which IgH rearrangement initiates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Ji1">[21]</xref>. Clearly, the partially methylated state of this region does not preclude RAG 1/2 recruitment.

The cluster at −4 kb was similarly methylated in both cell types. Because neither location corresponded precisely with the DHSs, we also examined shorter stretches of CpG dinucleotides in this region. Two sites located at −6 kb were significantly demethylated in pro-B cells compared to DP thymocytes, whereas one out of three CpGs at −5 kb was completely demethylated in pro-B cells. Two CpGs at −3 kb were completely demethylated in both pro-B cells and DP thymocytes. Finally, a cluster of CpGs in the −1.3 kb region was largely methylated in pro-B cells (see below). Overall, the majority of sites in this region remained methylated in pro-B cells, with very specific sites being targeted for demethylation.

        <title>Localized DNA Methylation at Recombination Intermediates</title>
        <p>To determine whether DNA methylation was altered by recombination, we examined pro-B cells purified from the bone marrow of wild-type mice, which contain DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions as well as unrearranged alleles. We found that unrearranged DFL16.1, DSP, and J<sub>H</sub> regions were methylated, while Eμ region was demethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) as seen in RAG2-deficient pro-B cells (note that un-rearranged DFL16.1 and DSP regions in these cells represent fully germline IgH alleles as well as those in which a downstream D<sub>H</sub> gene segment has undergone recombination to form a DJ<sub>H</sub> junction). However, DFL16.1/J<sub>H</sub>1 and DSP/J<sub>H</sub>1 recombined junctions were demethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001475.s004">S4</xref>). For junctions that involved DFL16.1, demethylation of both parts of the recombination reaction was evident due to the presence of analyzable CpGs in each segment. Many DSP-involving junctions lacked CpG dinucleotides contributed from the DSP part. This is because all DSP gene segments lie within a 4-kb repeat unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Chakraborty1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Bolland1">[36]</xref>, which is reflected in all DSP family members sharing a common CpG located 3′ of the gene segment. Two DSP gene segments, DSP2.2 and DSP2.3, have a CpG within the gene segment. In addition, the amplicon encompassing DSP2.3, includes a third CpG dinucleotide 5′ of the gene segment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001475.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The 3′ CpG is lost during recombination, and deletions that occur during recombination lead to many junctions that have no CpG contribution from the D<sub>H</sub> part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g004">Figures 4B, 4C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001475.s004">S4</xref>).

Data shown are derived from two independent preparations of pro- and pre-B cells obtained from six to eight mice in each experiment. This cell population contains a mix of germline and partially rearranged IgH alleles. After bisulfite modification, the genomic DNA was used to amplify unrearranged (A) and DJ<sub>H</sub> rearranged junctions containing DFL16.1 and DSP gene segments (B).

Numbers within regions marked as DFL16.1, DSP and J<sub>H</sub>1 in (B) denote CpG dinucleotides corresponding to the configuration of these residues at the respective unrearranged gene segments. For example, of the five CpGs at unrearranged DFL16.1 only the first two are retained in DFL16.1/J<sub>H</sub>1 junctions. The total numbers of CpG dinucleotides are reduced in junctional sequences because some residues are lost during VDJ recombination as described in the text. Additional heterogeneity is due to the imprecise nature of recombination.

        <p>During B cell development, pro-B cells that contain a functional IgH allele undergo several rounds of cell division and differentiate into small pre-B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Jung1">[37]</xref>.

Sequence diversity at recombination junctions provided an unequivocal measure of allelic individuality in our experiments. For example, many completely demethylated alleles, such as DFL16.1/J<sub>H</sub>1 junctions in pre-B cells, could have arisen by aberrant amplification of a single allele. However, analysis of the junctional sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001475.s004">Figure S4</xref>) showed that each of these represented unique alleles.</p>
        <p>Demethylated DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions could arise by preferential juxtaposition of demethylated D<sub>H</sub> and J<sub>H</sub> gene segments; alternatively, demethylation could be targeted to the junction after recombination. One prediction of allelic demethylation prior to recombination is that unrearranged D<sub>H</sub>s located 5′ of the DJ<sub>H</sub> junction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g001">Figure 1</xref>) should be demethylated. To determine whether DNA demethylation was specific to the DJ<sub>H</sub> junction, or occurred more widely over recombinant allele, we used mature B cells. Earlier studies have shown that about 40% of mature B cells from wild-type mice contain VDJ<sub>H</sub> rearrangement on both alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Jung1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Dudley1">[38]</xref>. In such cells, unrearranged D<sub>H</sub> gene segments are lost from the genome. The remainder contain one VDJ<sub>H</sub> rearranged allele and one DJ<sub>H</sub> rearranged allele; these cells therefore contain unrearranged D<sub>H</sub> gene segments 5′ to the rearranged DJ<sub>H</sub> junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Mature B cells with germline IgH alleles have not been identified in normal mice. First, we determined the methylation state of the DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions in mature B cells. As seen in pro- or pre- B cells, DFL16.1/J<sub>H</sub>1 and DSP/J<sub>H</sub>1 junctions were demethylated in mature B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). We then analyzed germline DFL16.1 in mature B cells to score for all alleles with downstream D<sub>H</sub> rearrangements. We also analyzed a region approximately 1.3 kb 5′ of DFL16.1 that would be intact on DFL16.1 rearranged alleles. We found that both these regions were hypermethylated in mature B cells approximating that seen in RAG2-deficient pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). We conclude that demethylation of recombined alleles is highly localized to the DJ<sub>H</sub> junction.</p>

        <title>DNA Demethylation Requires the Intronic Enhancer Eμ</title>
        <p>To understand the basis for localized demethylation, we considered the following possibilities. First, a specific D<sub>H</sub> gene segment and the J<sub>H</sub> region could be demethylated immediately before recombination. In this model demethylation would precede rearrangement and could possibly target the recombinase to a pre-selected D<sub>H</sub> gene segment. Second, demethylation may occur during recombination, after the DNA breaks have been introduced by recombinase. Third, demethylation of the DJ<sub>H</sub> junction could occur after rearrangement. The last model predicts the existence of methylated DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions that are somehow trapped between recombination and demethylation steps. As described below, we found two sources of such DJ<sub>H</sub> recombined alleles.</p>
        <p>The intronic enhancer Eμ controls key features of the IgH locus assembly via its effects on chromatin structure. Of note, Eμ-deleted IgH alleles undergo D<sub>H</sub> recombination but not V<sub>H</sub> recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Afshar1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Perlot1">[40]</xref>.

To determine whether Eμ affected the methylation status of the DJ<sub>H</sub> junction, we applied the bisulfite procedure to genomic DNA of bone marrow pro-B cells from mice that lack a 220 nucleotide Eμ core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Perlot1">[40]</xref>. We first examined the two regulatory regions. Three of five CpG sites used to assess Eμ DNA methylation flank the core enhancer and are therefore present on the deleted alleles. These three sites were highly methylated on Eμ-deficient alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). CpGs associated with the juxtaposed loxP sites that substitute the Eμ core were also hypermethylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001475.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Thus, a functional enhancer is required to demethylate this region. The J<sub>H</sub>1 region remained hypermethylated in Eμ<sup>−</sup> alleles, whereas the DQ52 region was unmethylated on Eμ<sup>−</sup> alleles indicating that its demethylation was Eμ-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

Interestingly, DQ52/J<sub>H</sub>1 junctions were of a hybrid nature, consisting of several demethylated CpGs from DQ52 and several methylated CpGs from the J<sub>H</sub>1 portions of the junction. We infer that demethylation at DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions requires Eμ. The state of DQ52/J<sub>H</sub>1 junctions indicated that neither rearranging segment imposed its pattern of methylation during the “cut-and-paste” reaction of V(D)J recombination.

        <title>Junctional Demethylation Is Tissue Specific</title>

Thus, despite the presence of an intact demethylated enhancer, DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions in DP cells retained the methylation status of the rearranging gene segments. Our interpretation is that D<sub>H</sub> to J<sub>H</sub> recombination does not require prior DNA demethylation. After rearrangement, Eμ activity drives demethylation in pro-B cells; however, the milieu in DP thymocytes in terms of Eμ activity or availability of transcription factors, does not permit efficient junctional DJ<sub>H</sub> demethylation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Systematic analysis of DNA methylation of unrearranged and partially rearranged IgH alleles in primary cells revealed several interesting features. First, the lack of correlation between histone modifications and DNA methylation status indicates that these marks are independently regulated. This was most clearly evident in the J<sub>H</sub> region that is marked with the highest levels of histone acetylation and H3K4me3 in the unrearranged state, yet remains hypermethylated. Furthermore, germline DFL16.1 and the DSP gene segments were comparably methylated despite being differentially marked at the level of histone modifications. These observations appear to be at odds with genomic studies that show a correlation between histone acetylation and DNA demethylation, and H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Esteve1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Jones2">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Stancheva1">[45]</xref>. We suggest that the results from genome-wide studies may be skewed towards promoter-based CGIs. Instead, the sites we analyzed were largely non-CGIs and included enhancers (such as Eμ), promoters (such as DQ52), cryptic promoters (such as DSP and DFL16.1, see below), and regions that cannot be categorized as any of these.</p>
      <p>An important corollary of this observation is that pre-rearrangement DNA methylation status correlates poorly with recombination potential. Recent studies identified the J<sub>H</sub> region as a RAG1/2-rich recombination center <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Ji1">[21]</xref>. Our observation suggests that DNA demethylation is not required to generate the recombination center. Additionally, DFL16.1 and DQ52 gene segments that rearrange most frequently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Bangs1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Gu1">[35]</xref> have very different levels of DNA methylation prior to rearrangement; conversely, DSP gene segments that rearrange relatively less frequently have comparable levels of DNA methylation as DFL16.1. Taken together, our working model is that DNA methylation status does not guide the first step of IgH gene assembly.</p>
      <p>We note, however, that we cannot unequivocally rule out the possibility that selective demethylation of specific D<sub>H</sub> and J<sub>H</sub> segments occur in a subset of cells just prior to recombination. For example, while the J<sub>H</sub>1 region that we analyzed was largely methylated in pro-B cells prior to rearrangement, we observed that a minority of alleles were demethylated in both RAG-sufficient and RAG-deficient pro-B cells. These demethylated J<sub>H</sub>1 alleles may represent a subset of cells in which D<sub>H</sub> recombination will occur preferentially to the J<sub>H</sub>1 gene segment. It will be interesting to determine whether other J<sub>H</sub> gene segments are similarly singled out for demethylation in subsets of pro-B cells.</p>
      <p>Second, sites of maximal tissue-specific CpG demethylation in the germline IgH locus corresponded to the two strongest DNase 1 hypersensitive sites in the 70-kb D<sub>H</sub>–Cμ domain, DQ52 and Eμ. Because these regions share transcriptional regulatory properties, it is likely that their demethylation is linked to transcription or transcription-associated chromatin changes. Additionally, we noted highly selective CpG demethylation of some sequences and partial demethylation of others 5′ of DFL16.1 where three additional DNase 1 HSs have been recently identified. Though these observations link DNase 1 hypersensitivity to DNA methylation, this doesn't seem to be always the case. For example, J<sub>H</sub> region is known to be highly sensitive to DNase 1 digestion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Maes1">[46]</xref> (without being associated with “classical” DNase 1 hypersensitive sites), yet it is not demethylated. A possible model for this pattern of methylation emerges from the recent demonstration that Eμ is in spatial proximity to the cluster of DHSs 5′ of DFL16.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Guo1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Guo2">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Degner2">[48]</xref>. Since Eμ itself has a demethylating potential (Eμ flanking regions are methylated on Eμ-deficient alleles), perhaps Eμ looping to 5′ DFL16.1 sites “delivers” demethylating activities to this region. The partial demethylation observed at 5′ DFL16.1 sites may reflect that such loops are present in only a fraction of pro-B cells at any given time. Consistent with the idea that Eμ induces demethylation in a subset of cells, the form of partial demethylation seen at DFL16.1 (−6.5) involves extensive demethylation of some alleles and essentially complete methylation of others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001475-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Eμ has also been proposed to loop to DHS5-7 of the 3′ regulatory region at the 3′ of the IgH locus. Interestingly, earlier studies by Giambra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Giambra1">[49]</xref> showed that DHS5-7 was partially demethylated in a pro-B cell line in a manner similar to the methylation state 5′ of DFL16.1. This pattern may be the consequence of Eμ looping to DHS5-7 in a subset of pro-B cells. Overall, we propose that the pattern of DNA demethylation in the germline IgH locus is determined by spatial proximity to Eμ.</p>
      <p>Third, we found that DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions were extensively demethylated. Though we cannot discount the possibility that germline D<sub>H</sub> and J<sub>H</sub> gene segments were demethylated just before recombination, we favor the hypothesis that demethylation of DJ<sub>H</sub> junction occurred after recombination. The reasons for this are two-fold: first, DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions remain methylated in Eμ-deficient pro-B cells and in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes. Our interpretation is that these DJ<sub>H</sub> alleles are caught in an intermediate stage where recombination has occurred but demethylation has not. Second, we think it is unlikely that demethylation occurred prior to recombination followed by re-methylation of DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions based on the state of DQ52/J<sub>H</sub>1 junctions. In both Eμ-deficient pro-B cells and DP thymocytes the methylation status of DQ52/J<sub>H</sub>1 junctions was such that the DQ52 portion was demethylated and the J<sub>H</sub>1 portion was methylated. If demethylation preceded rearrangement, generation of each hybrid junction would require re-methylation of a subset of closely associated CpGs.</p>
      <p>Though our data clearly demonstrate that DNA demethylation of associated gene segments is not essential for D<sub>H</sub> to J<sub>H</sub> recombination, we note that the two instances of methylated DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions identified in this study involve circumstances where the frequency of D<sub>H</sub> recombination is lower than in wild-type pro-B cells. D<sub>H</sub> recombination has been estimated to be 5- to 10-fold lower in Eμ-deleted pro-B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Afshar1">[39]</xref> and only about 30%–50% of IgH alleles in DP thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Subrahmanyam2">[42]</xref> have DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions. We cannot rule out, therefore, that gene segment demethylation may increase the efficiency of D<sub>H</sub> recombination in wild-type pro-B cells. Because Eμ deletion also leads to loss of other accessibility-associated epigenetic marks in the unrearranged locus, it is difficult to deconvolute the contribution of each mark to recombination efficiency.</p>
      <p>How might DNA demethylation be targeted to DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions? We have previously shown that D<sub>H</sub> recombination activates cryptic bi-directional promoters associated with most D<sub>H</sub> gene segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Chakraborty1">[23]</xref>. Transcriptional activity and associated RNA polymerase II recruitment is restricted to the DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions, and drops off before the unrearranged D<sub>H</sub> segments located 5′ of the junction. These changes require Eμ and the simplest interpretation is that recombination places cryptic D<sub>H</sub> promoters under the influence of Eμ. Our working model is that D<sub>H</sub>-promoter/Eμ interaction brings Eμ-associated demethylating activity to DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions, thereby resulting in Eμ-directed demethylation. Because Eμ's influence does not extend to the next upstream D<sub>H</sub> gene segment, DJ<sub>H</sub> demethylation is highly localized. In this model the substantial demethylation of DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions compared to partial demethylation of looping sites may be due to stronger interaction of Eμ with DJ<sub>H</sub> promoters compared to Eμ interaction with the 3′ RR or 5′ of DFL16.1 sequences.</p>
      <p>Does DJ<sub>H</sub> demethylation serve a function? In this regard it is interesting to note that V<sub>H</sub> recombination is significantly reduced in both instances where DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions remain methylated (Eμ-deleted alleles and in DP thymocytes). Though this is consistent with the view that DJ<sub>H</sub> demethylation facilitates V<sub>H</sub> recombination, we think that the regulation of V<sub>H</sub> recombination is more complex. The highly localized Eμ-dependent DJ<sub>H</sub> demethylation that we describe in this report adds to the emerging evidence that DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions are distinguished from un-rearranged D<sub>H</sub> gene segments by several forms of epigenetic changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001475-Subrahmanyam1">[41]</xref>. These include activation-associated histone modifications, such as H3 acetylation and H3K4me3 and increased sensitivity to DNase I. Like DJ<sub>H</sub> demethylation, these alterations are also restricted to DJ<sub>H</sub> junctions and are Eμ dependent. Taken together, our working model is that all these DJ<sub>H</sub>-restricted epigenetic changes work in concert to promote the timing and precision of V<sub>H</sub> recombination.</p>
