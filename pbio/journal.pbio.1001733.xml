<p>Circadian pacemaker neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain gather network information through the highly conserved BMP signaling pathway to establish the daily period of locomotor behavior.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Living organisms use biological clocks to maintain their internal temporal order and anticipate daily environmental changes. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, circadian regulation of locomotor behavior is controlled by ∼150 neurons; among them, neurons expressing the PIGMENT DISPERSING FACTOR (PDF) set the period of locomotor behavior under free-running conditions. To date, it remains unclear how individual circadian clusters integrate their activity to assemble a distinctive behavioral output. Here we show that the BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN (BMP) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in setting the circadian period in PDF neurons in the adult brain. Acute deregulation of BMP signaling causes period lengthening through regulation of d<italic>Clock</italic> transcription, providing evidence for a novel function of this pathway in the adult brain. We propose that coherence in the circadian network arises from integration in PDF neurons of both the pace of the cell-autonomous molecular clock and information derived from circadian-relevant neurons through release of BMP ligands.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The circadian clock controls rhythms in behavior, physiology, and metabolism in all living organisms. The molecular components as well as the neuronal network required to keep this clock running have been identified in several species. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain this neuronal network is represented by an ensemble of 150 neurons, and among them, those expressing the Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF) neuropeptide encompass the “central oscillator”—also called master clock as it ensures 24-hour periods—of the fly brain. In this study we show that the widely conserved Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway is present in PDF neurons, and upon adult-specific activation it lengthens the endogenous period of locomotor behavior. We find that period lengthening correlates with delayed accumulation of nuclear PERIOD, a core component of the molecular clock. We also identified a putative DNA binding motif for the BMP pathway nuclear components within the regulatory region of the <italic>Clock</italic> (<italic>Clk</italic>) promoter, another core component of the circadian machinery. Interestingly, upon BMP pathway activation endogenous CLK levels are downregulated, thus accounting for the lengthening of the endogenous period. We propose that the endogenous period is a network property commanded by PDF neurons that results from integration of information from both the autonomous molecular clock and the nonautonomous BMP signaling pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Circadian clocks govern many physiological and behavioral changes with an endogenous period of about 24 h and are entrained by environmental inputs such as light and temperature.</p>
<p>The ensemble of biochemical reactions that sustains this phenomenon is well documented and is based on two interconnected negative feedback loops. In the first loop, the clock genes <italic>period</italic> and <italic>timeless</italic> are transcriptionally activated by dCLOCK and CYCLE, giving rise to protein products that negatively regulate their own transcription. In the second loop, dCLOCK and CYCLE activate transcription of their own repressor, VRILLE, and activator PDP1ε. The 24-h period underlying this process is achieved through transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational regulation of these core proteins, and by the tight regulation of their subcellular distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Hardin1">[1]</xref>. Through the localization of bonafide clock proteins in the fly brain, over 150 neurons have been ascribed as the circadian neuronal network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Sheeba1">[2]</xref>. Among them, a small bilateral cluster of four neurons called small ventral lateral neurons (sLNvs)—based on their size and relative position in the brain—express the neuropeptide PIGMENT DISPERSING FACTOR (PDF), and several lines of evidence emphasize their relevance as the core pacemaker in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Ewer1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Peng1">[6]</xref>. This cluster drives morning activity under light–dark cycles (LD) and sets the period in constant darkness (DD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Grima1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Stoleru1">[8]</xref>. Clock input pathways for light and temperature have been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Dubruille1">[9]</xref>, but the mechanisms in place to define the connectivity within the clock circuit are poorly understood. In particular, how different circadian clusters communicate with each other, the exact nature of their connectivity, and how this information is then transferred to the molecular clock to ultimately produce rhythmic behavioral outputs remains to be determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Frenkel1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Accurate communication among neuronal ensembles is a fundamental process underlying brain function and, in particular, behavioral control. Anterograde communication through synaptic transmission, cell adhesion molecules, or trophic factors allows neurons to signal to postsynaptic targets; in addition, retrograde signaling allows target cells to influence presynaptic neurons. Both types of communication are crucial for neuronal network assembly, maintenance, and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Fitzsimonds1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Sanyal1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>bone morphogenetic protein</italic> (<italic>BMP</italic>) pathway is a highly conserved retrograde signaling pathway that influences synaptic connectivity, ultimately controlling gene transcription. In particular, BMP regulates the growth and strength of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Aberle1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Marques1">[15]</xref>. At the NMJ, the muscle derived ligand GLASS BOTTOM BOAT (GBB) activates the presynaptic motorneuron, which responds by increasing the synaptic size and the amount of neurotransmitter released <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Marques2">[16]</xref>. In addition, this pathway is crucial in the control of gene expression of circulating neurohormones that modulate NMJ physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Veverytsa1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Eade1">[18]</xref>. BMP pathway ligands transmit biological information by binding to type I and type II receptors that form heterotetrameric complexes in the presence of the dimerized ligand and transduce the information to the nucleus through the SMAD proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Moustakas1">[19]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the best characterized orthologs of the BMP type I receptor are <italic>thickveins</italic> (<italic>tkv</italic>) and <italic>saxophone</italic> (<italic>sax</italic>), while <italic>wishful thinking</italic> (<italic>wit</italic>) and <italic>punt</italic> (<italic>put</italic>) account for the only known type II orthologs. Ligand binding links the constitutively active type II receptor kinase to the inactive type I one, which results in the phosphorylation of the latter, thus turning on its kinase activity. As a result, the type I receptor triggers a signaling cascade through phosphorylation of the R-SMAD <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog MOTHERS AGAINST DPP (MAD), allowing its association with the Co-SMAD MEDEA (MED). This complex is then translocated to the nucleus to regulate gene expression on its own, or by association with different co-regulators, such as SCHNURRI (SHN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Affolter1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Weiss1">[21]</xref>. Following pathway activation, a negative-feedback mechanism is induced through the expression of the I-SMAD DAUGHTERS AGAINST DPP (DAD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Tsuneizumi1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Despite the relevance of retrograde signals for network assembly and maintenance, only one report has focused on a central synapse. Genetic manipulation of the BMP pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons demonstrated that this activity-dependent retrograde signaling mechanism potentiates synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Baines1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this work, we report the identification, through a forward genetic screen, of a new acute regulator of circadian period. Manipulation of gene expression levels demonstrated that the retrograde BMP signaling is necessary for normal circadian behavior. More importantly, pathway activation is crucial for period determination in an adult-specific fashion through the regulation of <italic>Clk</italic> transcription in the sLNvs. Overall, the behavioral and biochemical data presented here indicate that the retrograde BMP pathway acting in the sLNvs modulates the endogenous circadian period, by integrating information from the rest of the circadian network.</p>

<title>A Functional Misexpression Screen Uncovers a Role for <italic>schnurri</italic> in Circadian Behavior</title>
<p>Great efforts have been dedicated to uncover new genes involved in the modulation of circadian rhythms. To identify additional components involved in sending or receiving information relevant for synchronization of the circadian network, a misexpression screen was carried out through deregulation of gene expression specifically in PDF expressing (PDF+) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>pdf</italic>Gal4 (herein referred to as <italic>pdf</italic>G4) transgenic fly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Renn1">[5]</xref> was employed to drive expression of independent transgenic insertions generated in our laboratory from a founder P[UAS] line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Blanchard1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Rezaval1">[25]</xref>. As a result, we identified a fly strain, P[UAS]<sup>756</sup>, that causes period lengthening of daily activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). The transposon landed within <italic>schnurri</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), a zinc finger protein that acts as a partner of SMADs, and is crucial for repression of target genes upon activation of the BMP pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Affolter1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Weiss1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Arora1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-StaehlingHampton1">[28]</xref>.

<p>Based on the initial <italic>in silico</italic> analysis it was envisioned that P[UAS]<sup>756</sup> could mediate overexpression of the <italic>shn</italic> locus upon GAL4 activation. To test this, we performed qPCR analysis to measure the four alternative transcripts encoded by this locus according to Flybase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). No effect on overall levels of <italic>shn</italic> were observed in homozygous P[UAS]<sup>756</sup> flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). However, when P[UAS]<sup>756</sup> was acutely induced in the entire organism, a significant increase was specifically observed in variant B, whose start site is located immediately downstream of the P[UAS]<sup>756</sup> landing site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s001">Figure S1A and S1C</xref>). These results suggest that increased levels of <italic>shn</italic> are responsible for the behavioral phenotype observed. In support of this, overexpression of <italic>shn</italic> in the PDF neurons through an independent UAS line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Marty1">[30]</xref> also led to a long period phenotype, similar to that observed in <italic>pdf</italic>G4&gt;P[UAS]<sup>756</sup> flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s001">Figure S1D and S1E</xref>). In addition, we rescued the P[UAS]<sup>756</sup> overexpression phenotype through the concomitant expression of a specific <italic>shn</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> predicted to target all four alternative transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s001">Figure S1F and S1G</xref>).</p>
<p>To explore an intrinsic effect of <italic>shn</italic> within the circuit we used the <italic>pdf</italic>G4 strain to drive <italic>shn</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> in the LNvs; this treatment renders only 50% of rhythmic flies, with a clear disorganization of the activity profile, pointing to a specific function of <italic>shn</italic> on locomotor rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>). A potential role for <italic>shn</italic> in the sLNv cluster is further supported by the observation that there is an enrichment of <italic>shn</italic> mRNA in PDF+ relative to ELAV+ neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-KulaEversole1">[31]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>The BMP Signaling Cascade Is Active Within the sLNvs</title>
<p>Since <italic>shn</italic> is a nuclear component of the BMP canonical pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Affolter1">[20]</xref>, we decided to evaluate the involvement of the entire pathway in the control of circadian locomotor activity. We first checked whether the pathway is active within the PDF cells employing a well-characterized reporter line (<italic>dad</italic>LacZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Tsuneizumi1">[22]</xref>). This strategy showed a clear activation in PDF+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) and in some of the DN1 neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), while it is clearly absent from other clusters—that is, the LNd neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Subsequently we expressed constitutively activated forms of the type I receptors <italic>sax</italic> and <italic>tkv</italic> (<italic>sax<sup>A</sup></italic> and <italic>tkv<sup>A</sup></italic>, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Haerry1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Nellen1">[33]</xref> in the PDF neurons. Despite <italic>sax<sup>A</sup></italic> or <italic>tkv<sup>A</sup></italic> expression failed to modulate behavior on their own, when expressed together they led to a surprisingly long period phenotype, almost 2 h longer than the deregulation of the downstream nuclear effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>), a condition that allowed detection of a clear pMad signal in the nucleus of the sLNvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s003">Figure S3</xref>). However, it was not possible to detect this marker of pathway activation in a wild-type brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), likely due to low levels. The fact that joint <italic>tkv</italic> and <italic>sax</italic> up-regulation leads to a long period phenotype is in agreement with the change observed upon <italic>shn</italic> overexpression, since <italic>shn</italic> and the receptors are positive elements of the signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Taking into account that expression of activated receptors could result in an ectopic phenotype, we down-regulated the endogenous receptors through specific RNAi lines in a cell-autonomous fashion. Interestingly, reduced levels of distinct type I and II receptors in PDF neurons resulted in deconsolidation of the activity pattern leading to arrhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>), phenocopying <italic>shn</italic> down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>). In agreement with these findings, joint down-regulation of <italic>mad</italic> and <italic>med</italic>, the nuclear components of the signaling pathway, produces an even more severe effect on rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figure 2G and 2H</xref>). In addition to the partial decrease in rhythmicity, down-regulated expression of BMP pathway components reduced the strength of locomotor rhythmicity in most flies, even the ones initially scored as rhythmic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s008">Table S2</xref>).</p>

<title>A Blend of BMP Ligands Shapes Locomotor Activity Rhythms</title>
<p>The finding that the BMP pathway operates in the sLNvs prompted us to identify which of the seven members of the ligand superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Moustakas1">[19]</xref> are critical for the control of locomotor rhythms. Since this signaling pathway functions retrogradely, we reasoned that a putative ligand source could either be the TIM+PDF− neurons or the PDF+ lLNvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, we down-regulated specific ligands either in PDF+ or TIM+PDF− neurons by means of RNAi expression. Interestingly, several ligands affected rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). Although <italic>myoglinin</italic> (<italic>myo</italic>) appears to play a role in both clusters, <italic>gbb</italic>, <italic>maverick</italic> (<italic>mav</italic>), and <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>) expression is relevant for rhythmycity in PDF+ cells. On the other hand, down-regulation of either <italic>activin-β</italic> (<italic>actβ</italic>), <italic>screw</italic> (<italic>scw</italic>), or <italic>dawdle</italic> (<italic>daw</italic>) did not affect rhythmicity on either cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>), although these RNAi lines were able to trigger lethality when driven from a constitutive promoter (such as <italic>actin</italic>; unpublished data).

<p>The activation of the BMP pathway throughout development could lead to structural abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Marques2">[16]</xref>, in turn affecting behavior.

<p>Flies were raised and tested during the first part of the behavioral experiment at the restrictive temperature (preventing GAL4 activity), and then were transferred to the permissive temperature (allowing GAL4 activity); thus, locomotor behavior was recorded in a condition that allows acute <italic>shn</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Despite the temperature shift, control flies—as well as those carrying a single transgenic copy of <italic>shn</italic>—retained their endogenous period. Along the same line, constitutive expression of <italic>shn</italic> in PDF neurons was subtly affected by the temperature increase.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To identify molecules relevant to the control of rhythmic behavior, a genetic screen was carried out through deregulation of gene expression in core pacemaker cells. As a result, a fly strain that causes period lengthening of daily activity rhythms was singled out, which pointed to a nuclear component of the BMP pathway. Adult-restricted activation of this signaling pathway in the sLNvs led to an increase in the endogenous free-running period, while RNAi-mediated knock-down of specific pathway components highlighted their requirement in coherent behavior. At a molecular level we demonstrated the presence of pathway components in specific subsets of circadian neurons and that pathway activation triggers a delayed nuclear PER accumulation through the negative regulation of the <italic>Clk</italic> promoter. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that the BMP signaling is present in the sLNvs and modulates the pace of the clock, providing a fine-tuning mechanism for a network-dependent setting of the circadian period.</p>

Expression of the neuropeptide FMRFamide in neurosecretory Tv neurons is completely abolished in <italic>wit</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Marques3">[52]</xref>. BMP retrograde signal is required early on to determine their peptidergic identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Allan1">[53]</xref>, and then to maintain the expression of this neuropeptide in the adult brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Eade1">[18]</xref>. Similar results were observed in Crustacean Cardioactive Peptide (CCAP) neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Veverytsa1">[17]</xref>, a subset of neurosecretory cells that control the behavioral program underlying ecdysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Ewer2">[54]</xref>. This data prompted us to evaluate the role of pathway deregulation on PDF expression, although reduced <italic>pdf</italic> levels result in a shortening of the free-running period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Shafer2">[55]</xref>. Neither <italic>pdf</italic> transcriptional levels nor PDF neuropeptide accumulation at the dorsal sLNvs terminals were affected upon <italic>shn</italic> overexpression in the adult (unpublished data). Recent work from our laboratory demonstrated that the concerted action of the BMP and PDF signaling pathways is required early on during development to define the adult architecture of PDF neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Gorostiza1">[56]</xref>. However, the fact that BMP signaling is active in the adult to modulate period length, with no effect on circuit morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s004">Figure S4</xref>), rules out the possibility that period lengthening derives from altered PDF levels. These observations suggest a different role for the BMP pathway in core pacemaker cells in the adult brain.</p>

<title>Different Components of the BMP Pathway Trigger Circadian Phenotypes</title>
<p>RNA interference-mediated knockdown enabled us to test the involvement of the BMP type I and II receptors, ligands, as well as the nuclear components in circadian control of locomotor behavior. Reduced BMP components result in a mutant phenotype, characterized by a disorganized locomotor activity profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g003">3</xref>), with no effect on period. Although more experiments are ensured to properly address this difference, the pleiotropic nature of this signaling pathway and the genetic strategies employed (including expression throughout development) could account for the behavioral differences.</p>
<p>In light of the well-known role of this pathway as a retrograde signal in neuronal communication, the fact that down-regulation of any pathway component results in deconsolidation of rhythmic activity opens the possibility that this mechanism is recruited for the coordination of the neuronal network underlying circadian locomotion. The different penetrance of the behavioral phenotypes among pathway components could be accounted for either a technical issue regarding the efficacy of specific UAS-driven RNAi lines, the differential strength of particular drivers (i.e., resulting from the <italic>pdf</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> promoters), or to the relevance that each molecule plays in the underlying process. As an example, different receptors (whose reduction leads to 60% of rhythmicity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figure 2F</xref>) could partially replace each other, while the concomitant down-regulation of both <italic>mad</italic> and <italic>med</italic> (which renders only 30% of rhythmic animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figure 2H</xref>) argues in favor of a mandatory role for these molecules in the coordination of rhythmic locomotion.</p>
<p>An alternative strategy extensively used to study BMP signaling is the expression of constitutively active forms of the <italic>sax</italic> or <italic>tkv</italic> type I receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Affolter1">[20]</xref>. The longer period phenotype observed upon receptor activation compared to the one achieved through <italic>shn</italic> deregulation suggests that period length correlates with the degree of BMP activation in the sLNvs. In addition, the observation that two distinct type I receptors are necessary for the period lengthening phenotype suggests a complex combination of BMP ligands reaching the PDF neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Gorostiza1">[56]</xref>). The notion that two type I receptors need to be activated to modulate the circadian system is further supported by the correlation between the period phenotype and the detection of pMAD immunoreactivity in the nucleus of the sLNvs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s003">Figure S3</xref>). While SAX activation leads to nondetectable pMAD levels, TKV activation associates to moderate levels of nuclear pMAD; instead, activation of both receptors leads to significantly higher pMAD levels in the sLNvs and in turn triggers a profound change in the endogenous period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). It has previously been described that in certain developmental processes the combination of ligands and receptors is important for the proper function of the cascade, thus broadening its flexibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Haerry1">[32]</xref>. In the case of the sLNvs, our findings open the possibility that different postsynaptic targets could release specific ligands, in turn enriching the communication between the clusters of the circadian network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, constitutively active receptors allowed us to show that upon activation pMad is present in the nucleus of the sLNvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s003">S3</xref>). In this context it is worth noting that we performed a time course in a wild-type background looking for differential pathway activation along the day, but we could not detect the phosphorylated form of this protein at any time point (unpublished data). This inability to detect pMAD could merely reflect the fact that either the time resolution (a 6-h window) was insufficient, or this signal is transient (short lived). A potential transient effect of this signaling pathway could result from ligands released from the postsynaptic targets of the sLNvs that could vary in response to a variety of stimuli (internal or external) in order to balance network function and achieve coherence within neuronal clusters. In this context it is likely that subtle or transient increases in pMAD levels (undetectable through immunohistochemistry) could still support a proper pathway function in the sLNvs in a wild-type brain.</p>

<title>Retrograde signaling impacts period determination.</title>
<p>The figure depicts a model in which different ligands released from sLNv postsynaptic targets (TIM+PDF− as well as the lLNvs) modulate the activity of the BMP signaling cascade in the sLNvs acting through the TKV/SAX/WIT receptors. In turn, this signal results in a transcriptionally active complex (including <italic>schnurri</italic>) that down-regulates <italic>Clk</italic> expression. Reduced <italic>Clock</italic> levels would then give rise to decreased <italic>per</italic> transcription and therefore reduced PER levels, thus slowing the pace of the molecular oscillator.</p>

<title>Retrograde BMP Signal Fine-Tunes Circadian Transcription</title>
<p>Manipulation of the dosage of core clock genes has provided a reliable strategy to unravel the mechanisms leading to period determination, since any period effect resulting from a change in gene dosage likely points to a rate-limiting step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Rosbash1">[58]</xref>. In this regard, the manipulation of <italic>per</italic> dosage has clearly paved the way. An increase in <italic>per</italic> dosage leads to a decrease in period solely when driven from the endogenous promoter; instead, when driven from a heterologous and constitutive promoter, it results in a period increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Yang1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Smith1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Rutila1">[61]</xref>. This particular situation allows testing genetic interactions with clock genes regarding period determination.</p>
<p>In this context, the strong genetic interaction between <italic>shn</italic> and the core clock components <italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, and <italic>Clk</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g006">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s006">S6</xref>) prompted us to ask whether modulation of the endogenous period, through activation of the BMP pathway, could result from the regulation of those genes at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, <italic>shn</italic> overexpression reduced <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g006">Figure 6</xref>). More importantly, the activation of the BMP pathway in the sLNvs is associated with reduced <italic>Clk</italic> transcription and protein accumulation, potentially through direct regulation on the DNA binding elements found within the <italic>Clk</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s006">S6</xref>).</p>
<p>Early on it was suggested that CLK is key to define the amplitude of the rhythms, although the period (and hence the phase) depended on PER and TIM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Allada1">[62]</xref>; moreover, sustained and elevated CLK has only minor effects on the periodicity of behavioral rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Kim1">[63]</xref>. On the other hand, CLK embodies the rate-limiting step in these molecular oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Bae1">[64]</xref>, and thus it would be unexpected to see no effect on overt rhythmicity resulting from alterations of CLK levels. Accordingly, it was recently shown that modulating VRI effects on <italic>Clk</italic> transcription through the α isoform of <italic>kayak</italic> (<italic>kay-</italic>α, the mammalian homolog of <italic>c</italic>-<italic>fos</italic>) impinges upon period determination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Ling1">[65]</xref>. Interestingly, reduced <italic>kay-</italic>α correlates with lengthening of the behavioral period and reduction in PER, PDP1, and CLK levels in the sLNvs, underscoring that altered CLK levels could indeed affect the pace of the clock.</p>

<title>Retrograde Signaling as a Network Coordination Mechanism</title>
<p>Previous studies have extensively described the interconnected negative feedback loops critical for the cell-autonomous setting of the 24-h endogenous period, as well as the role of the sLNvs in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Hardin1">[1]</xref>. However, the ability of the sLNvs to integrate information from the rest of the circadian network is poorly understood. Our findings provide genetic, behavioral, and molecular evidence for a model in which the retrograde BMP signaling cascade in adult circadian pacemaker neurons integrates information from the circadian network to modulate the period of locomotor behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g008">Figure 8</xref>). It follows that ligands released from yet unidentified sLNv postsynaptic cells are capable of modulating <italic>Clk</italic> transcription, thus contributing to set the endogenous period in a non-cell-autonomous fashion. We propose that the endogenous circadian period results from the action of the molecular clock at the cellular level that depends on the abundance of specific clock proteins, whose transcriptional regulation is modulated by the BMP pathway.</p>
<p>In recent years it has become clear that environmental conditions unevenly affect the properties of subsets of circadian neurons, thus impinging upon their relative hierarchy within the network to achieve a coherent response (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Muraro1">[66]</xref>). In this article we show that the BMP pathway is active in specific subsets of circadian neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001733.s002">S2</xref>), which may or not coincide with those releasing specific BMP ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001733-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Although it is too early to ascribe a function to this signaling pathway within the circadian network, it is tempting to speculate that it might provide a means to alter the connectivity of the circuit to keep it tuned to changes in day length or temperature fluctuations, often experienced under natural conditions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this pathway could also be functional to adjust the endogenous period in response to internal stimuli. In flies it has been proposed that different subsets of circadian neurons run with different periods (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Lin1">[67]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Yoshii1">[68]</xref>). A network capable of sustaining rhythmicity after several days under free-running conditions ensures that several mechanisms should be in place to guarantee coherence between clusters.</p>
<p>The circadian system in multicellular organisms relies on both cell autonomous biochemical interactions and network assembly of specific clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Welsh1">[69]</xref>. The existence of retrograde signals capable of retrieving information from distinct circadian clusters, which then impinge upon core pacemaker properties, offers a provocative hypothesis worth exploring in other circadian networks. Indeed, the BMP signal transduction pathway is highly conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001733-Moustakas1">[19]</xref>. In the mammalian system, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is composed of a heterogeneous network of coupled oscillators; a retrograde communication between them through the BMP pathway could arise as a novel mechanism involved in synchronization of SCN activity.</p>
