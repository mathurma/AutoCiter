                <p>A cornerstone of biotechnology is the use of microorganisms for the efficient
                    production of chemicals and the elimination of harmful waste.
                        <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> is an archetype of such microbes due to
                    its metabolic versatility, stress resistance, amenability to genetic
                    modifications, and vast potential for environmental and industrial applications.
                    To address both the elucidation of the metabolic wiring in <italic>P.
                    putida</italic> and its uses in biocatalysis, in particular for the production
                    of non-growth-related biochemicals, we developed and present here a genome-scale
                    constraint-based model of the metabolism of <italic>P. putida</italic> KT2440.
                    Network reconstruction and flux balance analysis (FBA) enabled definition of the
                    structure of the metabolic network, identification of knowledge gaps, and
                    pin-pointing of essential metabolic functions, facilitating thereby the
                    refinement of gene annotations. FBA and flux variability analysis were used to
                    analyze the properties, potential, and limits of the model. These analyses
                    allowed identification, under various conditions, of key features of metabolism
                    such as growth yield, resource distribution, network robustness, and gene
                    essentiality. The model was validated with data from continuous cell cultures,
                    high-throughput phenotyping data, <sup>13</sup>C-measurement of internal flux
                    distributions, and specifically generated knock-out mutants. Auxotrophy was
                    correctly predicted in 75% of the cases. These systematic analyses
                    revealed that the metabolic network structure is the main factor determining the
                    accuracy of predictions, whereas biomass composition has negligible influence.
                    Finally, we drew on the model to devise metabolic engineering strategies to
                    improve production of polyhydroxyalkanoates, a class of biotechnologically
                    useful compounds whose synthesis is not coupled to cell survival. The solidly
                    validated model yields valuable insights into genotype–phenotype
                    relationships and provides a sound framework to explore this versatile bacterium
                    and to capitalize on its vast biotechnological potential.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>The pseudomonads include a diverse set of bacteria whose metabolic versatility
                    and genetic plasticity have enabled their survival in a broad range of
                    environments. Many members of this family are able to either degrade toxic
                    compounds or to efficiently produce high value compounds and are therefore of
                    interest for both bioremediation and bulk chemical production. To better
                    understand the growth and metabolism of these bacteria, we developed a
                    large-scale mathematical model of the metabolism of <italic>Pseudomonas
                    putida</italic>, a representative of the industrially relevant pseudomonads. The
                    model was initially expanded and validated with substrate utilization data and
                    carbon-tracking data. Next, the model was used to identify key features of
                    metabolism such as growth yield, internal distribution of resources, and network
                    robustness. We then used the model to predict novel strategies for the
                    production of precursors for bioplastics of medical and industrial relevance.
                    Such an integrated computational and experimental approach can be used to study
                    its metabolism and to explore the potential of other industrially and
                    environmentally important microorganisms.</p>

            <p><italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> is one of the best studied species of the
                metabolically versatile and ubiquitous genus of the Pseudomonads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Timmis1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Moore1">[3]</xref>. As a species, it
                exhibits a wide biotechnological potential, with numerous strains (some of which
                solvent-tolerant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Mosqueda1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-deBont1">[5]</xref>) able to efficiently produce a range of bulk and
                fine chemicals. These features, along with their renowned stress resistance,
                amenability for genetic manipulation and suitability as a host for heterologous
                expression, make <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> particularly attractive for
                biocatalysis. To date, strains of <italic>P. putida</italic> have been employed to
                produce phenol, cinnamic acid, cis-cis-muconate, p-hydroxybenzoate, p-cuomarate, and
                myxochromide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Wierckx1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Stephan1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, enzymes
                from <italic>P. putida</italic> have been employed in a variety of other
                biocatalytic processes, including the resolution of
                <sc>d</sc>/<sc>l</sc>-phenylglycinamide into <sc>d</sc>-phenylglycinamide and
                <sc>l</sc>-phenylglycine, production of non-proteinogenic <sc>l</sc>-amino acids,
                and biochemical oxidation of methylated heteroaromatic compounds for formation of
                heteroaromatic monocarboxylic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Schmid1">[13]</xref>. However, most Pseudomonas-based applications are
                still in infancy largely due to a lack of knowledge of the genotype-phenotype
                relationships in these bacteria under conditions relevant for industrial and
                environmental endeavors. In an effort towards the generation of critical knowledge,
                the genomes of several members of the Pseudomonads have been or are currently being
                sequenced (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomesonline.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genomesonline.org</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pseudomonas.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.pseudomonas.com</ext-link>),
                and a series of studies are underway to elucidate specific aspects of their genomic
                programs, physiology and behavior under various stresses (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.psysmo.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.psysmo.org</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.probactys.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.probactys.org</ext-link>,

                revealed, among other features, a wealth of genetic determinants that play a role in

                polyhydroxyalkanoates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Huijberts1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Steinbchel1">[18]</xref>) and industrially

                in our understanding of <italic>P. putida</italic> through this sequencing effort,
                the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype cannot be predicted simply
                from cataloguing and assigning gene functions to the genes found in the genome, and
                considerable work is still needed before the genome can be translated into a fully
                functioning metabolic model of value for predicting cell phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-dosSantos1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Nelson1">[14]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Constraint-based modeling is currently the only approach that enables the modeling of
                an organism's metabolic and transport network at genome-scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Price1">[19]</xref>. A
                genome-wide constraint-based model consists of a stoichiometric reconstruction of
                all reactions known to act in the metabolism of the organism, along with an
                accompanying set of constraints on the fluxes of each reaction in the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Price1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Reed1">[20]</xref>. A major
                advantage of this approach is that the model does not require knowledge on the
                kinetics of the reactions. These models define the organism's global
                metabolic space, network structural properties, and flux distribution potential, and
                provide a framework with which to navigate through the metabolic wiring of the cell
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Price1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Papin1">[21]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Through various analysis techniques, constraint-based models can help predict
                cellular phenotypes given particular environmental conditions. Flux balance analysis
                (FBA) is one such technique, which relies on the optimization for an objective flux
                while enforcing mass balance in all modeled reactions to achieve a set of fluxes
                consistent with a maximal output of the objective function. When a biomass sink is
                chosen as the objective in FBA, the output can be correlated with growth, and the
                model fluxes become predictive of growth phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Varma1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Covert1">[23]</xref>. Constraint-based
                analysis techniques, including FBA, have been instrumental in elucidating metabolic
                features in a variety of organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Reed1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Price2">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Joyce1">[25]</xref> and, in a few cases thus far, they have been used
                for concrete biotechnology endeavors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Lee1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Pharkya2">[29]</xref>.</p>
            <p>However, in all previous applications in which a constraint-based approach was used
                to design the production of a biochemical, the studies addressed only the production
                of compounds that can be directly coupled to the objective function used in the
                underlying FBA problem. The major reason for this is that FBA-based methods predict
                a zero-valued flux for any reaction not directly contributing to the chosen
                objective. Since the production pathways of most high-added value and bulk compounds
                operate in parallel to growth-related metabolism, straightforward application of FBA
                to these biocatalytic processes fails to be a useful predictor of output. Other
                constraint-based analysis methods, such as Extreme Pathways and Elementary Modes
                analysis, are capable of analyzing non-growth related pathways in metabolism, but,
                due to combinatorial explosion inherent to numerical resolution of these methods,
                they could not be used so far to predict fluxes or phenotypes at genome-scale for
                guiding biocatalysis efforts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Papin2">[30]</xref>.</p>
            <p>To address both the elucidation of the metabolic wiring in <italic>P. putida</italic>
                and the use of <italic>P. putida</italic> for the production of non-growth-related
                biochemicals, we developed and present here a genome-scale reconstruction of the
                metabolic network of <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> KT2440, the subsequent
                analysis of its network properties through constraint-based modeling and a thorough
                assessment of the potential and limits of the model. The reconstruction is based on
                up-to-date genomic, biochemical and physiological knowledge of the bacterium. The
                model accounts for the function of 877 reactions that connect 886 metabolites and
                builds upon a constraint-based modeling framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Price1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Reed1">[20]</xref>. Only 6% of
                the reactions in the network are non gene-associated. The reconstruction process
                guided the refinement of the annotation of several genes. The model was validated
                with continuous culture experiments, substrate utilization assays (BIOLOG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Bochner1">[31]</xref>,
                    <sup>13</sup>C-measurement of internal fluxes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Fischer1">[32]</xref>, and a specifically
                generated set of mutant strains. We evaluated the influence of biomass composition
                and maintenance values on the outcome of flux balance analysis (FBA) simulations,
                and utilized the metabolic reconstruction to predict internal reaction fluxes, to
                identify different mass-routing possibilities, and to determine necessary gene and
                reaction sets for growth on minimal medium. Finally, by means of a modified OptKnock
                approach, we utilized the model to generate hypotheses for possible improvements of
                the production by <italic>P. putida</italic> of polyhydroxyalkanoates, a class of
                compounds whose production consumes resources that would be otherwise used for
                growth. This reconstruction thus provides a modeling framework for the exploration
                of the metabolic capabilities of <italic>P. putida</italic>, which will aid in
                deciphering the complex genotype-phenotype relationships governing its metabolism
                and will help to broaden the applicability of <italic>P. putida</italic> strains for
                bioremediation and biotechnology.</p>

                <title>Highlights of the Model Reconstruction Process</title>
                <p>We reconstructed the metabolism of <italic>P. putida</italic> at the genome-scale
                    through a process summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000210-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The reconstruction process involved: (1) an initial data
                    collection stage leading to a first pass reconstruction (iJP815<sup>pre1</sup>);
                    (2) a model building stage in which simulations were performed with
                        iJP815<sup>pre1</sup> and reactions were added until the model was able to
                    grow <italic>in silico</italic> on glucose minimal medium
                    (iJP815<sup>pre2</sup>); and (3) a model completion stage in which BIOLOG
                    substrate utilization data was used to guide model expansion and <italic>in
                        silico</italic> viability on varied substrates. The final reconstruction,
                    named iJP815 following an often used convention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Reed2">[33]</xref>, consists of 824
                    intracellular and 62 extracellular metabolites connected by 877 reactions. Eight
                    hundred twenty one (94%) reactions have at least one assigned gene as
                    delineated in the gene-protein-reaction (GPR) relationships. GPR relationships
                    are composed of Boolean logic statements that link genes to protein complexes
                    and protein complexes to reactions via combinations of AND and OR operators. An
                    ‘AND’ operator denotes the required presence of two or more
                    genes for a protein to function (as in the case of multi-protein complexes),
                    while an ‘OR’ operator denotes a redundant function that can
                    be catalyzed by any of several genes (as in the case of isozymes). Only 56
                    reactions, of which nine are non-enzymatic, lack associated genes. The remaining
                    47 non-gene-associated, enzymatic reactions were added in order to close
                    metabolic network gaps identified during the successive steps of the

                <p>Most network gaps (27) were identified during the second round of the
                    reconstruction and were resolved through detailed literature mining, thereby
                    enabling iJP815 to grow <italic>in silico</italic> on glucose in minimal medium.
                    The remaining gaps identified in the model completion step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000210-g001">Figure 1</xref>) were mostly single missing steps in
                    the pathway for which there is experimental evidence of operation (e.g., a
                    compound is consumed but not produced, and no alternative pathways exist). It
                    should be noted that for some gaps, there is more than one combination of
                    reactions with which the gap could be closed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Osterman1">[34]</xref>. In cases where
                    more than one gap closure method was available, the decision of which to use was
                    made based on similarity queries to related bacteria.</p>
                <p>The iJP815 model includes 289 reactions for which non-zero flux values cannot be
                    obtained under any environmental condition while enforcing the pseudo
                    steady-state assumption (PSSA). We term these reactions
                    “unconditionally blocked” meaning that they are unable to
                    function because not all connections could be made with the information
                    available. Three hundred sixty two metabolites that are only involved in these
                    reactions are classified as “unbalanced metabolites”.
                    Another important subset of model reactions is the “weakly
                    annotated” set, which means that all the genes assigned to these 57
                    reactions are currently annotated as coding for “putative”

                <p>The initial working version of the model (iJP815<sup>pre2</sup>) was able to
                    simulate growth with 14 of the 47 BIOLOG-assayed compounds as sole carbon
                    sources. This version of the reconstruction contained only a few transport
                    reactions, prompting us to identify compounds that could not be utilized
                        <italic>in silico</italic> simply due to the lack of a transporter. This was
                    achieved by allowing the intracellular pool of each compound of interest to be
                    exchanged with environment <italic>in silico</italic>, and by evaluating the
                    production of biomass in each case through FBA simulations. This approach
                    increased the number of utilizable substances to 34 but also produced six
                    false-positives (i.e., substances that support <italic>in silico</italic>
                    growth, but which gave a negative phenotype in the BIOLOG assay). These included
                    three metabolites involved in central metabolic pathways (<sc>d</sc>-glucose
                    1-phosphate, <sc>d</sc>-glucose 6-phosphate and glycerol-3-phosphate), an
                    intermediate of the <sc>l</sc>-histidine metabolism pathway (urocanate), an
                    intermediate of branched amino acids biosynthesis (2-oxobutanoate), and the
                    storage compound glycogen. This analysis suggests that the inability of
                        <italic>P. putida</italic> to utilize these compounds <italic>in
                    vivo</italic> is likely due to the lack of appropriate transport machinery.</p>
                <p>The final <italic>P. putida</italic> model (iJP815) grew on 39 of the 51
                    compounds tested in the BIOLOG assay and that concurrently were accounted for in
                    the model. Of these, 33 were true positives (compounds utilized in
                    <italic>vivo</italic> and allowing for growth <italic>in silico</italic>). The
                    mode of utilization of the remaining fourteen <italic>in vivo</italic> oxidized
                    compounds (i.e., false negatives) could not be elucidated. The remaining forty
                    two compounds posed true negatives, eight of which were accounted for in the
                    reconstruction. Ten utilized compounds also lack transport reactions, as nothing
                    is known about their translocation into the cell. Nevertheless, this comparison
                    of <italic>in silico</italic> growth predictions with BIOLOG substrate
                    utilization data indicates that the core metabolism of <italic>P.
                    putida</italic> has been properly reconstructed.</p>
                <p>A note of caution when comparing the BIOLOG assays with growth predictions is
                    that this assay evaluates whether an organism is able to oxidize the tested
                    compound and yield energy from it, which is different from growth. However, as
                        <italic>P. putida</italic> is able to grow on minimal medium supplemented
                    with these compounds, we considered the assumption to be justified.</p>

                <title>Model-Driven Reannotation</title>
                <p>The reconstruction process systematizes knowledge about the metabolism of an
                    organism, allowing the identification of errors in, and discrepancies between,
                    various sources of data. A major value of a manual model-building effort is the
                    careful revision of the current genome annotation, based on literature evidence
                    encountered during the model building process, BLAST searches, and gap closures.
                    During the reconstruction of the <italic>P. putida</italic> metabolic network,
                    we discovered a number of genes that appear to have been improperly annotated in
                    biological databases (Pseudomonas Genome Database, KEGG, NCBI). These
                    mis-annotations arose due to a lack of information at the time of the original
                    annotation or because knowledge that was available in the literature had been
                    overlooked in the original annotation. In a number of other cases, the model
                    building process has also generated new hypotheses for gene functions. For
                    instance, our reconstruction process identified an unlikely gap in the
                    <sc>l</sc>-lysine degradation pathway of <italic>P. putida</italic>. Extensive
                    literature search and careful reannotation has provided considerable evidence
                    that the genes PP0382 and PP5257, currently annotated as
                    ‘carbon-hydrogen hydrolase family protein’ and
                    ‘oxidoreductase, FAD binding’ respectively, most probably
                    code for a ‘5-aminopentamidase’ and
                    ‘<sc>l</sc>-pipecolate oxidase’, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Revelles1">[36]</xref>.
                    Another example is the propanoate degradation pathway: In the
                    iJP815<sup>pre2</sup> version this pathway was complete except for one enzymatic
                    activity, namely the 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase. Analysis of the enzymes
                    flanking this reaction showed that all of the enzymes are encoded by genes
                    immediately adjacent to the ORF PP2330. Inspection of this region of the genome
                    revealed that PP2336 is annotated as “aconitate hydratase,
                    putative”, although the flanking genes are responsible for degradation
                    of propanoate. Analysis of PP2330 via BLAST revealed a homology of more than
                    99% over the whole length of the protein with the 2-methylisocitrate
                    dehydratase from other bacteria, such as other strains of <italic>P.
                    putida</italic> (GB-1, W619), <italic>Burkholderia prymatum</italic> STM 815,
                        <italic>Burkholderia multivorans</italic> ATCC 17616, <italic>Pseudomonas
                        aeruginosa</italic> PA7, and <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>
                    R551-3. Consequently the gene was reannotated to code for this function and the
                    gap in propanoate degradation pathway was thus closed by addition of the
                    corresponding GPR. In other cases, discrepancies exist between various
                    databases, as in the case of PP5029, which is annotated in KEGG as
                    ‘formiminoglutamase’ but in NCBI as
                    ‘<italic>N</italic>-formylglutamate deformylase’. Analysis
                    of network gaps, genomic context and sequence homology provided a strong
                    indication that ‘<italic>N</italic>-formylglutamate
                    deformylase’ is the correct annotation. In many other cases the
                    reannotation meant changing the substrate specificity of the enzyme (which
                    corresponds to changing the last part of the EC number). These were mainly
                    identified by BLASTing the protein against protein sequences of other microbes
                    and, whenever available, cross-checking the BLAST results against primary
                    research publications. The full list of reannotations suggested by the

                <title>Comparison of the Predicted and Measured Growth Yields and the Role of
                    Maintenance</title>
                <p>After completing the reconstruction, we assessed whether the model was capable of
                    predicting the growth yield of <italic>P. putida</italic>, a basic property of
                    the modeled organism. <italic>In silico</italic> growth yield on succinate was
                    calculated by FBA and compared with <italic>in vivo</italic> growth yield
                    measured in continuous culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Duetz1">[37]</xref>. If the <italic>in silico</italic> yield were
                    lower than the experimental, it would indicate that the network may lack
                    important reactions that influence the efficiency of conversion of carbon source
                    into biomass constituents and/or energy. In fact, the calculated <italic>in
                        silico</italic> yield (0.61
                        g<sub>DW</sub>⋅g<sub>C</sub><sup>−1</sup>) was higher
                    than the experimental yield (0.47
                        g<sub>DW</sub>⋅g<sub>C</sub><sup>−1</sup>), indicating
                    that some of the processes reconstructed in the network might be unrealistically
                    efficient and/or that <italic>P. putida</italic> may be diverting resources into
                    other processes not accounted for in the model. This greater efficiency of the
                        <italic>in silico</italic> model versus <italic>in vivo</italic> growth data
                    is also consistent with recent studies that suggest optimal growth is not
                    necessarily the sole objective (function) of biochemical networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Pfeiffer1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Schuster1">[39]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The <italic>in silico</italic> growth yield is influenced not only by the
                    structure of the metabolic network, but also by other factors including biomass
                    composition and the growth-associated and non-growth-associated energy
                    maintenance factors (GAM and NGAM), the values of which represent energy costs
                    to the cell of “living” and “growing”,
                    respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Varma1">[22]</xref>. Therefore, since both the biomass
                    composition and the GAM/NGAM values were taken from the <italic>E. coli</italic>
                    model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Varma1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Reed2">[33]</xref> due to a lack of
                    organism-specific experimental information, we evaluated the influence of these
                    factors on the predicted growth yield.</p>
                <p>First, we analyzed the effects of changes in the ratios of biomass components on
                    the iJP815 growth yield. These analyses (displayed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s012">Text S1</xref>,
                    section “Assessment of the influence of the biomass composition the
                    growth yield”) indicated that varying any single biomass constituent
                    by 20% up or down has a less than 1% effect on the growth
                    yield of <italic>P. putida</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These results are consistent with
                    results of a previous study on the sensitivity of growth yield to biomass
                    composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Pramanik1">[40]</xref>. Although it is still possible that some
                    components of <italic>P. putida</italic> biomass are not present in <italic>E.
                        coli</italic> or vice versa, we conclude that the use of <italic>E.
                    coli</italic> biomass composition in the <italic>P. putida</italic> model is a
                    justified assumption for the purpose of our application and is probably not a
                    great contributor to the error in our predictions of growth yield.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, the effects of changes in the GAM on the <italic>in silico</italic>
                    growth yield were tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). It was found that if GAM
                    was of the same order of magnitude as the value used in the <italic>E.
                    coli</italic> model (13
                        [mmol<sub>ATP</sub>⋅g<sub>DW</sub><sup>−1</sup>),
                    its influence is negligible, as increasing or decreasing it twofold alters the
                    growth yield by merely 5%. A higher GAM value in <italic>P.
                    putida</italic> than in <italic>E. coli</italic> could contribute to the
                    discrepancy between the experimental measurements and <italic>in silico</italic>
                    predictions, but it could not be the only factor unless the <italic>E.
                    coli</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic> values differ more than twofold,
                    which is unlikely.</p>
                <p>Finally, we assessed the effects of changes in the value of NGAM on <italic>in
                        silico</italic> growth yield. The NGAM growth dependency is influenced by
                    the rate of carbon source supply, and thus indirectly by the growth rate. If the
                    carbon intake flux is low (as in the case of the experiments mentioned above,
                    with a dilution rate of 0.05 h<sup>−1</sup>), the fraction of energy
                    utilized for maintenance purposes is high and therefore so is the influence of
                    the NGAM value on growth yield (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Under such low-carbon intake
                    flux conditions, a twofold increase of the NGAM value can decrease the growth
                    yield by about 30%. This indicates that the main cause for the
                    discrepancy between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic>
                    growth yields is that the NGAM value is likely to be higher in <italic>P.
                    putida</italic> than in <italic>E. coli</italic>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s002">Figure S2A</xref>
                    indicates that increasing the NGAM value from 7.6 of 12
                        [mmol<sub>ATP</sub>⋅g<sub>DW</sub><sup>−1</sup>⋅h<sup>−1</sup>]
                    would reduce the <italic>in silico</italic> growth yield and lead to a better
                    match with experimental values. Consequently this NGAM value was used in
                    subsequent FBA and Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Mahadevan1">[41]</xref> simulations.</p>
                <p>For a high influx of carbon source (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) the influence of NGAM on the
                    growth yield is low and the influence of the NGAM and GAM values on growth yield
                    are comparable. It should be noted that, while FBA predicts the optimal growth
                    yield, few cellular systems operate at full efficiency. Bacteria tend to
                    “waste” or redirect energy if it is abundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Russell1">[42]</xref>,
                    leading to a lower-than-optimal <italic>in vivo</italic> growth yield. It is
                    also worth mentioning that maintenance values may depend on the carbon source
                    used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Hempfling1">[43]</xref> and on environmental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Mainzer1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Fieschko1">[46]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Additionally, we computed the growth yields of <italic>P. putida</italic> on sole
                    sources of three other important elements—Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous
                    (P), and Sulfur (S)—and compared these with published experimental
                    data from continuous cultivations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Duetz1">[37]</xref>, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000210-t004">Table 4</xref>. Since biomass
                    composition can play a role in the efficiency of <italic>in silico</italic>
                    usage of basic elements, this analysis can aid in assessing how well the biomass
                    equation, which is equivalent to the <italic>E. coli</italic> biomass reaction,
                    reproduces the true biomass composition of <italic>P. putida</italic>. The yield

                    putida</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> for these components. The
                    differences in yields, however, may be also caused by the change of the
                        <italic>in vivo</italic> biomass composition, which decreases the fraction
                    of compounds containing the limited element, when compared to the biomass
                    composition while the bacterium is grown under carbon-limitation. Such changes
                    were observed experimentally in <italic>P. putida</italic> for nitrogen and
                    phosphate limitations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Bratbak1">[47]</xref>. Thus, the biomass composition of <italic>P.
                        putida</italic> needs to be determined precisely in the future. However, for
                    the purpose of this work and since the global effect of the biomass composition
                    on the outcome of the simulations is negligible (as shown above), we considered
                    the use of the original biomass equation to be justified.</p>

                <title>Analysis of Blocked Reactions: The Quest for Completeness</title>
                <p>As described above, iJP815 contains 289 unconditionally (i.e., not dependent on
                    external sources) blocked reactions (that is, reactions unable to function
                    because not all connections are made), corresponding to 33% of the
                    metabolic network. In previously published genome-scale metabolic
                    reconstructions, the fraction of blocked reactions varies between 10 and 70
                    percent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Burgard2">[48]</xref>. Blocked reactions occur in reconstructions
                    mostly due to knowledge gaps in the metabolic pathways. Accordingly, the
                    blocked-reactions set can be divided into two major groups; (1) reactions with
                    no connection to the set of non-blocked reactions, and (2) reactions that are
                    either directly or indirectly connected to the operating core of the <italic>P.
                        putida</italic> model. The first group of reactions includes members of
                    incomplete pathways that, with increasing knowledge and further model
                    refinement, will gradually become connected to the core. This subset comprises
                    108 reactions (35% of blocked reaction set). The second group of
                    reactions comprises also members of incomplete pathways, but many of them belong
                    to pathways that are complete but that lack a transport reaction for the initial
                    or final compound. Examples of pathways lacking a transporter are the
                    degradation of fatty acids and of propanoate.</p>
                <p>In addition, there could exist compounds whose production is required only in
                    certain environmental conditions, e.g., under solvent stress, and as such are
                    not included in generic biomass equation. Pathways synthesizing compounds that
                    are not included in the biomass equation but that likely are conditionally
                    required include the synthesis of thiamine, various porphyrins and terpenoids.
                    In this case, reactions involved exclusively in the production of such compounds
                    would be blocked if no alternative outlets exist for those pathways. Allowing a
                    non-zero flux through these reactions would require inclusion into biomass of
                    the conditional biomass constituents, which in turn would require having various
                    biomass equations for various conditions. This level of detail, however, is
                    beyond the scope of our initial metabolic reconstruction and investigation.</p>
                <p>The high number of blocked reactions in iJP815 clearly indicates that there are
                    still vast knowledge deficits in the model and, thus, in the underlying
                    biochemical and genomic information. Since a genome-scale metabolic model seeks
                    to incorporate all current knowledge of an organism's metabolism, these
                    reactions are integral elements of the metabolic reconstruction and of the
                    modeling scaffold, even if they are not able to directly participate in steady
                    state flux studies. Therefore, the inclusion of these reactions in the model
                    provides a framework to pin-point knowledge gaps, to include novel information
                    as it becomes available and to subsequently study their embedding and function
                    in the metabolic wiring of the cell.</p>

                <p>The assessment performed as described above by means of high-throughput

                    predictions (in red) generally agree well with the measurements (in green)
                    throughout the network, as most of the <sup>13</sup>C values fall within the FVA
                    intervals, where intervals were predicted, or both values are close to each
                    other (in absolute values), when a single value was predicted. As <italic>P.
                        putida</italic> lacks phosphofructokinase, glucose can be converted to
                    pyruvate (the entry metabolite of TCA cycle) via the pentose phosphate (PP) or
                    the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathways. The ED pathway is energetically more
                    efficient and the <sup>13</sup>C measurements indicate that KT2440 uses it
                    preferentially over the PP pathway. Therefore, the FVA yields locally single
                    flux values rather than intervals, which reflects the relative rigidity of this
                    part of the network. In contrast, the energy generating part of the central
                    metabolic network (the TCA cycle and its vicinity) exhibits greater flexibility,
                    as illustrated by the broad flux intervals. Firstly, the conversion of
                    phosphoenylpyruvate into pyruvate can proceed either directly or via
                    oxaloacetate, although the bacterium appears to use the direct route (the
                        <sup>13</sup>C-model assumes, in fact, only the direct route; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s012">Text S1</xref>,
                    section “Comparison of FVA analyses with <sup>13</sup>C flux
                    measurement data”). Secondly, the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate
                    may also occur directly or via pyruvate. The <sup>13</sup>C flux measurements
                    indicate that the bacterium uses the indirect route in addition to the direct
                    one although, according to the FVA, the indirect route is energetically less
                    efficient. Interestingly, our model suggests also that the glyoxylate shunt
                    could be used interchangeably with full TCA-cycle without any penalty on growth
                    yield. However, as the glyoxylate shunt is inactivated in many bacterial species
                    via catabolite repression upon glucose growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Cozzone1">[51]</xref>, it is possible
                    that this alternative is not used in <italic>P. putida.</italic></p>

                        <sup>13</sup>C measurements, there still exist a number of discrepancies.
                    For instance, the <sup>13</sup>C-experiments suggest that the bacterium utilizes
                    the portion of glycolysis between triose-3-phosphate and

                    simulations. This illustrates one of the possible pitfalls of FBA, which per
                    definition assumes perfect optimality despite the fact that microorganisms might
                    not necessarily allocate their resources towards the optimization function
                    assumed in analysis, and in some cases may not operate optimally at all <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Teusink1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Schuetz1">[53]</xref>. Another group of
                    differences concentrates around the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), although
                    these are relatively minor and are likely due to differences in the quantities
                    of sugar diverted toward biomass in the <sup>13</sup>C model vs. iJP815. A third
                    group of differences revolves around pyruvate and oxaloacetate, whereby the
                        <italic>in vivo</italic> conversion of malate to oxaloacetate shuttles
                    through a pyruvate intermediate rather than directly converting between the two.
                    The last area where discrepancies exist between <italic>in silico</italic> and
                        <sup>13</sup>C data is in the TCA cycle, around which the flux is lower in
                    FVA simulations than in the experiment. This suggests that the <italic>in

                    major differences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We also assessed the influence of
                    the biomass composition on the distribution of internal fluxes and network
                    structure and found that this was negligible on both accounts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s013">Text S2</xref>,
                    section “Evaluation of biomass equation composition on the outcome of
                    FBA/FVA simulations” and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The results show that, in
                    principle, the bacterium can use all the alternatives described above and that
                    the penalty on the growth yield is minimal. While this analysis validates the
                    FVA simulation results, the wide breadth of the intervals (i.e., the mean ratio
                    of interval width to mean interval value exceeds three), suggests that the
                    (mathematical) under-determination of central metabolism can be quite high, and
                    indicates that there exist multiple sub-optimal solutions across the network and
                    that is thus difficult to predict exact internal flux and to
                    “pin-point” a particular solution. These results reflect the
                    essence of constraint-based modeling and FBA, which provide only a space of
                    possible flux distributions and not exact values. Therefore, deductions from
                    results of FBA simulations have to be made with great care. This underscores the
                    notion that constraint based modeling should be seen more as navigation
                    framework to probe and explore networks rather than as an exact predictive tool
                    of cellular metabolism.</p>

                    <p>To assess the robustness of the metabolic network to genetic perturbations
                        (e.g., knock-out mutations), we carried out an <italic>in-silico</italic>
                        analysis of the essentiality of single genes and reactions, which enabled us
                        to identify the most fragile nodes of the iJP815 network. Reaction
                        essentiality simulations were performed by systematically removing each
                        reaction from the network and by assessing the ability of the model to
                        produce biomass <italic>in silico</italic> via FBA in minimal medium with a
                        sole carbon source (glucose and acetate). Gene essentiality was assessed by:
                        (i) identifying for each gene the operability of the reaction(s) dependent
                        on this gene, (ii) removing from the network the reactions rendered
                        inoperative by the deletion of that particular gene, and (iii) determining
                        the ability of the model to produce biomass in the same manner as for the
                        reaction essentiality tests. Additionally, we estimated for both carbon
                        sources the smallest possible set of reactions able to sustain <italic>in
                            silico</italic> growth, in order to estimate the number of reactions
                        necessary for biomass synthesis in minimal medium (minimal set). This set
                        encompasses both all reactions that are essential (including those essential
                        regardless of the medium and those ‘conditionally
                        essential’) and the minimal number of non-essential reactions
                        that, together, are able to provide <italic>in silico</italic> growth (see
                            <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000210-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These

                    <p>The sets of essential reactions consist of 259 and 274 reactions for glucose
                        and acetate conditions respectively, constituting 82 and 86 percent of the
                        minimal set. These numbers indicate that most of the crucial metabolic
                        routes are not duplicated at the level of metabolic network structure. The
                        set of essential reactions under glucose growth is a subset of that under
                        acetate, suggesting that the growth on glucose is more resistant to
                        perturbations (as the smaller number of reactions mean less fragility points
                        in the network). The reactions belonging exclusively to the acetate minimal
                        set are mostly members of glyconeogenic pathway, with ATP synthase, the

                    <p>The metabolic robustness of an organism may also be provided at the genetic
                        level through genes coding for isozymes. Data on gene and reaction
                        essentiality provide insights into this phenomenon. We utilized FBA to
                        generate a list of <italic>in silico</italic> essential gene predictions,
                        including 153 and 159 genes under minimal glucose and acetate growth
                        respectively, in order to determine how gene/pathway redundancy affects
                        network robustness. These values may seem low when compared to the size of
                        the predicted essential reactions sets (259 and 274 reactions for glucose
                        and acetate growth, respectively). However, it must first be noted that each
                        essential reaction set contains about 25 (26 and 27 for the glucose and
                        acetate essential set, respectively) non gene-associated reactions, and that
                        elucidating the genes catalyzing these reactions would increase
                        substantially the number of <italic>in silico</italic> essential genes.
                        Further, approximately 20% of each minimal set (78 and 84 genes
                        under glucose and acetate conditions, respectively) consists of essential
                        reactions that can be catalyzed by two or more isozymes and thus are
                        essential at the metabolic network level but not at the genetic level. In
                        contrast to non-essential reactions in the minimal set, these reactions
                        essential at the metabolic network level but not at the genetic level are
                        not clustered in particular metabolic pathways but are rather spread
                        throughout the entire metabolic network. Altogether, these results indicate
                        that for about 40% of the reactions required to produce biomass,
                        there are alternative at either the genetic or the metabolic network level.</p>
                    <p>This analysis highlights the limitations of possible interventions aimed at
                        reshaping the flux distributions, because these can be applied only to
                        reactions that are not essential (since the inactivation of an essential
                        reaction yields a lethal phenotype). Identification of reactions catalyzed
                        by multiple enzymes shows which reactions may be best avoided when planning
                        mutational strategies as their inactivation may pose additional technical
                        problems, by requiring production of multiple knock-outs.</p>

                    <title>Flexibility of flux distributions</title>
                    <p>To further investigate these conclusions, we determined the flexibility of
                        fluxes over particular reactions as a measure of metabolic network
                        flexibility during biomass production. We found that the variability of
                        fluxes is similar under either glucose or acetate growth, but that acetate
                        growth instills a slightly higher rigidity to the metabolic network (as
                        observed above). We observed also that the flux of more than a half of the
                        reactions can vary to some degree without influencing biomass output. We
                        next analyzed the pathway-distribution of reactions exhibiting variable
                        flux, and found that biosynthetic pathways are in general more rigid (i.e.,
                        the fraction of reactions with flexible flux is relatively lower) than other
                        pathways. This rigidity might reflect the essentiality of these pathways
                        modules for the survival of the cell (See sections “Analysis of
                        flexibility of the flux over particular reactions” in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s012">Text S1</xref>

                        S5</xref>). A further measure to ascertain network flexibility was the
                        assessment of pairwise couplings between the reactions via Flux Coupling

                        for 90% of the reactions that are unblocked in a given condition,
                        at least one other reaction exists whose flux is proportionally coupled to
                        the flux of the first reaction, and therefore that the great majority of
                        reactions can be inactivated through inactivation of some other reaction.
                        This analysis is helpful in optimizing mutational strategies as it

                    growth-phenotypes with the growth of knock-out strains is a powerful way to
                    validate predictions. This has been done in a number of studies for which
                    knock-out mutant libraries were available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Oh1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Oberhardt1">[60]</xref>. As there is
                    currently no mutant library for <italic>P. putida</italic>, we tested gene
                    knock-out predictions with a set of <italic>P. putida</italic> auxotrophic
                    mutant strains created in our laboratory that are incapable of growth on minimal
                    medium with acetate as the sole carbon source. First we compared whether the
                    corresponding <italic>in silico</italic> mutants followed the same behavior
                    (lack of growth on minimal medium with acetate, where zero biomass flux during
                    FBA corresponded to a no-growth phenotype). This comparison was performed only
                    for strains whose knocked-out gene is included in iJP815. Thirty-eight out of
                    the 51 strains tested did not grow <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s010">Table S4</xref>).
                    Of the remaining 13 false positives (i.e., those growing <italic>in
                    silico</italic> but not <italic>in vivo</italic>), four (PP1470, PP1471, PP4679,
                    and PP4680) are mutated in genes considered non-essential <italic>in
                    silico</italic> due to “weakly annotated” gene putatively
                    encoding redundant isozymes. In the case of PP5185 (coding for
                    <italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamate synthase), its essentiality is removed by
                    PP1346 (coding for bifunctional ornithine
                    acetyltransferase/<italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamate synthase protein), which is
                    not only an isozyme of PP5185 (the <italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamate synthase
                    function) but which also catalyses a reaction (ornithine acetyltransferase) that
                    produces <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>l</sc>-glutamate (the product of
                        <italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamate synthase) and thus renders the activity
                    of PP5185 redundant. It appears either that this is a mis-annotation or that the
                    enzyme is utilized only under different conditions.</p>
                <p>In addition, PP0897 (<italic>fum</italic>C) seems to have two paralogues (PP0944,
                    PP1755) coding for isoenzymes of fumarate hydratase, but since the mutant in
                    PP0897 does not grow auxotrophically, they are either non functional or
                    mis-annotated. The enzyme complex that is composed of proteins expressed from
                    the genes knocked-out in the two false positives PP4188 and PP 4189 catalyzes
                    the decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA in the TCA cycle,
                    concurrently producing succinyl-CoA for anabolic purposes. In the model, this
                    functionality is not needed as this part of the TCA cycle can be circumvented by
                    the glyoxylate shunt, whereas succinyl-CoA can be produced by reverse operation
                    of succinate-CoA ligase. Restricting this reaction to be irreversible renders
                    both genes essential. This altogether suggests that either the succinate-CoA
                    ligase is irreversible or the glyoxylate shunt is inactive. The latter solution
                    is, however, impossible, due to the essentiality of the glyoxylate shunt upon
                    growth on acetate.</p>
                <p>The false positive PP4782 is involved in thiamine biosynthesis. This cofactor is
                    not included in the biomass, which is why the gene is not <italic>in
                    silico</italic> essential. This suggests thus that the <italic>in-silico P.
                        putida</italic> biomass reaction should be enriched with this cofactor. The
                    remaining false positives (PP1768, PP4909, PP5155) are involved in the serine
                    biosynthesis pathway. We found experimentally that mutants in these genes can
                    grow on acetate if the medium also contains <sc>l</sc>-serine. These genes can
                    be rendered <italic>in silico</italic> essential by setting glycine
                    hydroxymethyltransferase to operate only unidirectionally from <sc>l</sc>-serine
                    to glycine. The operation of this enzyme, however, is required for growth of the
                    bacterium on glycine, which is possible; though very slow (results not shown).
                    One of these genes (PP5155) has also a weakly annotated isozyme (PP2335). We
                    found out as well that several of the mutants (PP1612, PP4188-9, PP4191-4) grow
                        <italic>in silico</italic> on glucose, which we confirmed experimentally
                    (results not shown). Altogether, these experimental results assisted us in
                    improving the accuracy of the model.</p>
                <p>Albeit limited to a relatively small mutant set, this analysis shows that while
                    constraint-based models are not always able to predict exact flux values, they
                    are very useful in the identification of essential reactions and, through the
                    GPRs, the genes responsible for their catalysis. This enables identification of
                    vulnerable points in the metabolic network.</p>

                <title>Model Application—Production of Polyhydroxyalkanoates from
                    Nonalkanoates</title>
                <p>To illustrate the utility of a genome-scale model for metabolic engineering, we
                    used iJP815 to predict possible improvements to an industrially relevant
                    process; namely, the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from
                    non-alkanoic substrates for biomedical purposes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Steinbuchel1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-vanderWalle1">[63]</xref>. As the
                    production of PHAs uses resources that would be otherwise funneled towards
                    growth, increasing <italic>in silico</italic> PHA production would decrease the
                    growth. Consequently, in classic optimization-based approaches (e.g., FBA), no
                    PHA production would be predicted while optimizing for growth yield. The aim was
                    thus to increase the available pool of the main precursor of
                    PHAs—Acetyl Coenzyme A (AcCoA). This approach was based on the
                    observation that inactivation of isocitrate lyase (ICL) enhances the production
                    of PHAs in <italic>P. putida</italic> due to increased availability of AcCoA
                    that is not consumed by ICL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Klinke1">[64]</xref>. We therefore searched for other possible
                    intervention points (mutations) in the metabolic network that could lead to the
                    accumulation of AcCoA. This analysis was performed through application of a
                    modified OptKnock approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Burgard1">[28]</xref>, which allowed for parallel prediction of
                    mutations and carbon source(s) that together provide the highest production of
                    the compound of interest.</p>
                <p>Two main methods were employed to model a cellular pooling of AcCoA. The first
                    was the maximization of AcCoA production by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). In the
                    second, an auxiliary reaction was introduced that consumed AcCoA (concurrently
                    producing CoA, to avoid cofactor cycling artifacts) and that would represent the
                    pooling of AcCoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000210-g006">Figure 6A and
                    6B</xref>, insets). It is noteworthy that the value of ‘AcCoA
                    production’ predicted by the first method includes AcCoA that is then
                    consumed in other reactions (some of which will lead towards biomass production
                    for instance), whereas the value of ‘AcCoA pooling’
                    predicted by the second method includes only AcCoA that is taken completely out
                    of the system, and therefore made available for PHA production but unusable for
                    growth or other purposes. Therefore, only with the first method (AcCoA
                    production) can AcCoA fluxes and growth rates be compared directly with the
                    wild-type AcCoA flux and growth rate, as the second method (AcCoA pooling) will
                    display lower values for AcCoA fluxes and growth rates but will avoid
                    ‘double counting’ AcCoA flux that is shuttled towards
                    growth, and therefore is not available for PHA production (see plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000210-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>).</p>

                <p>To create the <italic>in silico</italic> mutants, we allowed the OptKnock
                    procedure to block a maximum of two reactions, which corresponds,
                    experimentally, to the creation of a double mutant. To avoid lethal <italic>in
                        silico</italic> strains, the minimal growth yield was limited to a value
                    ranging between 0.83 and 6.67

                    corresponding to about 5 and 40 percent of maximum growth yield, respectively.</p>
                <p>Six mutational strategies suggested by this approach are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000210-t005">Table 5</xref>. The first three

                <p>One promising hypothesis (strategy 2) generated by the AcCoA production method
                    predicted that a double-mutant devoid of 6-phosphogluconolactonase
                    (<italic>pgl</italic>/PP1023) and periplasmatic glucose dehydrogenase
                        (<italic>gcd</italic>/PP1444), would produce 29% more AcCoA than
                    the wild type growing on glucose as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000210-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). As we are currently still in the
                    process of generating this mutant, we were not yet able to test the prediction.
                    Another promising hypothesis (strategy 1) included knocking-out triose phosphate
                    isomerase (<italic>tpiA</italic>/PP4715). As the mutant for
                    <italic>tpiA</italic> was generated in this work, we tested whether it is able
                    to grow on the predicted carbon source (<sc>d</sc>-fructose), but the observed
                    growth was very weak (only very small colonies grew on agar plates after three
                    days). This suggests that growth might be too inhibited by this strategy for it
                    to be of great use.</p>
                <p>One strategy suggested by the AcCoA pooling method (strategy 4) called for
                    knocking out 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (<italic>prpD</italic>/PP2338) and
                    citrate synthase (<italic>gltA</italic>/PP4194), and supplying <italic>P.
                    putida</italic> with valine. Using this strategy, AcCoA pooling could
                    theoretically reach 21.9
                        mmol⋅g<sub>DW</sub><sup>−1</sup>⋅h<sup>−1</sup>,
                    but at a severe expense in bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000210-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The other strategies suggested by
                    the AcCoA pooling method highlight a somewhat linear tradeoff between growth and
                    AcCoA pooling, which could be investigated experimentally to determine how much
                    growth disruption is acceptable in a bioengineered production strain of
                        <italic>P. putida</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000210-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
                <p>These strategies illustrate the possible approaches to optimizing production of a
                    non-growth associated compound, and highlight the need for further experimental
                    work to assess the performance of this approach.</p>

            <p>A primary value of genome-scale metabolic models is their ability to provide a
                holistic view of metabolism allowing, for instance, for quantitative investigation
                of dependencies between species existing far apart in the metabolic network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Reed1">[20]</xref>. Once
                experimentally validated, these models can be used to characterize metabolic
                resource allocation, to generate experimentally testable predictions of cell
                phenotype, to elucidate metabolic network evolution scenarios, and to design
                experiments that most effectively reveal genotype-phenotype relationships.
                Furthermore, owing to their genome-wide scale, these models enable systematic
                assessment of how perturbations in the metabolic network affect the organism as a
                whole, such as in determining lethality of mutations or predicting the effects of
                nutrient limitations. Since these multiple and intertwined relationships are not
                immediately obvious without genome-scale analysis, they would not be found during
                investigation of small, isolated circuits or genes as is typical in a traditional
                reductionist approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Patil1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Jamshidi1">[66]</xref>.</p>
            <p>We present here a genome-scale reconstruction and constraint-based model of the
                    <italic>P. putida</italic> strain KT2440, accounting for 815 genes whose
                products correspond to 877 reactions and connect 886 metabolites. The manually
                curated reconstruction was based on the most up-to-date annotation of the bacterium,
                the content of various biological databases, primary research publications and
                specifically designed functional genomics experiments. New or refined annotations
                for many genes were suggested during the reconstruction process. The model was
                validated with a series of experimental sets, including continuous culture data,
                BIOLOG substrate utilization assays, <sup>13</sup>C flux measurements and a set of
                specifically-generated mutant strains. FBA and FVA were used to ascertain the
                distribution of resources in KT2440, to systematically assess gene and reaction
                essentiality and to gauge the robustness of the metabolic network. Hence, this work
                represents one of the most thorough sets of analyses thus far performed for an
                organism by means of constraint-based modeling, providing thereby a solid
                genome-scale framework for the exploration of the metabolism of this fascinating and
                versatile bacterium. However, since this modeling endeavor relies upon a number of
                approximations, the limits, potential and applicability of the analysis must be
                clearly identified and defined. We address these points below.</p>
            <p>Altogether, our results and analyses show that the model accurately captures a
                substantial fraction of the metabolic functions of <italic>P. putida</italic>
                KT2440. Therefore, the model was used to generate hypotheses on constraining and
                redirecting fluxes towards the improvement of production of polyhydroxyalkanoates,
                which are precursors for industrially and medically important bioplastics. This is,
                to our knowledge, the first reported application of constraint-based modeling to
                direct and improve the yield of a compound of which the production is not directly
                coupled to the growth of the organism. This opens up novel areas of application for
                the constraint-based approach. Our approach, based on the OptKnock algorithm, allows
                for both prediction of mutants with desirable properties and identification of
                conditions that support the expression of these properties.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the generally good agreement between experimental results and
                simulations of our model, several of the discrepancies encountered reflect pitfalls
                inherent to constraint-based modeling that go beyond the scope of our study:</p>
            <p>Firstly, the high number of blocked reactions and the mismatches with the BIOLOG data
                show that there are still many areas of the metabolism that require thorough
                exploration. The genes encoding transport-related are particularly relevant, as for
                most of them, neither the translocated compound nor the mechanism of translocation
                is known. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that the genome still has 1635 genes
                annotated as “hypothetical” or “conserved
                hypothetical”, more than 800 genes annotated as putative, and over 800 for
                which the functional annotation gives no information beyond the protein family name.
                It is thus likely that a fraction of the hypothetical and non-specifically annotated
                genes in the current <italic>P. putida</italic> annotation are responsible for
                unknown metabolic or transport processes, or that some might code for proteins that
                add redundancy to known pathways. This observation is common to all genomes
                sequenced so far and illustrates a major hurdle in the model building process (and
                hence, its usefulness) that can be overcome only through extensive studies in
                functional genomics.</p>
            <p>Secondly, although we carefully constrained the <italic>in silico</italic> flux space
                through FBA and FVA and obtained distribution spaces roughly consistent with those
                experimentally determined via <sup>13</sup>C- flux analysis, these approaches are
                inherently limited as they assume growth as a sole metabolic objective and ignore
                any effects not explicitly represented in a constraint-based metabolic model. It has
                been shown that FBA using objective functions other than growth can improve
                predictive accuracy under certain conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Schuetz1">[53]</xref>. Kinetic limitations
                also may play a very important role in determining the extent to which a particular
                reaction or pathway is used. Teusink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Teusink1">[52]</xref> showed that in the
                case of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> these factors may lead to false predictions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the reconstruction includes causal relationships between genes and reactions
                via gene-protein-relationships (GPRs) but it lacks explicit information regarding
                gene regulation. The regulation of gene expression causes that there are many genes
                in the cell that are expressed only under certain growth conditions. Therefore, the
                    <italic>in silico</italic> flux space is generally larger than the true
                    <italic>in vivo</italic> flux space of the metabolic network. This, in turn, may
                influence the robustness of the metabolic network and the essentiality of some
                reactions and genes. The lack of regulatory information and of the genetic
                interactions involved is likely to be one of the causes for faulty predictions of
                the viability of mutant strains. Adding this information will be an important step
                in the further development and improvement of the accuracy of the reconstruction.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, although our analyses indicated that growth yield is relatively insensitive
                to changes in biomass composition, these analyses also suggest that factors other
                than the structure of the metabolic network play an important role in defining the
                relationship between the growth yield and environmental conditions. The prediction
                of the exact growth yield requires the precise measurement of maintenance values,
                which may vary substantially from one condition to the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Mainzer1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Fieschko1">[46]</xref>. As
                the maintenance accounts for 10–30% of the total carbon source
                provided in unstressed conditions, this may set a limit to the accuracy of the
                growth yield predictions.</p>
            <p>To enhance the usefulness and predictiveness of the model, several avenues could be
                followed in the future. Firstly, additional constraints can be overlaid on the
                network to reduce the space of possibilities and increase the accuracy of
                predictions. In addition to specific knowledge of particular enzymatic or transport
                processes, such constraints are best based on high-throughput experimental evidence
                such as transcriptomic and proteomic data, which are instrumental in expanding
                genotype-phenotype relationships in the context of genome-scale metabolic models

                Microarray experiments have guided the discovery of metabolic regulons, and usage of
                microarray and proteomic data to constrain metabolic models has improved model
                accuracy for other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Covert1">[23]</xref>. Secondly, <italic>P. putida</italic> provides a
                good opportunity for incorporating kinetic information into a genome-scale model as
                there are various kinetic models available and under development for small circuits
                in <italic>P. putida</italic>
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Seker1">[68]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Abuhamed1">[71]</xref>. Incorporating data
                from these models into the genome-scale reconstruction would provide insights into
                the relationships of isolated metabolic subsystems within the global metabolism.
                This synthesis would also improve the flux predictions of the global model,
                particularly in areas where current FBA-based predictions methods fail due to their
                inherent limitations.</p>
            <p>Experimental validation of a genome-scale model is an iterative process that is
                performed continuously as a model is refined and improved through novel information
                and validation rounds. In this work, we have globally validated iJP815 as well as
                specific parts thereof by using both up-to-date publicly available data and data
                generated in our lab, but there will be always parts of the model that include
                blocked reactions and pathways that will require further, specific validation. As
                more knowledge becomes available from the joint efforts of the large <italic>P.
                    putida</italic> community (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.psysmo.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.psysmo.org</ext-link>), focus will
                be put on these low-knowledge areas for future experimental endeavors. We anticipate
                that this model will be of valuable assistance to those efforts.</p>
            <p>The metabolic reconstruction, the subsequent mathematical computation and the
                experimental validation reported here provide a sound framework to explore the
                metabolic capabilities of this versatile bacterium, thereby yielding valuable
                insights into the genotype-phenotype relationships governing its metabolism and
                contributing to our ability to exploit the biotechnological potential of
                pseudomonads. By providing the means to examine all aspects of metabolism, an
                iterative modeling process can generate logical hypotheses and identify conditions
                (such as regulatory events or conditional expression of cellular functions) that
                would reconcile disagreements between experimental observations and simulation
                results. Through a detailed <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of
                polyhydroxyalkanoate production, we show how central metabolic precursors of a
                compound of interest not directly coupled to the organism's growth function
                might be increased via modification of global flux patterns. Furthermore, as the
                species <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> encompasses strains with a wide range of
                metabolic features and numerous isolates with unique phenotypes, the reconstruction
                presented provides a basic scaffold upon which future models of other <italic>P.
                    putida</italic> strains can be built with the addition or subtraction of
                strain-specific metabolic pathways. Due to its applicability across the numerous
                    <italic>P. putida</italic> strains iJP815 provides a sound basis for many future
                studies towards the elucidation of habitat-specific features, bioremediation
                applications and metabolic engineering strategies with members of this ubiquitous,
                metabolically versatile and fascinating genus.</p>

                <title>Constraint-Based Models</title>
                <p>The <italic>P. putida</italic> model we present was built using a
                    constraint-based (CB) approach. A constraint-based model consists of a genome
                    wide stoichiometric reconstruction of metabolism and a set of constraints on the
                    fluxes of reactions in the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Price1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Reed1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Price2">[24]</xref>. The
                    reconstruction represents stoichiometry of the set of all reactions known to act
                    in metabolism of the organism, which can be determined in large part from
                    genomic data since most cellular reactions are catalyzed by enzymes. Thus the
                    model does not require any knowledge regarding the kinetics of the reactions,
                    and the requisite thermodynamic knowledge is limited to the directionality of
                    reactions.</p>
                <p>In addition to the reactions, the model includes a set of genes tied via Boolean
                    logic to reactions that their protein products catalyze, which allows for
                    accurate discrimination of the effects of genetic perturbations such as
                    knockouts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Reed2">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Edwards1">[72]</xref>. These Boolean
                    rules together form the gene-protein-reaction relationships (GPRs) of the
                    metabolic reconstruction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Reed2">[33]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The second part of the CB-model, namely the constraints, constitutes a set of
                    rules that narrow down the interval within which the flux of particular reaction
                    must lie. These constraints rest upon physico-biological knowledge. One of them,
                    the information regarding reaction directionality, has already been mentioned
                    above. Another constraint that is widely applied in biological systems is the
                    Pseudo-Steady-State Assumption (PSSA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Vanrolleghem1">[73]</xref>, which states
                    that a concentration of a chemical compound stays constant over the simulated
                    time frame. The reactants to which this constraint is applied are usually called
                    internal compounds, and in biological models correspond to the chemical
                    substances located inside the cell or its compartments. Remaining substances,
                    external compounds, correspond to species that can be taken up or secreted and
                    thus exchanged with the environment. Other types of constraints are top and
                    bottom limits that correspond to catalytic capabilities of the enzymes. More

                    <title>Flux balance analysis</title>
                    <p>Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a primary method for analysis of
                        constraint-based models. Generally, a constraint based model of metabolism
                        represents an underdetermined system, i.e., one in which a range of flux
                        distributions are mathematically possible. FBA narrows the flux
                        possibilities by determining a point in closed flux space that maximizes a
                        certain linear combination of fluxes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Varma2">[75]</xref>. FBA poses a
                        linear programming (LP) problem and thus a global maximum always exists,
                        provided that the problem is feasible (i.e., there exists at least one
                        combination of fluxes which fulfills all the constraints). Using the matrix
                        notation the FBA problem can be stated as following:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000210.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <bold>

                    <p>FBA optimization yields an optimal value for the objective along with a flux
                        value for every reaction belonging to the metabolic network. Commonly, FBA
                        is used to predict maximal growth or metabolite production yields. Cell
                        growth is simulated by the flux over a special ‘Biomass’
                        reaction that consumes precursors of cellular components (amino acids,
                        lipids, dNTPs, NTPs, cofactors) and produces a virtual unit of cell biomass.
                        Maximization of this flux is usually set as the FBA objective. This
                        procedure assumes that organisms have been shaped by the evolution towards
                        growth maximization, an assumption that has been validated under a variety
                        of conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Edwards2">[77]</xref>.</p>

                        the mathematically allowed flux space can vary depending upon the network
                        structure and the constraints. Flux variability analysis (FVA) is a method
                        that allows for rough top estimation of the flux space for a given FBA
                        optimization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Mahadevan1">[41]</xref>. FVA computes for each reaction an

                        informative, wherein instead of fixing the objective to its optimal value
                        from the initial FBA run (as in standard FVA), the objective value is
                        allowed to vary within a predetermined limit. For every suboptimal FVA
                        presented in this paper the objective lower limit was chosen at
                        90% of the initial objective value (assuming that FBA maximized

                    non-essential reaction a binary variable was added that reflects the activity of
                    the reaction. When the binary variable takes value of 1 the corresponding
                    reaction is virtually unlimited (or limited by rules of original LP problem).
                    When the variable is set to 0 the corresponding reaction is blocked (non-zero
                    flux is impossible). This was achieved by adding a following set of equations to
                    the original LP problem:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000210.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>for reversible reactions, and<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000210.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>for irreversible reactions.

                <title>Metabolic Network Reconstruction</title>
                <p>The main sources of information regarding the composition of the metabolic
                    network of <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> KT2440 were various biological
                    databases. Most of the information came from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
                    Genomes (KEGG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Kanehisa1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Kanehisa2">[81]</xref> and Pseudomonas
                    Genome Database (PGD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Winsor1">[82]</xref>. Information regarding <italic>P.
                    putida</italic> contained in these two databases is mainly based on the
                    published genome annotation of the bacterium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Nelson1">[14]</xref>, so there is a
                    large overlap between them. Additionally, substantial information was taken from
                    the BRENDA database, which catalogs reaction and enzyme information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000210-Schomburg1">[83]</xref>.
                    This all was augmented with knowledge coming directly from primary research
                    publications (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000210.s014">Text S3</xref>). The reconstruction process was
                    performed in an iterative manner, i.e., by adding or removing reactions from the
                    model in between rounds of model testing. First, reaction information for
                        <italic>P. putida</italic> was collected from KEGG and PGD. Reactions
                    supported by sufficient evidence and with specific enough functional annotations
                    were incorporated into the model. For every accepted reaction its reversibility
                    was assessed basing on assignments in KEGG pathways as well as information from
                    BRENDA database. For reactions with inconsistent assignments a decision about
                    reversibility was made basing on analysis of the reaction as well as its
                    reversibility in other organisms. Hereby, a first version of the metabolic model
                    was created (iJP815<sup>pre1</sup>).</p>
                <p>The next step involved assessing whether the reconstructed metabolic network is
                    able to produce energy from glucose. This was achieved by running FBA with ATP
                    production set as the objective function. Subsequently, the ability of the model
                    to grow <italic>in silico</italic> on glucose was tested. Successful <italic>in
                        silico</italic> growth indicates that every chemical compound belonging to
                    the biomass equation can be synthesized from present sources, using the
                    reactions contained in the model. Since the exact cellular composition of
                        <italic>P. putida</italic> is not known, the composition of <italic>E.
                    coli</italic> biomass was used as an approximation. This test was performed by
                    running FBA with production of each biomass constituent set as the objective. If
                    a compound could not be synthesized, the gaps in the pathway leading to it were
                    identified manually and a search was performed for reactions that could fill the
                    gaps. If this approach was unsuccessful, gaps were filled with reactions from
                    the <italic>E. coli</italic> model. This yielded the second version of the
                    reconstruction (iJP815<sup>pre2</sup>).</p>
                <p>The third round of reconstruction consisted of two sub-steps. First, the
                    compounds for which transport proteins exist were identified and appropriate
                    reactions added. Second, the results of BIOLOG carbon-source utilization
                    experiments were compared with <italic>in silico</italic> simulations for growth
                    on those compounds. It was assumed that the ability to grow <italic>in
                    silico</italic> on the particular compound as the sole carbon source
                    approximates the <italic>in vivo</italic> utilization. For those compounds that
                    did not show <italic>in silico</italic> growth, a literature search was
                    performed in order to identify possible pathways of utilization. The results of
                    this search, in the form of reactions and GPRs, were added to the model. The
                    outcome was the final version of the model (iJP815).</p>
