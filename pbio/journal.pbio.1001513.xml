      <abstract>
        <p>Plant stomata function in innate immunity against bacterial invasion and abscisic acid (ABA) has been suggested to regulate this process. Using genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that (i) the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> nine-specific-lipoxygenase encoding gene, <italic>LOX1</italic>, which is expressed in guard cells, is required to trigger stomatal closure in response to both bacteria and the pathogen-associated molecular pattern flagellin peptide flg22; (ii) LOX1 participates in stomatal defense; (iii) polyunsaturated fatty acids, the LOX substrates, trigger stomatal closure; (iv) the LOX products, fatty acid hydroperoxides, or reactive electrophile oxylipins induce stomatal closure; and (v) the flg22-mediated stomatal closure is conveyed by both LOX1 and the mitogen-activated protein kinases MPK3 and MPK6 and involves salicylic acid whereas the ABA-induced process depends on the protein kinases OST1, MPK9, or MPK12. Finally, we show that the oxylipin and the ABA pathways converge at the level of the anion channel SLAC1 to regulate stomatal closure. Collectively, our results demonstrate that early biotic signaling in guard cells is an ABA-independent process revealing a novel function of LOX1-dependent stomatal pathway in plant immunity.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Stomata are microscopic pores that are present in the epidermis of the aerial parts of higher plants, such as the leaves. These pores, which are flanked by a pair of cells called guard cells, regulate transpiration and the exchange of gas between leaves and the atmosphere. It is well documented that the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is a key regulator that controls the osmotic pressure in guard cells, allowing pore size to be adjusted in response to environmental conditions. Recently, stomata have also been shown to play an important role in the innate immune response. Indeed, upon contact with microbes, plants actively close stomata to prevent the entry of microbes and the consequent colonization of host tissue. This response is known as the stomatal defense response. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this defense response are not well understood. Using a variety of approaches, we show in this study that <italic>LOX1</italic>, a gene that encodes lipoxygenase (LOX) in guard cells, plays a major role in stomatal defense in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Mutations in <italic>LOX1</italic> impair stomatal closure and make plants more susceptible to the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato</italic>. We also show that several LOX-derived metabolites, the oxylipins, are potent inducers of stomatal closure. Finally, we provide evidence to show that ABA plays only a minor role in stomatal defense response, specifically by modulating this response.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Due to their sessile nature and the lack of an adaptive immune system, plants have evolved processes to synthesize a vast array of secondary metabolites devoted to their protection against pathogens. Some of these compounds, known as oxylipins, originate from the incorporation of one or several oxygen atoms in the carbon chain of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mainly linoleic acid (18∶2), linolenic acid (18∶3), and roughanic acid (16∶3). This first step leading to the formation of oxygenated fatty acids can be initiated either by reactive oxygen species (ROS) or enzymes such as lipoxygenases (LOXs), α-dioxygenases, or cytochromes P450. The primary hydroperoxy or hydroxy fatty acids can subsequently be converted into a plethora of metabolites, including aldehydes and oxo-acids, epoxydes, epoxy alcohols, hydroxides, divinyl ethers, and cyclized compounds such as jasmonates or phytoprostanes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Ble1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Mosblech1">[4]</xref>, which are involved in different aspects of plant physiology such as development, fertility, senescence, programmed cell death, and defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Wasternack1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Berger1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Vellosillo1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Reinbothe1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Caldelari1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The 9- and 13-specific LOXs that introduce two atoms of oxygen on carbon 9 or 13 of octadecanoic fatty acids, respectively, contribute to the synthesis of a great number of oxylipins. LOX genes are up-regulated and LOX-derived oxylipins are synthesized upon stress and pathogen challenges, suggesting that LOXs play a role in stress adaptation and pathogen defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Feussner1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Porta1">[12]</xref>. The 13-LOX product JA has received much attention as it has been demonstrated to be involved in almost all above-mentioned physiological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Caldelari1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Truman1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Mandoakar1">[15]</xref>. The JA signaling pathway is now well documented involving the conjugate jasmonate-Isoleucine (JA-Ile) as the active form of jasmonic acid (JA), the F-box protein Coronatine Insensitive 1 (COI1) as receptor, and Jasmonate Zim Domain (JAZ) transcription factors as repressors whose degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway leads to the transcription of JA-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Santner1">[16]</xref>. The 9-LOX-derived products have also been identified as signaling molecules regulating plant defense, cell death, as well as lateral root development and singlet oxygen-mediated stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Vellosillo1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Ranc1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Vicente1">[21]</xref>. In contrast to JA, the mechanisms whereby 9-LOX products exert their biological functions are still unknown. Due to their enzymatic activity LOX can produce reactive electrophile species oxylipin (RES oxylipin) from fatty acid hydroperoxides. Recently, the mechanisms underlying RES oxylipin signaling has been uncovered. RES oxylipins possess reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl or epoxide groups and can add to thiol- or amine-containing compounds, such as glutathione (GSH), proteins, or nucleic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Almras1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Mueller3">[27]</xref>. The chemical reactivity of RES oxylipins toward the antioxidant GSH can modify the cellular redox state. RES oxylipins can also target transcription factors and the TGA transcription factors (TGA2, TGA5, and TGA6) were demonstrated to regulate the RES oxylipin-mediated gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Mueller2">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The development of transcriptomic studies and the possibility to access analyses of cell-type-specific gene expressions have enabled us to refine our understanding on the role of genes in plant-specific organs or cells. In this respect, the analyses of cell-type-specific leaf transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Leonhardt1">[28]</xref> allowed much progress in the knowledge of guard cell signaling pathways that contribute to stomatal movements in response to various environmental stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Jammes1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Yao1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, a role of guard cells as an active plant defense mechanism against pathogens has been highlighted by the finding that stomata also function in innate immunity against bacterial invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Melotto1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Zeng1">[34]</xref>. Soon after pathogen recognition, the two guard cells that flank the stomata actively restrict the opening size preventing entry of microbes and host tissue colonization. This response is referred to as the stomatal defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Zeng2">[35]</xref>, and it has been suggested that the abscisic acid (ABA) was a key regulator of the pathogen-mediated stomatal closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Melotto1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The analysis of the cell-type-specific leaf transcriptome of Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Leonhardt1">[28]</xref> allowed us to identify the guard cell specifically expressed <italic>LOX</italic> encoding genes <italic>LOX1</italic> and <italic>LOX6</italic>. By multiple approaches we demonstrate that, in contrast to <italic>LOX6</italic>, <italic>LOX1</italic> plays a major role in the control of stomatal defense and plant innate immunity. We provide evidence that the MAPKs MPK3 and MPK6 and salicylate participate in a LOX1-specific stomatal pathway to respond to pathogens and PAMPs. Moreover, we show that the ABA pathway including the protein kinases OST1, MPK9, and MPK12 only contribute to a small extent to the stomatal response to pathogens. Overall, our data reveal the functioning of an oxylipin- and an ABA-dependent pathway that converge at the level of the anion channel SLAC1 to regulate stomatal closure.</p>

        <p>To test whether <italic>LOX1</italic> exerts its effect on plant immunity at the guard cell level, we compared the behavior of stomata of <italic>lox1</italic> mutants with WT plants in response to <italic>Pst</italic>.

Similarly, the flg22-induced stomatal closure was strongly impaired in both <italic>lox1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). On the contrary, the <italic>lox6-1</italic> mutant line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s010">Methods S1</xref>), was not compromised in its ability to close stomata in response to flg22 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Considering that ABA has been identified as a positive regulator of pathogen and PAMP-induced stomatal closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Melotto2">[33]</xref>, we investigated also whether <italic>lox1</italic> mutants showed altered sensitivity to ABA.

        <title>PUFAs Induce Stomatal Closure in Col-0 Plants But Fail to Activate This Process in <italic>lox1</italic> Mutants</title>
        <p>Since PUFAs are known LOX substrates, we first tested linoleic acid (18∶2) for its ability to induce stomatal closure. We observed that linoleic acid induced significant stomatal closure at 10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

These results strongly suggest that products of LOX activity are able to promote stomatal closure.</p>

        <title>Fatty Acid Hydroperoxides (FAHs) Activate Stomatal Closure at Lower Doses Than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or <italic>tert</italic>-Butyl Hydroperoxide (tBuOOH)</title>
        <p>LOXs directly generate FAHs by incorporating molecular oxygen into the backbone of PUFAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We therefore tested the ability of 9- and 13-HPODE to trigger stomatal closure and compared their activity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which was previously shown to mediate ABA-induced stomatal closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Wang1">[37]</xref> and to tBuOOH as a model organic hydroperoxide. We found that 9- and 13-HPODE promoted stomatal closure at considerably lower concentrations than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or tBuOOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), demonstrating that LOX-derived FAHs are potent inducers of stomatal closure.</p>
        <p>Oxidative processes arising from increased cellular hydroperoxide concentrations can be effectively prevented by the addition of free radical scavengers including thiol-containing compounds. Among them, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is one of the less potent free radical scavengers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Winterbourn1">[38]</xref>. Alternatively, thiols can act as nucleophiles to conjugate with reactive electrophiles through the Michael addition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Farmer2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Mueller3">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Davoine1">[39]</xref>. In order to get further insights into the mechanisms at the origin of the biological activities of hydroperoxides, epidermal peels were pre-incubated with 1 mM NAC before treatment with 10 µM 9- or 13-HPODE, 40 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or tBuOOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The inability of NAC to prevent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>- or tBuOOH-induced stomatal closure suggested that NAC did not function as an antioxidant. On the other hand, its specific inhibitory effect on FAHs rather suggested that it could act as a nucleophilic compound.</p>

Moreover, the effect of different Michael acceptors along with halogenated organic compounds and isothiocyanate was tested.

Additionally, the thiol-containing compound NAC that inhibited the action of FAHs also blocked the activity of 13-KODE and the other thiol reagents PCMB and sulforaphane, suggesting that reactivity toward thiols was critical for biological activity of these compounds. Conversely, NAC did not prevent ABA-induced stomatal closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that RES oxylipins and ABA do not share a common signaling pathway.</p>

        <title>NAC and 13-HODE Inhibit Bacterial- or flg22- but Not ABA-Induced Stomatal Closure</title>
        <p>The biologically inactive alcohols, 9- and 13-HODE, displaying chemical structures close to the corresponding ketones prompted us to verify whether these alcohols could counteract the biological activity of 9- and13-KODE and different thiol reagents. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, pre-incubation with 1 nM 13-HODE abolished the activity of the three thiol reagents (13-KODE, PCMB, and sulforaphane). Similar results were obtained with 9-HODE (unpublished data). However, the inhibitory effect of 13-HODE was overcome by using higher concentrations (10 or 100 nM) of 13-KODE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). On the other hand, stoichiometric concentrations of 13-HODE did not alter the ABA-induced stomatal closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

        <title>The Bacterial Phytotoxin Coronatine (COR) and Methyl Jasmonate (MJ) Inhibit RES Oxylipin-Induced Stomatal Closure Through Different Mechanisms</title>
        <p>COR secreted by virulent strains of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> disables stomatal defense in a COI1-dependent manner and notably inhibits PAMP- and ABA-mediated stomatal closure, subsequently triggering stomatal reopening required for pathogen entry and host colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Melotto1">[32]</xref>. To assess whether COR affects the activity of RES-oxylipin, we pre-treated epidermal peels with the toxin prior to treatment with RES oxylipins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, COR at 4 µM blocked the effects of both 1 nM 13- and 9-KODE. The COR chemical structure resembles that of JA-Ile, the biologically active form of JA, and enables this phytotoxin to interact with the JA-Ile receptor COI1 to hijack the JA-Ile hormone functions. In an attempt to better understand the biological activity of these chemically related compounds, we examined the action of methyl jasmonate (MJ) on guard cells. In our hands, MJ was unable to promote stomatal closure in a range of concentrations between 1 nM and 100 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s004">Figure S4</xref>). However, competition experiments of MJ with RES oxylipins (9/13-KODE and 12-OPDA) indicated that pretreatment of epidermal peels with 1 nM MJ reversed the activity of RES oxylipins applied at the same concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). At a 100-fold higher concentration of RES oxylipins, this inhibition was no longer observed, suggesting that MJ mediates the inhibition of RES oxylipins activity through a similar mechanism as the alcohols 9/13-HODE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, in contrast to COR, MJ did not counteract the action of ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, our data establish that although COR and MJ are both able to inhibit the RES oxylipin-mediated stomatal closure, in contrast to COR, the MJ-mediated activity is COI1-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

In order to clarify the function of ABA signaling in pathogen-induced stomatal closure, we first compared the effects of ABA, flg22, and 13-KODE on stomata of the mutant <italic>ost1-2</italic>. As previously reported, the <italic>ost1-2</italic> mutant does not close stomata in response to ABA even at very high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). However, <italic>ost1-2</italic> plants remained responsive to both flg22 and 13-KODE, albeit at higher doses than WT plants. The stomatal behavior of the <italic>aba2-1</italic> mutant, which is defective in ABA production, was also assessed and showed a similar response profile as the <italic>ost1-2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

        <p>In order to get further insights into the signaling steps triggered by the three compounds, we have assessed the activation of OST1 on Arabidopsis cell suspensions. In-gel kinase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) of immunoprecipitated OST1 showed that in accordance with previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Mustilli1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Belin1">[49]</xref>, ABA clearly activated OST1 kinase. In contrast, flg22 and both RES oxylipins 9- and 13-KODE were unable to activate OST1. This is consistent with the hypothesis that different signaling pathways can lead to stomatal closure, but that the optimization of the guard cell response to biotic stress requires ABA-dependent mechanisms.</p>

        <title>Distinct MAP Kinase Pathways Mediate ABA and Biotic Stress Signals</title>
        <p>Apart from OST1, a number of other protein kinases have been identified to function in ABA signal transduction, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which play a prominent role in both biotic and abiotic stress signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Colcombet1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Rodriguez1">[51]</xref>. MPK9 and MPK12 were shown to play an important role in ABA-induced closure of stomata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Jammes1">[29]</xref>. To clarify the role of these MAPKs in ABA and flg22 signaling, we tested <italic>mpk9-1/12-1</italic> double mutant plants, which were reported to be impaired in ROS-mediated ABA signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Jammes1">[29]</xref>.

        <p>To further investigate the role of protein kinases in response to ABA and biotic stress, we carried out kinase assays on cells treated with ABA, flg22, and 9- or 13-KODE. In-gel kinase assays showed flg22-mediated activation of three protein kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) that were previously identified as MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Droillard1">[52]</xref>. Immunoblotting using the anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody confirmed the presence of these activated MAPKs in seedlings exposed to flg22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). However, none of these MAPKs were activated in response to ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figures 6E</xref>), the kinase activities stimulated in ABA-treated cells corresponding to OST1 and other SnRK2s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Boudsocq1">[48]</xref>. In order to verify the role of these kinases in the ABA- and PAMP-mediated signaling cascades, the behavior of <italic>mpk3</italic> and <italic>mpk6</italic> knockout mutants was investigated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figure 6F</xref>, stomata of <italic>mpk3</italic> and <italic>mpk6</italic> responded normally to ABA, 18∶2 and 9-KODE, whereas their response to flg22 was strongly impaired demonstrating that different sets of MAPKs are required to convey signals generated by the action of ABA and biotic stress and suggesting that RES oxylipin production and action occur downstream of MPK3/6.</p>

        <title>LOX1 Activity Controls Stomatal Closure During the Early Stages of Plant–<italic>Pst</italic> Interactions</title>
        <p>In the present work, we show that a defect in <italic>LOX1</italic> compromises the ability of plants to close stomata in response to both virulent and avirulent strains of <italic>Pst</italic> or the PAMP flg22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Impairment in ABA responsiveness, which could have explained the <italic>lox1</italic> mutant phenotype, was ruled out since mutant and WT lines were similarly able to close stomata upon ABA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g001">Figure 1</xref>). On the other hand, involvement of oxylipins arising from LOX1 activity in controlling stomatal access of bacteria into plants was clearly established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Induction of stomatal closure by LOX substrates (PUFAs) or LOX reaction products (FAHs and KOD(T)E) was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s004">S4</xref>). On the other hand, Arabidopsis mutants lacking <italic>LOX1</italic> were no longer able to respond to PUFAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g002">Figure 2</xref>), while they still remained responsive to FAHs (unpublished data) and 9/13-KODE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), indicating that absence of LOX1 activity can be rescued not only by FAHs but also by their metabolites. In line with this result, it is noteworthy that pretreatment of the <italic>lox1-2</italic> mutant line with the 9-specific LOX compound 9-KODE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s010">Methods S1</xref>), partially restores resistance of LOX1-deficient lines against <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s007">Figure S7B</xref>), confirming that LOX1 controls stomatal defense.</p>
        <p>Dose-response curves of linoleic acid and the two FAHs (9- and 13-HPODE) for stomatal closure showed that these compounds close stomata at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower than ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s004">S4</xref>). Our data also demonstrate that the efficiency of oxylipins to close stomata is not position-specific, since 9- and 13-HPODE had the same biological activity and that trienic fatty acids were as active as dienic ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To better understand the mechanisms responsible for the biological activity of FAHs, their efficiency was compared to that of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. FAHs were remarkably more active than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and tBuOOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To explain this discrepancy, we postulate that oxidative stress potentially generated by the peroxides might target different signaling components. Unlike H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or tBuOOH, the more hydrophobic FAHs might access and oxidize critical residues in hydrophobic sites of key signaling proteins.</p>
        <p>Thiol-containing compounds can protect cells against oxidative injury by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) or by conjugating to reactive electrophile species (RES) often generated from FAHs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Mueller3">[27]</xref>. NAC, used in the present work for its rather weak antioxidant property <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Winterbourn1">[38]</xref>, did not inhibit the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>- or tBuOOH-induced responses, but it strongly compromised FAH responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Hence, it is likely that inhibition of FAH activity by NAC was rather due to its nucleophilic properties. Downstream of FAHs, those oxylipins containing α,β-unsaturated carbonyl structures are powerful RES able to add to thiol-containing substances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Farmer2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Mueller3">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Davoine1">[39]</xref>. Consequently, the activity of FAHs on stomata can rather be explained by their metabolization into RES-oxylipins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In good agreement with this hypothesis, the two RES oxylipins 9- and 13-KODE displayed equivalent and very strong activity on guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Five additional RES oxylipins including trienic fatty acid ketones (9- and 13-KOTE), two cyclopentenone derivatives (12-OPDA and ProstaglandinA2), and the aldehyde 4-HNE that can be generated by decomposition of FAHs all displayed strong biological activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Among these oxylipins, the JA precursor 12-OPDA displayed a strong activity on stomata, whereas MJ was inactive in a range of concentrations between 1 nM and 100 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The ability of MJ to induce stomatal closure is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Suhita1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Zhao1">[55]</xref> and this work), but very recent results show that MJ is active only when ABA endogenous levels reach a critical threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Hossain1">[56]</xref>. In the ABA-deficient line <italic>aba2-2</italic> or in plants treated by fluridon, an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, MJ was no longer able to promote stomatal closure, indicating that MJ activity on guard cells is intimately dependent on the physiological status of plants. Hence, culture conditions used to produce the biological material can strongly influence this status and modify the ability of plant to respond to MJ.</p>
        <p>The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl structure in oxylipins, as soft electrophiles, preferentially add to soft nucleophiles, which are cysteine residues in GSH or proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Mueller3">[27]</xref>. Reducing the RES oxylipins, 9-, and 13-KODE into their corresponding alcohols 9- and 13-HODE, the latter being not electrophilic, has allowed us to assess the involvement of this putative mechanism. Given that both alcohols were inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g003">Figure 3</xref>), reactivity of 9- and 13-KODE toward thiols could explain their biological activity. This hypothesis was confirmed by the fact that a large set of known thiol-reagents, including different natural and artificial Michael acceptors, several halogenated organic compounds, and one isothiocyanate, all promoted stomatal closure at nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g003">Figures 3C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s004">S4</xref>). Altogether, these results strongly suggest the involvement of a thiol-containing target in the RES oxylipin-mediated cascade.</p>
        <p>At stoichiometric concentrations, both the fatty acid alcohols 9/13-HODE and MJ were found to block the biological activity of RES oxylipins but not that of ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g005">5</xref>). On the other hand, at concentrations above 1 µM, the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> phytotoxin COR disabled both RES oxylipin and ABA activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Melotto1">[32]</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that the COR-mediated inhibition of RES oxylipin activity is COI1-dependent, whereas fatty acid alcohols and MJ inhibit this activity by means of another mechanism. This hypothesis is further supported by results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, which indicate that, on the mutant <italic>coi1-17</italic>, COR no longer exerts inhibition of the ketone effects, whereas MJ remains active. Neither NAC, 13-HODE, nor MJ inhibited the activity of ABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g005">5</xref>), suggesting that RES oxylipins do not share a common signaling mechanism with ABA. Considering that stomatal closure induced by inoculation with <italic>Pst</italic> or treatment with flg22 were inhibited by NAC or 13-HODE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g004">Figure 4</xref>), it can be concluded that the early stomatal response to pathogens is not under the control of ABA but depends on LOX1-derived RES oxylipins. According to all these data, it is tempting to speculate that thiol-reactive compounds such as RES-oxylipins generated in response to biotic stress would react on guard-cell-specific target(s) bearing a critical cysteine residue buried in a hydrophobic cavity. This covalent binding (alkylation) would then trigger stomatal closure. Competition with thiol-containing compounds such as NAC or the presence of FAH or RES oxylipin metabolites such as 9/13-HODE and jasmonates that could fit into the target cavity without reacting with the critical cysteine residues would prevent the target alkylation and thereby inhibit the biological process. The equal activity of 9- and 13-oxylipins on stomata suggests that these compounds are perceived by the same guard cell target(s). The 9- and 13-LOXs could both contribute to production of metabolites regulating stomatal movements, however in mutants lacking LOX1 activity, (i) PUFAs were not able to rescue stomatal function and (ii) bacteria were unable to trigger stomatal closure. Hence, LOX1 exhibits a specific function for which no other LOXs can be substitutes. Consistent with this assumption, it is clearly established that mutation in <italic>LOX6</italic>, the 13-LOX encoding gene expressed in guard cells, did not impair stomatal responses to flg22, linoleic acid, or 9-KODE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our examination of the SA function in the stomatal response indicated that the synthesis of SA is required to convey the RES oxylipin (9/13-KODE) signal but not that of ABA and SA acts downstream of these RES oxylipins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Hence it can be concluded that SA participates in the RES oxylipin-mediated signaling cascade in accordance with previous results indicating that PAMP- or <italic>Pst</italic>-regulated stomatal closure was SA-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Melotto1">[32]</xref> but SA is not an intermediate of the ABA-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Again, these results further support the conclusion that ABA does not act as a regulator of the biotic stress-dependent signal in guard cells.</p>

        <title>Bacterial-Induced Stomatal Closure Is ABA-Independent</title>
        <p>A major breakthrough in the understanding of the plant innate immune response against bacterial pathogens was the finding that stomatal closure was a key part of this process preventing bacterial entry in leaves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Melotto2">[33]</xref>. This work also suggested that PAMP-induced stomatal closure required ABA biosynthesis and components of the ABA signal transduction pathway such as the protein kinase OST1 and nitric oxide biosynthesis.</p>
        <p>Our data argue in favor of the existence of an ABA-independent guard cell signaling cascade controlling stomatal closure during the early steps of plant-microbe interaction. First, the ability of <italic>lox1</italic> mutant lines to respond to ABA strongly suggested that LOX1 did not act downstream of the hormone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Second, in contrast to ABA, neither flg22 nor the RES oxylipins 9- and 13-KODE could activate OST1 kinase in Arabidopsis cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that different early signaling pathways are employed for ABA and flg22 or RES oxylipins. Consistent with these results, the mutant <italic>ost1-2</italic>, which is insensitive to ABA, still responded to flg22 or 13-KODE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figure 6</xref>), albeit responses were less intense than in WT. Similarly, the stomatal responses of the <italic>aba2-1</italic> mutant, which is impaired in ABA synthesis, showed a marked decrease in sensitivity not only to ABA but also to flg22 and 13-KODE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Overall, our results strongly suggest that although ABA is not the major regulator of bacterial and PAMP-induced stomatal closure, it contributes to modulate stomatal responses to biotic stress. In a recent genetic screen, Zeng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Zeng2">[35]</xref> identified Arabidopsis mutants named scord (susceptible to coronatine-deficient <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000) that were compromised in their ability to close stomata in response to bacteria. Interestingly, a majority of these mutants showed normal closure in response to ABA, confirming our results that ABA does not directly control bacterial-induced stomatal closure. Stomatal closure requires the presence in guard cell membranes of effector proteins that control osmotic pressure. Their transcription and/or posttranslational regulation are known to mainly depend on ABA in an OST1-mediated pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-JoshiSaha1">[57]</xref>. To explain that mutants affected in ABA synthesis or regulation remained responsive to biotic stress, it must be assumed that still unidentified components also regulate this ultimate step. However, in these mutants, the stomatal closure machinery is likely less efficient, explaining the lower sensitivity of such mutants to biotic stress. Interestingly, the activation of one of these effectors, the slow-type anion channel SLAC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Negi1">[58]</xref>, is required in both ABA- and biotic stress-mediated responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s009">Figure S9</xref>), suggesting that these pathways converge at the level of the ion channels controlling the osmotic pressure of the guard cell necessary to regulate stomatal aperture.</p>
        <p>Numerous MAPK cascades have been reported to convey diverse environmental signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Colcombet1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Rodriguez1">[51]</xref>. Both MAP kinases MPK9 and MPK12 were identified as critical steps of the guard cell response to ABA, and the <italic>mpk9-1/12-1</italic> double mutant is compromised in ABA-induced stomatal closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Jammes1">[29]</xref>. However, this mutant responded normally to flg22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figure 6</xref>), further supporting that distinct ABA- and flg22-mediated pathways exist in guard cells. The two well-characterized MAPKs, MPK3 and MPK6, that are key response elements in both abiotic and biotic stress signaling have also been implicated in ABA signal transduction. <italic>MPK3</italic> antisense plants were shown to be partially impaired in ABA-promoted inhibition of stomatal opening, while they responded normally to the hormone in stomatal closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Gudesblat1">[59]</xref>. However, these plants were compromised in their ability to close stomata in response to <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> inoculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Gudesblat2">[60]</xref>. MPK6 was also reported to mediate ABA- and sugar-regulated seed germination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Xing1">[61]</xref> but also responses to other stresses such as pathogen infection, cold and salt stress, and wounding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Kim2">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Takahashi1">[65]</xref>. Our work demonstrated that flg22 but not ABA activated MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 early after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figure 6</xref>). A role of MPK3 and MPK6 in flg22-induced stomatal closure was subsequently confirmed by testing <italic>mpk3</italic> and <italic>mpk6</italic> knockout lines. The fact that both mutants were compromised in the flg22-mediated stomatal closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g006">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that the two MAP kinases do not play a redundant role in this process and agrees with recent findings that these two kinases both play an important but distinct role in plant immunity and signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Galletti1">[66]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Kohorn1">[67]</xref>. Overall, our results demonstrate that MPK3 and MPK6 are involved in the flagellin, but not in the ABA guard cell signaling cascade. The fact that linoleic acid (18∶2) and 9-KODE were as active on WT as on <italic>mpk3</italic> or <italic>mpk6</italic> mutants suggests that LOX1-mediated synthesis of oxylipins is downstream of MPK3/6, although it cannot be ruled out that these two steps are independent. The involvement of these MAPK activities as early specific steps of the flg22-dependent signaling cascade provides another argument supporting the existence of an ABA-independent mechanism leading to stomatal closure.</p>
        <p>Finally, gene expression studies of plantlets that were treated with ABA or <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 showed that <italic>RD29b</italic>, <italic>ABI1</italic>, and <italic>ABI2</italic> transcript levels rapidly increased only in response to ABA but not after <italic>Pst</italic> inoculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001513.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Additionally, given that plants first treated with <italic>Pst</italic> and then sprayed with ABA displayed identical responses as those observed in plants treated by ABA only, it can be concluded that ABA is not produced during the very early stage of the interaction with bacteria.</p>
        <p>Overall, our data suggest that early signals produced upon challenging of plants with ABA and pathogens are different. As depicted in the proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001513-g007">Figure 7</xref>), whereas the response to ABA is transduced principally by OST1 and MPK9/12, microbial signals are conveyed by MPK3/6, LOX1-induced RES oxylipin derivatives, and SA. Our work also provides evidence that ABA is essential to potentiate guard cells to enable them to properly respond to biotic stimuli, and further studies are necessary to characterize these steps and their role in the stomatal responses to other signals. Finally, the present results shed new light on the function of oxylipins in the plant immune response.</p>

            <title>Working model showing signaling components involved in bacterium- or flg22- and ABA-mediated pathways that lead to stomatal closure in the Arabidopsis guard cell.</title>
            <p>In red are the steps whose activity has been demonstrated in this work by genetic approaches. Downstream of biotic stimuli (<italic>Pst</italic> or flg22), both MPK3 and MPK6 are required to activate production of LOX1-dependent oxylipins such as FAHs (9-HPOD(T)E) and/or reactive ketones (9-KOD(T)E). Our pharmacological data strongly suggest that the latter compounds modulate the activity of putative thiol-containing targets responsible for biotic signal transduction. Downstream of this step, SA is required to convey the biotic stress signal. In a COI1-dependent manner, COR inhibits the accumulation of SA through the activity of three NAC transcription factors and orchestrates the stomatal reopening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001513-Zheng1">[74]</xref>. On the other hand, the ABA-dependent pathway that is triggered upon abiotic stress requires the protein kinases OST1 and MPK9 or MPK12. As one of the final effectors required for the regulation of osmotic pressure in guard cells, activation of the slow-type anion channel SLAC1 is necessary for stomatal closure in response to both biotic stress and ABA. Not depicted in this model are the data provided by this work and supporting the involvement of ABA in the guard cell potentiation required for optimizing responses to biotic stress.</p>
