        <p>It is well established that the variability of the neural activity across trials, as measured by the Fano factor, is elevated. This fact poses limits on information encoding by the neural activity. However, a series of recent neurophysiological experiments have changed this traditional view. Single cell recordings across a variety of species, brain areas, brain states and stimulus conditions demonstrate a remarkable reduction of the neural variability when an external stimulation is applied and when attention is allocated towards a stimulus within a neuron's receptive field, suggesting an enhancement of information encoding. Using an heterogeneously connected neural network model whose dynamics exhibits multiple attractors, we demonstrate here how this variability reduction can arise from a network effect. In the spontaneous state, we show that the high degree of neural variability is mainly due to fluctuation-driven excursions from attractor to attractor. This occurs when, in the parameter space, the network working point is around the bifurcation allowing multistable attractors. The application of an external excitatory drive by stimulation or attention stabilizes one specific attractor, eliminating in this way the transitions between the different attractors and resulting in a net decrease in neural variability over trials. Importantly, non-responsive neurons also exhibit a reduction of variability. Finally, this reduced variability is found to arise from an increased regularity of the neural spike trains. In conclusion, these results suggest that the variability reduction under stimulation and attention is a property of neural circuits.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>To understand how neurons encode information, neuroscientists record their firing activity while the animal executes a given task for many trials. Surprisingly, it has been found that the neural response is highly variable, which a priori limits the encoding of information by these neurons. However, recent experiments have shown that this variability is reduced when the animal receives a stimulus or attends to a particular one, suggesting an enhancement of information encoding. It is known that a cause of neural variability resides in the fact that individual neurons receive an input which fluctuates around their firing threshold. We demonstrate here that all the experimental results can naturally arise from the dynamics of a neural network. Using a realistic model, we show that the neural variability during spontaneous activity is particularly high because input noise induces large fluctuations between multiple –but unstable- network states. With stimulation or attention, one particular network state is stabilized and fluctuations decrease, leading to a neural variability reduction. In conclusion, our results suggest that the observed variability reduction is a property of the neural circuits of the brain.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Traditionally, neuroscience aims to discover the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual, cognitive and motor functions by examining neural responses as subjects repeatedly perform a behavioral task. Typically, neural responses are extracted by averaging over those trials and the obtained firing rates are often the only information retained. This approach discards the high firing irregularity and the high variability across trials that individual neurons activity exhibit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Softky1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Shadlen1">[2]</xref>, fluctuations that a priori limit information encoding. At different scales, high fluctuations are also observed in the so-called ongoing activity, and have been shown to play a role on the task-induced activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Arieli1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Fiser1">[6]</xref>. Therefore, the challenging question is: on a single-trial basis, how and in which conditions these a priori detrimental fluctuations allow an efficient information encoding?</p>
      <p>Recent experimental studies have examined the neural variability across a variety of species, cortical areas, brain states and stimulus conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Mitchell1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Churchland1">[10]</xref>. Measuring the neural variability with the Fano factor, the mean-normalized variance of the neural spike counts over trials, these studies have found that stimuli generally reduced neural variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Churchland1">[10]</xref>, in line with previous results in the visual system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-BorgGraham1">[11]</xref>. Additionally, neural variability has been found to decrease in an attentional paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Mitchell1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Cohen1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Theoretically, using a rate model, a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Rajan1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Abbott1">[13]</xref> has proposed that variability reduction arises from a stimulus induced suppression of an otherwise chaotic ongoing state. Using a spiking network model, we demonstrate here that the variability reduction can arise from an alternative network effect presented in the framework of attractor networks. The formalism of attractor dynamics offers a unifying principle for representation and processing of information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Amit1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Rolls2">[18]</xref>. Co-activation of neurons induces stronger mutual synaptic connections, leading to assembly formation. Reverberatory activity between assembly members can then lead to memory by the persistence of neural activation. The concept of neural assemblies was later formalized in the framework of statistical physics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Amit1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Brunel1">[16]</xref>, where these co-activated neurons lead to attractors in the phase space of the recurrent neural dynamics: patterns of co-activation can represent fixed points from which the dynamical system evolves. In this framework, we show that during spontaneous activity, as measured by the mean-normalized variance of the spike count (the Fano factor), neural variability is high when the network exhibits noise-driven excursions between multiple attractors. The application of an external stimulation stabilizes one specific attractor and suppresses the excursions between different attractors, leading to a reduction of neural variability. After an exhaustive study of the Fano factor changes in the network, we conclude that variability reduction is associated with one fundamental condition, namely that in the spontaneous condition, the network working point is around the edge of the bifurcation above which multiple stable (multistable) activated attractors appear. Moreover, we show that the reduced variability can be attributed to an increased regularity of the spike trains, as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of the interspike interval (ISI) distribution.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We study the reduction of neural variability using a spiking neural network model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Real biological networks have a priori an heterogeneous connectivity structure, particularly due to synaptic plasticity and learning: the present network model is an example of this. We first investigate the neural activity and its variability when the network is in a spontaneous state. Then, we consider the effect of the application of an external stimulation to one neural population and how variability is reduced relative to the spontaneous state. Therefore, we study how attention reduces the variability, when the top-down attentional bias is modeled as an increase in the external stimulation. We compare these results with experimental measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Churchland1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Mitchell1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Cohen1">[9]</xref>. As a model prediction, we consider the case where two stimuli are presented to different network populations -mimicking the case of two simultaneously presented stimuli in a neuron's receptive field, and when attention is directed towards one of them. We analyze under which conditions the variability is maximally reduced, i.e. when the network best encodes an external stimulation, and conclude that it occurs when the network working point in the spontaneous state is around the bifurcation where multiple stable attractor states emerge. The application of an external excitatory drive (sensory or attentional input) stabilizes one specific attractor, eliminating in this way the transitions between different attractors, resulting in a net decrease in neural variability.</p>

        <title>Stimulation Effects on Variability</title>
        <p>In the attractor network considered here (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), each excitatory population is selective for a specific external stimulus. In each of these populations, the recurrent weights are therefore assumed to have increased by Hebbian learning mechanisms to a value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, called the cohesion level. The inhibition level <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is regulated by the GABA synaptic connections provided by the inhibitory population. The stationary and stable states (attractors) of this network can be studied using a standard mean-field approximation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Brunel1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Deco1">[19]</xref>, applied here to the case when input rate fluctuations are absent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g001">Figure 1B</xref> plots the obtained bifurcation diagram in the spontaneous condition. The diagram shows the firing rate difference between the possible stationary states as a function of the cohesion and inhibition levels. Two regions can be distinguished. First, a large region where there is a unique stationary stable state (large dark blue region): this state corresponds to a low activation state where excitatory and inhibitory neurons fire at a low mean rate (approximately 3 Hz and 9 Hz when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively). Second, above a bifurcation, in a region of intermediate inhibition level and sufficiently large cohesion level, the network exhibits multistability with the coexistence of 6 stable states, namely: 5 equivalent states where only one of the 5 specific populations is highly activated, and a low activation state as described above. This last attractor remains stable just above the bifurcation, because of a so-called subcritical bifurcation. Below the bifurcation, although the activated attractors are unstable, fluctuations can induce transient excursions of the network state towards them, the dynamics around these attractors being partially stable even if not globally.</p>

        <p>First, we focus on spontaneous activity. For a network working point around but below the bifurcation, for example for a cohesion level <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and an inhibition level <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g002">Figure 2A</xref> show the network spontaneous activity (for times less than 10 s). The activity is irregular, not only from the timing of spikes but at the rate level, where abrupt changes occur from time to time. Each neural population has different rate fluctuations. The rate distribution for all selective populations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) is large (mean rate: 3.02 Hz; standard deviation: 4.53 Hz), with a unique peak at zero rate and with a long tail. These rate fluctuations cannot be explained solely by the input rate fluctuations: they reveal the excursions of the activity between the different network attractors. This type of network dynamics may be at the origin of the similar large firing rate fluctuations observed in the cortex of behaving monkeys (Reynolds and Mitchell, personal communication). When an external stimulus is applied to a given population (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Hz to population 1 at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), not only the activity of this population increases but the neural activity fluctuations due to the wanderings between the different attractors is sharply reduced. Actually, under stimulation, only the attractor corresponding to high activity in this population and low activity in all others is stable.</p>

For the first 10 s, no stimulus is applied and the resulting ongoing activity is similar in all excitatory populations: in each of them, the firing rate fluctuates irregularly and abruptly as the result of input rate fluctuations and induced excursions between the different attractors of the network. Besides an attractor corresponding to low activation in all populations, there are attractors corresponding to higher activation in one selective population and low activation in all the others.

        <p>To study the changes in the neural variability in the network when a specific external stimulus is applied, we investigate the Fano factor reduction corresponding to the difference between the spontaneous condition and when one selective excitatory population is externally stimulated by a Poisson spike train with rate I. The Fano factor was calculated from scatter plots of the neural spike count variance versus mean by linear regression fits constrained to pass through the origin. The spike counts variance and mean were calculated for each neuron separated in windows of 100 ms and averaging over 1000 trials. Applying the mean-matched procedure of Churchland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Churchland1">[10]</xref>, neurons in the stimulated population define the non-matched case (as stimulation increases their rate), whereas neurons in the non-stimulated populations define the matched case (as stimulation changes only slightly their rates). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g003">Figure 3</xref> plots the Fano factor without external stimulation, with external stimulation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Hz) and their difference as a function of the cohesion and inhibition levels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref> show the results for the matched condition and for the non-matched condition, respectively. Both cases show that a reduction of the Fano factor consistent with the experimental findings occurs around the bifurcation line (black line). More precisely, the matched rate case shows that multistability is required for the Fano factor to change. The Fano factor is reduced on the right part of the bifurcation line, for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, requiring then sufficient inhibition. For the non-matched rate case, the Fano factor is well reduced around the whole multistability region. Note that, due to the presence of noise, multiple attractors manifest themselves outside the region calculated with the mean-field approach (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the Fano factor level for those regions is consistent with the observed experimental values, namely: around 1.4 for the non-stimulated case and 1 for the stimulated case.</p>

For the non-stimulated neurons, the reduction of neural variability emerges also in the same region. In the spontaneous state, neural variability is high because of the network state excursions between different attractors. The application of an external stimulation stabilizes one specific attractor and suppresses the wanderings between different attractors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), leading to a neural variability reduction.</p>

        <title>Attentional Effects</title>
        <p>Recent experiments have studied the effect of attention on the neural variability over trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Mitchell1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Cohen1">[9]</xref>, Single V4 cells were recorded in awake behaving monkeys when one stimulus in the neuron's receptive field was behaviorally attended or not. Both studies reported a relatively small but significant decrease of the Fano factor in the attended condition with respect to the non-attended one. In our simulations, we modeled the attentional bias by increasing the level of exogenous input to the stimulus-specific population when this stimulus was attended, similar to an increase of the stimulus-related input. In this sense, it can be regarded as a baseline shift mechanism, or an increase in contrast (However, it does not accommodate any attentional gain mechanism that would be better modeled through changes in postsynaptic sensitivity, possibly through NMDA receptor dynamics). As the neural variability reduction increases with stimulus strength (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g005">Figure 5</xref>), the application of an attentional bias therefore decreases the Fano factor compared to the non-attended case.

        <p>As a model prediction, we consider now the case where two stimuli are presented simultaneously in a neuron's receptive field and when attention is allocated to only one of them, a situation referred to lead to “biased competition” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Desimone1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Reynolds1">[21]</xref>. In the network, selective populations 1 and 2 encode each one of the two simultaneously presented visual stimuli: the target which should be attended and the distractor which should be ignored. After 500 ms of spontaneous activity, the two external visual stimuli are applied to these two populations for 1000 ms. In the attended condition, the selective population corresponding to the target receives the attentional bias. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g008">Figure 8</xref> plots the neural variability reduction for the cohesion level <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The variability reduction is obtained as the difference of the average Fano factor for the 80 neurons in the attended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) versus in the non-attended stimulated populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).

The mechanism responsible for the reduction of neural variability is identical to the one described above. In the condition without attention noise-driven excursions between attractors generates a high neural variability. Allocation of attention stabilizes one of the attractors, namely the one corresponding to higher activation of the attended target population and lower activation of the ignored distractor population.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the spontaneous or undriven state, why do cortical circuits exhibit a relatively high degree of neural variability across trials? Why does this variability decrease when a stimulus is presented or when attention is paid? Here, we investigated what could underlie these phenomena in a realistic neural network. Our results show that, under spontaneous conditions, the high degree of neural variability in a neural circuit could essentially be due to fluctuation-driven excursions between the different attractors of the circuit dynamics. This is possible if, in the parameter space, the spontaneous state of the circuit resides around the edge of a bifurcation above which multistable attractors appear. The application of an external excitatory drive, either mediated by a sensory stimulus or by attention, stabilizes one specific attractor and suppresses in this way the transitions between the different attractors. This results in a net decrease in neural variability as measured as a by the Fano factor. More precisely, the matched rate case shows that multistability is required for the Fano factor to change. The Fano factor is reduced on the right part of the bifurcation line, requiring then sufficient inhibition (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). For the non-matched rate case, the Fano factor is well reduced around the whole multistability region. In conclusion our results show that, in the model parameter space, there exists a region where the Fano factor is reduced, both in the non-matched and the matched rate case. Because the spike count signal-to-noise ratio is increased, this reduction suggests an improved encoding of the external signal.</p>
      <p>Beyond the variability over trials, we have also shown that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the neural ISI distributions varies similarly to the Fano factor across all conditions, meaning that the variability reduction is due to a concomitant increase of the spike trains regularity. It would be interesting to verify this model prediction experimentally. However, due to relatively short recorded time intervals, this quantity may be difficult to measure and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Holt1">[22]</xref>, which requires only the knowledge of two consecutive ISIs, could be employed instead.</p>
      <p>The above conclusions have been obtained for the present heterogeneously connected network and rely on the existence of multiple attractors. However, the present scenario does not depend on the specific network structure, provided the network exhibits multistability. In this case, there is a region of the parameter space where there is strict multistability, meaning the co-existence of multiple stable states. From dynamical systems theory, it is known that close to this region, the unstable attractors can still transiently attract the dynamics, a behavior which will be favored by fluctuations. Note that, because multistability is needed here to reproduce the experimental observations, this excludes a priori single neuron mechanisms.</p>
      <p>In a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Rajan1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Abbott1">[13]</xref>, the authors have proposed that the ongoing spontaneous activity is chaotic, and that stimulation suppresses this chaos. They use a phenomenological firing rate model which allows a theoretical understanding of the network behavior. The realism of the present model allows a quantitative comparison with experimental results but prevents at the same time such a theoretical understanding. Only could we predict the stationary states of the network using a mean-field approach. Beyond the naïve analogy that stimulation suppresses ongoing fluctuations in the two models, a number of differences between the two models (in their case: rate model, no noise, temporal input, phase transition) indicate that the two scenarios are different.</p>
      <p>Further experimental and theoretical evidence supports the present scenario. At the microscopic level and using optical imaging, Arieli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Arieli2">[4]</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Kenet1">[5]</xref>) first showed that spontaneous activity is highly coordinated across large neural assemblies in the primary visual cortex (V1) of an anesthetized cat. Furthermore, the pattern of co-activation is feature-specific in the discharge of individual neurons and is temporally locked to the activation of other cells with similar orientation preferences whose spatial organization is described by orientation maps. Finally, the variability of such ongoing activity can explain much of the variability in subsequent sensory-evoked responses, indicating a potential link with perception. Blumenfeld et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Blumenfeld1">[23]</xref> accounted for this type of cellular ongoing activity by assuming that this activity resulted from noise-driven transitions between multistable attractors of the intracortical network. They suggested a rate model endowed with a simple local connectivity rule, and showed that it yields attractor states that are highly similar to the orientation maps alternatively activated in the absence of stimulation. They also considered the case where the activity is evoked by a visual stimulus and showed how a structured afferent input can select the orientation map that matches the orientation of the stimulus. Their model therefore suggests that orientation maps are encoded in the lateral connections, and that these connections can generate an orientation map both when the activity is spontaneous and when it is evoked by a visual stimulus.</p>
      <p>In a recent work, where the same biophysical spiking neural network was used, it was shown that, using the Fisher information, the network neural activity best encoded a small external input, or modulatory input (like it is believed to be the case for attention), in the region of the parameter space where excitatory and inhibitory input currents almost balance each other, and which correspond to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Deco and Hugues, PLoS One, in press). This regime of balanced input is supported by experimental evidence in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Shu1">[24]</xref> and in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Haider1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Rudolph1">[26]</xref>. Taken together with the present results, we can conclude that, in the region of the parameter space around the bifurcation and where input currents almost balance, our model agrees with all the experimental findings, which suggests that these observations may also correspond to a region of best stimulus encoding.</p>
      <p>At the global level of large-scale neural systems, a broad body of experimental work, mainly using the BOLD fMRI hemodynamic response, has suggested that brain activity during resting state is not random but has a spatiotemporal structure (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Fox1">[27]</xref>). From these findings, ongoing neural activity may therefore be organized in a series of functional networks, so-called resting state networks. Suggested by a modeling study, these networks may also emerge from noise-induced transitions between multiple oscillatory brain states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Deco2">[28]</xref>. In this sense, the model of Blumenfeld et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Blumenfeld1">[23]</xref> at the microscopic cellular level, and the model of Deco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Deco2">[28]</xref> at the global neuroanatomical level, propose that spontaneous ongoing activity is built up with multiple attractors, each one related with different specific stimulations or tasks, and that this activity fluctuates during spontaneous activity (or rest) due to transitions between those attractor states, induced by noise and unstructured input.</p>

Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons are point-like elements, whose dynamical state is described by their membrane potential <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. An IF neuron can be described by a basic circuit consisting of a cell membrane capacitance <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in parallel with a membrane resistance <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, driven by input currents coming from connected neurons. Hence, the subthreshold dynamics of the membrane potential of each neuron in the network is given by the following equation:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e062" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the membrane leak conductance, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the resting potential, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the synaptic current. The membrane time constant is defined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. When the voltage across the membrane reaches a given threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the neuron generates a spike which is then transmitted to other neurons and the membrane potential is instantaneously reset to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and maintained there for a refractory time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> during which the neuron is unable to produce further spikes. The spikes arriving to a given neural synapse produce an input to the neuron which induce post-synaptic excitatory or inhibitory potentials (through a low-pass filter formed by the membrane and synaptic time constants). In Equation 1, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the synaptic conductances, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the excitatory and inhibitory reversal potentials, respectively. The dimensionless parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the connections are the synaptic weights. The NMDA currents are voltage dependent and they are modulated by intracellular magnesium concentration. The gating variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the fractions of open channels of neurons and they are given by:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e078" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e079" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e080" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e081" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e082" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>The sums over the index <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent all the spikes emitted by the presynaptic neuron j (at times <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

        <title>Neural Network</title>
        <p>We use the same network to study both situations, namely the effects of stimulation and attention on the neural variability over trials. The network consists of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in our simulations) interacting neurons, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are excitatory (pyramidal) cells and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are inhibitory cells (interneurons), consistent with the neurophysiologically observed proportions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Abeles1">[29]</xref>. We use an attractor network where neurons are organized into a discrete set of populations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002395-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). There are three different population types, namely: 1) the inhibitory population, 2) the excitatory non-selective population and 3) the excitatory selective population. The inhibitory population <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is made of the inhibitory neurons in the modeled brain area and mediates competition in the attractor network by distributing a global inhibitory signal. The non-selective population <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is composed of all excitatory neurons that are not receiving any specific external input and which therefore provides a background level of excitation. The remaining excitatory neurons are clustered in different populations <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, 5 in the simulations reported here. Each contains <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> neurons (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in our simulations) which are sensitive to a specific external stimulus. The network is fully connected, meaning that each neuron in the network receives <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> excitatory and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> inhibitory synaptic contacts. The connection strengths between and within the populations are determined by dimensionless weights <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We assume that the connections are already formed, e.g. by earlier self-organization mechanisms, as if they were established by Hebbian learning, with the coupling between two neurons being strong if their activities are correlated and weak if they are anticorrelated. The recurrent self-excitation within each selective population <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by the weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which is called the cohesion level, and the weaker connection between them by the weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The synaptic efficacy <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depends on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by the relation <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This serves to ensure that the average excitatory synaptic efficacy will remain constant as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is varied across conditions. Neurons in the inhibitory population are mutually connected with an intermediate weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These neurons are also connected with all excitatory neurons with the same intermediate weight, which for excitatory-to-inhibitory connections is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and, for inhibitory-to-excitatory connections, is denoted <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and called the inhibition level. Neurons in each excitatory population <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are connected to neurons in the population <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with a feedforward and feedback synaptic weights <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. The remaining connections are all set to the baseline value, i.e. to 1.</p>
        <p>All neurons in the network always receive an external background input from <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> external neurons emitting uncorrelated Poisson spike trains at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The resulting spike train is still a Poisson spike train, with rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. More specifically, and for all neurons inside a given population p, the resulting spike train is assumed to have a time-varying rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, governed by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e152" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ms, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> kHz, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> kHz is the standard deviation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a normalized Gaussian white noise. Due to noise, negative values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that could arise are rectified to zero. These input rate fluctuations represent the noisy fluctuations that are typically observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, neurons in a specific selective population <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> could receive other inputs when an external stimulus is applied or when attention is allocated to that population. These inputs are specified by adding a corresponding rate to the rate of the background Poissonian input spike train.</p>

      <sec id="s4c">
        <title>Stimulation Effect</title>
        <p>Without stimulation, all neurons only receive the background input. In the stimulation case, the first selective population is stimulated, receiving an extra input whose rate is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Without external stimulation, the spontaneous activity of the network consists in a noise-driven wandering between different attractors (See Results for more detailed explanations), each corresponding to higher activation in one selective population and lower activation in all the others. Stimulation onset stabilizes one attractor, corresponding to the high activation of the stimulated selective population. The spiking activity for one trial is simulated for 500 ms without stimulation, allowing the network activity to stabilize, and the stimulus is then presented during 100 ms. Results during the stimulus period are averaged over 1000 trials initialized with different random seeds.</p>

      <sec id="s4d">
        <title>Attentional Effect</title>
        <p>We analyze the effect of attention on the neural variability and study the encoding of an attended stimulus. For this, we first address the recent experimental results when one stimulus is presented in a neuron's receptive field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Mitchell1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Cohen1">[9]</xref>. In a second part, as a prediction, we analyze the case where two stimuli are presented in a neuron's receptive field, a case used to elicit “biased competition” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Desimone1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Reynolds1">[21]</xref>. In the model, when attention is applied to a given stimulus, a biasing input corresponding to a rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is added to the input of the corresponding stimulus specific population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Deco3">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Hugues1">[31]</xref>. In the case of one stimulus, the effect of attention is consequently assimilable to an increase of the stimulus strength or contrast, and is essentially a particular case of the stimulation case. In the case of two stimuli, each simulation started with a period of 500 ms (for network activity stabilization). Then, during a period of 1000 ms, an identical stimulus was presented to selective populations 1 and 2, represented by the corresponding extra rates <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Hz, respectively. Two cases were compared: with and without attention. In the case with attention, an extra attentional bias <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was added to the population 1, corresponding to the attended spatial location (i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> Hz). In the case without attention, no bias was applied. The spiking activity was averaged over 2000 trials initialized with different random seeds.</p>

        <title>Fano Factor</title>
        <p>In the spiking simulations, we characterized neural variability using the mean-normalized variance of the spike counts, i.e. the Fano factor. It is defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the variance and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the mean of the spike counts of a neuron in a time window W. In all cases, we used a time window of 100 ms. The Fano factor measures the noise-to-signal ratio and therefore characterizes the neural variability over trials. For example, for a Poisson process, the variance equals the mean spike count (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002395.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for any length of the time window. We calculated the Fano factor by fitting a linear regression (constrained to pass through the origin) to scatter plots of the spike-count variance versus mean for each of the 80 neurons in the analyzed population. The variance and mean of the spike counts were calculated for each individual neuron by averaging over 1000 trials. In conditions for which the rate of some populations was not significantly affected, which is the case in practice for the non-stimulated neuronal populations, we used the mean-matching procedure for the Fano factor described in Churchland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002395-Churchland1">[10]</xref> whose aim is to have the same distribution of mean firing rates and therefore factor out the rate for the Fano factor changes. In brief, the mean matching procedure consists of selecting neurons such that the distribution of the spike count for each condition (with or without stimulation) is the same. We took the greatest common distribution of the computed spike count for each condition. Individual points are then randomly removed until the actual distribution matched the common distribution. The mean-matched Fano factor is based on the remaining points.</p>
