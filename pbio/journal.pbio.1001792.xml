<title/>
<p>A bacterial effector protein, HopX1, targets host plant JAZ transcriptional repressors for degradation to activate the jasmonate pathway, thereby promoting bacterial pathogenesis by suppressing host defense responses.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Pathogenicity of <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> is dependent on a type III secretion system, which secretes a suite of virulence effector proteins into the host cytoplasm, and the production of a number of toxins such as coronatine (COR), which is a mimic of the plant hormone jasmonate-isoleuce (JA-Ile). Inside the plant cell, effectors target host molecules to subvert the host cell physiology and disrupt defenses. However, despite the fact that elucidating effector action is essential to understanding bacterial pathogenesis, the molecular function and host targets of the vast majority of effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we found that effector HopX1 from <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tabaci</italic> (<italic>Pta</italic>) 11528, a strain that does not produce COR, interacts with and promotes the degradation of JAZ proteins, a key family of JA-repressors. We show that <italic>hopX1</italic> encodes a cysteine protease, activity that is required for degradation of JAZs by HopX1. HopX1 associates with JAZ proteins through its central ZIM domain and degradation occurs in a COI1-independent manner. Moreover, ectopic expression of HopX1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> induces the expression of JA-dependent genes, represses salicylic acid (SA)-induced markers, and complements the growth of a COR-deficient <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> (<italic>Pto</italic>) DC3000 strain during natural bacterial infections. Furthermore, HopX1 promoted susceptibility when delivered by the natural type III secretion system, to a similar extent as the addition of COR, and this effect was dependent on its catalytic activity. Altogether, our results indicate that JAZ proteins are direct targets of bacterial effectors to promote activation of JA-induced defenses and susceptibility in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. HopX1 illustrates a paradigm of an alternative evolutionary solution to COR with similar physiological outcome.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Bacterial plant pathogens secrete toxins and inject effector proteins into the host cells to promote infection, and the identification of the individual functions of these molecules is essential to understand the infective process. Remarkably, some Pseudomonas strains have evolved a sophisticated strategy for manipulating hormonal balance by producing the toxin coronatine (COR), which mimics the plant hormone jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-Ile). The JA-Ile pathway plays a key role in plant immunity by activating defenses against fungal pathogens, while promoting bacterial growth by inhibiting the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defenses required for <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> resistance. Here, we report that the effector HopX1 from a <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> strain that does not produce COR exploits an alternative evolutionary strategy to activate the JA-Ile pathway. We show that HopX1 encodes a cysteine protease that interacts with and promotes the degradation of key JA pathway repressors, the JAZ proteins. Correspondingly, ectopically expressing HopX1 in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> induces the expression of JA-dependent genes, and natural infection with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> producing HopX1 promotes bacterial growth in a similar fashion to COR. Our results highlight a novel example by which a bacterial effector directly manipulates core regulators of hormone signaling to facilitate infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> is a widespread bacterial pathogen that causes disease on a broad range of economically important plant species. In order to infect, <italic>P. syringae</italic> produces a number of toxins and uses a type III secretion system (TTSS) to deliver effector proteins into eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-OBrien1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Xin1">[2]</xref>. This mechanism is essential for successful infection by both plant- and animal-associated bacteria as bacterial mutants deficient in the TTSS are no longer pathogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Nomura1">[3]</xref>. Effectors contribute collectively to pathogenesis inside the host cell by targeting host molecules and defeating plant defenses, which are based on two tiers of recognition by the innate immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Jones1">[4]</xref>. The first branch is triggered by the recognition of highly conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by host cell transmembrane proteins that function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which in turn, activate MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Jones1">[4]</xref>. The second branch recognizes type III effectors inside the plant cell via nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) resistance (R) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Jones1">[4]</xref>. This leads to activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI), and is characteristically associated with programmed cell death known as the hypersensitive response (HR). Accumulating evidence suggests that a primary function of microbial effectors is suppression of both MTI and ETI to avoid pathogen recognition during the infection process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Lindeberg1">[5]</xref>. However, despite the fact that elucidating effector action is essential to understanding bacterial pathogenesis, the molecular function and host targets of the vast majority of effectors remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>Plant immunity relies on a complex network of small-molecule hormone signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-RobertSeilaniantz1">[6]</xref>. Classically, salicylic acid (SA) signaling mediates resistance against biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic microbes such as <italic>P. syringae</italic>, whereas a combination of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) pathways activates resistance against necrotrophs such as the fungal pathogen <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-RobertSeilaniantz1">[6]</xref>. SA and JA/ET defense pathways generally antagonize each other and thus, elevated resistance against biotrophs is often correlated with increased susceptibility to necrotrophs, and vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Grant1">[7]</xref>. The collective contribution of these two hormones during plant-pathogen interactions is crucial to the success of the interaction. Remarkably, some <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains have evolved a sophisticated strategy for manipulating hormonal homeostasis by producing coronatine (COR), a mimic of the bioactive jasmonate hormone, JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Fonseca1">[8]</xref>. COR contributes to disease symptomatology by inducing chlorotic lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Uppalapati1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Brooks1">[11]</xref>, facilitates entry of the bacteria into the plant host by stimulating the opening of stomata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto2">[13]</xref>, and promotes bacterial growth by inhibiting SA-dependent defenses required for <italic>P. syringae</italic> resistance, because of its activation of the antagonistic JA pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-LaurieBerry1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Cui1">[15]</xref>. COR, as the JA-Ile phytohormone, is perceived through a receptor complex formed by the F-box protein CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) and JASMONATE ZIM DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Sheard1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>. COI1 is the F-box component of an SCF-(Skip-cullin-F-box)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase required for all JA-dependent responses tested so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Fonseca1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Feys1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Katsir1">[22]</xref>. JAZ co-receptors are COI1 substrates that negatively regulate the JA-signaling pathway by directly interacting with and repressing transcription factors (TFs) that control JA-regulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Sheard1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Pauwels1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-FernandezCalvo1">[24]</xref>. Repression of TFs by JAZ is mediated by a general co-repressor machinery involving TOPLESS (TPL) and TPL-related proteins that interact with JAZ repressors through the adaptor protein NINJA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Pauwels2">[25]</xref>. The JAZ family of JA-repressors consists of 12 members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that have emerged as central modulators of JA signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chini1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Yan1">[26]</xref>. Under stress conditions, COR or JA-Ile promotes the formation of JAZ-COI1 complexes, triggering JAZ degradation via the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Sheard1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>. This leads to de-repression of the TFs that initiate the transcription of JA-dependent genes, and repression of SA-dependent defenses against the bacteria. Thus, COR acts as a potent virulence factor in plants by triggering the degradation of JAZs. Acquisition of COR by bacterial pathogens has been of tremendous adaptive importance during host-pathogen evolution because it has allowed bacteria to manipulate the host hormonal network to promote susceptibility.</p>
<p>COR is produced by several bacterial strains distributed throughout the <italic>P. syringae</italic> phylogeny, but is particularly common among <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> strains such as DC3000 (<italic>Pto</italic> DC3000) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Bender1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Hwang1">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, strains such as <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tabac</italic>i (<italic>Pta</italic>) 11528 that do not produce COR can still open stomata, suggesting that other virulence factors, probably type-III effectors, are used to activate the JA pathway instead of COR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Lee1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Studholme1">[30]</xref>. This is supported by several studies suggesting that COR and effectors act synergistically to induce JA responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thilmony1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Cui2">[35]</xref>. Indeed, several effectors have been shown to modulate the expression of JA-inducible genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-He1">[33]</xref>. Moreover, gene expression profiles indicate that several JA-regulated genes are still induced in <italic>coi1</italic> mutants upon <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection, indicating that JA responses are activated downstream or independently of COI1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chen1">[34]</xref>. Therefore, bacterial effectors should target other components of the JA pathway downstream of COI1 to activate JA responses, the best candidates being JAZ repressors. Recently, Mukhtar and colleagues developed a large-scale map of physical interactions between proteins from the reference plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and effector proteins from <italic>P. syringae</italic> and the obligate biotrophic oomycete <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> (<italic>Hpa</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Mukhtar1">[36]</xref>. The experiment yielded a map of 6,200 interactions, and showed that pathogens from different kingdoms deploy independently evolved virulence effectors that interact with a limited set of highly connected cellular hubs to facilitate their diverse life-cycle strategies. Strikingly, two out of the five most significantly targeted plant hub proteins by effectors (namely RESPONSE TO LOW SULPHUR [LSU1, AT3G49580] and an unknown kinesin light-chain related protein [AT3G27960]), physically interact with several JAZ proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Mukhtar1">[36]</xref>. Thus, it is plausible that pathogens may attempt to manipulate the JA pathway directly through JAZ proteins.</p>
<p>In previous studies, we generated a draft genome sequence of <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 and used a functional screen to infer its repertoire of T3SS effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Studholme1">[30]</xref>. This led to the identification of <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 proteins with homology to previously described effectors. Since <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 does not produce COR, we hypothesized that it might have followed an alternative evolutionary strategy to activate the JA pathway by developing effector proteins that target JA signaling components. As noted above, we hypothesized that JAZ repressors would be the best candidate targets. Therefore, to study whether any such effector proteins target JAZ repressors, we developed a screen to analyze the stability of JAZ proteins in the presence of each <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 effector. We found that the <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 effector HopX1 encodes a cysteine protease that interacts with and degrades JAZ proteins in a COI1-independent manner. Ectopic expression of HopX1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> induced the expression of JA-dependent genes, compromised the induction of SA-marker gene <italic>PR1</italic> upon SA treatment, and complemented the growth of a COR-deficient <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 strain during natural bacterial infections. Moreover, <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> growth increased by about one log (colony forming units [cfu]/cm<sup>2</sup>) when naturally expressing <italic>hopX1</italic>, but not its catalytic mutant version, indicating that HopX1 can effectively promote susceptibility when delivered by the natural TTSS. This increase in susceptibility was similar to the effect of supplementing bacteria with 2 µM of COR and independent of COI1. Altogether, the results indicate that similar to COR, HopX1 acts within the plant cell to promote activation of jasmonate-induced defenses and bacterial disease bypassing the need of JA-Ile perception.</p>

<title>HopX1 Compromises the Accumulation of JAZ Proteins</title>
<p>It has been suggested that <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tabaci</italic> activates JA responses such as stomatal aperture without producing COR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Lee1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Studholme1">[30]</xref>, which suggests that effectors from this strain could provide the same function by targeting components of the JA pathway. Whereas stomatal closure is part of a plant innate immune response triggered upon pathogen perception to restrict bacterial invasion, plant pathogenic bacteria have evolved specific virulence factors such as COR to promote stomata opening in order to circumvent such innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto2">[13]</xref>. To investigate whether live <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 bacteria can re-open plant stomata without producing COR, we first incubated host <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves with virulent <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 bacteria. In this experiment, <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 was used as a positive control, and a non-pathogenic TTSS defective strain <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 <italic>hrpV−</italic> unable to secrete effector proteins into the plant cell served as a negative control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Oh1">[37]</xref>. Incubation of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves with <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 <italic>hrpV−</italic> for 5 hours induced stomatal closure as described previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto1">[12]</xref>. In contrast, virulent <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 or <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 bacteria maintained stomatal apertures similar to mock treatments. This indicates that effector proteins from <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 might play a role in re-opening of stomata as COR does, probably through action on the JA-signaling pathway.</p>
<p>To identify <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 effector proteins that could target JAZs, we analyzed a <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 effector library constructed in a binary vector within the T-DNA region, in which individual genes are expressed from the <italic>35S</italic> promoter as genetic fusions to three C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tags (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s016">Table S1</xref>). We transiently co-expressed <italic>JAZ5-HA</italic> with individual effector genes from this library or an empty vector (<italic>EV</italic>) control in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> by agroinfiltration. Using this approach, we identified HopX1 as a <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 effector capable of compromising JAZ5 accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s002">Figure S2</xref>). To confirm this result and to exclude a potential effect of the HA tag, we developed an independent form of HopX1 with an N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion. We then transiently co-expressed an <italic>EV</italic> construct or <italic>GFP-hopX1</italic> under the control of the <italic>35S</italic> promoter with <italic>35S:JAZ5-HA</italic> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf tissue. Western blot analysis showed that GFP-HopX1 accumulated in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar to previous results, JAZ5-HA protein was detectable when co-expressed with the EV control but not (or only weakly) with GFP-HopX1, despite the fact that <italic>GFP-hopX1</italic> co-expression did not affect <italic>JAZ5-HA</italic> mRNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicate that HopX1 compromised the accumulation of JAZ5 protein when transiently co-expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> without affecting gene expression levels.</p>

To test if HopX1 could compromise the accumulation of JAZ proteins other than JAZ5, we transiently co-expressed the 12 <italic>JAZ</italic>-HA genes individually with <italic>GFP-hopX1</italic> or an <italic>EV</italic> control in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, and analyzed JAZ accumulation by Western blotting. We successfully detected eight out of 12 JAZ proteins when co-infiltrated with the EV control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, HopX1 compromised the accumulation of all eight JAZ proteins detected, indicating that HopX1 activity is not restricted to JAZ5 but targets the whole JAZ family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We also analyzed the effect of HopX1 on the stability of additional JA related proteins such as the JA receptor COI1 and the downstream TF MYC2, which is a direct target of JAZ repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chini1">[17]</xref>. HopX1 did not alter COI1 or MYC2 protein levels compared to the EV control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that HopX1 compromises the accumulation of the JAZ family of JA-repressors in a specific manner.</p>

<title><italic>HopX</italic>1 Encodes a Cysteine Protease and This Activity Is Required for HopX1-Mediated JAZs Degradation</title>
<p>HopX1 family members from different <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains are modular proteins that contain a putative cysteine-based catalytic triad and a novel conserved N-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Nimchuk1">[38]</xref>. The putative catalytic triad is required for effector function and consists of cysteine (C), histidine (H), and aspartic acid (D) residues conserved with cysteine proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Nimchuk1">[38]</xref>. In order to determine whether these domains are conserved in HopX1 from <italic>Pta</italic> 11528, we performed a PSI-BLAST search with the HopX1<italic><sub>Pta</sub></italic><sub> 11528</sub> protein sequence. BLAST analysis revealed a near identical match with HopX1 from <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>phaseolicola</italic> bacterial strains such as race 4 (99% identity), but showed significantly less homology with the respective <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 homolog (72% identity) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). The putative catalytic triad residues were strictly conserved in HopX1<italic><sub>Pta</sub></italic><sub> 11528</sub>, as was the novel N-terminal domain of unknown function typical of this family of effectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). This conservation suggests that the domains may play an important role in the activity of this effector inside the plant cell, and that HopX1<italic><sub>Pta</sub></italic><sub> 11528</sub> might have cysteine protease activity.</p>
<p>To determine if HopX1 has cysteine protease activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used a kit designed for the detection of protease activity (serine, aspartic, cysteine, and metalloproteinases) using fluorometry based on the hydrolysis of a labeled casein general substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Twining1">[39]</xref>. As previously described by Nimchuck and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Nimchuk1">[38]</xref>, we did not detect any protease activity when purified recombinant HopX1 protein fused to maltose binding protein (MBP) was incubated with the casein-labeled substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that this recombinant protein may be inactive or that it might lack a co-factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). However, we detected significant protease activity when the casein substrate was incubated with HopX1-HA immunopurified directly from stable transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants expressing the <italic>hopX1</italic> gene from a <italic>dexamethasone</italic>-inducible promoter (<italic>DEX</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that HopX1 expressed <italic>in planta</italic> has protease activity. To test whether this activity of HopX1 required its conserved cysteine protease catalytic triad, we substituted the conserved Cys-179 residue within this domain for an alanine residue to generate the HopX1<sup>C179A</sup> mutant. HopX1<sup>C179A</sup>-HA inmunoprecipitated from transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants did not show any proteolytic activity compared to negative controls. The trypsin enzyme used as a positive control in these experiments showed much higher activity on the casein substrate than HopX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). These data indicate that HopX1 has protease activity, but seems to operate suboptimally on a general substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>. To test whether HopX1 may have evolved specific substrate selectivity, we incubated inmunoprecipitated HopX1 and HopX1<sup>C179A</sup> from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> with recombinant MBP-JAZ5 expressed and purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells with or without protease inhibitors. The amount of MBP-JAZ5 diminished significantly when incubated with HopX1 but not with HopX1<sup>C179A</sup> or buffer in the absence of protease inhibitors, but not in its presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, HopX1, but not HopX1<sup>C179A</sup>, is capable of inducing JAZ5 degradation <italic>in vitro</italic> suggesting that the effector indeed acts as a protease on the JAZ5 substrate.</p>

<p>To confirm that degradation of JAZ proteins by HopX1 requires its putative cysteine protease activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, we next tested the effect of the C179A mutation on JAZ5-HA accumulation when the proteins were co-expressed transiently in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). JAZ5-HA was detectable in the presence of HopX1<sup>C179A</sup>, but not HopX1, indicating that this catalytic residue is indeed critical for the effect of HopX1 on JAZ5 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, only wild-type HopX1, but not HopX1<sup>C179A</sup>, compromised the accumulation of additional JAZs such as JAZ1, JAZ2, JAZ9, and JAZ10 when transiently co-expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. However, HopX1 did not alter MYC2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). To exclude that JAZ5 degradation is a general property of cysteine proteases, we analyzed the effects of previously described cysteine proteases such as HopC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Dowen1">[40]</xref> and HopN1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-LopezSolanilla1">[41]</xref> or an independent HopAD1 effector on the stability of JAZ5 when coexpressed transiently in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. As expected, JAZ5-HA accumulation was compromised in the presence of HopX1, but not when co-expressed with the EV control or with HopC1 or HopN1 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The HopAD1 effector could not be detected in this assay. Taken together, these data suggest that degradation of JAZ proteins by HopX1 is specific and depends on a cysteine protease enzymatic activity that requires a conserved cysteine within the proposed catalytic triad.</p>

<title>HopX1 Associates with and Degrades JAZs in a COI1-Independent Manner</title>
<p>Increased JA-Ile levels promote binding of JAZs to SCF<sup>COI1</sup> and subsequent degradation of JAZ repressors via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Sheard1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, degradation of JAZs by HopX1 might be direct (through its protease activity) or an indirect effect mediated by JA-Ile synthesis and COI1. To investigate if JAZ degradation by HopX1 is direct or indirect, we first analyzed whether HopX1-induced degradation of JAZ5 was dependent on the 26S proteasome pathway by using the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. In HopX1 coexpression experiments in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, JAZ5 was not detected in the presence of MG132, indicating that degradation does not require the proteasome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s006">Figure S6</xref>). We next checked whether HopX1-induced degradation of JAZ proteins occurred in a COI1-dependent or independent manner. To test this, we first used a stable transgenic <italic>N. tabacum</italic> line silenced for expression of the <italic>NtCOI1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Shoji1">[42]</xref>. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis confirmed that control <italic>N. tabacum</italic> plants (Line VC, transformed with <italic>EV</italic>) accumulated <italic>NtCOI1</italic> mRNA, whereas <italic>NtCOI1</italic> transcripts were undetectable in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> plants silenced for the <italic>NtCOI1</italic> gene (Line L18) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>NtCOI1</italic>-silenced <italic>N. tabacum</italic> plants produced few seeds, a phenotype reminiscent of infertile <italic>Arabidopsis coi1-1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s007">Figure S7B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Feys1">[19]</xref>.

<p>JAZ proteins are characterized by three sequence motifs, namely a relatively conserved N-terminal (NT) motif and the two highly conserved ZIM (central) and Jas (C-terminal) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chini1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Pauwels1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Yan1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Fonseca2">[44]</xref>.

Consistently, these truncated JAZ forms (JAZΔJas) are resistant to COI1-dependent degradation after jasmonate treatment, and plants overexpressing them are JA-insensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chini1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>. To confirm whether degradation of JAZ proteins by HopX1 is COI1-independent, we analyzed the effect of HopX1 on three JAZΔJas proteins, namely JAZ1ΔJas, JAZ2ΔJas, and JAZ7ΔJas. We detected <italic>JAZ1</italic>Δ<italic>Jas</italic>, <italic>JAZ2</italic>Δ<italic>Jas</italic>, and <italic>JAZ7</italic>Δ<italic>Jas</italic> proteins when co-expressed individually with the <italic>EV</italic> control in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). However, none of these JAZΔJas protein forms accumulated when co-expressed with GFP-HopX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), confirming that HopX1 triggers the degradation of JAZ proteins in a COI1-independent manner.</p>
<p>All of our previous results imply that HopX1 targets JAZ proteins directly. Therefore, we next examined the ability of HopX1 and HopX1<sup>C179A</sup> to interact with all 12 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> JAZ proteins in pull-down (PD) experiments. To do this, we used recombinant JAZ proteins fused to MBP and cell extracts of either wild-type plants (as negative controls), or transgenic plants expressing HopX1-HA or HopX1<sup>C179A</sup>-HA from the <italic>DEX</italic> inducible promoter. These experiments included protease inhibitors so that degradation of JAZs would not diminish a potential interaction with HopX1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, all full-length MBP–JAZ proteins tested interacted with wild-type HopX1-HA, but not with the mutant HopX1<sup>C179A</sup>-HA form. Similarly, MBP-HopX1 purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> cells co-immunoprecipitated with JAZ5-GFP when the recombinant effector protein was incubated with <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants extracts transiently expressing the JAZ5 transgene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s008">Figure S8</xref>). We could also detect weak interaction with MBP-HopX1<sup>C179A</sup> but to a lesser extent than MBP-HopX1. Overall, this indicates that HopX1 interacts with JAZ proteins.</p>
<p>To further determine the requirements for HopX1 interaction with JAZ proteins, we expressed the JAZ deletion mutants JAZ5<sub>1–91</sub> (NT domain), JAZ5<sub>92–163</sub> (ZIM domain), and JAZ5<sub>164–274</sub> (Jas domain) fused to MBP in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified these fragments for PD analysis with cell extracts of transgenic plants expressing HopX1-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g003">Figure 3E</xref> the N-terminal fragment alone, or the C-terminus containing the Jas domain, did not interact with HopX1. However, the JAZ5<sub>92–163</sub> derivative containing the ZIM domain was sufficient for interaction with HopX1. Notably, the mutant version HopX1<sup>C179A</sup> could not be pulled down with any fragment of JAZ5, as we observed previously with full-length JAZ proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The results indicate that HopX1 interacts directly with JAZ proteins though the central ZIM domain, whereas the other conserved domains seem to be dispensable. The data support our previous results showing that HopX1 triggers the degradation of all JAZ proteins, as the ZIM domain is present in all members of the JAZ family of repressors.</p>
<p>JAZ proteins are translated in the cytoplasm and localized predominantly in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chini1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>. We next examined in which subcellular compartment the degradation of JAZs proteins by HopX1 takes place. To test this, we expressed GFP or GFP-HopX1 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves and analyzed its subcellular localization using confocal microscopy. As reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Nimchuk1">[38]</xref>, the fluorescent signal corresponding to GFP-HopX1 accumulated mainly in the cytoplasm 48 hours post inoculation (HPI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). We could also detect GFP-HopX1 fusion protein within the nucleus in cross-middle nuclear sections using confocal microscopy analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g003">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s009">S9A</xref>), indicating that a pool of the effector enters the nucleus. To confirm this result, we further performed separation of nuclear extracts from the cytoplasmic fraction of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves transiently expressing GFP alone or GFP-HopX1 fusion protein. Crude fractions enriched for nuclei contained detectable levels of full length GFP-HopX1 although to a lesser extent than cytoplasmic fractions, confirming the microscopy results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). These results indicate that HopX1 could potentially degrade JAZ proteins both in the cytoplasm and nucleus.</p>

<p>Crosstalk between JA and SA signaling pathways plays an important role in the regulation and fine-tuning of induced defenses against pathogens. The SA and JA/ET defense pathways generally antagonize each other, and induction of the JA pathway by <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains counteracts SA-dependent defenses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Grant1">[7]</xref>. Thus, we next determined whether activation of the JA-pathway by HopX1 could interfere with SA-dependent gene expression. We analyzed the expression of the SA marker gene <italic>PR1</italic> in <italic>DEX</italic>-inducible transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Aa–0 plants expressing <italic>hopX1 or hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup> pre-treated with 1 mM of SA or a mock solution for 24 hours. Treatment with SA strongly induced <italic>PR1</italic> expression in non-induced <italic>hopX1</italic> or <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup> transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Strikingly, DEX induction of the <italic>hopX1</italic> effector gene for 24 hours strongly reduced subsequent SA induction of <italic>PR-1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Pre-induction of the <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup> gene interfered weakly with <italic>PR-1</italic> expression, but to a much lesser extent than wild-type HopX1. Overall, these results suggest that HopX1 activates the JA pathway to suppress SA-dependent defense responses to induce plant susceptibility.</p>
<p>On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that HopX1 could contribute to bacterial pathogenicity by mimicking COR-induced susceptibility. The jasmonate mimic COR is a bacterial toxin that contributes to bacterial invasion of the apoplast by <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto1">[12]</xref>. Consistently, coronatine-deficient (<italic>COR−</italic>) <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 mutants are less virulent on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants when surface-inoculated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto1">[12]</xref>. To test if HopX1 contributes to bacterial pathogenicity during natural infections when delivered by the bacterial TTSS we compared bacterial replication of a <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> strain expressing <italic>hopX1</italic><sub>Pta11528</sub> or the <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup> gene on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 plants infected by spray inoculation. This type of inoculation mimics natural infection conditions and is one of the most sensitive techniques to assess plant susceptibility to bacterial pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Zipfel1">[48]</xref>. <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> growth was increased by about one log (cfu/cm<sup>2</sup>) when expressing <italic>hopX1</italic> compared to the same strain containing <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup> or an empty vector construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Strikingly, differences in bacterial growth promoted by HopX1 were abolished when DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> strains expressing <italic>EV</italic> or the <italic>hopX1</italic> or <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup> genes were supplemented with 2 µM of COR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). This result supports the idea that HopX1 and COR act redundantly. Similar results were obtained when we compared bacterial replication on transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Aa–0 plants expressing <italic>hopX1</italic> or <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup> infected with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 or the isogenic <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> strain by spray inoculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s013">Figure S13</xref>). These results indicate that HopX1 can complement the deficiency in COR production of <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic>, and supports a key role for the effector catalytic triad in the activation of the jasmonate pathway.</p>
<p>We further studied whether <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> growth promotion by HopX1 was COI1-dependent by performing similar experiments in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants lacking the <italic>COI1</italic> receptor gene (<italic>coi1-30</italic>). As described previously, external application of COR did not restore <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> growth on <italic>coi1-30</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g004">Figure 4F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Kloek1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Brooks1">[11]</xref>. In contrast, expression of <italic>hopX1</italic>, but not <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup> or <italic>EV</italic>, enhanced the growth of <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> in <italic>coi1-30</italic> plants, similar to previous results in Col-0 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Moreover, we examined whether JAZ proteins were degraded by HopX1 <italic>in vivo</italic> after bacterial infections on transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 plants expressing the dominant negative J<italic>AZ1ΔJas-HA</italic> variant from the <italic>35S</italic> promoter. As described above, JAZ proteins lacking the C-terminal Jas domain do not interact with COI1 and cannot be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, thus promoting JA-insensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chini1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chini2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-FernandezCalvo1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto3">[46]</xref>. J<italic>AZ1ΔJas-HA</italic> levels were strongly reduced in total plant extracts 24 hours after infiltration of <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> bacteria expressing <italic>hopX1</italic>, whereas infiltration of buffer or <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> expressing either <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup> or <italic>EV</italic> did not cause any significant changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Consistent with the fact that J<italic>AZ1ΔJas-HA</italic> is resistant to COI1-dependent degradation by bacterial COR, challenge with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 did not alter J<italic>AZ1ΔJas-HA</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Finally, we investigated whether <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> bacteria expressing <italic>hopX1</italic> could re-open plant stomata. To do this, we incubated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 as a positive control or <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> bacteria expressing <italic>hopX1</italic>, <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup>, or an <italic>EV</italic> control. Incubation of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> expressing an <italic>EV</italic> for 5 hours induced stomatal closure whereas stomata of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves incubated with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 remained open similar to mock treated control leaves as it was described previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s014">Figure S14</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Melotto1">[12]</xref>. Strikingly, only <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> bacteria expressing <italic>hopX1</italic>, but not <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup>, could re-open plant stomata of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. This indicates that HopX1 from <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 plays a role in re-opening of stomata as COR does. These data are consistent with functional redundancy between HopX1 and the phytotoxin COR. Taken together, our data indicate that HopX1 acts inside the plant cell to promote activation of the JA pathway and induce susceptibility in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Levels of resistance in whole plants are influenced by systemic signals mediated, in many cases, by plant hormones. The importance of the role of hormones in biotic interactions is underlined by the increasing number of pathogenic microbes that are known to produce phytohormones or phytohormone mimics to perturb hormonal homeostasis and promote disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-RobertSeilaniantz1">[6]</xref>. To date, production of cytokinins (CKs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Kakimoto1">[49]</xref>, abscisic acid (ABA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Siewers1">[50]</xref>, auxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Spaepen1">[51]</xref>, JA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Mittal1">[52]</xref>, and ET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Weingart1">[53]</xref> has been reported in various bacterial or fungal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-RobertSeilaniantz1">[6]</xref>. Remarkably, some pathogens produce hormone mimics. This is the case of some strains of <italic>P. syringae</italic> that produce COR, a mimic of the bioactive jasmonate JA-Ile, but synthesized via an unrelated biosynthetic pathway involving ligation of coronamic acid (cma) to the polyketide coronafacic acid (cfa) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Xin1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-RobertSeilaniantz1">[6]</xref>. Like JA-Ile, COR functions as an SA antagonist to promote virulence via suppression of host defenses. Notably, COR is produced by only a few <italic>P. syringae</italic> pathovars, whereas all <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> inject an array of effector proteins into the host cell that collectively promote disease by targeting and altering host cellular activities. The identification of their cellular targets is crucial to understand virulence. Recent data indicate that some effectors might impinge the JA pathway. For instance, Cui and colleagues showed that the effector AvrB indirectly perturbs JA signaling by interfering with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP kinase 4 (MPK4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Cui2">[35]</xref>. Moreover, several studies suggest that even in strains producing COR, effectors act synergistically with COR to induce the JA pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thilmony1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chen1">[34]</xref>. Thus, it seems plausible that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> manipulates the plant hormonal network through bacterial effectors to induce susceptibility. Here we have uncovered a novel molecular mechanism by which a bacterial strain (<italic>Pta</italic> 11528), which does not produce COR, activates the JA pathway to promote susceptibility through the degradation of JAZ repressors by the effector HopX1. In this work, we analyzed a <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 effector library containing ten identified effectors whereas the full <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 effector repertoire is predicted to secrete a suite of about 30 virulence effector proteins into the host cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Studholme1">[30]</xref>. Thus, it is plausible that additional effectors among the <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 effector repertoire not tested in this work may also destabilize JAZ proteins in a redundant manner with HopX1 to ensure activation of JA signaling and bacterial pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Expression of <italic>hopX1</italic>, but not <italic>hopX1</italic><sup>C179A</sup>, induced expression of early JA-responsive genes while reducing SA-mediated induction of the SA-marker gene <italic>PR1</italic>, a hallmark response of the JA pathway. These phenotypes are evidently associated with the virulence function of the effector, as the presence of HopX1 promotes <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 growth both in stable transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants expressing the effector under the control of a inducible promoter, or when the effector is delivered naturally by the TTSS of the bacteria. These results highlight a novel bacterial strategy to subvert the antagonistic relationship between host SA and JA signaling pathways. JA-Ile activates plant responses by promoting physical interaction between the E3 ligase COI1 and JAZ repressors. This interaction leads to JAZ polyubiquitination (poly-Ub) and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome, releasing TFs from repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Sheard1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>. Remarkably, HopX1 compromises the accumulation of JAZ repressors in <italic>NtCOI1</italic>-silenced plants, and triggers the degradation of dominant-negative JAZ variants lacking the C-terminal Jas domain, which is required for the interaction with COI1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chini1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Yan1">[26]</xref>. Therefore, HopX1-triggered degradation of JAZ proteins occurs in a COI1-independent manner, thus allowing activation of the pathway in the absence of the hormone. The ability of HopX1 to promote degradation of JAZ proteins and activate JA responses suggests that this is a strategy to promote disease. PD and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that HopX1 interacts with JAZ proteins through its central ZIM domain, conserved in all 12 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> JAZ repressors and their JAZΔJas variants. The interaction with the ZIM domain is consistent with HopX1-triggered degradation of all full-length JAZs and truncated derivatives tested in our assays, and indicates that the effect of HopX1 on JAZs is direct or at least through the same protein complex. JAZ proteins are translated in the cytoplasm and then localized mainly, but not exclusively, in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chini1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Thines1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Withers1">[54]</xref>. For example, JAZ1 can be detected in both cytosol and nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Jiang1">[55]</xref>. Moreover, Withers and colleagues recently reported a MYC2-dependent mechanism for nuclear import of cognate JAZs transcriptional repressors in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Withers1">[54]</xref>, which implied an equilibrium of JAZ proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Thus, it is conceivable that HopX1 could potentially degrade JAZ proteins both in the cytoplasm and nucleus.</p>
<p>Interaction and degradation of JAZs by HopX1 suggest that this effector has proteolytic activity. HopX1 family members are modular proteins that contain a putative cysteine-based catalytic triad and a novel conserved N-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Nimchuk1">[38]</xref>. The putative catalytic triad consists of cysteine (C), histidine (H), and aspartic acid (D) and is similar to that utilized by diverse enzyme families such as cysteine proteases and peptide N-glycanases (PNGases), which are all members of the transglutaminase (TGase) protein superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Nimchuk1">[38]</xref>. While previous reports failed to detect protease activity <italic>in vitro</italic> using general substrates, genetic approaches demonstrated the functional relevance of the conserved catalytic triad of HopX1 family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Nimchuk1">[38]</xref>. For example, mutation of this putative catalytic triad of various HopX family members abolished avirulence activity on <italic>R2</italic>-expressing bean cultivars and also prevented initiation of cell death in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> following transient expression assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Nimchuk1">[38]</xref>. We found that HopX1 has protease activity on both general and specific substrates when the effector was directly immunopurified from plants and that this activity required Cys-179 within the conserved catalytic triad. Previously, Coaker and colleagues reported that the cysteine protease effector AvrRpt2 requires host general folding catalyst cyclophilins like <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ROC1 to activate AvrRpt2 cysteine protease activity once the effector is translocated into the plant cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Coaker1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Coaker2">[57]</xref>. Activated AvrRpt2 undergoes autoprocessing of its N-terminus to yield the mature protease that cleaves the host target RIN4 <italic>in planta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chisholm1">[58]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that HopX1 also requires a host eukaryotic chaperone into the plant cell for the activation of the protease activity in a similar fashion as AvrRpt2. These results, together with the ability of HopX1 to interact with JAZs in PD and co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggest a model in which HopX1 acts on JAZs directly or indirectly through a third plant protein in the same complex. Noteworthy, HopX1<sup>C179A</sup> shows markedly reduced affinity for JAZ proteins in PD and co-immunoprecipitation assays compared to wild-type HopX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g003">Figures 3C, 3D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s008">S8</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the lack of activity of HopX1<sup>C179A</sup> on JAZs could be due not exclusively to a missing enzymatic activity but also to a compromised ability to interact with its host targets, or a combination of both simultaneously. In this regard, we can also not completely exclude that HopX1 activity on JAZs could be due to an additional plant protease that co-purifies between the same protein complex. Despite previous reports showing that the cysteine protease effector AvrPphB cleaved host targets into smaller fragments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chisholm1">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Shao1">[59]</xref>, we did not see smaller bands in our assays including free MBP. We speculate that this could be due to the small size of JAZ proteins (25–35 KDa). However, it is also possible that HopX1 degrades JAZ proteins at multiple sites and triggers target degradation in a similar fashion to the cysteine protease effector AvrRpt2 on its 30-kDa host substrate protein RIN4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chisholm1">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Shao1">[59]</xref>. On the other hand, it is possible that the immunoprecipitation of HopX1-HA or C179A-HA from transgenic plants contains additional proteases that could affect MBP stability. This would explain why in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g002">Figure 2B</xref> MBP-JAZ5 protein purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> is more stable in the presence of general cocktail protease inhibitors. Despite this, unspecific degradation would occur in all samples to the same extent and therefore, the effect we observed in MBP-JAZ5 in the presence of HopX1 is likely to be specific. Moreover, we found that substitution of the conserved Cys-179 amino acid of HopX1 to alanine also compromised HopX1-mediated JAZ5 degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, activation of JA-dependent gene expression and JA-related phenotypes occurred in a Cys-179 dependent manner when expressed ectopically in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Furthermore, in contrast to wild-type HopX1, HopX1<sup>C179A</sup> delivered by the TTSS was unable promote growth of <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 <italic>COR−</italic> bacteria. Overall, these data suggest that HopX1 family members are proteolytic enzymes of the cysteine protease family, and that this activity is required for function.</p>
<p>Several JAZ pre-mRNAs are subject to alternative splicing, which, at least for JAZ10, results in truncated JAZΔJas proteins that are resistant to proteasomal degradation because they are unable to interact with COI1, thereby causing dominant JA-insensitive phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Yan1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chung1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chung2">[60]</xref>. The alternative splicing of <italic>JAZ</italic> genes provides a feedback mechanism to efficiently repress the JA signal output and reduce the fitness costs associated with over-stimulation of the signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chung1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Chung2">[60]</xref>. Degradation of JAZΔJas variants by HopX1 suggests that this effector should promote a sustained activation of the JA pathway, favoring susceptibility. In agreement with this hypothesis, <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 COR− expressing <italic>hopX1</italic> promoted bacterial replication in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g004">Figure 4E and 4F</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 COR−, which does not produce COR, grew better in the presence of the effector (DEX in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s013">Figure S13</xref>) than the wild-type strain producing COR in the absence of the effector (mock in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s013">Figure S13</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that evolution has shaped this effector–host interaction to maximize the activation of the JA response pathway through direct targeting of most forms of JAZs. Besides the 12 JAZ repressors, six additional <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins contain a ZIM domain. Collectively, these 18 proteins are known as the TIFY proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Pauwels1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Vanholme1">[61]</xref>. It remains to be determined whether HopX1 targets any of these ZIM domain containing proteins, and if they also play a role in plant defense against bacteria.</p>
<p>Notably, HopX homologs are found in diverse phytopathogenic bacteria including <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000. BLAST analysis revealed a near identical match of HopX1<italic><sub>Pta</sub></italic><sub> 11528</sub> with HopX1 from <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>phaseolicola</italic> bacterial strains such as race 4 (<italic>Pph</italic> race 4) (99% identity) but significantly less homology with the respective <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 homolog (72% identity) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that the <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 and <italic>Pta</italic> 11528 alleles of HopX1 play different roles in the plant cell.

Secondly, HopX1<italic><sub>Pto</sub></italic><sub> DC3000</sub> did not compromise the accumulation of JAZ5 when co-expressed transiently in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001792.s015">Figure S15</xref>). Consistently, transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 plants expressing the dominant negative J<italic>AZ1ΔJas</italic> variant infected with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 did not alter J<italic>AZ1ΔJas</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001792-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). This indicates that these plants are resistant to both HopX1<italic><sub>Pto</sub></italic><sub> DC3000</sub> and COI1-dependent degradation by bacterial COR. The ability of HopX1<italic><sub>Pta</sub></italic><sub> 11528</sub> to trigger JAZ degradation and activation of JA responses may reflect specialized functions among the broad divergence across the HopX family members. It is tempting to speculate that redundancy between COR and HopX1 has allowed strains that produce the phytotoxin to evolve HopX1 for other functions and in doing so, lose its JA-inducing activity. Overall, HopX1 exemplifies a bacterial strategy for pathogenicity in which the JA pathway is targeted through direct degradation of JAZ repressors to promote pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Finally, emerging data suggest that bacterial pathogens have evolved effectors to manipulate important plant hormones that regulate defense response such as SA and JA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-RobertSeilaniantz1">[6]</xref>. For, example, the <italic>P. syringae</italic> effector HopI1 directly targets Hsp70 in choloroplasts to suppress SA accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Jelenska1">[62]</xref> whereas the effector AvrB promotes JA signaling likely through an indirect mechanism via the activation of MPK4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Cui2">[35]</xref>. Very recently, the <italic>P. syringae</italic> effector HopZ1a was reported to interact and acetylate several JAZ proteins through a putative acetyltransferase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Jiang1">[55]</xref>. HopZ1a-mediated acetylation induces JAZ1 degradation through an undefined mechanism that is dependent on COI1. This leads to activation of JA-dependent gene expression and plant susceptibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Jiang1">[55]</xref>. It is possible that post-translational modifications of JAZ1 induces or represses 26S proteasome degradation triggered by COI1. In this study, we found that <italic>hopX1</italic> encodes a cysteine protease, activity that is required for degradation of JAZs by HopX1. HopX1 associates with JAZ proteins through its central ZIM domain and degradation occurs in a proteasome- and COI1-independent manner, highlighting the different strategies used by bacterial effectors to target similar host components. Importantly, ectopic expression of HopX1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> induces the expression of JA-dependent genes and represses SA-induced markers, whereas delivery of HopX1 by the natural TTSS of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> partially re-opens stomata during the infection process and promotes susceptibility to a similar extent as the addition of COR. These results highlight a novel molecular mechanism by which bacterial effectors directly manipulates core regulators of hormone signaling to facilitate infection. Indeed, oomycete pathogens were also found to produce effectors that interact with JAZ3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001792-Mukhtar1">[36]</xref>. The recent findings highlight the JA receptor complex as a major common and critical hub of suppression for diverse pathogens during the arms race between plants and pathogens.</p>
