				<article-title>In Monarchs, Cry2 Is King of the Clock</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The circadian clock plays a vital role in monarch butterfly (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Danaus plexippus</named-content>) migration by providing the timing component of time-compensated sun compass orientation, a process that is important for successful navigation. We therefore evaluated the monarch clockwork by focusing on the functions of a <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like <italic>cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>cry</italic>), designated <italic>cry1</italic>, and a vertebrate-like <italic>cry</italic>, designated <italic>cry2</italic>, that are both expressed in the butterfly and by placing these genes in the context of other relevant clock genes in vivo. We found that similar temporal patterns of clock gene expression and protein levels occur in the heads, as occur in DpN1 cells, of a monarch cell line that contains a light-driven clock. CRY1 mediates TIMELESS degradation by light in DpN1 cells, and a light-induced TIMELESS decrease occurs in putative clock cells in the pars lateralis (PL) in the brain. Moreover, monarch <italic>cry1</italic> transgenes partially rescue both biochemical and behavioral light-input defects in <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic>. CRY2 is the major transcriptional repressor of CLOCK:CYCLE-mediated transcription in DpN1 cells, and endogenous CRY2 potently inhibits transcription without involvement of PERIOD. CRY2 is co-localized with clock proteins in the PL, and there it translocates to the nucleus at the appropriate time for transcriptional repression. We also discovered CRY2-positive neural projections that oscillate in the central complex. The results define a novel, CRY-centric clock mechanism in the monarch in which CRY1 likely functions as a blue-light photoreceptor for entrainment, whereas CRY2 functions within the clockwork as the transcriptional repressor of a negative transcriptional feedback loop. Our data further suggest that CRY2 may have a dual role in the monarch butterfly's brain—as a core clock element and as an output that regulates circadian activity in the central complex, the likely site of the sun compass.</p>

          <p>During their spectacular fall migration, eastern North American monarch butterflies (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Danaus plexippus</named-content>) use a time-compensated sun compass to help them navigate to their overwintering sites in central Mexico. The circadian clock plays a critical role in monarch butterfly migration by providing the timing component to time-compensated sun compass orientation. Here we characterize a novel molecular clock mechanism in monarchs by focusing on the functions of two CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) proteins. In the monarch clock, CRY1, a <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like protein, functions as a blue-light photoreceptor for photic entrainment, whereas CRY2, a vertebrate-like protein, functions within the clockwork as the major transcriptional repressor of the self-sustaining feedback loop. An oscillating CRY2-positive neural pathway was also discovered in the monarch brain that may communicate circadian information directly from the circadian clock to the central complex, which is the likely site of the sun compass. The monarch clock may be the prototype of a clock mechanism shared by other invertebrates that express both CRY proteins, and its elucidation will help crack the code of sun compass orientation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In insects, circadian clocks regulate the timing of numerous biological events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b001">1</xref>]. Some examples of critical circadian rhythm outputs in holometabolous insects include the time of day of adult eclosion, the seasonal timing of reproductive diapause, and time-compensated sun compass navigation.</p>
      <p>The molecular clock mechanism has been the subject of intense investigation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b003">3</xref>], while less attention has been directed at the clockwork mechanism in other, non-drosophilid insects. In the fruit fly, the central clock is driven primarily by a negative transcriptional feedback loop that involves the products of the <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>), and <italic>timeless</italic> (<italic>tim</italic>) genes, and the transcription factors <italic>Clock</italic> (<italic>Clk</italic>) and <italic>cycle</italic> (<italic>cyc</italic>). CLK and CYC heterodimers drive <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> transcription through E-box enhancer elements. The resultant PER and TIM proteins form heterodimers that translocate back into the nucleus to repress their own transcription via inhibitory effects on CLK and CYC. <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) is co-localized in clock cells with PER and TIM and functions as a blue-light photoreceptor involved in photic entrainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b006">6</xref>]. CRY disrupts PER and TIM heterodimers by directly interacting with TIM in a light-dependent process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b009">9</xref>], and it also participates in its own light-dependent degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b010">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>The eastern North American monarch butterfly (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Danaus plexippus</named-content>) is well known for its long-distance fall migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b011">11</xref>]. We have been developing this species as a model to examine the role of the circadian clock in time-compensated sun compass orientation and in the seasonal induction of the migratory generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b012">12</xref>]. Using clock protein expression patterns, we previously identified the location of circadian clock cells in the dorsolateral protocerebrum (pars lateralis [PL]) of the butterfly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>], which expresses PER, TIM, and a <italic>Drosophila</italic>-like CRY (designated CRY1; see below). We also identified a CRY1-staining neural pathway that may connect the circadian (navigational) clock to polarized light input entering brain, which is important for sun compass navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b015">15</xref>]. A CRY1 pathway also may connect the circadian clock to neurosecretory cells in the pars intercerebralis (PI) for the initiation of the migratory state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>]. A direct clock-to–sun compass pathway has also been postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the course of our molecular investigations of the circadian clock mechanism in monarchs, we have discovered that these butterflies, like all other non-drosophilid insects so far examined, express a second <italic>cry</italic> gene that encodes a vertebrate-like protein designated insect CRY2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b016">16</xref>]. Functional studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider 2 (S2) cells show that monarch CRY2 is light insensitive, but potently inhibits CLOCK:CYCLE-mediated transcription, whereas monarch CRY1 is light sensitive, but does not show transcriptional repressive activity. However, the mechanistic details of CRY2′s actual function within a clockwork have not been defined in any insect.</p>
      <p>Further molecular evolutionary studies have shown that gene duplication and loss have led to three modes of <italic>cry</italic> gene expression in insects, giving rise to three types of circadian clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b017">17</xref>]: two derived clocks, in which only <italic>cry1</italic> (e.g., <italic>Drosophila</italic>) or <italic>cry2</italic> (e.g., the honey bee <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Apis mellifera</named-content> and red flour beetle <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Tribolium castaneum</named-content>) is expressed, and an ancestral clock in which both <italic>cry1</italic> and <italic>cry2</italic> are expressed (e.g., the monarch butterfly). The expression of two functionally distinct <italic>cry</italic>s in monarchs suggests that the butterfly clock may use a novel clockwork mechanism that is not yet fully described in any organism.</p>
      <p>In the studies discussed here, we have therefore used in vivo approaches, a monarch cell line that contains a light-driven molecular clock, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> carrying monarch <italic>cry1</italic> or <italic>cry2</italic> transgenes to elucidate the monarch clockwork mechanism and its photic entrainment. Our results define many characteristics of a CRY-centric clock in the monarch butterfly with CRY1 functioning potentially as a blue-light photoreceptor for photic entrainment, whereas CRY2 functions, without PER, within the clockwork as the major transcriptional repressor of the core transcriptional feedback loop. We also present evidence of a CRY2-positive neural pathway that oscillates in the central complex, the apparent site of the sun compass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b019">19</xref>]. CRY2 may thus function as both a core clock element and as an output-regulating circadian activity in the central complex.</p>

        <title>Temporal Patterns of Clock Gene RNA and Protein Expression in Monarch Heads</title>
        <p>If a negative transcriptional feedback loop underlies the circadian clock in monarch butterflies, it should drive the rhythmic expression of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> in vivo. We thus used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) to examine the temporal expression patterns of the clock gene homologs in monarch butterfly heads at 3-h intervals in a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle (LD) and during the first day in constant darkness (DD).</p>
        <p>Monarch <italic>per</italic> RNA levels exhibited a daily rhythm in LD with peak levels at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 18 and low levels at ZT 0–3, and the rhythm persisted in DD (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b020">20</xref>]. We found that a rhythm of similar phase was manifested by monarch <italic>tim</italic> RNA levels in both LD and DD (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

            <p>(A) Temporal profiles of clock gene RNA expression in heads. Heads were collected at 3-h intervals for 24 h in LD and during the first day in DD. RNA levels were quantitated by qPCR.

        </fig>
        <p>Monarch-specific antibodies against PER, TIM, CRY1, and CRY2 were used to examine the temporal profiles of clock protein abundance in monarch head extracts by Western blot analysis. Indeed, PER and TIM showed significant temporal oscillations in abundance in LD (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), with peak levels occurring from ZT 18–24/0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). There were also temporal changes in PER electrophoretic mobility; the changes in mobility were due to changes in phosphorylation, as phosphatase treatment converted &gt;90% of the high–molecular weight forms of PER to a single, lower–molecular weight band (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The more highly phosphorylated forms of PER were predominant at 3 h after lights-on. In DD, the oscillation in PER abundance persisted (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), while the oscillation in TIM abundance was markedly blunted, to the point that there was no longer a significant daily rhythm (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Thus, the daily TIM abundance oscillation in the head is mainly light driven. There was no significant daily change in either monarch CRY1 or CRY2 abundance in whole head extracts in either LD or DD (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p>

In DpN1 cells, we in fact found that the RNAs for <italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, <italic>cry1</italic>, <italic>cry2</italic>, <italic>Clk</italic>, <italic>cyc</italic>, <italic>vrille</italic>, <italic>Pdp1</italic>, <italic>slimb</italic>, <italic>doubletime</italic>, <italic>CKII</italic>α, <italic>CKII</italic>β, and <italic>shaggy</italic> were all expressed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-st001">Table S1</xref>). We focused our studies of the temporal dynamics of clock gene expression in DpN1 cells on <italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, <italic>cry1</italic>, and <italic>cry2</italic> to parallel our in vivo analyses.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, when studied at 4-h intervals under LD, we found cycling in clock gene RNA levels (by qPCR) and clock protein abundance (by Western blot analysis). At the level of gene expression, we found that monarch <italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, and <italic>cry2</italic> exhibited near-synchronous daily rhythms in RNA levels, with peak levels between ZT 16 and 24, and trough levels between ZT 4 and 8 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). There was no significant daily oscillation in <italic>cry1</italic> levels in LD (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). In DD, no clock gene RNA oscillation was apparent on the first day. This lack of a circadian oscillation was consistently observed in repeated experiments.</p>
        <p>At the protein level, monarch PER and TIM showed robust temporal oscillations in abundance in DpN1 cells in LD, with highest protein levels at the end of the dark period (ZT 24/0) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for PER and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for TIM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). CRY2 also showed temporal changes in abundance, with highest levels 4 h later at ZT 4 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). For PER, there was not only a diurnal change in protein abundance but also in electrophoretic mobility, as found in head extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Phosphorylated PER was the dominant form at ZT 4, which correlated with the highest level of CRY2 abundance, and the rapidly declining <italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, and <italic>cry2</italic> RNA levels. This temporal increase in CRY2 abundance in DpN1 cells contrasts with the lack of rhythmicity in CRY2 abundance over the 24-h day in LD in monarch heads (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>B with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">1</xref>D). The reason for this discrepancy is because CRY2 is more widely expressed in the monarch brain than the other clock proteins examined, and CRY2 is not under robust circadian control in most areas (see below). The temporal profiles of clock gene RNA and protein expression in DpN1 cells are consistent with PER and/or CRY2 being involved in negative feedback repression of CLK:CYC-mediated transcription in the cell line, which is further explored below. Similar to what we found for RNA expression in DpN1 cells, we were unable to identify a circadian oscillation of the clock proteins in the cells in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Although it is unclear why we were not able to detect a functional circadian clock in DpN1 cells, the close correlation of clock gene RNA and protein expression patterns between DpN1 cells and heads in LD, makes the cell line a useful system in which to study the molecular and biochemical details of the monarch clock transcriptional feedback loop in LD (focusing on the role of CRY2), as well as its intracellular light input pathway (focusing on the role of CRY1).</p>

        <title>CRY1 Mediates the Light-Induced Decrease in TIM in DpN1 Cells</title>
        <p>We first used DpN1 cells to examine whether monarch CRY1 mediates the light-induced decrease in TIM abundance, providing a light-resetting pathway into the molecular clock. By using RNA interference induced by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs,) we supply evidence that the light-induced decrease in TIM abundance in DpN1 cells is mediated through CRY1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

            <title>CRY1 and TIM Reponses to Light in DpN1 Cells</title>
            <p>Clock protein abundance in LD-cultured cells changes in response to light. DpN1 cells were cultured under LD, pretreated with dsRNA against <italic>GFP</italic> (black lines) or dsRNA against <italic>cry1</italic> (red lines), and then exposed to light (at the start of the normal light period) for 540 min. Cells were collected at the designated times. Cell homogenates were analyzed by Western blot, and probed for CRY1 (GP37), TIM (GP47), PER (GP40), and CRY2 (GP51) (left-hand panels). The time courses of declines were quantified by chemiluminescence, and band intensity was normalized against α-tubulin (right-hand panels). (A) CRY1, (B) TIM, (C) PER, (D) CRY2. Time 0 is before lights on. Each point is the mean ± SEM of three experiments.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Once lights were turned on to initiate the normal light period in LD-cultured control cells (those treated with double-stranded RNA [dsRNA] targeting the green fluorescent protein [<italic>GFP</italic>] gene), there was a transient increase in CRY1 abundance at 15 and 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, black line), followed by a rapid decrease by 60 min, reaching constant low levels by 120 min; the light-induced decrease in CRY1 abundance in LD-cultured cells was unexpected (see below). With lights on, there was a rapid decrease in TIM abundance at 15 min, reaching constant low levels by 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, black lines). Light induced a slower decrease in PER abundance starting at 120 min, with a steady decline throughout the light period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, black line). The light-induced decline in CRY2 abundance was even slower and only apparent at 540 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, black line). The time course of light-induced protein decrements from TIM to CRY2 was similar to that seen after lights on (ZT 12) in LD without dsRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) and is consistent with a series of protective protein:protein interactions in which TIM:PER interactions protect PER from degradation, whereas PER:CRY2 interactions protect CRY2 from degradation (see below).</p>
        <p>A surprising aspect of the control experiment was that the initiation of the light period now caused a decrease in CRY1 abundance in cells treated with dsRNA targeting <italic>GFP</italic>, rather than CRY1 levels remaining at constant dark-like levels in the light, as seen in untreated cells cultured under LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). This light-induced CRY1 decrease was found to be secondary to a 5-h serum starvation of the medium that is necessary for efficient transfection of dsRNA into DpN1 cells (unpublished data); serum starvation likely induces the expression of a kinase that is important for monarch CRY1′s proteasomal degradation by light (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, pretreatment of cells maintained in LD with dsRNA targeting <italic>cry1</italic>, which caused a ∼60% reduction in CRY1 abundance in darkness just prior to (time 0) and throughout light exposure (Figure2A, red line), greatly reduced the decrease in TIM abundance in response to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, red lines). Pretreatment also greatly reduced the subsequent decreases in PER and CRY2 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">2</xref>D, red lines), compared with controls (cells treated with dsRNA targeting <italic>GFP</italic>). The lack of a complete block of the light-induced reduction of TIM appeared to be secondary to the partial CRY1 knockdown (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The dsRNA data strongly suggest that CRY1 mediates the light-induced TIM degradation in DpN1 cells (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Consistent with CRY1-mediating photic entrainment in the butterfly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b022">22</xref>], we found that blue light is the spectral component that degrades CRY1 and TIM in DpN1 cells and also synchronizes the timing of behavior (the adult eclosion rhythm) to the 24-h day (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

        <title>TIM Localization and Light Sensitivity in the Brain</title>
        <p>Next, we examined the location of light-sensing clock cells in monarch brain by immunocytochemistry, using our newly-developed monarch-specific anti-TIM antibodies. Monarch TIM-like immunoreactivity was detected by the new antibodies in the cytoplasm of cells in the PI and PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">Figure 3</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">3</xref>G and unpublished data), as previously described using an anti-TIM antibody against <italic>Drosophila</italic> TIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>]. Each of the monarch-specific antibodies gave prominent staining patterns in the cytoplasm (compared with weak staining with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antibody, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>]), with ∼25 large cells stained in the PI and four cells consistently stained in the PL. In addition, approximately eight cells were identified near the lobula region of the optic lobe (OL), and approximately eight cells were found in the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG). Double-labeling studies showed that the cytoplasmic TIM staining was localized in the PL to the four cells that co-express corazonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">3</xref>C), a neuropeptide that marks clock cells in the PL of lepidopteran brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b024">24</xref>], including monarchs, in which two of the four cells also stain for PER and CRY1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>]. Moreover, direct comparison confirmed that the cytoplasmic staining of CRY1 and TIM were colocalized in two of the four cells in PL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). We were unable to determine whether CRY1 and TIM were colocalized in the PI, however, because of weak staining for CRY1 in this structure; because there were twice as many TIM-positive cells as CRY1-positive cells in PI, only half of those TIM-positive cells would be expected to be colocalized with CRY1. The anti-TIM antibodies also stained a group of cells in the dorsal region of the OL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg005">Figure S5</xref>) in close vicinity, but not identical to the CRY1-positive group of cells previously described there [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>]. These TIM-positive cells projected into the same glomerular structure as the adjacent CRY1-staining cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). We did not observe detectable TIM staining in the nuclei of any of the cell groups.</p>

        <p>All of the cyptoplasmic staining in TIM-positive cells in the brain appeared to be light sensitive in LD. As previously noted, Western blot data showed a large light-driven daily oscillation of TIM in heads under LD conditions, with the daily oscillation of TIM abundance substantially blunted on placement in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). A similar pattern was found for the TIM-positive cells in the brain. In LD, all TIM-positive regions exhibited significantly lower levels of TIM staining at ZT 6, compared to ZT 15, including all four TIM-positive cells in PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">Figure 3</xref>H). In DD, on the other hand, there was a significant oscillation in PL only (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05), with lower staining at circadian time (CT) 9 and higher staining at CT 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">Figure 3</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">3</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">3</xref>I). In all other areas (PL, OL, and SOG), there was no significant difference between CT 9 and CT 15 (<italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05). When subjected to a 1-h light pulse from ZT 14–15 (ZT 15L), a significant light-induced decrease in TIM levels was detected in the PL only (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01), affecting all four TIM-positive cells, compared with brains kept in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">Figure 3</xref>F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">3</xref>G, and J). In all other areas (PI, OL, and SOG), there was a clear trend for a decrease in TIM staining with the light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g003">Figure 3</xref>J), but it did not reach significance (<italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05). Collectively, the data show that there is a good correlation in the different lighting schedules between TIM abundance changes in heads detected by Western blots and TIM staining patterns in brain regions detected by immunocytochemistry. TIM staining in the PL was the area most consistently regulated (by light and in DD).</p>
        <p>These data show a complex relationship between CRY1 and TIM degradation in the monarch brain. Wherever CRY1 and TIM are colocalized, CRY1 likely mediates TIM degradation, based on our studies in DpN1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In the other TIM-positive areas, either CRY1 is present below the level of antibody detection or TIM in those cells is degraded in a CRY1-independent manner, perhaps by local interactions (as may occur in PL), by opsins expressed in brain, and/or by neural pathways from eye and/or stemmata to TIM-positive cells.</p>
        <p>We showed previously by immunocytochemistry that CRY1 levels in the PI and PL are not altered by light exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>]. It thus appears that the light-induced decrease in TIM in TIM/CRY1 colocalized cells is not necessarily accompanied by a measurable decrease in monarch CRY1 abundance, which has also been shown by Western blot analysis in LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">1</xref>D) and with short-term light exposure at night both in DpN1 cells and in whole-head extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg006">Figure S6</xref>), as well as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b007">7</xref>]. It thus appears that light may induce a conformational change in monarch CRY1, leading to TIM degradation, but without necessarily inducing its own degradation.</p>

        <title>A Monarch <italic>cry1</italic> Transgene Partially Rescues Light-Input Defects in <italic>cry<sup>b</sup> Drosophila</italic></title>
        <p>Because there are no genetic approaches yet available in monarch butterflies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b012">12</xref>], we asked whether monarch CRY1 can function as a circadian photoreceptor by expressing monarch transgenes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

For these studies, we took advantage of the <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> mutation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, because it induces severe light-input defects; circadian phase does not shift in response to a light pulse, and TIM does not cycle in LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b006">6</xref>].

        <p>We first examined the ability of the monarch <italic>cry1</italic> transgene to restore the ability of discrete light pulses at night to phase-shift the circadian clock that drives locomotor activity in <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> mutant flies. We used two light pulses; a 1-h light pulse at ZT 15, which normally causes phase delays, or a 1-h light pulse at ZT 21, which normally causes phase advances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b005">5</xref>]. The light-pulse experiments using four independent <italic>UAS-cry1</italic> lines showed a partial rescue of the <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> phenotype. With a light pulse at ZT 21, the phase advances in the <italic>UAS-cry1</italic> lines <italic>1a</italic>, <italic>15b</italic>, and <italic>22b</italic> were as robust as the <italic>y w</italic> control (no significant differences), and the phase advance of line <italic>6b</italic> was only slightly less than that of <italic>y w</italic> (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). With a light pulse at ZT 15, the rescue was still evident, but not as robust; all four <italic>UAS-cry1</italic> lines had a statistically smaller phase change than <italic>y w</italic> (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001 for each), but they also had a statistically larger phase change than the <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> line (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01 for <italic>1a</italic> and <italic>6b</italic>; <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001 for <italic>15b</italic> and <italic>22b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

        <p>Next, the four <italic>UAS-cry1</italic> lines were examined for their ability to rescue the light-induced, CRY-dependent TIM oscillations in heads of the <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> background. In <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> flies, TIM levels do not cycle in LD. It is known that the light-induced TIM oscillation can be rescued by expressing <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY under the <italic>tim-GAL4</italic> driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b005">5</xref>]. Each of the <italic>UAS-Cry1</italic> lines partially rescued TIM cycling in fly heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Note that although TIM does not normally degrade in <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> flies, some degree of cycling is occasionally observed, as seen in this set of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, lanes 1 and 2).

        <title>Monarch CRY2, but Not PER, Represses CLOCK:CYCLE–Mediated Transcription in DpN1 Cells</title>
        <p>Having provided several lines of evidence suggesting that CRY1 functions as a photoreceptor for the butterfly clock, we next used DpN1 cells to construct the primary gear of the circadian clock, a negative transcriptional feedback loop, by examining the ability of monarch PER, TIM, CRY1, or CRY2 to inhibit monarch (dp)CLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription. Previous studies in S2 cells have shown that monarch CRY2 is a potent repressor of dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b017">17</xref>], but it has also been shown in S2 cells that both the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Antheraea pernyi</named-content> PER proteins alone potently repress <italic>Drosophila</italic> (d) CLK:dCYC–mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b029">29</xref>]. The DpN1 cell line was ideal for the current study because it allowed for the exogenously expressed monarch proteins to be examined in a homologous cell-based system. We used luciferase reporter gene assays with a reporter construct containing a tandem repeat of the proximal CACGTG E-box enhancer from the monarch <italic>per</italic> gene promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b017">17</xref>].</p>
        <p>Cotransfection of the reporter with monarch CLK and CYC caused a 100-fold increase in transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). As expected, monarch CRY2 potently inhibited dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner, yet neither monarch PER nor monarch TIM inhibited transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>A); transfected monarch PER is &gt;90% nuclear in DpN1 cells (unpublished data). The same result was found with independent PER constructs obtained from cDNA from different sources of monarch head RNA (unpublished data). Monarch PER does have the potential to inhibit transcription in other cellular contexts, because it robustly inhibited dCLK:dCYC–mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (unpublished data).</p>

            <title>CRY2 Is a Major Repressor of CLK:CYC–Mediated Transcription in DpN1 Cells</title>
            <p>(A) Monarch CRY2 inhibits dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription using luciferase reporter gene assays. The monarch butterfly <italic>per</italic> E box enhancer luciferase reporter (<italic>dpPer4Ep-Luc</italic>; 50 ng) was used in the presence (+) or absence (–) of monarch CLK/CYC expression plasmids (50 ng each). Monarch <italic>cry1</italic> (5, 15, and 50 ng), <italic>cry2</italic> (5, 15, and 50 ng), <italic>per</italic> (10, 30, and 100 ng), or <italic>tim</italic> (1, 30, and 100 ng) was used. Luciferase activity relative to β-galactosidase activity was computed. Each value is the mean ± SEM of three independent transfections. Western blot of FLAG-epitope–-tagged protein expression levels for each concentration of each construct is depicted below the graph.</p>
            <p>(B) De-repression assay showing that endogenous CRY2 inhibits dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription. The monarch <italic>per</italic> E box luciferase reporter and monarch CLOCK and CYC were co-transfected into DpN1 cells to elevate reporter activity. The ability of endogenous PER, TIM, CRY1, or CRY2 to inhibit CLK:CYC-mediated transcriptional activity was then evaluated using dsRNA directed against each RNA to determine what effect knockdown had on the levels of all four clock proteins (Western blots using PER-GP40, TIM-GP47, CRY1-GP37, or CRY2-GP51, upper panel) and whether knockdown elevated (de-repressed) luciferase activity (lower panel). The luciferase values are the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.</p>
            <p>(C) Monarch clock proteins form multimeric complexes in vivo. Brain or DpN1 extracts from ZT 18–19 were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against monarch PER (R33), TIM (R38), or CRY2 (R41). Immunocomplexes generated by each antibody were then analyzed by Western blot and probed for all three proteins (PER-GP40, TIM-GP47, and CRY2-GP51).</p>
            <p>(D) Knockdown of endogenous CRY2 abolishes the diurnal <italic>per</italic> RNA rhythm. dsRNA against monarch <italic>cry2</italic> was transfected into DpN1 cells to knock down CRY2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg009">Figure S9</xref>A), and <italic>per</italic> RNA levels were monitored at 4-h intervals over 24 h in LD. Double-stranded RNA against <italic>GFP</italic> served as the control. Relative monarch <italic>per</italic> RNA levels are depicted. Each value is mean ± SEM of three experiments. Solid line, <italic>GFP</italic> control; dashed line, CRY2 knockdown.</p>
            <p>(E) Oscillation in nuclear CRY2 abundance in DpN1 cells. Cells were entrained to LD and then fixed at 4-h intervals over 24 h in LD. The cellular localization of CRY2 was assayed by immunocytochemistry using CRY2-GP51. The cells were counterstained with SYTOX Blue to visualize the nuclei. At each time point, the localization of CRY2 in the cells was categorized as nuclear, cytoplasmic, or both nuclear and cytoplasmic. The proportion of cells at each time point in each category was calculated as the percentage of the total number of cells counted (30 per slide). Each bar represents the mean ± SEM of three experiments. Representative photomicrographs of CRY2 staining in nucleus, and in both cytoplasm and nucleus are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg009">Figure S9</xref>B.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>These data suggest that the monarch clock homologs can participate in a negative transcriptional feedback loop. A novel aspect of this feedback loop is that monarch CRY2 has the major inhibitory role for repressing dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription from a monarch <italic>per</italic> E box enhancer, while PER was ineffective (either alone or in combination with TIM or sub maximal inhibitory doses of CRY2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
        <p>Next, a repressive effect of endogenous monarch CRY2 was examined on dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription using dsRNAs to knock down endogenous clock gene expression in DpN1 cells. For one dsRNA approach, the monarch <italic>per</italic> E box luciferase reporter and monarch CLOCK and CYC were cotransfected to elevate reporter activity. The ability of endogenous PER, TIM, CRY1, or CRY2 to inhibit CLK:CYC–mediated transcriptional activity was then evaluated using dsRNA directed against each clock gene RNA to determine whether knockdown elevated (de-repressed) luciferase activity and what effect knockdown had on the levels of all four clock proteins.</p>
        <p>The luciferase value obtained with dsRNA against <italic>GFP</italic> was the control for comparison of clock protein levels and knockdown-induced de-repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 1). Double-stranded RNA directed against <italic>per</italic> caused a substantial reduction in both PER and CRY2 abundance, and luciferase activity was elevated (de-repressed) by ∼3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 2). The decrease in CRY2 abundance with dsRNA against <italic>per</italic> did not appear to be the result of a decrease in <italic>cry2</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg008">Figure S8</xref>), but was due to a post-transcriptional process, likely involving direct PER:CRY2 interactions, which protect CRY2 from degradation (see below). Double-stranded RNA against <italic>tim</italic> knocked down TIM abundance, and also caused a modest decrease in PER and CRY2 abundance, while luciferase reporter activity was elevated (de-repressed) 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 3). Double-stranded RNA against <italic>cry1</italic> substantially reduced CRY1 abundance only, and did not cause an elevation in luciferase reporter activity compared to <italic>GFP</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 4 versus lane 1). Double-stranded RNA against <italic>cry2</italic> caused a ∼70% reduction in CRY2 abundance only, while reporter activity was elevated (de-repressed) to a level comparable to the value with dsRNA against <italic>per</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 5 versus lane 2). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that endogenous CRY2 alone (not PER) is a dominant repressor of dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription in DpN1 cells. The dsRNA knockdown results are also consistent with PER stabilizing CRY2 and TIM stabilizing PER (see also the temporal order of light-induced clock protein degradation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A), and show that the de-repression following knockdown of PER or TIM is due to secondary reductions in CRY2 levels.</p>
        <p>These biochemical data suggest that TIM, PER, and CRY2 are in the same protein complex. We therefore examined endogenous protein interactions by incubating DpN1 cell or brain extracts with clock protein antisera and probing the resulting immune complexes for each of the three clock proteins by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitated PER pulled down TIM and CRY2, immunoprecipitated TIM pulled down PER and CRY2, and immunoprecipitated CRY2 pulled down PER and TIM in both DpN1 cells and in brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). These results are consistent with the existence of endogenous clock protein complexes containing PER, TIM, and CRY2. The data are also consistent with the protective protein interactions (TIM protects PER from degradation and PER protects CRY2 from degradation) suggested in previous experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).</p>
        <p>In our second dsRNA approach, dsRNA against <italic>cry2</italic> was transfected into DpN1 cells to knock down CRY2, and <italic>per</italic> RNA levels were monitored at 4-h intervals over 24 h in LD, and dsRNA against <italic>GFP</italic> served as the control. We could not use dsRNA against <italic>per</italic> for this approach, because of the secondary effect of PER knockdown decreasing CRY2 levels, as documented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes 2). With <italic>GFP</italic> dsRNA, the normal daily oscillation of <italic>per</italic> RNA in LD was clearly apparent and unaltered with high levels from ZT 20–24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). With CRY2 knockdown, on the other hand, <italic>per</italic> RNA levels remained at peak values throughout the 24-h period, with no oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg009">Figure S9</xref>A). This result confirms that endogenous CRY2 is the major repressor of dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription for this light-driven clock, because without substantial CRY2, <italic>per</italic> transcription remains constantly high over the 24-h period in LD. Moreover, the increase in PER levels with CRY2 knockdown again shows that endogenous CRY2 is the major repressor; there is no evidence for a role of PER in CRY2′s repressive ability in DpN1 cells.</p>
        <p>If CRY2 is the transcriptional repressor of the diurnal clock in DpN1 cells, then its cellular localization should change over the day, being mainly nuclear at the time of maximal repression of dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription. We thus examined the temporal profile of nuclear CRY2 in DpN1 cells and compared the time course to the normal daily rhythm in <italic>per</italic> RNA levels depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>D (solid lines), as a measure of dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcriptional readout. When the temporal profiles were examined at 4-h intervals over 24 h in LD, we found a clear daily change in the cellular location of CRY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg009">Figure S9</xref>B). The amount of CRY2 in the nucleus began to increase at ZT 16 and peaked at ZT 4, the predicted time of CRY2 maximal repression, when <italic>per</italic> RNA levels had dropped to near low values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Because the low levels of <italic>per</italic> RNA persisted with increasing time in the light period of LD (ZT 8 and 12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>D), the amount of CRY2 in the nucleus began to decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). These data show an oscillation in nuclear CRY2 abundance that is consistent with its role as the major transcriptional repressor of the light-driven clock in DpN1 cells. Perhaps in LD, only a portion of CRY2 in DpN1 cells—the portion translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus—is functionally relevant for inhibition of dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription.</p>

        <title>Monarch CRY2 Is Co-Localized with Other Clock Proteins in the PL</title>
        <p>But what about CRY2 function in the monarch brain? We first used in situ hybridization to map <italic>cry2</italic> RNA expression in the monarch brain. The brain distribution revealed RNA staining in ∼16 cells in the PI, four cells in the PL, ∼six cells in the central protocerebrum ventrally from the central body and dorsally from the oesophageal foramen, and ∼four cells in the SOG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg010">Figure S10</xref>A–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg010">S10</xref>C).

        <p>Using our newly developed monarch-specific anti-CRY2 antibodies, the anatomical location of CRY2 staining by immunocytochemistry was very similar to the RNA expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). CRY2-like immunoreactivity was detected in the cytoplasm of ∼16 cells in the PI and four cells in the PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">6</xref>C). Double labeling studies showed that the CRY2 staining was localized in the PL to the four cells that co-express corazonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">6</xref>E) and TIM. Direct comparison confirmed co-localization of CRY2 and TIM in the same four cells in the PL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg011">Figure S11</xref>). There were ∼25 CRY2-positive cells in the dorsal OL, ∼35 in the ventral OL, and ∼500 small CRY2-positive cells between the lobula and medulla and medulla and lamina. The main discrepancy between the RNA and protein patterns was that CRY2 staining was not detected in the RNA-expressing cells between the lamina and retina (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg010">Figure S10</xref>A versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

        <title>CRY2 Occurs in Nuclei of PL Cells at Appropriate Times to Repress Transcription</title>
        <p>CRY2 nuclear staining should be observed in the PL at the time of transcriptional repression. Such evidence of nuclear translocation is expected based on the transcriptional feedback loop model of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b002">2</xref>] and on what we found for CRY2 in DpN1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). Until now, we have not been able to find an obvious rhythmic nuclear accumulation of any clock protein so far examined (PER, TIM, CRY1, as well as CRY2) in the PL or in any other monarch brain region.</p>
        <p>One possible explanation for not finding nuclear clock proteins is that each protein is heavily expressed in cytoplasm of PI and PL and, by comparison, there might be a relatively small amount of functionally relevant clock protein that does cycle into the nucleus to alter transcription, as appears to occur for phosphorylated nuclear PER bound to chromatin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b028">28</xref>]. With this in mind, we initially examined CRY2 staining in thin (5 μm) sections throughout the entire monarch brain focusing on nuclear occurrence of CRY2 at 2-h intervals from ZT 18 to ZT 6, which covered seven points over the time interval in which we would expect to find CRY2 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">6</xref>H), based on our studies of DpN1 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">5</xref>E). We compared the temporal pattern of nuclear CRY2 to the <italic>per</italic> RNA rhythm in monarch brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>H, upper panel), because the <italic>per</italic> RNA rhythm is the most consistent clock gene rhythm in monarchs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), and it is the same assay we used as a transcriptional readout of dpCLK:dpCYC–mediated transcription for comparison with the temporal profile of nuclear CRY2 in DpN1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, solid line).</p>
        <p>In the PL, the nuclei are large (10 μm in diameter), and counterstaining with three specific fluorescent DNA probes revealed that these cells are unique in that most of the chromatin is distributed around the inner edge of the nuclear envelope and in small patches in the nucleus. In addition, the amount of DNA staining detected in the nucleus per se is minute, compared with nuclear staining in surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg012">Figure S12</xref>A). Nonetheless, using high-power microscopy in combination with a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, we found clear evidence of temporal control of CRY2 staining in the nucleus of PL cells, which was limited to the four cells in PL and was not found in any other CRY2-positive cells in brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">6</xref>H). Specifically, over the 12-h period of study in LD, we identified nuclear CRY2 staining at ZT 2 and 4 only; no nuclear staining was detected at ZT 18, 20, 22, 24, or ZT 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>G, left column; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>H, middle panel). The CRY2 nuclear staining in the PL co-localized with the chromatin detected in the nucleus by the DNA probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060004-sg012">Figure S12</xref>B). We next examined four time points over the circadian cycle and found CRY2 nuclear staining in PL only at CT 3, and not at CT 9, 15, or 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>G, right column; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>H, lower panel). The timing of CRY2 nuclear occurrence correlated well with the time of maximal transcriptional repression of the <italic>per</italic> RNA oscillation in monarch brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>H, upper panel), similar to the temporal profiles described in DpN1 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">5</xref>E). It is likely that CRY2 is present in the nucleus of relevant PL cells starting several hours before the peak, with the peak being what we are detecting for nuclear CRY2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">6</xref>H, based on our studies in DpN1 cells. We thus conclude that the cyclic presence of CRY2 in the nucleus of PL cells closes the circadian transcriptional feedback loop in vivo in the monarch butterfly.</p>
        <p>We also looked at 5-μm sections for PER staining in the nuclei of PL cells over the circadian cycle using an antipeptide antibody that we previously used to characterize PER staining in monarch brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>]. However, high background staining gave inconclusive results and no clear nuclear staining was detected above background at any of the Zeitgeber or clock times examined (unpublished data). Nonetheless, because of the strong evidence presented for CRY2 as a major transcriptional repressor of a clock feedback loop in monarchs (data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g005">Figure 5</xref>), the detection of temporally controlled, nuclear CRY2 in putative clock neurons in butterfly brain helps resolve a puzzle that has existed for the last 10 y of work on lepidopteran clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b031">31</xref>].</p>

        <p>The site of the sun compass in insects now appears to be the central complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b019">19</xref>]. The central complex is a midline structure consisting of the dorsally positioned protocerebral bridge and the more ventrally situated central body, which has upper and lower subdivisions. Recent studies in locusts and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that the central complex is not only a control center for motor coordination but is also the actual site of the sun compass (for polarized skylight integration from both eyes and probably all skylight information) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b018">18</xref>], as well as being involved in visual pattern learning and recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b032">32</xref>]. Finding a clock connection with the central complex in the monarch butterfly would be a major advance for beginning to understand its remarkable navigational capabilities.</p>
        <p>Both CRY2 arborizations and projections were identified in the brains of monarch butterflies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). The strongest and most dense arborization of CRY2 staining was found in the central body, just ventral from the protocerebral bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). This staining in the central complex was specific for CRY2, because staining for PER, TIM, or CRY1 was not detected in the central body. Another CRY2 arborization was found in the superior medial and lateral protocerebra, which are connected via the protocerebral bridge just above (dorsal to) the central body. In addition to these two arborizations, there are three CRY2-staining projections that could be traced. The first projection was coming from the protocerebral bridge and PI laterally toward the four cells in the PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g007">Figure 7</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g007">7</xref>E).

The third projection traveled from the superior medial protocerebrum ventrally, likely to the corpora cardiaca/corpora allata complex, because CRY2 staining was detected in both these neurohemal organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g007">Figure 7</xref>H). It appeared that the CRY2 pathways arise from cells in PL and/or PI.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>Collectively, our results provide several lines of evidence suggesting that monarch CRY1 functions in vivo as a circadian photoreceptor, whereas CRY2 functions as a transcriptional repressor for the butterfly clockwork. This novel clock mechanism has aspects of both the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse circadian clocks rolled into one, as well as unique aspects of its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g008">Figure 8</xref>A).</p>

            <title>Proposed Monarch Butterfly Circadian Clock Mechanism and CRY-Centric Clock-Compass Models</title>
            <p>(A) The main gear of the clock mechanism in pars lateralis is an autoregulatory transcription feedback loop in which CLK and CYC heterodimers drive the transcription of the <italic>per</italic>, <italic>tim</italic>, and <italic>cry2</italic> genes through E box enhancer elements; in addition to <italic>per</italic>, there are CACGTG E box elements within the 1.5-kb 5′ flanking regions of the butterfly <italic>tim</italic> and <italic>cry2</italic> genes (unpublished data). TIM (T), PER (P), and CRY2 (C2) form complexes in the cytoplasm, and CRY2 is shuttled into the nucleus where it shuts down CLK:CYC–mediated transcription. PER is progressively phosphorylated and likely helps translocate CRY2 into nucleus. CRY1 (C1) is a circadian photoreceptor, which, upon light exposure (lightning bolt), causes TIM degradation to gain access to the central clock mechanism. The thick gray arrows represent output functions for CRY1 and for CRY2.</p>
            <p>(B) Clock-compass pathways in monarch butterfly brain. A circadian clock in the PL is entrained by light acting through CRY1 expressed in clock cells (orange line). A CRY1-positive fiber pathway (orange) connects the circadian clock to axons originating from polarized UV light-sensitive photoreceptors in the dorsal rim of the compound eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b045">45</xref>]. The circadian clock also may interact directly with the sun compass (in the central complex) through a CRY2-positive fiber pathway (green) discovered in the current study. Output from the central complex ultimately controls motor output.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The CRY1-TIM pathway for light-induced resetting of the monarch clock is similar to that found in the fruit fly, and the butterfly is the only other animal, outside of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in which a photoreceptive function of CRY1 for clock entrainment has been shown in vivo. What is different between photoreceptive CRY function in fruit fly and monarch is that the cascade of protein degradation events ends with CRY2′s degradation in the butterfly, rather than with PER's, as occurs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We propose that it is the ultimate decrease in CRY2 levels that resets the CLK:CYC–driven transcriptional feedback loop in monarch butterflies (see temporal protein decay patterns in the light periods in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Then what is the function of monarch PER? We have shown that PER is important for stabilizing CRY2, and PER:CRY2 heterodimers may also be involved in translocating CRY2 into the nucleus, as occurs in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b033">33</xref>], although we could not detect PER in the nucleus of PL cells using currently available antibodies. It is also still possible that PER has a minor role in repression of CLK:CYC–mediated transcription, although the dominant repressor in monarchs is CRY2.</p>
        <p>The role of monarch CRY2 as a transcriptional repressor is similar to the role of the CRYs in the mouse clockwork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b033">33</xref>]. The existence of CRY2 and its repressive function, independent of PER, are major distinguishing features of the monarch clock mechanism from that of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY has been suggested to function in the peripheral clockwork as a transcriptional repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b036">36</xref>], but only when overexpressed with PER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b037">37</xref>], and no such clock-like function driving behavior has been detected for fruit fly CRY overexpressed within the central clock of <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b004">4</xref>]. We have been able to track monarch CRY2′s movement into the nuclei of PL cells at clock times appropriate for its role as a major transcriptional repressor of the butterfly clock feedback loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">Figure 6</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g006">6</xref>H)—no previous nuclear translocation of clock proteins has been reported in any other non-dipteran species. Our studies set the stage for more careful examination of this issue in other insects, as also suggested by a recent study in the housefly <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Musca domestica</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b038">38</xref>].</p>
        <p>It is likely that monarch CRY2 exerts its inhibitory function on transcription by directly interacting with CLK:CYC heterodimers, which can now be assessed in DpN1 cells. DpN1 cells are also an important reagent for examining CRY1 signaling mechanisms, as it is the only insect cell line reported that has all the endogenous machinery from CRY1 light sensing through the degradation of CRY2.</p>
        <p>The CRY-centric ancestral circadian clock we have defined in monarch butterflies may be common in those non-drosophilid invertebrates that express both <italic>cry1</italic> and <italic>cry2</italic>. The CRY-centric clock of the monarch may also hold a key to understanding the regulation of critical migratory behaviors, including time-compensated sun compass navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b040">40</xref>]. The relatively intense staining of the CRY proteins in cytoplasm suggests output roles for the proteins distinct from those involved in the circadian clock mechanism and its entrainment by light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Indeed, previous work has shown that a CRY1-staining neural pathway may connect the circadian clock to polarized light input entering brain that may ultimately impinge on the sun compass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g008">Figure 8</xref>B; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b013">13</xref>]).</p>
        <p>The results presented here further show that a CRY2-staining neural pathway may more directly connect the circadian clock to the central complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g008">Figure 8</xref>B), the likely site of a sun compass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b019">19</xref>], and that the pathway communicates circadian information to the sun compass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g007">Figure 7</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g007">7</xref>J). CRY2 may simply be marking a circadian pathway to the sun compass or it may be directly involved in rhythmic synaptic activity in that region. The elucidation of a novel central clock mechanism in monarch butterflies and the finding of CRY-staining neural pathways to aspects of sun compass integration provide a solid cellular, molecular, and biochemical foundation for further functional and genetic studies into the remarkable navigational capabilities of the monarch butterfly.</p>

A Western blot was probed with guinea pig anti-PER (GP40), anti-TIM (GP47), and anti-CRY2 (GP51) antibodies.</p>

        <p>Brain-suboesophageal ganglion complexes were dissected from CO<sub>2</sub> anesthetized adult monarchs and processed immediately for immunocytochemistry as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b030">30</xref>]. For examining nuclear localization of CRY2, the sections were counterstained with specific fluorescent DNA probes (DAPI, 1 μg/ml, 10 min at room temperature; Propidium iodide, 0.5 μg/ml, 10 min at room temperature; or YOYO-1 [Molecular Probes] 0.1 μM, 10 min at room temperature, respectively). Stained and mounted sections were examined using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with Nomarski (DIC) optics, epifluorescence, and a CCD camera.</p>
        <p>The following primary antibodies and their corresponding dilutions were used: TIM-R38 (1:500); TIM-GP47 (1:1,000); rabbit anti-CORAZONIN (from Makio Takeda, 1:1,000); CRY1-R31 (1:500); CRY1-GP37 (1:500); CRY2-R42 (1:200); CRY2-GP50 (1:200); and CRY2-GP51 (1:500). To visualize the primary antibody binding, the following secondary antibodies were used: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat (1:1,000); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig (1:1,000, both from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories); Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-rat (1:200); Alexa Fluor555-conjugated goat anti-rat (1:400); Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig (1:200); Alexa Fluor555-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig (1:400), Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:200); Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:200); Alexa Fluor555-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:400, all from Molecular Probes).</p>
        <p>To verify the specificity of immunological reactions, primary antibodies were replaced with normal goat serum. In an additional control of binding specificity, the anti-CORAZONIN antibody was pre-incubated with 100 molar excess of the original antigen prior to immunocytochemical staining. In all cases, no significant staining above background was observed.</p>
        <p>For scoring of immunoreactive intensities, stained sections were coded and viewed under a microscope. Levels of staining were subjectively scored with an intensity scale from 0–5. The time of collection was decoded after scoring.</p>
        <p>For immunocytochemistry of CRY2 location in DpN1 cells, cells were seeded on cover slips and entrained in LD at 28 °C for 2 d. The cells were fixed at the times indicated. The cellular localization of CRY2 was assayed by immunocytochemistry using anti-CRY2 (GP51) antibody and Alexa594 conjugated anti–guinea pig secondary antibody (Invitrogen). The cells were also stained with SYTOX Blue (Invitrogen) to visualize the nucleus.</p>

        <p>For light pulse/phase shift experiments, 16 males per genotype per light pulse were entrained in 12:12 LD for three full days in 120–220 lux before receiving a 1-h light pulse at 1,000–1,400 lux (for CRY1 experiments) or 1,200–1,600 lux (for CRY2 experiments) at ZT 15 or ZT 21. [This small difference in light intensities between these two experiments was unfortunately unavoidable; we were unable to use the same incubator for both experiments, and there are enormous technical challenges in producing equivalent lux readings between incubators. Both of these experiments were performed at saturating light intensities and, thus, this difference should not affect the results.] A “no-pulse” control group was also included. Flies were then placed in DD for 6 d. Data were collected using the TriKinetics Drosophila Activity Monitor (DAM) system. To identify and exclude arrhythmic flies, 5 d of activity in DD were analyzed starting 12 h after the last “lights off” using the Fly Activity Analysis Suite (FaasX) CYCLE_P software (Michel Boudinot; <email xlink:type="simple">michel.boudinot@iaf.cnrs-gif.fr</email>) under the following parameters: no filter for high frequencies, chi-square significance 0.01. Matlab with the Signal Processing Toolbox and the FlyToolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b043">43</xref>] was used to plot behavior peaks of pulsed versus nonpulsed flies. Phase shifts were determined for each genotype by taking the average delay or advance of the three peaks of activity after the light pulse. The first peak of activity directly after the light pulse was not included in the average.</p>
        <p>For Western blot samples, eight males and eight females per sample were entrained in 12:12 LD for at least two full days before collecting on dry ice. Frozen fly heads were collected into Eppendorf tubes and homogenized in 30 μl lysis buffer [150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.5% NP40, 100 mM NaF, Complete Protease Inhibitor Tablet (Roche)] with Kontes pestles. After centrifugation, 25 μl of the homogenate was transferred to fresh tubes. Protein concentrations were normalized by Coomassie Reagent (Pierce), and either 5 or 10 μg of protein was loaded per lane (depending on well size). Tubulin and dTIM/dpCRY2 were separated on the same gel and the filter cut at 75kDa. Primary antibodies were rat anti-dTIM (1:5,000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b006">6</xref>], and monoclonal mouse anti-Alpha Tubulin (Sigma) (1:8,000 or 1:16,000). Secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz) were goat anti-rat IgG HRP conjugated, goat anti-guinea pig IgG HRP conjugated, and goat anti-mouse IgG2a HRP conjugated. Films and chemiluminescent blots were imaged with the FUJIFILM LAS-1000, and bands were quantified using the ImageGauge V4.22 software.</p>

          <title>CRY1 and TIM Responses to Light after 48 h in DD</title>
          <p>(A) Clock protein abundance in DpN1 cells changes in response to light after prolonged exposure to dark. DpN1 cells were cultured for 48 h under DD and then exposed to light for 540 min. Cells were collected at the designated times. Cell homogenates were analyzed by Western blot and probed for CRY1 (GP37), TIM (GP47), PER (GP40), and CRY2 (GP51) (upper panel). The time courses of declines were quantitated by chemiluminescence, and band intensity was normalized against α-tubulin (lower panel). Time 0 is before lights on.</p>
          <p>(B) Effects of inhibitors on the light-induced decrease in CRY1 and TIM. Cells were pretreated with DMSO (the vehicle control, left), MG115 (final concentration of 40 μM in DMSO) for 2 h prior to light exposure (center), or GSK-3β inhibitor VIII (final concentration 20 μM in DMSO) for 2 h prior to light exposure (right). CRY1 abundance (GP37) and TIM abundance (GP47) were monitored by probing Western blots of cells collected at the designated times during the 120-min light exposure.</p>
          <p>(C) CRY1 mediates light-induced TIM degradation in DpN1 cells. Cells were pretreated with dsRNA against <italic>GFP</italic> (left), <italic>cry1</italic> (center), or <italic>tim</italic> (right) prior to light exposure. CRY1 abundance (GP37) and TIM abundance (GP47) were monitored by probing Western blots of cells collected at the designated times during the 120-min light exposure.</p>
          <p><bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> We found a light-induced decrease in CRY1 in untreated DpN1 cells after culturing the cells for 48 h in DD. Once lights were turned on after 48 h in DD, there was a rapid decrease in CRY1 and TIM, followed by a slower decrease in PER, followed by a decrease in CRY2(A), similar to the temporal cascade of protein decrements found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060004-g002">Figure 2</xref>. The delayed decrease in both PER and CRY2 abundance after light exposure was not due to accelerated protein synthesis, relative to CRY1 and TIM, because the same temporal sequence of declining protein accumulation was found following treatment of the cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prior to light exposure (unpublished data).</p>
          <p>The light-induced decrease in both CRY1 and TIM was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG115, showing that the decrease in CRY1 is mediated by proteosomal degradation (B, center), as occurs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060004-b010">10</xref>]. The lack of light-induced decrease in TIM with MG115 treatment was also likely due to lack of proteasomal degradation of TIM itself, as the decrease in TIM by light is not necessarily accompanied by a decrease in CRY1. In fact, the GSK-3β inhibitor VIII blocked the light-induced decrease in CRY1, but <italic>did not</italic> inhibit TIM's degradation by light (B, right). These data, along with the dsRNA data (C, center) show that CRY1 can mediate light-induced TIM degradation, with or without inducing its own degradation. The results further suggest the involvement of a GSK-3β-like kinase in the degradation of monarch CRY1 by light.</p>
          <p>Using dsRNA, we showed that the light-induced decrease in TIM after 48 h in DD is also mediated through CRY1 (C). Pretreatment of cells with dsRNA targeting <italic>cry1</italic> prior to turning the lights on caused a substantial (70%) reduction in CRY1 in darkness just prior to light exposure (time 0) and greatly reduced the decrease in TIM abundance in response to light, compared to controls (cells treated with dsRNA against <italic>GFP</italic>). Double stranded RNA targeting <italic>tim</italic> reduced TIM abundance prior to and throughout light exposure, but did not deter CRY1′s rapid decrease following lights on. Collectively, the data show that CRY1 mediates the light-induced decrease in TIM in DpN1 cells, with or without inducing CRY1′s own degradation.</p>

          <p>(A) Photomicrograph of a region near the PL stained with the nuclear stain propidium iodide. Arrows denote patchy nuclear staining in two CRY2-positive cells (two arrows for each cell), whereas arrowheads denote intense nuclear staining in surrounding cells.</p>
          <p>(B) Nuclear CRY2 is co-localized with chromatin in the PL. The section (5 μm) was taken from a brain collected at ZT4. The section was stained for CRY2 (CRY2-R42; left) and counterstained with propidium iodide (middle); the staining in cytoplasm is due to overexposure to amplify the low intensity of nuclear staining. The merged image (right) shows co-localization (arrows)</p>
