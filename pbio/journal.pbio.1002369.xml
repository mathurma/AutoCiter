<abstract>
<p>Faithful meiotic chromosome segregation and fertility require meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes rather than the equally available sister chromatid, a bias that in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> depends on the meiotic kinase, Mek1. Mek1 is thought to mediate repair template bias by specifically suppressing sister-directed repair. Instead, we found that when Mek1 persists on closely paired (synapsed) homologues, DNA repair is severely delayed, suggesting that Mek1 suppresses any proximal repair template. Accordingly, Mek1 is excluded from synapsed homologues in wild-type cells. Exclusion requires the AAA<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Pch2 and is directly coupled to synaptonemal complex assembly. Stage-specific depletion experiments further demonstrate that DNA repair in the context of synapsed homologues requires Rad54, a repair factor inhibited by Mek1. These data indicate that the sister template is distinguished from the homologue primarily by its closer proximity to inhibitory Mek1 activity. We propose that once pairing or synapsis juxtaposes homologues, exclusion of Mek1 is necessary to avoid suppression of all templates and accelerate repair progression.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chromosome segregation errors during meiosis may cause infertility, fetal loss, or birth defects. To avoid meiotic chromosome segregation errors, recombination-mediated linkages are established between previously unattached homologous chromosomes. Such recombination events initiate with breaks in the DNA, but how these breaks are preferentially repaired using the distal homologous chromosome, rather than the physically more proximal sister chromatid of similar sequence, is not well understood. Meiotic repair-template bias in the budding yeast depends on the function of Mek1, a meiosis-specific protein kinase. Previous models suggested that Mek1 activity creates repair-template bias by suppressing repair with the sister chromatid. We found that Mek1 localizes on meiotic chromosomes until the homologues pair and closely align. Removal of Mek1 requires the assembly of a conserved zipper-like structure between meiotic chromosomes, known as the synaptonemal complex. DNA break repair is delayed in mutants in which Mek1 persists on closely aligned homologues. These findings suggest that persistent Mek1 activity can suppress repair from all templates, and that one function of the synaptonemal complex is to remove this activity from chromosomes. Our findings build on previous models to propose that Mek1 activity creates a local zone of repair suppression that is normally avoided by the spatially distant homologous chromosome to promote repair-template bias.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division that produces haploid gametes from diploid progenitors and is essential for sexual reproduction. The reduction in ploidy is achieved by a unique chromosome division phase (meiosis I) that segregates homologous chromosomes (homologues). Errors in this process are a leading cause of infertility, miscarriages, and birth defects in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref001">1</xref>]. Proper meiosis I chromosome segregation in most organisms requires that each homologue pair be linked by at least one crossover. Crossover formation occurs during the extended prophase preceding meiosis I and is promoted by the programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Resection of these breaks exposes single-stranded DNA tails that invade a donor template for repair. A subset of strand-invasion reactions subsequently matures to form double Holliday junctions, which are generally resolved as crossovers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>To promote linkages between homologues, meiotic DSB repair is strongly biased toward using the homologue rather than the physically more proximal sister chromatid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref004">4</xref>]. Available evidence, stemming mostly from studies in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, suggests that homologue bias results primarily from suppression of repair from the sister template. In yeast, this barrier to sister repair is mediated to a large extent by the chromosomal kinase Mek1, a meiosis-specific orthologue of mammalian CHK2 kinase that is recruited to the axial element structures of meiotic chromosomes upon DSB formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref005">5</xref>]. Mek1 recruitment requires the phosphorylation of the chromosome axis protein Hop1 on threonine 318 (T318) by the checkpoint kinases Mec1 (ATR) and Tel1 (ATM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref006">6</xref>]. Chromosomal recruitment leads to the dimerization and activation of Mek1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref007">7</xref>]. Mek1, in turn, phosphorylates a variety of targets, including the repair factors Rad54 and Rdh54, as well as histone H3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref009">9</xref>]. Phosphorylation of Rad54 inhibits its interactions with the recombinase Rad51 and is thought to help suppress sister-targeted repair along with additional Mek1 targets that remain to be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref008">8</xref>]. In addition, Rad51 is kept inactive by its meiosis-specific inhibitor Hed1, which further biases repair towards the homologue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref012">12</xref>]. Current models suggest that a DNA “tentacle” formed by the assembly of Rad51 and the meiotic recombinase Dmc1 on one end of a DSB interprets the suppressive signal established by Mek1, leading to preferred repair engagement with the homologue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>For homologue bias to be established, the DSB repair machinery must be able to distinguish homologue and sister templates. A probable mechanism included implicitly or explicitly in many models of homologue bias is that the sister chromatid is identified either by spatial proximity and/or through the cohesive linkages resulting from DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref015">15</xref>]. As a result, the sister is subject to Mek1-dependent repair suppression, whereas the generally spatially more distant or unlinked homologue is not. An extension of the spatial proximity model is that if the homologue were to be transported within the range of Mek1 activity, it would also become suppressed as a template. Indeed, experimental hyperactivation of Mek1 also delays interhomologue repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref016">16</xref>], suggesting that Mek1-dependent repair suppression does not inherently distinguish between sister chromatids and homologous chromosomes.</p>
<p>The close alignment of homologous chromosomes is an essential part of meiotic prophase that in many organisms culminates in the assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC). The SC is a conserved tripartite structure that assembles along the entire length of paired homologues during meiotic prophase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref017">17</xref>]. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, SC assembly (synapsis) initiates at sites of crossover designation and centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref020">20</xref>] and involves the progressive deposition of Zip1, an extended coiled-coil protein that aligns homologous chromosomes at a fixed distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref021">21</xref>]. The function of the SC remains obscure. The SC is thought to stabilize pairing interactions, but homologues often remain co-aligned, albeit at a greater distance, in the absence of Zip1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref022">22</xref>]. Recent experiments have hinted at a signaling role for the SC. In several organisms, SC assembly is associated with a loss of chromosomal proteins, most notably yeast Hop1 and the orthologous HORMAD proteins in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref026">26</xref>], as well as the yeast DSB regulators Rec114 and Mei4, which require Hop1 for recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref029">29</xref>]. As DSB levels are elevated in SC mutants, these observations have led to the model that the SC acts as a feedback signal to suppress DSB formation on chromosomes that have engaged in crossover repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref030">30</xref>], although some evidence suggests that this suppression is not absolute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref032">32</xref>]. Given that Mek1 recruitment also depends on chromosomal Hop1, the synapsis-associated loss of Hop1 would also be expected to affect Mek1 binding. Unexpectedly, however, Mek1 was reported to persist on synapsed chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we reinvestigated the chromosomal dynamics of Mek1 and its role in regulating meiotic DSB repair. We demonstrate that Mek1 is in fact eliminated from synapsing chromosomes and that removal requires Zip1-mediated recruitment of the AAA<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Pch2. Moreover, we show that DSB repair on synapsed chromosomes requires the function of Rad54, a target of Mek1-dependent inhibition. Importantly, failure to remove Mek1 from synapsed chromosomes leads to delays in DSB repair, indicating that Mek1 must be inactivated on fully engaged chromosomes to ensure timely completion of meiotic DSB repair.</p>

<title>The SC Restricts Recruitment of Mek1</title>
<p>To investigate the dynamics of Mek1 binding to meiotic chromosomes, we analyzed chromosome spreads using a functional Mek1-GFP construct. Nuclei were staged based on the progressive deposition of Zip1, marking the assembly of the SC along meiotic chromosomes. An <italic>NDT80</italic> deletion was used to prevent SC disassembly and Mek1 degradation due to exit from meiotic prophase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref034">34</xref>]. Mek1 foci were abundant on chromosomes prior to the association of Zip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). However, in contrast to a previous report, which detected many apparent Mek1 foci on synapsed chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref033">33</xref>], we observed a notable loss of chromosomal Mek1 from regions of extended Zip1 staining, such that Mek1-GFP foci were nearly undetectable when all chromosomes had assembled an SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but may be related to differences in strain background. The loss of chromosomal Mek1 signal was confirmed using a polyclonal antibody against Mek1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s002">S1A Fig</xref>), and was not due to a drop in Mek1 protein levels during meiotic prophase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref034">34</xref>]. Examination of nuclei with partially assembled SC indicated that the disappearance of Mek1 foci was directly correlated with SC deposition even on individual chromosomes. As SC formation is relatively rapid in wild-type cells, we confirmed this observation in a <italic>zip3Δ</italic> mutant, in which chromosome synapsis is delayed and limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref020">20</xref>]. Like in the wild-type situation, Mek1-GFP signal was strongly reduced in synapsed regions but persisted on unsynapsed chromosomes in a <italic>zip3Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). These data indicate that chromosome synapsis coincides with a loss of chromosomal Mek1.</p>

<p>The disappearance of Mek1 from chromosomes was mirrored by a loss of Mek1-dependent chromatin marks. Phosphorylation of histone H3 T11 requires Mek1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref009">9</xref>]. Immunostaining using an antibody specific for H3-pT11 revealed numerous foci on unsynapsed chromosomes but a near complete absence once chromosomes were synapsed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), implying that Mek1 is not active on synapsed chromosomes. To support this observation, we analyzed H3-pT11 by western blotting in a meiotic time course. Cells were blocked at the end of prophase using an <italic>ndt80Δ</italic> mutation to avoid secondary effects from Mek1 inactivation after prophase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref039">39</xref>]. H3-pT11 first became detectable at 3 h after meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), corresponding to the time of DSB induction. This timing correlated well with the phosphorylation of other meiotic checkpoint targets, including Zip1, Zip3 and Sae2. H2A-pS129 accumulated earlier presumably because of its role in premeiotic DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref040">40</xref>]. Consistent with the analysis of chromosome spreads, H3-pT11 signal disappeared 5 h after meiotic induction, when most cells in the culture were completing SC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). The disappearance of H3-pT11 is in contrast to the other tested checkpoint targets, which remained phosphorylated during SC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the SC-associated loss of Mek1 appeared to occur irrespective of persistent DNA repair intermediates. <italic>zip3Δ</italic> mutants are severely defective in DSB repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref041">41</xref>] and accumulate abundant repair foci marked by the Rad51 recombinase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s002">S1B Fig</xref>). However, whereas Mek1 signal was largely restricted to unsynapsed regions in <italic>zip3Δ</italic> mutants, Rad51 foci were abundantly detectable on both unsynapsed and synapsed chromosomes. These data indicate that, at least in the absence of <italic>ZIP3</italic>, completed chromosomal DNA repair is not a prerequisite for the loss of Mek1 from synapsed chromosomes.</p>
<p>To test whether the SC is responsible for the loss of Mek1, we removed Zip1 from meiotic chromosomes. To circumvent potential pleiotropic effects of earlier roles of Zip1 in centromere pairing and DSB repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref042">42</xref>], we used the “anchor-away” technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref037">37</xref>] to conditionally deplete Zip1 from chromosomes that had already assembled SCs. In this technique, proteins tagged with the FRB domain of human mTOR are actively depleted from the nucleus after rapamycin addition due to interaction with a cytoplasmic anchor (a ribosomal protein fused to FKBP12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Zip1 was quantitatively depleted from meiotic chromosomes within 2 h of rapamycin addition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s002">S1C Fig</xref>). Nuclear depletion of Zip1-FRB throughout meiosis caused defects in sporulation and spore viability approximating the <italic>zip1Δ</italic> mutant, whereas untagged control strains treated with rapamycin retained wild-type spore viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s010">S1A and S1B Table</xref>). Strikingly, specific removal of Zip1 starting at the 6 h time point, when the vast majority of nuclei have fully synapsed chromosomes, caused rapid reaccumulation of Mek1 on chromosomes (17/20 nuclei; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). We conclude that Zip1 assembly on chromosomes promotes the removal of Mek1 and is required to maintain Mek1 exclusion from synapsed chromosomes.</p>

<title>Mek1 Loss Is Linked to the Chromosomal Elimination of the Hop1-pT318 Epitope</title>
<p>Chromosomal recruitment and activation of Mek1 requires the phosphorylation of Hop1-T318 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref006">6</xref>], which may be subject to Zip1-dependent regulation.

<title>Hop1-pT318 and Mek1 Persist on Synapsed Chromosomes When Pch2 Is Absent</title>

<p>The persistence of Hop1 on synapsed chromosomes in the <italic>pch2Δ</italic> mutant is associated with unusually distinct parallel tracts of DAPI-stained chromatin along the lengths of chromosomes, a conformation only occasionally observed in short stretches on synapsed wild-type chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g003">Fig 3F</xref>).

<title>A Non-null Mutation of <italic>ZIP1</italic> Uncouples Chromosome Synapsis and Removal of Mek1</title>
<p>Our data suggest that removal of Mek1 depends on a Pch2-associated function during synapsis. Further analysis identified a non-null allele of <italic>ZIP1</italic> that assembles SC but fails to recruit Pch2 to synapsed chromosomes. Cells lacking a leucine-zipper in the coiled-coil region of Zip1 (<italic>zip1-4LA</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref045">45</xref>] exhibited overall wild-type SC structure but lost all SC-associated Pch2 staining (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g003">3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s004">S3D–S3F</xref>).

<title>PP4 Contributes to the Loss of Chromosomal Hop1-pT318</title>
<p>We investigated whether the SC-associated loss of Hop1-pT318 is mediated by dephosphorylation in addition to Hop1 removal. PP4 protein phosphatase, comprising the catalytic subunit Pph3 and the cofactor Psy2, negatively regulates Hop1 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref046">46</xref>]. To specifically interrogate the role of PP4 in Hop1 dephosphorylation during chromosome synapsis, we conditionally depleted the PP4-cofactor Psy2-FRB by anchor-away at the time of full synapsis. Nuclear depletion of Psy2 caused a modest accumulation of Hop1-pT318 signal in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and an increase in Hop1-pT318 focus number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), indicating that PP4 contributes to the removal of Hop1-pT318. Unlike in <italic>pch2Δ</italic> mutants, the increases in Hop1-pT318 signal were not associated with an increase in chromosomal Hop1 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s005">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). We do note, however, that the Hop1-pT318 signals often appeared at sites of discontinuity in Zip1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), perhaps reflecting sites where Hop1 persists on synapsed chromosomes.

<p>The reappearance of Hop1-pT318 foci upon PP4 depletion also presented a puzzle, as it implied an increasing number of unrepaired DSBs on synapsed chromosomes. DSB formation, a prerequisite for Hop1 phosphorylation and Mek1 recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref047">47</xref>], is thought to be largely shut down upon homologue engagement and synapsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref049">49</xref>], although several groups have reported continued presence of DSBs in <italic>ndt80</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref032">32</xref>]. To test for the presence of unrepaired DSBs, we analyzed Rad51 focus number upon Psy2-FRB depletion. Nuclei with fully synapsed chromosomes displayed very few Rad51 foci when Psy2 was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). By contrast, Psy2-FRB depletion led to a significant increase in Rad51 focus number on synapsed chromosomes that matched Hop1-pT318 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), suggesting an increased presence of DSBs. The accumulating Rad51 foci may reflect DSB repair intermediates that became destabilized upon PP4 depletion. Alternatively, they may represent continued DSB formation on synapsed chromosomes in the absence of PP4 activity. This latter possibility would imply that DSB formation continues on synapsed chromosomes.</p>

<title>Zip1 Removal Reveals that DSBs Continue to Form on Post-synapsis Chromatin</title>
<p>To begin to distinguish between these possibilities, we first asked whether DSB formation can be restored upon removal of the SC, which would indicate that DSB suppression associated with synapsis is reversible. We depleted Zip1-FRB by anchor-away and used immunofluorescence analysis of Rad51 to monitor DSB levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Zip1 depletion led to a significant increase in steady-state focus number of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). This effect is not observed in untagged control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s006">S5A Fig</xref>) and is mirrored by an increase in steady-state focus numbers of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s006">S5B Fig</xref>).

This outcome was not due to non-specific disruption of Mer2 by the FRB tag, because Mer2-FRB strains accumulated near wild-type levels of Rad51 foci prior to synapsis and produced fully viable spores in the absence of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s006">S5C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s010">S1A and S1B Table</xref>).

<p>We used physical assays at several endogenous DSB hotspots to monitor the occurrence of new DSBs upon depletion of Zip1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref050">50</xref>]. Electrophoretic separation of restriction-digested genomic DNA followed by Southern analysis allows detection of the larger unbroken DNA (parental size) as well as the faster migrating DSB fragments. DSB fragments reappeared at the <italic>ERG1</italic> hotspot in the <italic>ZIP1-FRB</italic> strain but not in the untagged control strain following rapamycin addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). These DSBs were absent when Mer2 was co-depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s007">S6A Fig</xref>), indicating that they represent newly formed DSBs and are not the result of destabilized repair intermediates. DSB signal may be further increased due to the loss of Zip1 repair functions upon depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref042">42</xref>]. A similar increase in DSBs was also observed at the <italic>YIL094c</italic> hotspot after Zip1 nuclear depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s007">S6B Fig</xref>). However, Zip1 nuclear depletion did not lead to significant DSB reappearance at the <italic>YGR279c</italic> or the <italic>YCR047c</italic> hotspot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s007">S6E Fig</xref>). Thus, although the increase in DSBs after Zip1 nuclear depletion is consistent with the notion that Zip1 prevents the formation of new DSBs on fully synapsed chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref030">30</xref>], our data suggest that this suppression may occur in a locus-specific manner. We note that following Zip1 depletion, the DSB bands at several hotspots migrated at a higher molecular weight than DSB fragments observed in early prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s007">S6B–S6D Fig</xref>), suggesting that processing of DSB ends is altered in this situation.</p>

<title>Ongoing DSB Formation on Synapsed Chromatin Is Rapidly Processed by Rad54</title>
<p>Given that depletion of PP4 led to an increase in Rad51 foci even in the presence of Zip1 and that previous studies have reported continued presence of DSBs in <italic>ndt80</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref032">32</xref>], we asked whether some DSB formation is maintained when chromosomes appear fully synapsed in late prophase. To test this possibility, we depleted DSB repair factors from synapsed chromosomes to trap newly formed DSBs. We chose Rad54, which promotes Rad51-dependent DSB repair, and Rdh54, a Rad54-like protein that activates the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1. Dmc1 and Rdh54 are required for homologue-directed repair in meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref052">52</xref>], whereas Rad54 is inhibited by Mek1 to suppress intersister repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref008">8</xref>]. We reasoned since Mek1 is nearly absent on synapsed chromosomes, Rad54 may become active in this situation. We used anchor-away to deplete Rdh54-FRB and Rad54-FRB from synapsed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>). No increase in Rad51 focus number was observed upon removal of Rdh54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5H</xref>), although nuclear depletion of Rdh54-FRB throughout meiosis caused an expected reduction in sporulation efficiency, indicating effective depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s010">S1A Table</xref>). By contrast, Rad54 removal led to a strong increase in Rad51 focus number on synapsed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>). Although this finding may indicate that DSB formation continues on synapsed chromosomes, previous studies indicated that Rad51 also associates with undamaged DNA in the absence of Rad54 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref053">53</xref>]. To address this possibility, we co-depleted a DSB-cofactor Mer2 or the DSB-inducing enzyme Spo11 with Rad54-FRB. Co-depletion of either factor significantly reduced Rad51 focus formation on synapsed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). These data strongly suggest that DSB formation continues even when chromosomes appear fully synapsed, and that DSB turnover depends on Rad54.</p>
<p>Southern analysis indicated that DSB accumulation on synapsed chromosomes upon Rad54 depletion is locus-dependent. The accumulation of unrepaired DSBs was apparent at the <italic>YGR279c</italic> and <italic>YCR047c</italic> DSB hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s007">S6D–S6F Fig</xref>), whereas the DSB signal at the <italic>YIL094c</italic> and <italic>ERG1</italic> hotspots did not increase substantially above background (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">5D, 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s007">S6B</xref>). Interestingly, these patterns of DSB accumulation are opposite to the patterns observed upon Zip1 depletion (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">5D–5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s007">S6D–S6F</xref>). Thus, these differences may reflect the varying propensities of different genomic regions to synapse or differential dependence on <italic>ZIP1</italic> function for DSB repair. Alternatively, individual hotspots may differ in their dependence on Hop1/Mek1 for DSB formation and/or repair. In contrast to the slower-migrating DSB fragments after nuclear depletion of Zip1, the DSB fragments that appeared at the <italic>YGR279c</italic> and the <italic>YCR047c</italic> locus after nuclear depletion of Rad54 were faster migrating compared to DSBs in early prophase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s007">S6D and S6F Fig</xref>; compare DSB pattern at T = 3 h to rapamycin-treated sample in Rad54-FRB). This migration pattern is consistent with hyperresection of DSBs ends and is typically observed when strand-invasion activity is blocked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the accumulation of Rad51 foci in Rad54-depleted nuclei, we observed no defect in SC structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">Fig 5G</xref>) and no increase in Hop1-pT318 focus number, overall Hop1 phosphorylation, or total chromosomal Hop1 signal upon Rad54 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s008">S7A–S7C Fig</xref>). This behavior is in stark contrast to the commensurate increase in Rad51 and Hop1-pT318 foci upon depletion of Zip1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g002">2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g005">5A and 5B</xref>) or PP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). These observations support the model that Zip1-dependent Hop1 removal and PP4 activity collaborate to prevent Hop1-T318 phosphorylation on synapsed chromosomes. We conclude that unrepaired DSBs do not lead to Mek1 recruitment when chromosomes appear fully synapsed.</p>

<title>Mek1 Suppresses DSB Repair between Closely Engaged Chromosomes</title>
<p>The loss of Mek1 activity upon SC formation suggests that DSB repair on already synapsed chromosomes may not be constrained by homologue bias. To test this possibility, we investigated the formation of intersister (IS) and interhomologue (IH) double Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediates over time in <italic>ndt80Δ</italic> mutants at two DSB loci, <italic>HIS4-LEU2</italic> and <italic>GAT1</italic>. Engineered restriction site polymorphisms surrounding these DSB sites permit the separation of IS and IH repair intermediates by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref055">55</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). As <italic>ndt80Δ</italic> mutants accumulate unresolved dHJs, analysis of IS and IH dHJs at a given time point will provide the cumulative average of template bias up until that time point. Analysis of the <italic>HIS4-LEU2</italic> hotspot revealed a strong IH bias that persisted over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s009">S8A Fig</xref>), consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref056">56</xref>]. <italic>GAT1</italic> reproducibly exhibited a weaker IH bias (IH:IS ~1.5:1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s009">S8B Fig</xref>) than other strong DSB hotspots (IH:IS ~4:1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref056">56</xref>], but still substantially higher than the IH:IS ~1:9 template bias observed for mitotic DSB repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref057">57</xref>]. Notably, the cumulative IH:IS ratio at <italic>GAT1</italic> became progressively lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s009">S8B Fig</xref>) consistent with decreased IH bias at later time points. These data support the notion that, at least at the <italic>GAT1</italic> locus, meiotic repair constraints are relaxed after chromosomes are fully synapsed. Because technical difficulties precluded us from analyzing IH bias at additional loci, we do not know to what extent this effect extends to other DSB hotspots.</p>

<p>A major mechanism of establishing homologue bias is to make repair from the sister chromatid more difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref058">58</xref>]. One conceptually simple way to achieve this goal is to establish a Mek1-dependent “zone” of repair suppression, such that spatially proximal sequences (i.e., the sister) cannot easily be used as repair templates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref013">13</xref>]. If so, then removal of Mek1 may be necessary once chromosomes are aligned, as alignment would also place the homologue in this zone of repair suppression, thereby rendering repair from all templates equally difficult (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This model predicts that unrepaired DSBs should accumulate in cells that fail to remove Mek1 from synapsed chromosomes. Indeed, we observed an accumulation of Rad51 foci on fully synapsed chromosomes of <italic>pch2Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Rad51 accumulation occurred independently of the <italic>ndt80Δ</italic>-mediated prophase arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002369.s009">S8C Fig</xref>) and is consistent with previous observations showing a delay in DSB repair in these mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref059">59</xref>]. To test whether the increased Rad51 foci on synapsed chromosomes are due to the persistence of Mek1 activity, we used an allele of Mek1 (<italic>mek1-as</italic>) that can be conditionally inactivated upon addition of a small molecule inhibitor (1-NA-PP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref060">60</xref>]. Addition of the inhibitor after chromosomes were synapsed led to the disappearance of Rad51 foci in <italic>pch2Δ mek1-as</italic> mutants, whereas the foci persisted in untreated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>), suggesting rapid repair of DSBs once Mek1 was inactivated.</p>

<p>Synapsis initiates at crossover-designated sites and centromeres (not depicted) and propagates along chromosomes to remove Hop1 and Mek1 in a chromosome-autonomous manner.

In a <italic>pch2</italic> mutant, chromosomal Mek1 activity persists and creates local repair constraints on all available templates, thereby causing a delay in DSB repair progression.</p>

<p>To confirm these results, we performed Southern analysis at the <italic>ERG1</italic> and <italic>YCR047c</italic> DSB hotspots.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we used stage-specific depletion experiments to investigate the function of chromosome axis proteins and the SC in controlling meiotic DNA-repair signaling by Mek1 kinase. Our data suggest that Mek1 activity, while being essential for establishing meiotic repair template bias, creates a problem for DSB repair when all templates are in close proximity. We show that the SC transverse filament protein, Zip1, promotes Pch2-mediated exclusion of Mek1 from fully paired chromosomes. We further show that the ectopic presence of Mek1 on synapsed chromosomes prevents DSBs from undergoing Rad54-mediated turnover. Thus, by promoting the removal of Mek1, the assembly of Zip1 into SC structure can directly modulate DSB repair pathways. The chromosome-autonomous nature of SC assembly provides an obvious means to differentially control this process between chromosomes.</p>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>A Model for Repair Template Selection</title>
<p>For repair template bias to be established, cells must be able to distinguish sister chromatids from homologous chromosomes. Our data point to a simple mechanism, whereby the primary determinant distinguishing sister from homologue is the spatial distance of the respective template from DSB-associated Mek1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This model is in line with current models of template choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref015">15</xref>], which propose that a Mek1-dependent inhibitory domain suppresses repair progression from the proximal sister template, while the generally more distant homologue escapes this suppression. It is further supported by the observation that hyperactivation of Mek1 also delays interhomologue repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref016">16</xref>]. We argue, however, that a consequence of this simple setup is that once homologous chromosomes pair and establish close juxtaposition, Mek1 must be inactivated, so as not to place the homologue in the inhibitory domain and thus render all possible repair templates unfavorable. The stochastic nature of chromosome pairing would require this inactivation to be coupled to the behavior of individual chromosomes.</p>
<p>One prediction emerging from this model is that Mek1 activity along chromosomes must be spatially and temporally restricted, a notion supported by our experiments. In addition, Mek1 recruitment must be dynamic, as the genomic distribution of DSBs varies from cell to cell. Accordingly, Hop1 distribution is highly stereotyped and DSB-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref027">27</xref>], whereas Mek1 recruitment is coupled to DSB induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>The model that Mek1-dependent suppression of DSB repair is not inherently selective for the sister can also explain why DSBs persist in <italic>pch2Δ</italic> mutants. Chromosome pairing is unaffected in <italic>pch2Δ</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref043">43</xref>], implying functional interhomologue repair interactions. However, repair completion may be suppressed because Mek1 activity persists on these chromosomes. This model may also explain why both crossover and non-crossover formation is delayed in <italic>pch2Δ</italic> mutants while the formation of single-end invasion intermediates occurs with wild-type kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref044">44</xref>]. Mek1 has been suggested to promote homologue bias in part by sequestering one DSB end in a quiescent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref061">61</xref>]. Perhaps persistent Mek1 activity hinders use of the sequestered end for completion of repair, thereby equally affecting crossover and non-crossover repair. Alternatively, the SC structure may create a situation that renders interhomologue repair structurally difficult, while Mek1 activity hinders repair with the sister template in <italic>pch2Δ</italic> mutants. Intriguingly, despite the severe repair delay, <italic>pch2Δ</italic> mutants display a wild-type level of spore viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref050">50</xref>]. This result implies that Mek1 suppression of DSB repair can be overcome with time and supports the notion that meiotic template choice is not absolute but rather the consequence of a kinetic barrier to repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>We speculate that the presence of Mek1 may also contribute to the accumulation of Rad51 foci when PP4 or Zip1 are depleted from synapsed chromosomes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g003">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g004">4A</xref>). In both experiments, Mek1 was bound to chromosomes that were allowed to fully pair prior to experimental manipulation (Zip1-FRB, Psy2-FRB), creating a situation similar to what is observed in <italic>pch2Δ</italic> mutants. Thus, although PP4 and Zip1 clearly have additional roles in recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref042">42</xref>], the presence of Mek1 may further impair DSB turnover in these situations.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>An SC-Mediated Switch in Repair Constraints</title>
<p>The loss of Mek1 upon chromosome synapsis implies that meiotic repair constraints become progressively relaxed at late stages of meiotic prophase, such that repair perhaps transitions into a mitotic-like state. One likely consequence of this transition is that at least some of the DSB repair on synapsed chromosomes depends on the mitotic DSB repair factor Rad54, which presumably promotes Rad51-dependent repair. Moreover, as Rad54 activity mediates the disassembly of Rad51 filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref062">62</xref>], it may also promote release of the second DSB end, which is thought to be held in a quiescent state by Rad51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref014">14</xref>]. The loss of Hop1 and Mek1 from synapsed chromosomes may also cause a down-regulation of Dmc1 activity, as Dmc1 no longer promotes meiotic DSB repair in the absence of either Hop1 or Mek1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref014">14</xref>]. Such loss of activity may explain why the DSBs that persist on synapsed chromosomes upon Rad54 depletion are not repaired and why depletion of the Dmc1-cofactor Rdh54 had little effect.</p>
<p>The successive implementation of repair constraints may be particularly important for the repair of DSBs in regions that lack an allelic sequence for repair, such as inversions or deletions, which, in fact, are repaired efficiently using the sister [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref013">13</xref>]. Chromosome synapsis is not dependent on sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref063">63</xref>] and can thus spread into such regions from sites of SC nucleation. Conversely, constitutive binding of Zip1, as observed at yeast centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref064">64</xref>], may constitutively prevent the recruitment of Mek1 and thus activation of meiotic template bias. Indeed, deletion of Zip1 leads to an increase in interhomologue recombination specifically around centromeres in the absence of increased DSB formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref065">65</xref>], consistent with the model that centromeric DSBs are primarily repaired from the sister.</p>
<p>Our results complement a growing body of evidence that identifies the SC as a macromolecular signaling conduit. By extending out from sites of crossover designation, the SC may communicate successful engagement in crossover repair to the rest of the chromosome and trigger a profound switch in meiotic chromosome behavior, including the remodeling of meiotic chromosome structure and the dampening of further DSB activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref066">66</xref>]. Our work adds to this list the relaxation of meiotic repair constraints as a result of the SC-dependent removal of Mek1. Work in mice suggests that SC-dependent changes in chromosome structure and DSB activity are conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref067">67</xref>]. It remains to be determined whether the same is true for the loss of repair constraints. Like in yeast, phosphorylation of HORMAD proteins is limited to unsynapsed chromosome axes in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref068">68</xref>], and synapsis leads to strong TRIP13/Pch2-dependent depletion of chromosomal HORMAD proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref026">26</xref>]. However, higher eukaryotes do not encode a clear Mek1 orthologue. Although CHK2 kinase could conceivably fulfill the role of Mek1 in these organisms, mouse CHK2 was recently shown to be required for checkpoint function without having a direct role in repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref069">69</xref>]. However, a role for the SC in regulating repair pathway choice is apparent in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, as partial depletion of the SC central region structure leads to increased interhomologue crossover events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref071">71</xref>]. Although synapsis initiates independently of meiotic recombination in this organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref072">72</xref>], the change in repair parameters is associated with altered axial compaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref070">70</xref>], which may be functionally related to the altered DAPI patterns apparent in yeast <italic>pch2Δ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002369.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the transition in meiotic recombination mediated by the SC likely has at least two functions. First, it may preserve the pattern of crossover distribution by limiting the formation of additional crossovers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002369.ref073">73</xref>]. Second, it minimizes the risk of aberrant repair events by restricting DSB numbers and by promoting the rapid repair of the DSBs that do form. Importantly, by executing this transition in <italic>cis</italic>, this feedback is robust to the inherently stochastic nature of chromosome pairing and meiotic crossover formation, and allows chromosomes to respond individually in a shared nuclear environment.</p>
