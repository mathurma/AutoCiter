<abstract>
<p>Co-expression analysis has been employed to predict gene function, identify functional modules, and determine tumor subtypes. Previous co-expression analysis was mainly conducted at bulk tissue level. It is unclear whether co-expression analysis at the single-cell level will provide novel insights into transcriptional regulation. Here we developed a computational approach to compare glioblastoma expression profiles at the single-cell level with those obtained from bulk tumors. We found that the co-expressed genes observed in single cells and bulk tumors have little overlap and show distinct characteristics. The co-expressed genes identified in bulk tumors tend to have similar biological functions, and are enriched for intrachromosomal interactions with synchronized promoter activity. In contrast, single-cell co-expressed genes are enriched for known protein-protein interactions, and are regulated through interchromosomal interactions. Moreover, gene members of some protein complexes are co-expressed only at the bulk level, while those of other complexes are co-expressed at both single-cell and bulk levels. Finally, we identified a set of co-expressed genes that can predict the survival of glioblastoma patients. Our study highlights that comparative analyses of single-cell and bulk gene expression profiles enable us to identify functional modules that are regulated at different levels and hold great translational potential.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>With the development of single-cell sequencing, an increasing number of biological insights were revealed at the single-cell resolution. Here we integrated the expression profiles from single cells and bulk tissues to discover that a majority of gene pairs were specifically co-expressed at single-cell and bulk levels. Our comparative analysis reveals co-expressed functional modules at different levels, and suggests a distinct regulatory mechanism in which single-cell co-expressed genes are regulated through physical interactions from different chromosomes. Moreover, we found a set of co-expressed genes to predict patient survival. This study suggests that single-cell and bulk co-expression analysis could provide novel biological insights and great clinical potential.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gene expression is often coordinated to carry out cellular activities and biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref001">1</xref>]. If the expression levels of two genes rise and fall together across different conditions, they are likely to be members of the same protein complex or participate in the same biological pathways. Therefore, co-expression analysis has been widely used to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) or annotate functions of uncharacterized genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref004">4</xref>]. Built upon co-expression relationships, co-expression networks were often constructed to reveal the functional modules consisting of genes with functional relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref007">7</xref>]. Furthermore, co-expression relationships are often considered to be the consequence of co-regulation that is governed by the same regulatory machinery. Therefore, regulatory elements could be predicted based on the co-expression relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref010">10</xref>]. In addition, co-expression analysis has been applied to cancer biology. For example, co-expressed gene sets could reveal interaction modules in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref011">11</xref>], or serve as molecular signatures to classify tumors into different subtypes, which often showed distinct clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous co-expression analyses were mainly conducted at the bulk level in which a large population of cells was profiled as a whole. Recently, single-cell sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate cellular variability and intratumor heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref016">16</xref>]. However, it remains elusive whether co-expression analysis at the single-cell level will provide novel biological insights into the molecular principles of transcription regulation that would be otherwise hidden at the bulk level. For example, can the same set of co-expressed genes be identified both at the single-cell and bulk levels from the same tissue origin? Will the comparative co-expression analysis reveal functional modules that are regulated at different levels? Do the co-expression relationships detected at the single-cell and bulk levels reflect the same regulatory mechanisms?</p>
<p>To address these important questions, we developed a computational approach to perform comparative co-expression analysis between single-cell and bulk samples, and discovered that the majority of the co-expressed gene pairs were unique. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the discrepancy between the two analyses is not due to technical artifacts. Interestingly, the co-expressed genes in bulk tissues tend to have the same biological functions, while the co-expressed genes in single cells encode proteins that are likely to interact with each other. Strikingly, members in different protein complexes are often predominately connected by one type of co-expression relationships. Furthermore, we find that the co-expression relationships in the single cells and bulk tissues might reflect distinct co-regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, interchromosomal interactions are highly enriched for single-cell co-expression. Finally, we discover a set of co-expressed genes that can predict the clinical outcome of glioblastoma.</p>

<title>Distinct sets of co-expressed genes were identified at the single-cell level</title>
<p>We used glioblastoma as a model system because both single-cell and bulk expression data are available. A dataset of single-cell RNA-seq was obtained from 430 individual cells of five glioblastoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref014">14</xref>]. Similarly, gene expression profiles of 120 glioblastomas as bulk tissues were obtained from TCGA consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref017">17</xref>]. To compare co-expression patterns at single-cell and bulk levels, we calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients (R) of gene expression for all possible gene pairs across the cells (or tumors).</p>
<p>Strikingly, the majority (&gt; 90%) of co-expressed gene pairs were unique to either single-cell or bulk analysis. For instance, we observed that the expression profiles of two genes, <italic>ATP9B</italic> and <italic>MORC4</italic>, were highly correlated at the single-cell level (R = 0.97, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g001">Fig 1A</xref>); the correlation coefficients calculated separately from the five tumors were also consistent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). However, their correlation was not significant at the bulk level (R = 0.04). Conversely, the expression profiles of <italic>REST</italic> and <italic>ROCK2</italic> were found highly correlated at the bulk level (R = 0.85), but not at the single-cell level (R = 0.00051, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Globally, we separately identified the top 1,000 most correlated gene pairs at either single-cell or bulk level and cross-examined whether the same pairs were also correlated at the other level. Surprisingly, only 76 (7.6%) of the top 1,000 gene pairs are shared between the bulk and single-cell levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). For example, <italic>RPL41</italic> and <italic>RPS14</italic> are co-expressed in both single cells (R = 0.75) and bulk tissues (R = 0.83) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). However, most co-expressed gene pairs at the single-cell level have no or even negative correlation at the bulk level. Similar pattern was also observed for the top 1,000 correlations at the bulk level. It is worthy to note that the observation is not sensitive to the correlation measurement we choose. For example, if maximal information coefficient (MIC), which is able to capture non-linear relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref018">18</xref>], was used, a consistent pattern was observed that 96.4% co-expressed gene pairs were specific at single-cell or bulk level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These results suggested that distinct sets of co-expressed gene pairs were yielded at single-cell and bulk levels.</p>

<title>Distinct co-expression patterns are not due to artifacts</title>
<p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the discrepancy in co-expression analysis between bulk and single-cell levels is not due to technical artifacts. First, we checked whether expression correlation was sensitive to the samples chosen for analysis. We randomly partitioned the cells (or tumors) into two equal-sized sub-groups and separately calculated corresponding gene expression correlations. The top 1,000 co-expressed genes were highly consistent between the two sub-groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). For example, 524 (52.4%) of the top 1,000 correlations were shared between the two sub-groups in the single-cell analysis. The remaining 47.6% of gene pairs are also highly correlated, even though they were not in the top 1,000. A similar observation was made for bulk-level analysis. This observation suggested that expression correlations were robust and not sensitive to the samples used for calculation.</p>
<p>Second, we examined whether the dissociation and processing of single cells introduced measurement errors, which could lead to the discrepancy of co-expression between single-cell and bulk levels. For the five glioblastomas with single-cell expression profiles, we averaged gene expression across the individual cells and then compared the average gene expression profiles with the genuine bulk expression profiles from the same glioblastomas. The comparison showed that the average gene expression was highly correlated with the expression in bulk tissue for each tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that the procedure of isolating and harvesting single cells did not introduce much distortion in expression profiles. Furthermore, in comparison of the expression profiles of the five tumors for single-cell sequencing with the other 120 bulk tumors from TCGA, we found that the five samples were dispersed among the 120 glioblastomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). This result suggests that the five tumors for single-cell analysis are not characteristically different to the 120 glioblastomas for bulk analysis, and both of the datasets were representative of primary glioblastomas.</p>
<p>Third, we explored whether the discrepancy of co-expression patterns between single cells and bulk tissues could be observed in other tissues. Similar analyses were performed using data obtained from prostate cancers. We compared the transcriptome of 122 individual prostate cancer cells with those of 398 bulk prostate cancers from TCGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref019">19</xref>]. The results showed that only 4% of the top 1,000 correlations were shared between single-cell and bulk levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Taken together, all of the above analyses suggest that the observation of distinct co-expressed gene pairs in single cells and bulk tissues was valid, and not due to technical artifacts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Members of protein complexes co-expressed at different levels</title>
<p>In order to dissect the biological roles of the co-expressed genes at the single-cell level, we classified the co-expressed genes into three groups: single-cell specific, bulk specific, and shared at both levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s007">S7 Fig</xref> and see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and Methods</xref> for the details). In brief, we compared the distributions of expression correlation coefficients from real and randomly shuffled expression profiles to identify the thresholds of significantly positive correlations at single-cell or bulk levels. Using the obtained thresholds, 5,303, 107,851, and 12,584 gene pairs were classified as single-cell specific, bulk specific, and shared co-expressed gene pairs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we attempted to discover distinct characteristics of these three groups of co-expressed genes. We first checked whether protein products of the co-expressed genes were enriched for known PPIs. By surveying the PPI networks of the BioGRID database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref020">20</xref>] using the corresponding proteins of those co-expressed genes, we found that bulk specific co-expressed genes were slightly enriched for PPIs. Specifically, the protein products of 591 (0.55%) of the 107,851 co-expressed gene pairs specific to the bulk tissues have known PPI relationships, while only 0.34% was expected for randomized gene pairs (P = 3.8E-91, student’s t-test). In contrast, PPIs were much more enriched in single-cell specific co-expressed genes (90 of 5,303, 1.7%), which was a 5-fold enrichment compared to the expectation (P = 2.0E-247, student’s t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Strikingly, we observed that 1,167 of 12,584 (9.3%) shared co-expressed genes have PPIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), a 27-fold enrichment compared to the expectation (P &lt; 1.0E-500, student’s t-test). The enrichment was not due to relatively high correlation coefficients in the shared group. The same trend was also observed if we compared the three groups at the same range of correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the enrichment for PPIs in co-expressed genes increased with the degree of correlation coefficients, suggesting the fidelity of the relationships between the co-expressed genes and PPIs.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, we observed that the three classes of co-expressions were not homogeneously distributed among annotated protein complexes. Instead, different protein complexes were enriched in different classes of co-expressions. Members of many protein complexes are co-expressed at bulk level, such as proteasome and CDC5L complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). However, members in other complexes (e.g. condensing II) are co-expressed in both single cells and bulk tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Perhaps the most striking examples are cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes. Of 1,816 co-expressed gene pairs that belong to the cytoplasmic ribosomal complexes, 1,791 (98.6%) were co-expressed at both single-cell and bulk levels. In contrast, among 329 co-expressed genes of the mitochondrial ribosomal complexes, all of them are bulk specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These results suggest that the synchronized expression of members in protein complexes is governed through different types of co-expression relationships, reflecting distinct regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<title>Single-cell specific co-expressed genes are enriched for distinct biological functions</title>
<p>We next examined whether co-expressed genes tend to share similar biological functions. To this end, we calculated the semantic similarity of the biological process (BP) terms of gene ontology (GO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref021">21</xref>] between two genes using GOSemSim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref022">22</xref>]. Our analyses demonstrated that the shared and bulk specific co-expressed gene pairs tend to have similar biological functions. Specifically, the fractions of shared and bulk specific co-expressed genes having the same functions were 4.6 and 1.5-fold higher than the expectation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In contrast, the single-cell specific co-expressed genes were not enriched for function similarity (0.997-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

<p>The three groups of co-expressed gene pairs are enriched for different biological functions. Again, we checked the biological functions associated with the genes from the top 1,000 shared, single-cell specific, or bulk specific co-expression pairs. For single-cell specific co-expressed genes, GO terms including biological adhesion, and regulation of apoptosis were enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).

<title>Distinct regulatory mechanisms are responsible for three types of co-expressed genes</title>
<p>To determine whether the underlying regulatory mechanism of co-expression at single-cell level is different from those at the bulk level, we analyzed the possible regulatory relationships for the three groups of co-expressed genes. We examined two distinct and complementary mechanisms for co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). First, we tested whether the co-expressed genes tend to have synchronized activity of their <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements across different physiological conditions.

<p>We computed the accessibility of gene promoters annotated by DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and corresponding DHS signal correlations across 125 human cell types and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref023">23</xref>]. Our analysis revealed that shared and bulk specific co-expressed gene pairs had significantly higher DHS correlation than the random expectation. For example, <italic>RPL9</italic> and <italic>RPS6</italic> belong to the shared co-expressed gene group, and the accessibility of their promoters was perfectly synchronized across the 125 cell types (R = 0.98, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Similarly, the accessibility of another pair, <italic>FRYL</italic> and <italic>RAPGEF6</italic>, bulk specific co-expressed genes, was also highly correlated (R = 0.98). Overall, the highest peak of the distribution of DHS correlation for shared and bulk specific co-expressed gene pairs were located at 0.81 and 0.79, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In contrast, the correlation coefficient for single-cell specific co-expressed genes was much lower than the other two groups (P &lt; 1.0E-300, student’s t-test). For example, DHS signal of two genes, <italic>GIS</italic> and <italic>GSS</italic>, was not correlated (R = 0.068, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The correlation coefficients of single-cell specific genes were much broader distributed, with the highest peak located at 0.12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>We then calculated the probability that two genes physically interact with each other based on chromatin interaction data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref024">24</xref>]. In IMR90 cell lines, we discovered that the single-cell specific and bulk specific co-expressed genes were more likely to have physical interactions than expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). In contrast, the shared co-expressed genes were not enriched for chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). The same observation was confirmed in an independent cell line of hESC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Our results demonstrated that the datasets obtained from bulk tissues (e.g. DHS and chromatin interactions) could partially explain the co-expression at bulk and single-cell levels, and different types of co-expressions might be regulated by different mechanisms.</p>

<title>Most of single-cell co-expressed genes were from different chromosomes</title>
<p>Previous co-expression studies at the bulk level have shown that genes within the same topological domain were more likely to interact with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref024">24</xref>]. Here we asked whether a pair of co-expressed genes resided on the same chromosome or even within the same topological domain. Interestingly, for bulk specific co-expressed genes, we observed that 16.9% were found on the same chromosome, whereas only 5.3% of single-cell specific co-expressed genes were encoded on the same chromosome, which was almost the same as randomly selected gene pairs (average 5.4%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). If we only focused on the top 1,000 highest co-expressed gene pairs, the difference between two levels became even more significant, 47.5% and 5.5% of bulk and single-cell specific genes were located in the same chromosome, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We further asked to what degree the intrachromosomal co-expressed genes were from the same topological domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref024">24</xref>].

<title>Co-expressed genes could serve as a prognosis signature for glioblastomas</title>
<p>Recent studies demonstrated that network-based classification approaches provided more power in prediction of clinical outcomes than individual genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref027">27</xref>]. We searched the subnetworks within the three types of co-expression networks to identify a set of co-expressed genes that could stratify patients with most significantly different survival time. We classified 120 patients with RNA sequencing from TCGA into two groups based on the expression profiles of genes within each subnetwork (or combination of subnetworks) and compared the survival rates between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). By examining all subnetworks and the combination of the subnetworks, we discovered a combination that achieved the best separation of patient survival rates, which consisted of 4 shared and 2 single-cell specific co-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The two groups of patients were well separated based on the silhouette plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004892.s011">S11 Fig</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analysis revealed distinct characteristics for the co-expressed genes at single-cell and bulk levels. The stark difference between the two levels suggests that the single-cell expression profiles provide novel biological insights when they are compared with bulk expression profiles. Interestingly, the DHS and chromatin interaction datasets obtained from bulk tissues could partially explain the co-expression at single-cell level. Nevertheless, we are fully aware of the difference of gene regulation between bulk and single-cell levels. For example, two bulk co-expressed genes could have the same accessibility of regulators in their promoters, whereas the regulation of the two genes at single-cell level is independent to each other and could result in un-correlated accessibilities of the promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004892.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). If we could deconvolute the signal from the bulk tissues or obtain the datasets on gene regulation at single-cell level, we expect to obtain stronger connection between co-expression and co-regulation. Although a few DHS or ChIP-seq datasets at single-cell level are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref031">31</xref>], the data quality is still not optimal (e.g. low sequencing depth). One interesting observation is that majority of the single-cell co-expressed genes are located in different chromosomes, in line with a recent observation that co-expressed odorant receptor genes was not restricted to single chromosome at single-cell level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref032">32</xref>]. While the current chromatin interaction analyses are mainly focused on intrachromosomal interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref034">34</xref>], our analysis suggests that interchromosomal interactions are of biological interests.</p>
<p>In our analysis, a set of six co-expressed genes was used to stratify glioblastoma patients into two groups with significantly different survival. Although these genes were selected without prior knowledge of cancer biology, the genes are relevant to glioblastomas. For example, <italic>PLXNA4</italic> (plexin A4) has been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis and progression of glioblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref035">35</xref>].

In total, 4,837 and 4,722 genes were analyzed for glioblastoma and prostate adenocarcinomas, respectively. We performed log2-transformation for RPKM. In order to avoid 0 value for invalid log2-transformation, we added 1 to RPKM value. We then performed global centralization by subtracting corresponding average expression across tissues or cells.

The hierarchical clustering of expression profiles took Pearson’s correlation coefficient as similarity measurement, and used complete linkage. Similarly, we also used MIC (maximal information coefficient) to measure expression correlation of gene pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>We then classified the co-expressed genes into three groups: bulk specific, single-cell specific, and shared. Since the distributions of correlation coefficients are quite different between single cells and bulk tissues, we could not choose a uniform cutoff to define the positive correlation. Instead, we developed a shuffled-expression-based algorithm to determine the cutoffs for single-cell and bulk expression separately. Firstly, we shuffled the expression for each gene across the samples, and generated a corresponding distribution of correlation coefficients. We then set the correlation coefficient at the top percentage of 10<sup>−6</sup> as cutoff for positive correlation. After setting the cumulative probability of no correlation in random distribution to 0.3 for each side around zero correlation, we obtained the cutoffs of no correlation. The criteria for positive correlation and no correlation are very stringent here because we want to make sure the selected groups of gene pairs are indeed bulk specific or single-cell specific. Those positively correlated gene pairs at both single-cell and bulk levels were assigned to the group of shared co-expressed genes. Single-cell specific co-expressions were those gene pairs with positive correlation at the single-cell level but no correlation at the bulk level. Similarly, those gene pairs with positive correlation at the bulk level but with no correlation at the single-cell level were assigned to bulk specific co-expressed genes.</p>

<title>Integration with protein-protein interactions and protein complexes</title>
<p>In order to associate gene co-expressions with protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we downloaded PPIs from BioGrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref020">20</xref>]. We calculated the fraction of co-expressions with PPIs in each type of co-expressed genes. Meanwhile, we generated one thousand sets of 1,000 pairs of genes randomly selected from all gene pairs as control gene pair sets. Each set of control gene pairs were associated with PPIs as well. To calculate the proportion for different ranges of expression correlations, we divided co-expressed genes into equal-interval groups with 0.1 bin size of the correlations.</p>
<p>The components of protein complexes were from CORUM database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref041">41</xref>]. All shared and specific co-expressions were mapped to each protein complexes. The layout and view of co-expression network of protein complexes were performed in Cytoscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref042">42</xref>].</p>

<title>Analysis of GO similarity and function enrichment</title>
<p>We used R package GOSemSim to calculate the semantic similarity of the biological process (BP) terms of gene ontology (GO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref022">22</xref>] between two genes. If similarity value of gene pair ≥ 0.5, the genes were called with GO similarity. Based on this criterion, we calculated the percentage of co-expressed gene pairs and randomly selected gene pairs with GO similarity.</p>
<p>To identify the enriched GO terms, we each chose the top 1,000 co-expressed gene pairs from three groups of co-expressions, respectively. We obtained 129 unique genes from top 1,000 shared co-expressions. After excluding the genes were overlapped between shared and single-cell specific co-expressions, we obtained 319 single-cell specific genes. Besides, 640 genes were unique to bulk specific co-expressions. These three groups of genes were separately performed function enrichment analysis through DAVID software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref043">43</xref>]. According to the enriched functions, co-expression networks of top 1,000 correlations were organized into different modules. The genes were assigned to the most significant module if they were enriched in multiple functional modules.</p>

<title>DHS correlation, chromatin interactions and location of co-expressed genes</title>
<p>DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in 125 human cells and tissues were downloaded from ENCODE project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref023">23</xref>]. DHSs within the promoter regions (upstream 1,000 base pairs relative to transcription start sites (TSSs)) were associated to genes. If no DHS peaks were found within the promoter regions, the intensity of DHSs of genes was assigned to zero. We then calculated DHS correlations of gene pairs across 125 cell types.</p>
<p>To identify chromatin interaction of co-expressed genes, we used Hi-C data from previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref024">24</xref>]. The DNA regions across upstream 5,000, gene body, and downstream 5,000 were used to identify whether gene pairs have chromatin interaction.</p>
<p>Chromosomal relationships of co-expressed gene pairs were plotted using Circus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref044">44</xref>]. Topological domains in genome were reported by a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref024">24</xref>]. According to the locations of TSSs, gene pairs were determined whether they were located in the same chromosome or topological domain.</p>

<title>Identification of gene signature for glioblastoma survival</title>
<p>We constructed three networks separately from single-cell specific, bulk specific and shared co-expressions. Using ‘Fast Modularity’ software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref045">45</xref>], we then determined 56, 42, and 15 dense subnetworks within these three co-expression networks, which reflect the functionally related gene groups. For each subnetwork, we performed hierarchical clustering of patients based on the bulk expression levels of the genes within the subnetwork. The patients were classified into two groups according to the clustering and then compared of their survival using the Kaplan-Meier method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref046">46</xref>]. The significance of differential survival between two groups of patients was assessed with a log-rank test. After testing all the subnetworks, 7 shared, 1 single-cell specific and 1 bulk specific subnetworks were found to be able to separate the patients with significantly different survival rates (P &lt; 0.05, log-rank test). We then further examined the combination of at most three significant subnetworks using the same procedure and discovered one combination with the best performance for tumor prognosis. We then estimated the false discovery rate (FDR) using Benjamini and Hochberg approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref047">47</xref>]. The quality of partition of patients was assessed through silhouette graph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref048">48</xref>].</p>
<p>In TCGA, another 123 glioblastomas were measured using microarray platform, of which 22 samples were also profiled with RNA sequencing. In order to make the expression levels comparable between microarray samples and sequencing samples, we used one of patients (TCGA-06-0156), which was measured both by RNA sequencing and microarray, for normalization. After log2-transformation of sequencing data, expression profile of each patient subtracted the average expression of TCGA-06-0156 from RNA sequencing. Similarly, expression profiles measured by microarray also subtracted the average expression of microarray-measured TCGA-06-0156. Using the gene signature obtained from the 120 glioblastomas, we then predicted the class of additional 101 microarray-measured glioblastomas (a validation set) through a nearest shrunken centroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004892.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
