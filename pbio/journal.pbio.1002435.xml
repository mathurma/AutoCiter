<article-title>Tracking Resilience to Infections by Mapping Disease Space</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>The study of infectious disease has been aided by model organisms, which have helped to elucidate molecular mechanisms and contributed to the development of new treatments; however, the lack of a conceptual framework for unifying findings across models, combined with host variability, has impeded progress and translation. Here, we fill this gap with a simple graphical and mathematical framework to study disease tolerance, the dose response curve relating health to microbe load; this approach helped uncover parameters that were previously overlooked. Using a model experimental system in which we challenged <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> with the pathogen <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, we tested this framework, finding that microbe growth, the immune response, and disease tolerance were all well represented by sigmoid models. As we altered the system by varying host or pathogen genetics, disease tolerance varied, as we would expect if it was indeed governed by parameters controlling the sensitivity of the system (the number of bacteria required to trigger a response) and maximal effect size according to a logistic equation. Though either the pathogen or host immune response or both together could theoretically be the proximal cause of pathology that killed the flies, we found that the pathogen, but not the immune response, drove damage in this model. With this new understanding of the circuitry controlling disease tolerance, we can now propose better ways of choosing, combining, and developing treatments.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>It is an intuitive assumption that the severity of symptoms suffered during an infection must be linked to pathogen loads. However, the dose–response relationship explaining how health varies with respect to pathogen load is non-linear and can be described as a “disease tolerance curve;” this relationship can vary in response to the genetic properties of the host or pathogen as well as environmental conditions. We studied what changes in the shape of this curve can teach us about the underlying circuitry of the immune response. Using a model system in which we infected fruit flies with the bacterial pathogen <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, we observed an S-shaped disease tolerance curve. This type of curve can be described by three or four parameters in a standard manner, which allowed us to develop a simple mathematical model to explain how the curve is expected to change shape as the immune response changes. After observing the variation in curve shape due to host and pathogen genetic variation, we conclude that the damage caused by <italic>Listeria</italic> infection does not result from an over-exuberant immune response but rather is caused more directly by the pathogen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The clinical goal of treating infectious diseases is to reduce the levels of sickness experienced by infected hosts. One approach to studying this problem is to quantitate illness by correlating the dose response of pathology to pathogen load; graphs like these are called “disease tolerance curves” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref006">6</xref>]. We argue that the shape of the dose response curves and the underlying mathematical functions producing these curves can teach us how to alter the health-by-microbe relationship. For example, if disease tolerance curves are linear, we need only discover the molecular mechanisms that control the curves’ slopes. If these curves have a more complex shape—for example, a sigmoid shape—then we will need to measure more variables.</p>
<p>Since there are not universally agreed upon definitions for many of the words we use to describe the immune response and health, we start by defining the following terms: vigor, resistance, resilience, and tolerance. “Vigor” is the health of an uninfected individual, and “resistance” describes the host’s ability to limit microbe load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref006">6</xref>]. We use “resilience” to describe the ability of infected hosts to return to their original healthy condition, much in the same way the word is used to describe the way a perturbed ecological system returns to its origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref008">8</xref>]. For example, a resilient host may suffer from an infection but would easily bounce back to health, whereas infection in a non-resilient host might lead to permanent disability or death. We apply the term resilience to an infected individual because we can follow the path that individual takes from health through sickness and back. “Disease tolerance” is the dose response curve summarizing the pathogen loads that are required to produce a range of host responses. Disease tolerance differs from resilience in that tolerance is an emergent property of populations, while resilience is a property of an individual; disease tolerance measures how resilience changes across a population as pathogen load is varied. Disease tolerance, by definition, cannot be measured in a single individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref009">9</xref>]. The model described in this paper shows how these distinctions between resilience of individuals and tolerance of populations disappear once we understand infection dynamics to the point that we can predict how a population would behave knowing the properties of an individual.</p>
<p>To study disease tolerance we used a simple infection system in which we injected a pathogen (<italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>) into a fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref014">14</xref>]. These <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic>-infected flies suffer from a variety of ailments, including alterations in their circadian rhythm, cold-coma recovery, climbing ability, feeding behavior, metabolism, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref017">17</xref>]. To determine the disease tolerance curve, we plot the survival rates of the infected flies against microbe loads measured 2 days post infection (DPI). We used this system because it allowed us to measure large numbers of samples and to take advantage of the genetic tools and the understanding of innate immunity available for this model organism.</p>
<p>Our immediate goal is to define the mechanisms controlling tolerance. We start with a simple mathematical model representing feedbacks between microbe growth, the immune response, damage, and health, modeling each using logistic equations. We then measured the ground-truth of these models using a <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster/L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection that can lead to lethal outcomes. We experimentally measured microbe growth, the immune response, and disease tolerance and found that each of them was well described by sigmoid curves, suggesting that we need at least three variables to describe each. In the case of tolerance, this meant that we had to measure host vigor, the number of bacteria required to injure the host, and the maximum death rate achieved by the fly. In the case of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) transcript production, we measured basal levels, the number of bacteria required to induce transcripts to 50% of their maximum value, and the maximum transcript level. We examined how alteration of the values of the parameters in the model changed the output of the model to distinguish between changes that we might see if microbes or the immune response were the principal mediators of damage. Upon testing a variety of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> natural variants and mutants along with some <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> mutants, we concluded that, in this system, the bacteria and not the immune response is responsible for the damage caused by the infection. When we monitored how disease tolerance changed as we varied host or pathogen properties, we found the tolerance curve changed shape in the manner predicted by the model; for example, the number of bacteria required to damage health changed, while the vigor and maximum death rate remained constant. We demonstrate that this dual approach of measuring and modeling full-length disease tolerance curves can reveal previously unrecognized parameters controlling disease tolerance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We started by making a graphical model to explain four parameters: microbe load, the immune response, microbe-induced damage, and health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We modeled the immune response so that it could both limit microbe growth and kill microbes. We previously found that <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> infected flies waste upon infection and predicted that the day they died they would have exhausted their glycogen and fat stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref019">19</xref>]. We also found that <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infected flies waste during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref015">15</xref>]; to explain death, we used these empirical data to imagine that there was a store of “health” that could be depleted by the infection. In our model, both the immune response and the microbes can cause damage, which depletes health and increases the death rate. Immunopathology directly affects health, while microbes secrete damage effectors that impact health.</p>

<p>We built a simple mathematical model based on the graphical model largely using sigmoid functions to define each parameter (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Experimental Procedures</xref>) to help define our assumptions about the mechanisms governing disease tolerance. This was an obvious choice for microbe growth and the immune response, as these equations are well described in classical mathematical models of infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref020">20</xref>]. We used the same mathematical function to describe microbe-induced damage, since we anticipate that the shape of the curve is due to some enzymatic rate-limiting step that will likely follow sigmoid Michaelis-Menten kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>To determine the ground-truth of this model, we measured the behavior of microbes, the immune response, and health in a model system in which we inject <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> into the body cavity of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>. We chose this model infection because it is simple to obtain the measurements we need to define resistance and disease tolerance and because we have a collection of host mutants that we know affect resistance and tolerance to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref012">12</xref>]. We can readily measure microbe loads by homogenizing whole flies at any point in the infection to plate them to determine colony-forming units (CFU). We can determine the health of the infected flies by measuring the median time to death following infection.</p>
<p>When <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> is injected into flies that are incubated at 29°C, the resulting bacterial growth is best described as logistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, logistic adjusted r<sup>2</sup> = 0.594, adjusted linear and adjusted exponential r<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.1) with a maximum growth rate of 0.1656 log10 (CFU)/h. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> loads reach a plateau at 24 h post infection.</p>

<p>We wanted to define the relationship between AMP levels to a given microbe load to understand how many parameters we need to use to measure the immune response. Because bacteria grow rapidly to reach their plateau, and wounding flies to introduce bacteria causes an immune response on its own, we reasoned it would be difficult to measure the immune responses at intermediate microbe loads by simply injecting flies with different amounts of microbes. Instead, we took flies that had high levels of bacteria and slowly cured them of the infection so that we could measure the relationship between AMP transcripts and microbe load essentially at steady state. The fly immune response cannot clear <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> on its own; therefore, to clear the bacteria we transferred infected flies to fly media containing 1 mg/ml of ampicillin 2 DPI. We observed that <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> clearance followed exponential decay dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, adjusted r<sup>2</sup> = 0.7140). <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infection in the fly decreases survival, but ampicillin-treated flies lived just long as uninfected flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Having developed a method to slowly decrease microbe loads, we performed the following experiment: We injected one set of flies with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fed them with ampicillin, and followed them regularly to serve as wounding, aging, and antibiotic treatment controls. We took a second set of flies and injected <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic>. This group was split in two; one portion was fed ampicillin to clear the microbes, and the other was not. We collected flies for plating to determine microbe loads, and for RNA preparation to run a microarray at regular intervals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s003">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We analyzed the expression of the known and presumed AMPs with respect to microbe loads and found that AMPs are expressed according to a sigmoid relationship with respect to microbe load. We plotted the expression of AMPs to CFU levels in the fly and found the relationship between AMP transcription and microbe load is best fit by a four-parameter sigmoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Accordingly, each AMP transcript has a baseline (bottom plateau), maximal concentration (top plateau), effective bacterial concentration producing a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>), and slope. We observe that the AMPs expressed during infection differ in their EC<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) over a range of about 100-fold (20–2,000 CFUs). AMP expression does not continue to increase as microbe number increases past a certain point, and each AMP transcript reaches a characteristic plateau. Each AMP transcript can thus be characterized by its maximum expression in relation to its baseline, and this relationship varies over an 8-fold range between AMPs. We observed no significant relationship between EC<sub>50</sub> and maximum expression, suggesting that EC<sub>50</sub> and maximum expression can vary independently of each other. We found an exponential relationship between Hill slope and EC<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), suggesting that AMPs requiring large numbers of bacteria for induction turn on in a switch-like manner, while those turned on at low microbe loads are turned on gradually. This gives us insight into the tuning of the fly’s immune response; overall, AMPs will be turned on gradually at microbe loads below 100 bacteria per fly but will rapidly increase as loads pass 1,000 bacteria per fly.</p>

<p>Though AMPs had a rather simple sigmoid relationship with microbe load, this was not the case for many other genes modulated during infection. Some of these other gene expression patterns showed hysteresis, by which we mean that gene expression depends upon past conditions and not only the immediate conditions. For example, gene expression for these hysteretic transcripts had one pattern as the fly moved from health to sickness and another as the fly returned from sickness to health. This hysteresis can be useful because it helps us define different states of the infection. To visualize the “disease space” traversed by infected flies and to identify the different states of the infection process, we used topological data analysis (TDA). It is common practice when clustering data to plot the data using some sort of tree structure, as is done with hierarchical clustering or spade analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref024">24</xref>]. This makes good sense when dealing with data for a developing system in which the animal or cell enters a new state, but it is problematic when dealing with a system that returns to its original state; resilient systems should not be fit by a tree and are better described by loops. Topological data analysis is sensitive to the topology of the data and will not arbitrarily linearize a loop and then force it to fit a tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref026">26</xref>]. Instead, the analysis simply clusters related data points, represented as nodes on a network graph, and the shape of that graph reveals the connections between the time points (for recent examples see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref029">29</xref>]). In the case of a resilient system, such as flies recovering from an infection, we find this graph forms a loop.</p>

<p>To determine which genes show altered expression in different parts of the disease map, we performed fuzzy c-means clustering on this dataset to identify genes with similar expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s004">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s010">S2 Table</xref>). We then performed gene ontology analysis on each cluster to identify characteristic physiological changes within the cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s011">S3 Table</xref>) and then asked about the expression patterns of these genes on the TDA graph. Acute stress response genes, such as heat shock protein 26, were activated immediately after injection and then quickly returned to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). AMP expression follows CFU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>).

The transcripts for these “morbidity genes” (clusters 1, 2, 11, 12, 22, 35, 43) continue to increase even when microbe levels plateau. Gene ontology analysis of fuzzy c-means clusters containing these morbidity genes did not yield significantly enriched terms.

<p>Occasionally, tolerance curves are fit with mathematical functions, but the reason these functions are chosen is that they fit the data and not that they are dissected for further biological insights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref032">32</xref>]. More typically, tolerance is visualized as a linear system, which requires just two parameters, vigor and slope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref011">11</xref>]. In contrast, our sigmoid model provides four parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). In addition to vigor and slope used to describe a line, the sigmoid model adds the parameters of EC<sub>50</sub> and maximum effect. The EC<sub>50</sub> of the system is the number of microbes present at day 2 that cause a 50% change in MTD. Maximum effect is defined by the sigmoid’s asymptotic tail at high microbe loads. This defines a maximum death rate, suggesting that there is a previously unrecognized rate-limiting step for death.</p>
<p>In the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, depletion of health could be induced either by bacterial damage effectors or indirectly by self-harm caused by the resistance response. We modeled the two possibilities by observing how the shape of the curve changed as we altered the model such that either the resistance response or bacteria were the sole cause of damage. We concentrated on changes in the rate that the immune response was turned on (τ), and the inflection points for the relationships between microbe density and the rates of immune induction and microbe-induced damage induction (σ<sub>I</sub> and σ<sub>M</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g006">Fig 6A–6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s012">S4 Table</xref>). In the case in which resistance mechanisms drove damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref>) and bacterial damage was set to zero, changes in τ or the inflection point for microbe-induced immunity caused shifts in both the EC<sub>50</sub> and microbe loads. The effect is more extreme when the inoculum is far below the microbial carrying capacity, as this gives the immune response an opportunity to control microbe loads. This results in a reciprocal mechanistic link between resistance and tolerance in which one is always high when the other is low. In the model in which bacteria drive damage, a loss of resistance results in high microbe loads and health pegged at maximum severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Shifts in the EC<sub>50</sub> of the bacterial damage-driven system, in which resistance-induced damage is set to zero, are caused by changes in the inflection point for bacterial-induced damage, as might be expected for differentially virulent strains of microbes or hosts that are better at neutralizing bacterial toxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). In this second case, there is no mechanistic reciprocal link between resistance and tolerance, and the two vary independently of each other.</p>

<title>Testing the Mathematical Model for Disease Tolerance</title>
<p>To test whether the shape of the disease tolerance curve in this host–pathogen pairing was driven by immunological damage or microbial damage, and to determine how the parameters of a sigmoid disease-tolerance curve varied, we measured the tolerance curves for a collection of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants that we previously showed differ in their resistance and tolerance defenses to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref012">12</xref>]. We also tested natural variant flies from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetics Reference Panel that were preselected because they showed extreme changes in their response to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref034">34</xref>]. In addition, we tested <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> mutants that altered pathogenesis in the fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref011">11</xref>]. These data supported the model in which bacteria caused damage in the system and did not support the immunological damage model.</p>
<p>A mutation in the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> gene <italic>CG2247</italic> was found previously to reduce the fly’s ability to both survive an infection and control <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref011">11</xref>]; here, we found that at 2 DPI, even <italic>CG2247</italic> mutant flies injected with just ten bacteria had the same high microbe loads as flies injected with 100,000 bacteria, supporting the idea that these mutants alter resistance. This is visible in the tolerance curves, in which all of the points from infected mutant flies clustered on the bottom asymptote of the parental tolerance curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g006">Fig 6E–6H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s013">S5 Table</xref>). An additional example of a fly strain with poor resistance is shown in the supplementary data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s005">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s013">S5 Table</xref>). Since flies suffering a loss of resistance showed no change in the maximum death rate of the infection, these results support the model in which bacteria are responsible for damage.</p>
<p>RNAseq analysis of <italic>CG2247</italic> mutant flies suggests a molecular mechanism for the observed phenotype. We observed that in wild-type flies, the transcripts encoding the enzymes required to generate a reactive oxygen response against <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> dropped over the course of the infection but recovered upon antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s008">S6 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref035">35</xref>]. In contrast, these transcripts dropped to 10-fold lower levels in <italic>CG2247</italic> mutants and did not recover to their original levels. We observed a reduction in the characteristic dark spots resulting from the action of this immune response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s008">S6 Fig</xref>). We conclude that mutations in this gene disrupt the melanization immune response.</p>
<p>The disease-tolerance curve for the natural variant <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> strain, RAL 359, showed a reduction in the EC<sub>50</sub> of the system without a change in resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref033">33</xref>]. RAL 359 was as capable as our lab control strain w<sup>1118</sup> in controlling <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> growth; however, low doses of the microbe had a larger effect on health in this strain than in the control. This shifted the EC<sub>50</sub> from 922 to 83 colony-forming units per fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g006">Fig 6I–6L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s013">S5 Table</xref>). The vigor and maximum death rate of these two strains was similar. This shift in EC<sub>50</sub> was a common phenotype, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s006">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s007">S5</xref> Figs.</p>
<p>Changing the virulence of the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> also altered the EC<sub>50</sub> of the system. Mutant <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> lacking the virulence factors actin assembly-inducing protein (ActA) or listeriolysin O (LLO) had previously been shown to kill flies more slowly than wild-type <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g005">Fig 5C</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g006">Fig 6O</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref011">11</xref>]. The tolerance curves for flies infected with an <italic>ΔactA</italic> mutant showed a shift in the EC<sub>50</sub> from 922 to 5,753 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g006">Fig 6M–6P</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002435.s013">S5 Table</xref>). We observed a ceiling for the number of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> that can be maintained in a wild-type infected fly (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002435.g005">5A</xref>) and hypothesize that this is defined by the number of phagocytes in the fly that provide a niche for <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref013">13</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As a field, we can generate complex network diagrams showing how the parts of the immune system communicate with each other and identify key signaling pathways and nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref037">37</xref>]. Though this lets us predict that the system will fail when we remove a necessary component of the network, evolution and medicine work by subtler means, for example, by changing rate constants in addition to deleting entire pathways. To predict how evolution or medicine will change an immune response, we need to identify mathematical functions that accurately describe the behavior of that process so that we can understand all of the parameters that control the behavior.</p>
<p><italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> growth in the fly follows logistic kinetics; the variation of these curves observed in natural fly variants suggests that microbes are controlled by separable parameters defining the growth rate and carrying capacity of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref034">34</xref>]. It seems reasonable that this is not a property limited to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> growing in the fly and that it will be true for many pathogens, especially considering that this is a near textbook description of microbial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref039">39</xref>]. Both of these properties should be under natural selection, but studies of infections in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> typically do not measure microbe growth at all and, when they do, they measure only one time point, conflating growth rates with carrying capacities. The fly is studied because it is easily manipulated and has a relatively simple immune response, but despite decades of work, the field has been underestimating the number of dimensions in which natural variation can change the immune response. Thinking about this generally, it raises the question of whether there might be separate host mechanisms that control microbe growth rates versus ceilings and, thus, diseases might result from a defect in either of these mechanisms. To study these different disease mechanisms, we must ensure that our experiments let us observe the phenomenon.</p>
<p>The AMP response in the fly is under the control of two signaling pathways, Toll and imd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref040">40</xref>]. The classical descriptions of these pathways argue that the pathways show specificity for different elicitors; a problem with the experiments supporting this model is that the experiments did not correlate response to elicitor levels, and most experiments tested just one arbitrarily determined time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref042">42</xref>]. We find that AMP induction is described well by a four-parameter sigmoid function. This means that there are parameters describing the basal level, EC<sub>50</sub>, maximum expression level, and slope, which may all vary independently of each other; that we don’t see a correlation between maximal gene induction and EC<sub>50</sub> supports this hypothesis. If the field’s experiments measure gene expression at just one time point post infection and do not correlate this to microbe loads, we cannot learn which of the three induction parameters are changing. Thus, though it is clear that the Toll and imd signaling pathways, as well as sex, age, the environment, and evolution, can change the immune response, we don’t have a good definition of specificity in this system. Now that we understand that there are new variables to explain, we need to explain this from an evolutionary perspective; for example, what selective pressures cause changes in the EC<sub>50</sub> of gene expression of an AMP rather than the maximal gene expression or slope? Will a host benefit from a quick induction of antimicrobials at low microbe loads, or should it invest in an enormous response as microbe loads climb higher?</p>
<p>We found that health was correlated with microbe load according to a four-parameter sigmoid function. As described above for microbe growth and immune induction, past experiments looking at health outputs in model infections are problematic because they don’t measure the full shape of the response curve and don’t report where an experiment is performed on the curve. Perhaps it should have been obvious that microbes would have a growth ceiling and AMPs would have a maximum expression level; classic infectious disease modeling texts start with chapters describing these functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref043">43</xref>]. However, one thing these books don’t do is link pathogen growth and the immune response to health. When we examine this relationship, we find that we can make simple models that predict the presence of more parameters than we’ve been studying. For example, the implication of a sigmoid response for health suggests that there is a rate-limiting step for death and that death has a maximum rate. This means that it should be possible not only to change the EC<sub>50</sub> of the system to reduce the rate at which damage occurs, but we should also be able to increase the health reservoir of a host so that it has high stamina and will be able to suffer damage for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>The underlying problem with the field’s experimental characterization of immune responses is that we focus on when responses are induced in terms of time and not why they are induced in terms of the quantity of inducer. The result is that we systematically overlook and conflate control mechanisms. By correlating effects to effectors, we can better understand microbial pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Disease Spaces</title>
<p>The disease space analysis of recovering and dying flies reveals that far more is going on in these sick animals than AMP gene expression, and it lets us organize these events with a simple map. A commonly used time point for gene expression studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is 6 h post infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref045">45</xref>]; this is a particularly problematic time point because it combines transient expression of heat shock genes with expression of antimicrobials. Flies fated to die have a progressing gene signature in which a set of transcripts is increased without a corresponding increase in microbe load. We anticipate that one will need to measure the course of pathogenic infections to identify these genes, rather than follow microbes that simply elicit an immune response but do not kill wild-type flies (for example <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref046">46</xref>]. Just as each pathogen causes a different disease in humans, we expect that there will be a range of pathologies caused by insect pathogens and do not assume that these <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic>-induced genes are the only morbidity genes in the fly. The nature of this particular death response is unclear, as the identity of the genes does not provide obvious clues. In contrast, recovering flies have a unique gene expression signature that suggests function; for example, enzymes in biosynthesis and energy metabolism are repressed during infection but pop up hysteretically as microbes are removed, suggesting the induction of a recovery response that rebuilds damaged tissues.</p>

<title>Why Does Shape Matter?</title>
<p>The shapes of tolerance curves are important because they will define which medications can be used to improve the health of an infected patient depending upon their position on the sigmoid curve. Here is a concrete example: If we think about the dose response curve to sepsis in humans as a linear response, then any drug that limits damage will help every patient. We come to a different conclusion if we consider a sigmoid relationship. Humans suffer from sepsis when relatively small numbers of microbes enter the blood, and very sick patients can have much higher levels of microbes. This suggests the sickest patients will be found on the asymptote of a sigmoid curve, where they will be suffering maximum pathological effects. Drugs that change the basal level of a response, EC<sub>50</sub>, or slope will not help these patients; they will only respond to drugs that manipulate maximal response levels. Thus, we need to understand the shape of these tolerance curves and where the patients lie on the curves to select appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>The discussion of tolerance in patients raises a tricky point. We’ve shown it is possible to measure a disease tolerance curve in a model system; this demonstrated the nonlinear nature of tolerance and suggested the existence of new dimensions we should follow when measuring disease outcomes. The problem is that this approach requires us to perform many more experiments than we do currently when analyzing phenotypes, and this approach is likely impossible to apply to most human infections for the following two reasons: First, disease tolerance is plotted using summary characteristics of an infection. For example, one might measure the maximum parasite load and minimum health for an infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref005">5</xref>]. This is accessible experimentally, but it is unethical to gather these data from a patient, as you need to treat the patient when they enter the clinic. In one rare case of HIV, infected patients’ tolerance curves have been recorded because these chronically infected patients are followed for years, but that approach isn’t going to be useful for acute infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref047">47</xref>]. Second, disease tolerance is a measurement of the behavior of a population and not an individual. The information we gather about an individual allows us to place a datum on a health by microbe graph, but we don’t know the shape of the curve that should be fit through that individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref009">9</xref>]; thus, we can’t easily determine which parameters need fixing in the sick patient. What we learn from model systems is that there are underlying rules that can be used to explain disease outcomes, and that these rules are nonlinear. By studying these rules in models, we can identify the molecular mechanisms corresponding to the mathematical parameters and then apply this knowledge to human biology by analogy. If we want to measure changes directly in human immune infections, we need to rely on descriptions of disease space, which are described in the accompanying paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref048">48</xref>].</p>

Flies were anaesthetized with carbon dioxide. A drawn glass needle carrying <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> was used to pierce the cuticle on the ventrolateral side of the abdomen. A picospritzer III was used to inject 50 nl of liquid into the fly. Bacteria were delivered at different concentrations to produce injections of approximately 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 CFU. Infectious doses were determined for each experiment by plating a subset of flies at time zero. Approximately 200–400 flies were used for each dose in the experiment to measure survival and to count colonies.</p>

<title>RNA Isolation for Microarray</title>
<p>Flies were injected with 50 nl of Listeria (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.001, or approximately 100 CFUs) or left manipulated. Following injection, flies were placed in vials containing dextrose fly media and incubated at 29°C. Samples were separated into three groups: Moribund, recovering, and uninfected control. Moribund flies were infected, and samples were collected on the following DPI: 0.25, 1, 2, 2.25, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Recovering flies were infected and flipped onto dextrose fly media containing 1 mg/ml ampicillin 2 DPI. Recovering samples were collected on the following DPI: 2.25, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 16. Uninfected control flies were not infected but were flipped onto dextrose fly media containing 1 mg/ml ampicillin 2 dpi. Uninfected control samples were collected on the following dpi: 2.25, 3, and 9. At each of the indicated time points, groups of 20 flies were homogenized in TRIzol, and RNA was isolated using a standard TRIzol preparation. Additional flies were used to determine CFUs and monitor survival. Biological triplicates were obtained from three independent experiments. Quality of RNA was determined using a BioAnalyzer 2100.

<title>Topological Data Analysis</title>
<p>Only genes that were differentially expressed in moribund and recovering but not in uninfected control were used in the topological data analysis using the Ayasdi 3.0 software platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ayasdi.com" xlink:type="simple">ayasdi.com</ext-link>, Ayasdi Inc., Menlo Park, California). Nodes in the network represent clusters of samples of infected flies, and edges connect nodes that contain samples in common. Nodes are colored by the average value of their samples for the variables listed in the figure legends. TDA was used to map the way hosts loop through the disease space in an unsupervised fashion. Two types of parameters are needed to generate a topological analysis. First is a measurement/notion of similarity, called a metric, which measures the distance between two points in some space (usually between rows in the data). Second are lenses, which are real valued functions on the data points. Lenses are used to create overlapping bins in the dataset. Overlapping families of intervals are used to create overlapping bins in the data. Metrics are used with lenses to construct the Ayasdi 3.0 output. Multiple lenses can be used in each analysis. There are two parameters used in defining the bins. One is resolution, which determines the number of bins; higher resolution means more bins. The second is gain, which determines the degree of overlap of the intervals. Once the bins are constructed, we perform a clustering step on each bin, using single linkage clustering with a fixed heuristic for the choice of the scale parameter. This heuristic is described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002435.ref026">26</xref>]. This gives a family of clusters within the data, which may overlap. We built a network with one node for each such cluster and where we connect two nodes, if the corresponding clusters contain a data point in common. We used two types of lenses. The first type was lenses based on dimension reduction algorithms such as multidimensional scaling and nearest neighbor analyses; these helped analyze the data in an unsupervised manner. The second type was lenses based on the data alone, for example, the levels of antimicrobial gene expression or recovery gene expression. The gene expression markers helped us dissect the graphs using knowledge about the biology of the system. To build our map, we analyzed our dataset with samples as rows and genes as columns. We used the Variance Normalized Euclidean metric. We used the PCA coord1 and PCA coord2 lens as well as two data lenses: <italic>CG32373</italic> and <italic>Fuca</italic> (Resolution = 19, Gain = 6, and equalized was used for all lenses).</p>

<p>Microbes grow in a sigmoid fashion at rate <italic>r</italic> as they deplete the host substrate, and immune effectors can either kill microbes outright at rate <italic>ε</italic> per effector or inhibit microbial growth at rate <italic>η</italic>. In these simulations, growth rate limitation was used as the main immune response. Two mechanisms contribute to immune effector production. Reflecting the sigmoid relationship between microbe density and AMP levels, immune effectors can increase in proportion to microbe density up to a maximal rate of <italic>τ*k</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> until effector levels saturate immune pathway machinery (k<sub>I</sub>). The parameter σ<sub>I</sub> reflects the microbe concentration at the inflection point for immune induction. Immune effectors decay at rate μ. Microbes secrete virulence factors and toxins at a maximal rate φ*k<sub>D</sub>, modulated by a sigmoidal relationship between damage factor production and microbe density to reflect a process like quorum sensing controls on virulence factor production. As with immunity, there is a carrying capacity imposed on damage effectors. This could reflect either negative feedbacks on further effector production at high effector densities or a bottleneck limiting flux through the system. The parameter σ<sub>D</sub> reflects the microbe density that produces a half-maximal induction rate. Damage effectors degrade at rate ρ. Immunopathology and damage effectors deplete health (H) at rates γ and α, respectively, while hosts can recover health according to a sigmoidal relationship with current health (reflecting the difficulty of achieving recovery at low health due to organ failure and other catastrophe) at rate z. “Death” is called when health dips below 10% of maximum (k<sub>H</sub>).

<title>50 fuzzy c-means clusters.</title>
<p>All differentially expressed genes were clustered into 50 fuzzy c-means clusters. Prior to clustering, data were standardized to have a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of one. The 50 fuzzy c-means groups were then manually curated into groups of similar expression patterns. Each line represents mean gene expression. Blue represents uninfected control. Red represents infected and no treatment. Green represents infected and ampicillin-treated. Cluster numbers highlighted in red contain mortality genes, and cluster numbers highlighted in green contain recovery genes.</p>
