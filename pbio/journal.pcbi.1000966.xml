<p>We used a multi-round, two-party exchange game in which a healthy subject played a subject diagnosed with a DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistics Manual-IV) disorder, and applied a Bayesian clustering approach to the behavior exhibited by the healthy subject. The goal was to characterize quantitatively the style of play elicited in the healthy subject (the proposer) by their DSM-diagnosed partner (the responder). The approach exploits the dynamics of the behavior elicited in the healthy proposer as a biosensor for cognitive features that characterize the psychopathology group at the other side of the interaction. Using a large cohort of subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 574), we found statistically significant clustering of proposers' behavior overlapping with a range of DSM-IV disorders including autism spectrum disorder, borderline personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and major depressive disorder. To further validate these results, we developed a computer agent to replace the human subject in the proposer role (the biosensor) and show that it can also detect these same four DSM-defined disorders. These results suggest that the highly developed social sensitivities that humans bring to a two-party social exchange can be exploited and automated to detect important psychopathologies, using an interpersonal behavioral probe not directly related to the defining diagnostic criteria.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Human social interaction is exquisitely complex, and perturbed social interaction is a hallmark of psychological pathogy. When someone has a psychological disorder the focus is generally on their behavior, but this behavior is rarely something displayed in isolation and typically induces profound changes in the people interacting with the disturbed individual. In this work we asked if the behavior of one person in a simple two-person economic exchange game is sensitive to features that could classify the pathology of their partner. We analyzed a large group of previously recorded interactions involving healthy persons and people diagnosed with a variety of psychological disorders, and found that a healthy person's behavior is indeed quantitatively and systematically influenced by their partner's pathology. These results could ultimately lead to a different way of understanding and diagnosing psychological disease.</p>

<title>Fairness games as probes for social exchange</title>
<p>Social interactions among humans reflect the execution of some of the most important and complex behavioral software with which humans are endowed. Consequently, we should expect the computations involved in human social exchange to be subtle and perhaps even difficult to expose and study in controlled settings. However, exposing these computations is crucial if we are to improve our characterization and understanding of normal human cognitive function and dysfunction.</p>
<p>In recent years, the components of social exchange in healthy subjects have been probed using interactive economic exchange games <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Trivers1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Singer1">[8]</xref>. These games typically involve two subjects interacting for one or multiple rounds through the exchange of monetary gestures to one another. For our purposes here, these games require three classes of computation be intact and functioning in the minds of the interacting subjects. They require that each subject can (1) compute norms for what is fair in each exchange, (2) detect deviations in monetary gestures that deviate from these norms, and (3) choose actions predicated on such deviations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Camerer1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Roth1">[15]</xref>. These experimental probes have been used previously in the area of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics, but here we show that the behavioral gestures elicited in the context of economic exchange games can be used to classify certain psychopathologies. The twist in our effort here is that we use a data-driven approach examining the reactions of the healthy partner as a kind of biosensor while playing an exchange game with a subject possessing a psychopathology.</p>

<title>Multi-round trust game</title>
<p>In this paper, we used a multi-round fairness game played by pairs (“dyads”) of interacting humans to extract behavioral phenotypes defined by the dynamics of play exhibited over the 10 rounds of a complete game <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-KingCasas1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-KingCasas2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Tomlin1">[16]</xref>. The game we employ is called a <italic>trust game</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Camerer3">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Berg1">[19]</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000966-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. In the 10-round trust game, one player (called the <italic>investor</italic> or the <italic>proposer</italic>) is endowed with 20 monetary units and chooses to send some fraction <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to their partner (called the <italic>trustee</italic> or the <italic>responder</italic>). The amount sent is tripled to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the way to the trustee. The trustee decides which fraction <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to return in response to the investor, thus each round is represented by two numbers: the investment fraction <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the repayment fraction <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. All the rules are transparent to both players. The game is played for 10 rounds and the repeated exchanges allow the players to build models of what to expect from their partner providing that their capacity to sense, model, and respond to their partner's decisions is intact.</p>

<p>A) Depiction of Multi-Round Trust Task. A ten round task in which two players, an investor and a trustee, undergo repeated interactions. Adapted from previous publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-KingCasas1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-KingCasas2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Tomlin1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Chiu1">[20]</xref>. B&amp;C) Our Approach. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Houser2">[23]</xref>, we cluster investor-trustee dyads based on a regression of previous choices in the trust game. Specifically, we predict ratios of investment <italic>i<sub>t</sub></italic> in round <italic>t</italic> as a polynomial of past rounds of investment and return. The number of clusters, order of polynomial, and number of rounds back on which to base this dependence are all taken as free parameters in the model.</p>

<p>In most of the dyads, the subjects were given no information about their partner and did not meet or speak to the partner before, during, or after the task. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Tomlin1">[16]</xref>, we also included “personal” dyads, in which the partners met before the task, were instructed together, and saw a picture of their partner during each round.</p>
</sec><sec id="s1c">
<title>Biosensor hypothesis</title>
<p>The basic approach of this paper derives from our prior work showing that this same game elicits unique behavioral phenotypes when a game is played between a healthy investor and a trustee diagnosed with a range of DSM-defined disorders – Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Chiu1">[20]</xref>, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-KingCasas1">[6]</xref>, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Chiu1">[20]</xref>. In all these studies, we noticed that the behavioral differences affect not only the trustee, but also a healthy investor who plays with this trustee.</p>
<p>A similar conclusion that a healthy subject is sensing the psychological nature of the opponent during play was obtained in a recent paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Yoshida1">[21]</xref>, where it was shown that a subject can gauge the strategic sophistication of the opponent in repeated play of a complex stag hunt game.</p>
<p>These observations suggested the hypothesis that the healthy (or typical) investor's behavior might be used to ‘read out’ features that could characterize the psychopathology group playing in the trustee role. This possibility was also suggested by the nature of the interpersonal interaction enforced by the game. In any multi-round interaction with another human, a player's choices are rather dramatically entangled with those of her partner. In addition, although the game is characterized by two numbers per exchange (investment and repayment ratio), it does require players to have several cognitive capacities intact to accomplish a ‘normal’ exchange. These include short-term and working memory, sufficiently accurate models of what to expect from another human in this exchange, appropriate sensitivity to positive and negative social signals, and intact capacity to respond to such signals. Collectively, these observations support the basic hypothesis that humans bring highly developed social sensitivities to two-party interactions that might be profitably exploited as a biological “sensor” (<italic>biosensor</italic>) – first using a human proposer (investor) and later capturing this behavior in a computer agent.</p>

<title>Available data</title>
<p>We analyze the results of 287 dyads, in which healthy participants play against healthy trustees, as well as against the trustees that have four different disorders: ASD, BPD, MDD, and ADHD. Each subject played only one game. With the exception of some patients with BPD, participants with disorders were not medicated. A detailed description of the data is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s007">Table S1</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Bayesian classification of multi-round social exchange</title>
<p>We sought to classify the dynamics using only the numbers exchanged in the game between players (investment and repayment ratios), the number of “types” or styles of play (number of clusters), and the functional dependence of the next investment on preceding investment and repayment ratios. In short, we sought a heavily data-driven approach.</p>
<p>We extended a previously published method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Houser1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Houser2">[23]</xref> to cluster available trust game data. This method uses a regression approach to the functional dependence that clusters individuals based on coefficients of the regression. This method has advantages over traditional clustering approaches: (i) the number of types in our population is estimated directly from the data, and (ii) classification uncertainty is captured by probabilities rather than categorical cluster assignments. An investor is not classified as either within or not within a cluster, but instead a probability of being in a cluster is computed. This allows us to identify clusters where a style of behavior (a type) is over-represented (in comparison with what is expected by chance), under-represented, or neither (see below for details of this calculation).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Data-driven modeling of two-party social exchange in the trust game</title>
<p>The basic model is determined directly from the numbers exchanged by the two players during the game. We model the healthy proposer's investment at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a function of preceding investment and repayment ratios. In this “black-box”, regression approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Houser1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Houser2">[23]</xref>, we assume that we can capture meaningful variations in types of investor play by using a regression model based only on previous investment and return ratios, in contrast to other approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Yoshida1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Hampton1">[24]</xref> which commit to more explicit models of how these values are used in mental processes to generate behavior.</p>
<p>It is known that an arbitrary continuous function can be approximated, with any given accuracy, by a polynomial of an appropriate order. As a result, a widely used approach to describe such functions is to try polynomial dependence of increasing order. For a first order dependence of the current investment <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on previous investments and repayments the model is:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e008" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indexes the subject and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indexes the current round of the game. For a second order dependence of the current proposer investment on previous investments and repayments, this expression would accrue all possible second order terms in lagged investments and repayments, including terms of the type <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that describe interaction between investments and repayments. Such terms acknowledge that the current choice by the investor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is entangled with their previous interactions with their partner. Although expression 1 depicts a first order dependence on previous investments and repayments extending back two rounds of the game, in this paper, we do not pre-commit to the exact functional dependence for the current proposer investment nor to the number of exchanges into the past that best predict the person's current decision. Instead, we assume a general polynomial dependence of the current investment ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on previous investments and repayments, and determine the order of this polynomial dependence directly from the data. Similarly, we determine the number of rounds into the past required to predict optimally the person's current investment ratio from previous investment and repayment ratios. The details of this general approach follow.</p>
<p>Formally, we model the behavior as a mixture of regressions. For a fixed order of polynomial dependence <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a fixed look-back window <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and a fixed number of clusters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we assume a single investor's data is given by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an investor's (8-dimensional) vector of investments (we consider models looking back as many as two rounds; to make the models comparable we only consider 8 investments), <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the model matrix of independent variables defining the regression (all less than or equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-degree monomials in lagged investments and repayments going back <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rounds), <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th cluster's regression coefficients, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the variance of the error term in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th cluster, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the weight assigned to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-th cluster, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the multivariate normal, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the identity matrix.</p>
<p>This behavior model is applied to the data from the whole group, with the data itself determining both the appropriate subdivision into clusters and the regression coefficients within each cluster.</p>

<title>Characterizing corresponding social behavior</title>
<p>With the clusters defined as described, we sought to characterize the kinds of social gestures (signals sent across rounds and between players) that define them. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000966-g005">Figure 5</xref>, we summarize the across-round social gestures for each cluster in terms of the regression coefficients for the investment and repayment ratios and the constant term (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

Notice that in Cluster 4, the dependence is dominated by the constant term; this term reflects universally high investments. In Cluster 4, investors playing subjects with major depressive disorder are over-represented. The other over-represented group in Cluster 4 are investors playing trustees that they meet before the game and whose pictures they see each round of the exchange. It is interesting to note that investors playing subjects with ASD end up over-represented in the same cluster (Cluster 2) as investors playing subjects in an impersonal version of the game – where subjects do not meet nor see each other.</p>

<title>Computer agents as investor-side biosensor</title>
<p>The above results provide evidence that examining investor-side behavior provides a new kind of ‘readout’ for some important psychopathology groups studied under the probe of the multi-round trust game. The game itself, although simple (in each round only two numbers are exchanged), requires a number of intact cognitive functions including working memory, short-term memory, the capacity to model and predict the partner's likely response, the capacity to sense deviations from these expectations, good a priori models of human trade instincts (reflected by round one offers and responses), and so on. One value of this approach is that it utilizes a probe that is not directly related to the symptom lists that define DSM classifications, and therefore provides a possible alternative method of classifying some psychopathologies – or at least identifying or isolating some of their malfunctioning computations.</p>
<p>To verify the robustness of the clustering algorithm we employed a previously described computer agent designed to play the trustee role.</p>
<p>The possibility to design agents of this type was shown in our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-KingCasas1">[6]</xref>. The corresponding “<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbor” agents use the database containing the results of all the rounds of all the dyads. A <italic>healthy trustee agent</italic>, to describe how much to repay, looks at the vector of 6 previous choices (last 3 investments and last 3 repayments) and finds, of all the records with healthy trustees, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> situations in which corresponding previous choices were the closest (in the Euclidean distance). Out of the 6 recorded outcomes of these closest situations, the agent selects one with equal probability. A <italic>BPD trustee agent</italic> similarly selects from dyads with a BPD trustee.</p>
<p>These trustee agents were validated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-KingCasas1">[6]</xref>: in interaction with healthy human investors, the BPD agent was shown to reproduce accurately ruptures in cooperation normally observed when a healthy investor plays a BPD trustee. Such ruptures were not observed in healthy investors playing a healthy computer trustee.</p>
<p>In our case, we need to supplement these agents with a similar <italic>investor agent</italic> that select the investment value based on the 6 closest dyads. Our hypothesis is that the same correlation with disorders can be detected by players playing against the investor agent.</p>
<p>Since it was already shown that the trustee agents adequately describe the trustee behavior, we had healthy investor agent play either the healthy or BPD trustee agent in the trust task for ten rounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000966-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) 1,000 times. These interactions were then assigned to the previously determined clusters using the posterior distribution of parameters generated from the analysis of the human dyads (see details in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). Notably, interactions between the BPD trustee and healthy investor agent were statistically significantly over-represented by 7.19 standard deviations in Cluster 3 – the same cluster in which investors playing both medicated and non-medicated individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder are over-represented. On the other hand, interactions between the healthy investor and healthy trustee agents were not statistically significantly over-represented in this same cluster; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000966-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s003">Figure S3</xref>.</p>

<title>Agent-vs-agent validation of clustering scheme.</title>
<p>A) Depiction of agent-vs-agent trust task. Specifically, a k-nearest neighbors agent that samples healthy investor behavior plays the multi-round trust game against a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors agent that samples healthy or BPD trustee behavior for ten rounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-KingCasas1">[6]</xref>. B) Depiction of the space of sampled interactions. The sampling agent uses the records of investment and return from the trust game as played by either (i) healthy trustees, (ii) healthy investors, or (iii) BPD trustees depending on the specific agent used. The agent starts with a vector representing several immediate past choices for the game that is currently playing (this vector forms the center of the circle), and selects several records for which the corresponding vectors have the smallest Euclidean distance to the current vector (these vectors are inside the circle). C) The sampling agent finds the next investment (or return) ratios for all the closest recorded game trajectories. In Panel C, these ratios represent <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. D) The agent then selects, with equal probability, one of these “next” ratios and returns it as the investment (or return) ratio for the game that is currently playing.</p>

<p>Thus, for BPD, the same correlation between the statistical clustering and disorders can indeed be achieved by using the investor agents (For the ASD group, there were insufficient data (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to develop an analogous trustee agent and so no validation along this psychopathology was possible at this time).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have used a data-driven, Bayesian regression approach to cluster the healthy investor behavioral data from a large set of 287 trust interactions, which included trustees from several DSM mental-illness groups. The Bayesian approach allowed us to determine in a principled way the number of clusters in our population (four) and probabilities for each dyad to belong to each cluster. Next, we used a chi-square criterion for over/under-representation to determine which pre-defined DSM-IV groups are statistically significantly over- and under-represented in each cluster. We found that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the resulting clusters and the DSM-IV disorders: namely, dyads in which trustees have a certain DSM-IV disorder are over-representedin the corresponding cluster.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a correlation between the severity of each disorder and the probability of belonging to the correpsonding cluster.</p>
<p>The finding that a trustee's disorder can be detected based on the investor's behavior is in line with the fact that in any multi-round interaction with another human, a player's choices are dramatically entangled with those of her partner. Humans bring highly developed social sensitivities to two-party interactions. Our results show that these sensitivities can serve as a <italic>biosensor</italic> – the quantitative behavioral dynamics of a healhy person can capture the subtle behavioral abnormalities (abnormalities that are difficult to capture by the usual statistical analysis) of her partner.</p>
<p>To further validate our approach, we used a previously described <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-nearest neighbor sampling agent, as well as its implementation in the investor role, to simulate healthy vs healthy and healthy vs BPD interactions. We showed that healthy vs. BPD agent interactions were over-represented in the same cluster as healthy vs BPD individuals, whereas the healthy vs. healthy agent interactions were under-represented in this cluster.</p>
<p>Having arrived at an initial validation of our clustering, one can ask what further information can we extract from our method. Specifically, what do the patterns of play (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000966-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and polynomial coefficients used to predict investor behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000966-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) tell us about the behavior of individuals in each group?</p>
<p>We start with the fourth, and smallest, cluster. This cluster over-represents (i) dyads who met before playing the trust game as well as (ii) healthy investors playing trustees with Major Depressive Disorder. In this cluster, investment ratios are very high, and return ratios, in comparison to other clusters, are also high. For this “trust cluster”, the constant term effectively dominates the polynomial predicting the investment ratio.</p>
<p>The third, next largest, cluster, over-represents both medicated and non-medicated individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder. In this cluster, both investment and return ratios are relatively low.</p>
<p>The second cluster over-represents adolescents with Autism-Spectrum Disorder. The difference in pattern of play between this cluster and cluster one is difficult to detect by simply looking at the round by round average investment and repayment levels. Notably, the two clusters separate individuals with Autism-Spectrum Disorder from individuals with ADHD, two disorders that are often difficult to separate because they share several symptoms. One of the advantages of our method is that we arrive not only at clusters, but also at polynomial coefficients that can be used to predict investment ratios in each cluster. By looking at these coefficients, one can see a characterizing feature of cluster two - specifically, the current investment ratio depends strongly on the ratios of investment and return one round back. It is known that reciprocity is a driving signal in the trust game <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Dempster1">[25]</xref>, and that the sensitivity to reciprocity of individuals with Autism-Spectrum Disorder is blunted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Lord1">[28]</xref>. The investor behavior in cluster may be an adaptation to this diminished sensitivity.</p>
<p>While our results show the statistically significant biosensing of certain disorders, the resulting clustering does not provide us with a clear diagnostics – since each cluster contains, in addition to individuals with the corresponding disorder, also a large number of healthy individuals; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s011">Table S5</xref>. The fact that we did not get a clear separation between normal participants and participants with disorders (i.e. we find healthy participants scattered across the cluster) points to two distinctly different ways to approach psychopathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Trull1">[30]</xref>. One possibility is that psychopathology groups are reflections of “quantitative” differences along normal cognitive dimensions (and their correlations) that are probed by our interpersonal exchange game. The second is that the first possibility holds but is augmented by the fact that psychopathology groups bring extra (or fewer) or different cognitive dimensions to the responses elicited by the game (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s004">Figure S4</xref>). To shed light on this issue in the context of this task, we clustered the healthy dyads alone and then assigned the disordered dyads to these clusters. The algorithm again selected 4 as the optimal number of clusters, 1 as the polynomial order, and 2 as the lookback length, but the assignment of the disordered dyads to the clusters is somewhat different than in the main result (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s012">Table S6</xref>). For BPD dyads the overrepresentation result is stronger, but for the other groups it is weaker. Also, while the betas of the regression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s013">Table S7</xref>) are quite similar in three of the clusters, the fourth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s005">Figure S5</xref>) is substantially different. Finally, the cluster assignments of the healthy dyads are in good concordance across the two clusterings (adjusted Rand index of .94 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Hubert1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Fraley1">[33]</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s014">Table S8</xref>). Taken together, these facts suggest that the second view of psychopathology mentioned above is to be favored in this task, and that as far as this behavioral probe is concerned the disordered individuals are qualitatively different.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a seemingly more direct classification – based directly on the return values – does not lead to such a statistically significant correlation between clusters and disorders: many differences between healthy and pathological trustees cannot be detected against the background of other behavioral differences; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s015">Table S9</xref>. This shows that humans acting as biosensors have the ability to “filter out” the important differences – and thus, help in diagnosing psychopathologies.</p>
<p>To summarize: we have data from 287 dyads involved in one such task - the trust game. We use a data-driven, agnostic method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Houser1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Houser2">[23]</xref> to arrive at (i) the number of clusters, (ii) the order of the polynomial that predicts investment ratios, and (iii) the number of rounds prior on which investor decisions depend directly from the data. We then arrived at a probabilistic clustering of these dyads, and analyzed over-representation of initial groups in the new clusters. We found that, by clustering dyads based on investor decisions, we were able to over-represent trustees with different disorders in separate clusters. Further, we used previously described k-nearest neighbor sampling agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-KingCasas1">[6]</xref> to generate 1000 interactions each for healthy vs healthy and healthy vs BPD agents. By clustering these interactions based on the polynomial coefficients from our initial clusters, we found that simulated healthy vs BPD interactions are statistically significantly over-represented in the same cluster as real healthy vs BPD interactions, but that simulated healthy vs healthy interactions are statistically significantly under-represented in the same cluster. We believe that these results constitute a significant step forward in quantitative diagnosis of psychiatric illness. The fact that brain images have helped in the analysis of human behavior in fairness games <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Rilling1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Singer1">[8]</xref> makes us believe that our diagnoses can be further refined by using the corresponding brain imaging data.</p>
<p>Current psychiatric diagnoses are based on the DSM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-American1">[34]</xref>. Essentially, these are lists of criteria used by a trained physician to characterize whether or not a person has a specific disorder. Such clinical, experience-based classification schemes provide a valuable understanding of psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, to uncover genetic underpinnings of various psychiatric disorders and to provide quantitative behavioral and neural measures, it is desirable to have quantitative measures of normal social interactions that can expose computations perturbed in various psychopathologies. Such measures could then be used to quantify abnormalities in social exchange, to diagnose psychiatric and neurological disorders, and to probe the genetic basis of such disorders. The results presented in this paper show some of our first steps in this direction; however, as more data on this and similar parametric social exchange tasks becomes available it should help to construct a quantitative understanding of mental disorders.</p>

<title>Additional observations</title>
<p>Intuitively, one might expect the investment on the next round to be an interactive function of both previous investment and the repayment the investor received, rather than independent effects of each. However, our analysis shows that the optimal clustering corresponds to polynomials of order <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e., to the linear dependence (1). This means that, contrary to this intuition, the second-order terms – in particular, interaction terms between investments and repayments (such as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) – do not lead to a statistically significant improvement of the model's explanatory power.</p>
<p>For patients diagnosed with a DSM-IV disorder, medication is an important potential confound. In our study, only some BPD patients were medicated. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000966-g002">Figure 2</xref>, both medicated and non-medicated BPD patients were statistically significantly over-represented in the corresponding Cluster 3. Thus, the presence or absence of medication does not affect our classification.</p>
<p>In this paper, we use a purely data-driven approach to data analysis. This approach is important from the foundational viewpoint, since it enables us, in particular, to further confirm the objective nature of the existing psychopathology classification. From the practical viewpoint, once this classification is established, we can improve the diagnostic efficiency if we explicitly use the known diagnoses in classification and regression analysis. For example, this may make it possible to find the markers that identify healthy subjects with superior discriminatory power.</p>

<title>Bayesian classification: Optimal parameters</title>
<p>We used the Laplace-Metropolis estimator of the marginal likelihood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Lewis1">[37]</xref>, as described in Houser, Keane, and McCabe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Houser2">[23]</xref>, to compare models with different values of the number K of clusters, order P of the polynomials, and the number D of past rounds on which the model depends. We did not include any results in which 2 of 3 samplers arrived at at least one empty type in the mode of the last 5,000 of 8,000 draws from the posterior. To maximize marginal likelihood (i.e., to find a posterior mode), we used component-wise optimization (also known as conditional maximization or step-wise ascent; see, e.g., p. 312 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Gelman1">[38]</xref>), the use of which is well-established for Bayesian problems such as maximizing the posterior mode, and arrived at the same answer when comparing the maximum log marginal likelihoods for different models. As a result, we concluded that the optimal model has <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> clusters, a first order polynomial <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and a dependence of ratios of investment on ratios of investment and return <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rounds into the past.</p>
<p>We found that, in contrast to the simpler case described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Houser2">[23]</xref>, our marginal likelihood values are sometimes fairly close to one another in many cases and thus, the results of comparing these values can potentially change if we repeat the same computational experiment. To makes sure that our selection of 4 clusters does not change, we supplemented the conditional maximization by the exhaustive analysis of all possible triples <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with up to 10 clusters, polynomials of order 1 to 3, and a time dependence of 1 or 2 rounds into the past. For each such model, we used several samplers and got several values of marginal likelihoods; when we compare two models, we select the simpler one (the one with fewest overall parameters) unless the other one has a statistically significantly larger mean. Since for the same model <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000966.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the distribution of marginal likelihood values is sometimes not Gaussian (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s006">Figure S6B</xref>), we could not use the usual t-test.

<p>Model selection. We present log marginal likelihoods estimated using the method of Lewis-Raftery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Lewis1">[37]</xref> from 9 samplers for each choice of number of clusters K, look-back rounds D, and order of polynomial P describing the dependence of investment ratios in a given round on investment &amp; return ratios in prior rounds. We sort all models by the number of model parameters, and discard models for which &gt; = 6 have an empty type in the mode of all 5,000 draws from the posterior (after the first 3,000 is discarded as burn-in). We used the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Wilcoxon1">[39]</xref> to compare a given model's median log marginal likelihood with that of each model with fewer parameters. We chose the model (red) with the largest marginal likelihood for which we can guarantee that it is better than all parsimonious models. We report, in the right-hand column, for each model, the number of the first model for which we cannot guarantee the marginal likelihood is superior; that is, either (i) the median of this model is lower than the median of the model # in this column or (ii) the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as implemented in MATLAB R14 SP3 (Natick, MA), does not reject the null hypothesis that the medians of the log marginal likelihoods for the two different models come from the same distribution at a 95% significance level. Please also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000966.s005">Figure S5</xref>. For the case of two models: K = 4, D = 2, P = 1 and K = 3, D = 2, P = 1, we performed an analysis using 3 samplers to compare the method of marginal likelihood used above based on the posterior mode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Dempster1">[25]</xref> with a method, the mean harmonic estimator, that is based on using all draws from the posterior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000966-Gelman1">[38]</xref> for a detailed review of this and other methods of calculating marginal likelihoods and model selection). We found, for the median value of 3 samplers for each model, the log marginal likelihood for the Lewis-Raftery method preferred the K = 4, D = 2, P = 1 model by 36.64 units, whereas the mean harmonic estimator preferred the K = 4, D = 2, P = 1 model by 52.99 units. Thus, the two estimates are in good agreement, further justifying our use of the well-established Lewis-Raftery method.</p>

<p>Relation between clusters based on all dyads and clusters based on only healthy trustees. This table shows that for dyads with healthy trustees, there is a concordance between their cluster assignments across the two clusterings: when we cluster all dyads and when we only cluster dyads with healthy trustees. Of all the healthy dyads which were assigned to Cluster 1 in the clustering based on all the dyads, 100% got assigned to Cluster 1 in the healthy-trustees-only clustering. Of all the healthy dyads which were assigned to Cluster 2 in the clustering based on all the dyads, 91.9% got assigned to Cluster 2 in the healthy-trustees-only clustering. Of all the healthy dyads which were assigned to Cluster 3 in the clustering based on all the dyads, 95.0% got assigned to Cluster 3 in the healthy-trustees-only clustering. Of all the healthy dyads which were assigned to Cluster 4 in the clustering based on all the dyads, 89.5% got assigned to Cluster 4 in the healthy-trustees-only clustering.</p>

<p>Clustering based on the investment ratios vs. clustering based on the return ratios. For clustering based on the investment ratios, different optimization techniques lead to the same optimal number of clusters K = 4. For clustering based on the investment ratios, different optimization techniques lead to different numbers of clusters: K = 2 and K = 5. For each of the corresponding three clusterings, for each of the four pathologies, we list of largest over-representation and, in parenthesis, the number of the cluster in which this over-representation occurs. A blank slot means that the corresponding pathology is not over-represented in any of the clusters. According to our computations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section), only over-estimations of 1.5 and larger are statistically significant. For clustering based on the investment ratios, all overrepresentations are statistically significant, and different pathology groups are overrepresented in different clusters - i.e., this clustering provides a statistically significant separation of different pathologies. For clusterings based on the return ratios, not all overrepresentations are statistically significant, and some groups are overrepresented in the same cluster.</p>
