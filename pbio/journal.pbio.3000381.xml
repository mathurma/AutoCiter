<abstract>
<p>The primary cilium is a central signaling hub in cell proliferation and differentiation and is built and disassembled every cell cycle in many animal cells. Disassembly is critically important, as misregulation or delay of cilia loss leads to cell cycle defects. The physical means by which cilia are lost are poorly understood but are thought to involve resorption of ciliary components into the cell body. To investigate cilium loss in mammalian cells, we used live-cell imaging to comprehensively characterize individual events. The predominant mode of cilium loss was rapid deciliation, in which the membrane and axoneme of the cilium was shed from the cell. Gradual resorption was also observed, as well as events in which a period of gradual resorption was followed by rapid deciliation. Deciliation resulted in intact shed cilia that could be recovered from culture medium and contained both membrane and axoneme proteins. We modulated levels of katanin and intracellular calcium, two putative regulators of deciliation, and found that excess katanin promotes cilia loss by deciliation, independently of calcium. Together, these results suggest that mammalian ciliary loss involves a tunable decision between deciliation and resorption.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cilia are present in all branches of the eukarya. These organelles are adapted to generate motion and facilitate interactions between cells and their surrounding environment through the transduction of molecular and mechanical signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref003">3</xref>]. All cilia share a core architecture consisting of a basal body (centriole), an axoneme of stable microtubule doublets, and a ciliary membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref006">6</xref>]. In many cases, including vertebrate primary cilia and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> motile cilia, the cilium is closely linked with cell cycle stage, generally forming in interphase (G0) and disassembling at some point prior to mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref012">12</xref>]. Misregulation or delay in primary cilia loss leads to defects in cell cycle progression, which underlie aberrant developmental and homeostatic phenotypes in ciliopathies and many cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite recent progress in the identification of molecular players and pathways regulating primary cilia disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref036">36</xref>], the physical mechanisms by which mammalian cilia are ultimately lost have not been identified. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, cilia are resorbed into the cell body preceding cell division with rates of approximately 0.3–0.7 μm/min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref045">45</xref>]. Alternatively, conditions of stress or pharmacological induction have been shown to trigger comparatively rapid removal of cilia, defined as the concurrent release of membrane and axoneme from the cell body. This phenomenon has been described in many species as deciliation, ciliary excision, shedding, deflagellation, or flagellar autotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref053">53</xref>]. Whether deciliation occurs as part of normal primary cilium behavior and contributes to cell cycle–linked cilia loss is unknown. In this work, we use long-term live-cell imaging to determine how these physical mechanisms (resorption or deciliation) contribute to mammalian cell cycle–associated cilia loss.</p>

<title>Ciliary structures in cells undergoing serum-induced cilium loss</title>
<p>To assess the physical processes underlying ciliary loss, we observed ciliary morphology in a population of mammalian cells entering the cell cycle. We manipulated serum level in the culture medium to synchronize ciliary behavior in inner medullary collecting duct 3 (IMCD3) cells expressing somatostatin receptor 3::green fluorescent protein (SSTR3::GFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref055">55</xref>], a fluorescent plasma membrane marker that is enriched in the ciliary membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). The majority of serum-starved cells (60 +/− 9.09%) were ciliated. Subsequent serum stimulation for 6 hrs resulted in a decrease in the fraction of cells with a cilium (30 +/− 0.4%) to levels comparable to asynchronously cycling cells. Serum-induced cilium loss requires the function of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a deacetylase of tubulin and cortactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref034">34</xref>]. Cells treated with 2 μM tubacin, an HDAC6 inhibitor, failed to undergo serum-induced ciliary loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref057">57</xref>]. Mitotic cells accumulated following serum stimulation, but this accumulation was inhibited or delayed in tubacin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), consistent with a requirement for ciliary loss prior to mitotic entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref060">60</xref>]. Thus, serum stimulation induces semisynchronous, HDAC6-mediated, cell cycle–linked ciliary loss in these cells.</p>

<p>We next characterized cilia morphology in fixed cells over a 6-hr serum-stimulation time course. We identified three major types of noncanonical ciliary structures as likely loss intermediates in fixed cells expressing SSTR3::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g001">Fig 1C–1G</xref>): 1) a discontinuous axoneme, marked by a gap in acetylated tubulin (acTub) staining in all z-planes (“Discontinuous acTub,” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g001">Fig 1C</xref>); 2) a ciliary stub, characterized by a short (&lt;1 μm) cilium positive for both acTub and SSTR3 membrane fluorescence (“acTub+ SSTR3+ Stub,” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g001">Fig 1D</xref>); and 3) an axoneme marked by linear acTub fluorescence (&gt;1 μm) but lacking corresponding membrane SSTR3 fluorescence (“acTub+ SSTR3−,” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). All intermediate structures were rare in serum-starved cells but at 1–2 hr after serum stimulation comprised the majority of detectable cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Tubacin treatment prevented the enrichment of all three structures in serum-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), indicating that these structures are most likely representative of disassembling cilia.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Rapid deciliation is the predominant mode of ciliary loss</title>
<p>These results suggested that ciliary-loss behaviors within a single-cell population might be variable, so we used live-cell imaging to observe individual cilia-loss events. We generated IMCD3-SSTR3::GFP cells that stably coexpress a centrosome marker (mCherry-PACT) to identify the position of the basal body. Live cells were imaged immediately following serum stimulation, with full confocal stacks acquired continuously for 6–12 hrs at 90-sec intervals (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>). Apically-facing cilia were selected for analysis to avoid artifacts caused by deformations of basally-facing cilia by interactions with the culture substrate. Control serum-starved cells subjected to this imaging regime retained their cilia over 6 hrs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and exhibited only a slight decrease in length over 12 hrs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), suggesting that imaging itself does not stimulate cilium-loss dynamics. The mean standard deviation of variation between consecutive length measurements was 1.53 μm, likely reflecting measurement error intrinsic to 3D visualization with our spatiotemporal resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). These metrics in serum-starved cells were used as baseline controls for serum-induced ciliary loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2A.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Image sequences of cells undergoing cilia loss revealed a striking range of dynamic behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s007">S1 Movie</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s008">S2 Movie</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s009">S3 Movie</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s010">S4 Movie</xref>). We grouped these behaviors into three categories: Gradual, cilium length reduction over at least two consecutive time points resulting in terminal cilium loss (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2A.2</xref>; 0.02 μm/min; T<sub>start</sub> ≠ T<sub>final-1</sub>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s002">S2 Fig</xref>); Instant, a single discrete cilium-loss event within a single-imaging frame, i.e., 30–90 sec (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2A.3</xref>; ≥4.72 μm/min L<sub>final-1</sub> &gt; 1.5 μm); and Combined, a period of Gradual disassembly directly followed by Instant loss (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2A.4</xref>; Gradual phase [0.03 μm/min], preceding rapid loss within 46 seconds, ≥5.69 μm/min). To reduce bias in our cumulative analysis, we developed an algorithm to normalize ciliary length fluctuations to controls, identify an event start point, and assign each event to one of the three categories described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref> for full description of algorithm strategy). Length curves were normalized by time (to 1,000 arbitrary units) and ciliary length (to the maximum length of each cilium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref>). The Gradual averaged curve shows early ciliary shortening with event start points distributed along the curve, followed by a period of consistent shortening in the last approximately 150 normalized time units as the slope of the curve increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The Instant averaged curve appears nearly flat until the last point; start points were nearly all clustered in the last approximately 10 normalized time units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). The Combined averaged curve features a period of slight slope characteristic of Gradual dynamics followed by an Instant cilia-loss event, with start points distributed along the curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Cilia-loss events occurred throughout the entire 12-hr imaging window; hourly frequency of event start points and end points are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s002">S2D–S2G Fig</xref>. These results demonstrate asynchronicity and further heterogeneity of cilia-loss behaviors. However, end points (completion of cilia loss) were most frequent between 1–3 hrs post serum addition, consistent with the enrichment of noncanonical ciliary structures observed in fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), further supporting that these structures are intermediates of cilia-loss events. The nature of individual loss events did not change consistently over time, suggesting that factors other than time after serum stimulation influence cilia-loss mechanism.</p>
<p>Ciliary-loss rates spanned several orders of magnitude (10<sup>−3</sup>−10<sup>1</sup> μm/min), with the slowest Gradual events occurring over several hours, and the fastest Instant events (10<sup>1</sup> μm/min) occurring in less than 90 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Within the Combined category, the rate of the first Gradual step (0.08 μm/min ± 0.26) and second Instant step (3.41 μm/min ± 2.10) were not significantly different from those of the Gradual-only (0.08 μm/min ± 0.11) and Instant-only (3.88 μm/min ± 1.80) rates, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Further, the majority of ciliary length (72.6 ± 4.5%) was lost during the Instant stage. Thus, Combined ciliary loss likely represents both Gradual and Instant mechanisms occurring within one loss event, rather than an independent third behavior with biphasic dynamics.</p>
<p>Strikingly, we found that the Instant and Combined groups together comprised 84% (<italic>n</italic> = 69) of the observed events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Thus, events with Instant dynamics, which occur within seconds, are the predominant behavior for terminal ciliary loss in our experimental conditions. Rates of Gradual loss were heterogeneous but approximately consistent with previously reported rates of resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref044">44</xref>], while Instant dynamics were significantly more rapid than would be expected for resorption. To test whether Instant loss dynamics might be consistent with what has previously been described as deciliation, we examined the dynamics of deciliation induced by dibucaine, which likely acts by raising intracellular calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref061">61</xref>]. Dibucaine-induced deciliation had qualitative features and a dynamic profile similar to serum-induced Instant loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s003">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2A.2</xref>). Therefore, we propose that deciliation is the physical mechanism underlying Instant cilia loss.</p>
<p>In a rare instance, we observed direct shedding of the entire visible cilium from the surface of a serum-stimulated cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s011">S5 Movie</xref>). The shed cilium in the z-stack shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3A</xref> has a fragmented appearance. Due to the rapid timescale of the shedding event, the shed cilium can travel a considerable distance (&gt;1 μm) in the time between individual z-slices (roughly 2.6 seconds) within the stack. As a result, the shift in apparent location of the same object in subsequent slices causes the final imaged object to appear distorted—artificially elongated or with the appearance of separated fragments. We note that the segments in such sequences were visualized as a comigrating cluster, rather than dispersing independently, consistent with the interpretation that they are parts of one structure imaged at slightly different times. Therefore, we interpret the fragmented appearance of the cilium in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3A</xref> as the result of motion of the imaged object during acquisition, rather than a biological change in morphology, and suggest that these images represent a deciliation event.</p>

<p>The rapid nature of the deciliation event shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3A</xref> (&lt;54 seconds) and the diffusion of the shed ciliary remnant(s) away from the site of origin is consistent with the Instant loss dynamics found in 84% of serum-induced disassembly events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2G</xref>) and in dibucaine-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In addition, cilia shed under our culture conditions from cells expressing mCherry-α-tubulin contained tubulin in shed ciliary fragments (imaged at 30-second intervals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) suggesting that the axoneme is shed together with the ciliary membrane. These results further support the hypothesis that Instant cilium loss represents ciliary disassembly via deciliation.</p>

<title>Recovery of whole cilia from culture media demonstrates that deciliation occurs during ciliary disassembly</title>
<p>If deciliation is a major mode of cilium disassembly, we would expect to be able to recover whole cilia from culture medium. Such recovered material should have lengths consistent with whole cilia (≥1.5 μm, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) and contain membrane- and axoneme-specific components. We developed two methods to enrich for ciliary fragments spontaneously released at low concentration from serum-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3C–3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). First, we used immune-capture of fluorescently-labeled cilia to directly visualize unperturbed ciliary fragments. Culture medium from serum-stimulated IMCD3::SSTR3-GFP cells transiently expressing mCherry-α-tubulin was incubated on imaging dishes coated with an antibody against the extracellular domain of SSTR3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Samples were imaged, without fixation, by fluorescence; we could reproducibly identify cilia marked by both SSTR3-GFP and mCherry-α-tubulin captured in this manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We interpret the jagged appearance of the cilia as due to thermal motion of the sample during stack acquisition of material that is not firmly fixed to the substrate. Compared to control serum-starved medium, serum-stimulated medium yielded a 3.5-fold increase in captured cilia. In addition, pretreatment with tubacin decreased the number of captured cilia to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Finally, following this procedure in unlabeled IMCD3 cells, we observed objects with dimensions consistent with intact shed cilia after fixation and imaging by scanning electron microscopy, demonstrating that deciliation is not a result of SSTR3::GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>The cilia immune–capture method was limited by low concentration and further sample loss due to the instability of antibody-bound cilia, which hindered subsequent compositional analysis by immunofluorescence or biochemistry. Therefore, we used a complementary method to increase yield, in which culture medium was subjected to a series of filtration and centrifugation steps to concentrate ciliary material approximately 500-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3F–3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). As a positive control, serum-starved cells were artificially deciliated with high-calcium buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref062">62</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>). Immunoblotting against intraflagellar transport 88 (IFT88), α-tubulin, and acetylated tubulin further confirmed enrichment of ciliary proteins in the concentrated medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), and lack of DAPI-stained material indicated that isolated samples were free of large cellular debris (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). Immunostaining for axoneme markers (IFT88, α-tubulin, and acetylated tubulin) demonstrated increased abundance of ciliary structures, many with the dimensions (1.5–7 μm) expected of whole cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, flagellar severing can occur at two distinct sites of flagellar autotomy (SOFA): proximal and distal to the transition zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref063">63</xref>]. To determine the site of deciliation with respect to the transition zone in IMCD3 cells, we immunostained isolated ciliary material with an antibody against the transition zone marker RPGRIP1L. Distinct RPGRIP1L puncta asymmetrically colocalized with one end of elongated acetylated tubulin signal, indicating the presence of transition zone components in many isolated cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). Thus, deciliation can occur from the proximal transition zone, consistent with the frequent observation of complete removal of the ciliary membrane in Instant and Combined cilia loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2A.3, 2A.4 and 2G</xref>). The fact that RPGRIP1L is not present in all acetylated tubulin–positive structures further suggests that deciliation might also occur at intermediate locations along the cilium, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3B</xref>. Together, these results indicate that whole and partial cilia, including membrane and axoneme components, are shed during ciliary loss. In summary, via two independent ciliary-isolation methods, we show that deciliation occurs during serum-induced cilium loss and is likely to be the phenomenon underlying Instant loss dynamics.</p>

<title>p60 katanin overexpression promotes Instant ciliary loss</title>
<p>We next sought to gain insight into the regulation of deciliation. A central requirement for complete deciliation is the disruption of axonemal microtubules near the ciliary base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref064">64</xref>]. Although this process has been observed in several organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref065">65</xref>], the underlying machinery and mechanism of deciliation have been difficult to elucidate. The microtubule-severing enzyme katanin has been proposed as a candidate for this function in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref067">67</xref>]. Katanin has been demonstrated to localize to both proximal and distal regions of the transition zone in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref067">67</xref>], but <italic>pf19</italic> mutants, which are defective in the p60 catalytic subunit of katanin, do not have a deflagellation defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref068">68</xref>]. In mammalian cells, katanin has a general regulatory relationship with primary cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref069">69</xref>]. Katanin is required for microtubule rearrangement in mitotic spindle formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref072">72</xref>], but its role in primary cilia loss is poorly understood.</p>
<p>To examine the potential for regulation of ciliary loss by katanin, we manipulated katanin level by overexpression. We generated IMCD3 cells stably coexpressing SSTR3-GFP and tRFP-p60 or turbo red fluorescent protein (tRFP) as a control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>).

In addition, in approximately 30% of ciliated cells, p60 localized near the base of the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<p>Next, we determined whether tRFP-p60 katanin expression influenced overall assembly and loss of cilia. Total levels of ciliation in response to serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s005">S5C Fig</xref>) were unaffected; however, ciliary length was significantly reduced in tRFP-p60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of ciliary loss by tubacin and cytochalasin D was unaffected in tRFP-p60 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s005">S5G Fig</xref>). Therefore, tRFP-p60 katanin expression influences ciliary structure but is not sufficient to induce ciliary disassembly in serum-starved cells, and any effect of p60 overexpression likely occurs downstream of HDAC6 activity.</p>
<p>We next asked whether tRFP-p60 katanin expression affects ciliary loss dynamics in serum-stimulated cells. In cells expressing only tRFP, terminal cilium loss by Instant dynamics comprised 86.7% of disassembly events (<italic>n</italic> = 61, 33.3% Instant and 53.3% Combined), consistent with our analysis in parental cell lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g002">Fig 2G</xref>. However, in tRFP-p60–overexpressing cells, Gradual dynamics were virtually eliminated, while the frequency of Instant loss increased, resulting in 98% of events featuring Instant terminal cilium loss (<italic>n</italic> = 50, 50% Instant and 48% Combined) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Thus, tRFP-p60 expression shifts the distribution of disassembly behaviors toward Instant ciliary loss dynamics. These results suggest that increased katanin activity is capable of modulating ciliary disassembly behavior by promoting deciliation with Instant dynamics and that the distribution of heterogeneous disassembly behaviors is tunable by mechanistic regulators.</p>

<title>Katanin p60 overexpression blocks the effects of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> modulation on ciliary disassembly</title>
<p>High-intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) triggers deciliation, and many methods of experimentally inducing deciliation do so by raising [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref077">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref082">82</xref>], also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). p60 katanin function and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> are both necessary for experimentally induced severing of isolated flagellar–basal body complexes in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref046">46</xref>]. Additionally, calcium-calmodulin signaling functions upstream of Aurora A kinase, a key regulator of ciliary loss upstream of HDAC6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref083">83</xref>], suggesting a broader role for cytoplasmic calcium in regulating ciliary loss via all of the behaviors we have identified. Thus, we hypothesized that calcium and katanin functions may cooperate in serum-induced ciliary loss. We asked whether, in the presence of high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i,</sub> the frequency of cilium loss would be exacerbated by expression of tRFP-p60. Cells were serum starved to promote ciliation and then treated with small molecule drugs to modulate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels. In both tRFP- and tRFP-p60–expressing cells, raising [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> with either 1 μM ionomycin, an ionophore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref084">84</xref>], or 190 μM dibucaine reduced ciliary abundance and length to a similar degree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). Treating cells with 5 μM thapsigargin, which raises [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by releasing intracellular stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref085">85</xref>], also reduced ciliation but not cilia length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref050">50</xref>] in control tRFP-expressing cells. Intriguingly, this effect was reversed in tRFP-p60–expressing cells, which exhibited a slight increase in ciliation and cilia length in response to thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s005">S5C and S5D Fig</xref>). Overall, tRFP-p60–expressing cells did not exhibit elevated rates of ciliary loss induced by high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p>Conversely, we asked what effects depletion of [Ca2+]<sub>i</sub> would have on ciliary disassembly in tRFP- and tRFP-p60–expressing cells. BAPTA-AM, a cell-permeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref086">86</xref>], did not affect ciliary length in starved cells but inhibited ciliary loss in serum-stimulated tRFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>), consistent with published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref023">23</xref>]. However, cilium loss was not impaired in serum-stimulated tRFP-p60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), and ciliary length in starved cells was reduced compared to DMSO-treated tRFP-p60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Therefore, tRFP-p60 katanin expression can overcome the requirement for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in ciliary loss. We summarize these results in a schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4G</xref>. Overall, we found that overexpression of tRFP-p60 eliminated or reversed the effects of both increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> with thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s006">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>) and reducing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> with BAPTA-AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and katanin do not act cooperatively to promote ciliary loss. Rather, the negative regulation of cilia by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> appears to be mitigated or reversed in the presence of excess p60 katanin.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We characterized serum-induced ciliary-loss dynamics and behaviors of primary cilia, a process critical to tissue homeostasis and development in vertebrates. Here, we present a model for ciliary loss based on these results and discuss implications of that model.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that there are at least two mechanisms of ciliary loss in mammalian cells: resorption, in which the axoneme is depolymerized and ciliary contents are incorporated into the cell, and deciliation, in which the axoneme is excised near its base. We have incorporated these in a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g005">Fig 5</xref>) in which ciliary loss requires at least two major decision points: decision 1, when to remove the cilium and decision 2, when to invoke Instant deciliation. Decision 1 is controlled by Aurora A, HDAC6, and other elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref087">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref088">88</xref>]. Decision 2, in IMCD3 cells, results in deciliation immediately (Instant), after a delay (Combined), or never (Gradual). We assume that resorption of the cilium, as the initial behavior in Combined dynamics, is the default mode of cilium loss and that rapid deciliation, when invoked, overrides the slower-acting resorption. Thus, cilium loss is a tunable decision in at least two ways: when to remove the cilium and the mechanism by which that removal is accomplished, both of which are likely to differ in different cell types and different contexts.</p>

<p>Major regulators of ciliary disassembly function at two decision points: whether (Decision 1) and how (Decision 2) to disassemble the cilium, which is dominated by deciliation (orange) but also features resorption (blue) and Combined resorption-deciliation (green). Katanin (p60) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> can promote deciliation at Decision 2 independently and/or antagonistically. Regulators of disassembly may further contribute to either decision indirectly via modulation of cytoskeletal rearrangement (magenta). See text for full description.</p>

</fig>
<p>In most cases of Instant cilium loss, the entire visible cilium was lost within seconds; however, in some cases, detachment of the distal portion of the cilium could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In addition, we observed the presence of the transition zone protein RPGRIP1L in some cilia isolated from cell culture medium. This suggests that ciliary detachment can occur at multiple sites along the cilium. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, there are two known SOFAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref063">63</xref>], directly above and below the transition zone, and katanin has been shown to localize to both sites via immunogold electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref067">67</xref>]. Flagellar severing at one site or the other seems to be associated with functional context—distal severing is associated with stress response, and proximal severing occurs during mitotic flagellar disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref063">63</xref>]. Whether these deciliation sites translate to a functional difference in the mammalian primary cilium is not understood. For instance, it could be that distal severing, which leaves the transition zone intact, may allow for rapid regeneration of the cilium, while proximal severing may serve as a “terminal deciliation” in a cell cycle context in which regrowth is suppressed; indeed, this could be a third decision that a cell undertakes during cilia loss.</p>
<p>To better understand how deciliation is regulated in in IMCD3 cells, we manipulated p60 katanin and intracellular calcium levels and found that the activity of overexpressed p60 katanin biases cilium-loss events nearly exclusively toward deciliation, likely representing an intervention at Decision 2. Whether and how katanin might sever axoneme microtubules in deciliation, or whether it is indeed required for deciliation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref068">68</xref>], remain critical outstanding questions. Katanin may also indirectly influence cilia, perhaps by severing centrosome-associated microtubules and interfering with ciliary protein trafficking (consistent with the observed diffuse staining pattern at the cilium base, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) or by modulating the available pool of cytoplasmic tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref089">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref090">90</xref>]. These hypotheses could help explain why tRFP-p60 expression negatively affects cilia length but not formation in untreated cells.</p>
<p>Calcium is necessary for ciliary loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref023">23</xref>] and is sufficient to drive deciliation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref091">91</xref>], thus acting at both Decisions 1 and 2. Although the role of calcium is likely multifaceted, it seems that calcium and increased p60 katanin activity may function independently and also negatively interact at the Decision 2 nexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4E–4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000381.s006">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>). Despite the requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> for disassembly (Decision 1) and deciliation (Decision 2) in normal conditions, tRFP-p60 cells were able to undergo ciliary loss after [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> chelation, likely via deciliation. This suggests the existence of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent deciliation pathway, as has been suggested previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref050">50</xref>]. Alternatively, overexpressed p60 may promote cilium loss via resorption in the absence of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. This relationship may be consistent with the finding that calcium binding inactivates p60 severing activity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref092">92</xref>]. We speculate that the activities of katanin and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in modulating ciliary behavior may depend on their relative levels in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g004">Fig 4G</xref>).</p>
<p>What is the significance of the multiple mechanisms of ciliary loss coexisting in the same cells? In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, the anterograde IFT kinesin mutant <italic>fla-10</italic>, which normally undergoes passive flagellar shortening due to IFT imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref043">43</xref>], switches to deflagellation in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the restrictive temperature. Conversely, deflagellation-incompetent mutants (<italic>fa1</italic>, <italic>fa2</italic>, <italic>adf</italic>) undergo flagellar resorption in response to acid shock, which normally induces deflagellation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref093">93</xref>]. This work is directly in line with our two-decision model, suggesting that once an internal or external cue to disassemble the cilium/flagellum is detected (Decision 1), the cell will “find a way” to remove its cilium—if the preferred or default mode of disassembly (Decision 2) is unavailable or unfavorable, an alternative mechanism can be used. The recent development of an engineered inhibitable KIF3A/3B recapitulated the <italic>fla-10</italic> phenotype of in NIH3T3 cells—inhibition of motor activity induced cilium loss. Intriguingly, the consistent reduction in cilia number over 8 hrs was accompanied by only a minor reduction in cilium length, suggesting that cilia were lost by rapid deciliation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref094">94</xref>]. Future studies could take advantage of this tool to examine the dynamic behaviors of cilia during this process, as well whether modulation of p60 katanin, intracellular calcium levels, and other potential regulators influence cilia-loss dynamics induced by a cell cycle–independent stimulus.</p>
<p>Ciliary-loss behaviors varied both in the dynamics (10<sup>−3</sup> to 10<sup>1</sup> μm/min) and physical process (resorption versus deciliation). The coexistence of resorption and deciliation in the same cilium (Combined dynamics) is intriguing and may suggest independent or differential regulation of the distal and proximal portions of the cilium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref036">36</xref>]. It might be, for example, that structural features of the axoneme, such as doublet–singlet microtubule interface or post-translational modifications, contribute to differential regulation of ciliary regions. We were unable to directly and specifically observe the axoneme in our live-cell imaging experiments. However, in fixed serum-stimulated cells, we identified several noncanonical structures that hint at the fate of the axoneme during ciliary loss. These included discontinuous axoneme staining that might reflect partial breaks away from the base, short axoneme stubs that could represent a remnant of a severed or resorbed cilium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref095">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref096">96</xref>], and even axonemes without corresponding ciliary membrane staining, possibly representing a portion of axoneme retracted into the cell, as has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref039">39</xref>]. While these interpretations are speculative due to the markers used and the nature of static representations of this dynamic process, the relatively low abundance of these structures in starved and tubacin-treated conditions indicates that they may represent ciliary loss intermediates.</p>
<p>We emphasize that loss of the cilium involves a complex interplay between general ciliary trafficking and regulation, cytoskeletal dynamics, and intracellular signaling ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref009">9</xref>] <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000381.g005">Fig 5</xref>) and that our manipulations of calcium and katanin are best viewed as initial probing into the molecular nature of these decisions. Further work is required to understand the molecular mechanisms and must take into account that many key regulators of ciliary loss have additional roles in cytoskeletal regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref054">54</xref>] and other cellular functions, including calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref097">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref098">98</xref>], AurA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref099">99</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref100">100</xref>], HDAC6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref101">101</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref104">104</xref>], and katanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref105">105</xref>].</p>
<p>We observed deciliation as a means for cell cycle–linked ciliary loss, whereas previous descriptions of such behavior in mammalian cells have only been under conditions of experimentally induced toxicity and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref052">52</xref>]. The morphology and composition of isolated cilia confirmed two major points supporting the interpretation that the observed Instant loss events represent deciliation: 1) the entire ciliary membrane can be shed from cells as an intact structure, and 2) shed ciliary membranes contain tubulin, suggesting that the axoneme is severed and shed along with the ciliary membrane. Interestingly, a related phenomenon—the release of a small membrane segment from the ciliary tip, referred to as apical abscission, decapitation, or release of ciliary ectosomes—has been described in several contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref088">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref106">106</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref107">107</xref>], but it is unclear whether axoneme components are present in these structures. Ciliary decapitation was previously reported as an initiating step in the cilia-loss process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref088">88</xref>] as well as in assembling cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref009">9</xref>]. It would be particularly interesting to test whether there is a mechanistic link between these events by investigating whether PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>– and F-actin–mediated membrane constriction that drives decapitation participates in deciliation from the ciliary base as well as other locations along the cilium. Finally, the implications of our findings for understanding cilia loss should be considered in the context of the general features of cultured kidney-derived epithelial cells, in comparison to and contrast with cilia in other experimental approaches, cell types, tissues, and organisms. Although most cilia share a similar core structure and associated machinery, differences in structure and function (i.e., primary versus motile/specialized), and the relative size of cilia to the cell body, are likely to be relevant to the mechanisms of ciliary assembly and loss.</p>

Samples were blocked for 1 hr at RT or overnight at 4°C in 2% BSA, 1% goat serum, 75 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>. Antibodies were diluted to the indicated concentrations in blocking buffer. Primary antibody incubations were performed for 1 hr at RT or overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibody incubations were performed for 1–2 hrs at RT. Following each antibody incubation, samples were washed three times in PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 for 5 minutes each at RT.</p>
<p>Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted epifluorescence microscope and a 63x objective, or a Leica SP8 scanning laser confocal microscope with LASX Software, using mercury or argon lamps with white light laser excitation, and a 63x 1.4 NA objective. Exposure times were constant during each experiment. For imaging of serum-starved and serum-stimulated cells, fields of view were selected based on DAPI staining by two criteria: 1) to select for moderate cell density, in order to avoid effects of high density on cell cycle and ciliation and 2) to eliminate bias in percent cilia quantifications from scanning by ciliary markers.</p>

<title>Live-cell confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Cells were cultured on glass-bottomed Mattek dishes and imaged in DMEM-F12 media with 15 mM HEPES without phenol red. Movies were acquired 4–12 hrs after serum stimulation with a Leica SP8 scanning laser confocal microscope using 0.5-μm z-slices, 30–90-second intervals, autofocus (Best Focus function), in a 37°C incubator, and red and green channels were acquired simultaneously. The video file was saved as .lif from LASX software and opened in Imaris x64 8.0.2 as a 3D render for analysis of cilia disassembly dynamics and basal body positioning.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Cilia counts and length measurements were performed either manually in Fiji or Imaris x64 8.0.2 and 9.2.1 or through semiautomated detection in Imaris. Manual analysis involved detecting ciliary membrane, marked by an enrichment of SSTR3::GFP above background threshold, that were adjacent to a centriole (mCherry::PACT in dual-fluorescent cells or pericentrin immunofluorescence in single [SSTR3::GFP-expressing] or nonfluorescent cells), to distinguish from accumulations of SSTR3+ membrane elsewhere in the cell. Manual length measurements in Fiji [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000381.ref108">108</xref>] were made with the line function, and in Imaris (Bitplane, version 8.0.2 and up) with the Measurement tool. Generally, single z-plane images were analyzed in Fiji or Imaris, while confocal z-stacks were analyzed in Imaris which allowed more accurate length measurement due to the 3D render (Surpass) capability. When possible, length measurements in confocal images were semi-automated in Imaris using the Surfaces function to create an artificial object encompassing the ciliary membrane, and exporting Bounding Box data as a proxy for length (the longest dimension of the object).</p>
<p>For live cell serum stimulation experiments, movies were visually scanned in Imaris for examples of disassembling cilia. Images of each disassembling cilium were cropped by time (from t0 to several mins after complete loss) and position (restricted to area of occupancy during the that time window) and then saved in a separate file. To generate ciliary length curves, the ciliary membrane was isolated as an artificial object using the Surface function. When possible, the object was automatically tracked over consecutive time points with length data generated at each time point. In cases where automatic tracking was not possible due to low signal-to-noise of ciliary membrane fluorescence, measurements were taken manually at 15–30 minute intervals until the initiation of ciliary disassembly, and at each time point during the disassembly event.</p>
<sec id="sec020">
<title>Matlab</title>
<p>Raw length measurement data from disassembling cilia movies were compiled into an Excel spreadsheet. The data were imported into a Matlab algorithm which performed Gaussian smoothing using a moving average and normalization to starved control cilia dataset. The start point of the cilium loss event was defined by scanning backwards from the final point (time at which length = 0 μm) until the derivative (length difference between consecutive time points) is not different in magnitude than the mean control slope (−0.005 μm/min). Based on this start point, each cilium loss event was categorized as follows: as follows: Gradual if the start point was earlier than the penultimate time point (T<sub>final-1</sub>); Instant if the length at the penultimate time point was above 1.532 μm (threshold based on measurement error); and Combined if both criteria are true. An output file containing disassembly rates, start and end time, start and end length, and proportion length lost per disassembly stage was generated for all cilium loss events.

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism. Statistical tests used for each analysis are indicated in the figure legends. No explicit power analysis was used to determine sample size. All experiments were performed with at least three biological replicates, i.e., samples from independent cell culture passages. When used, technical replicates (i.e., repeats from the same cell culture passage) were averaged for each biological replicate. In brief, comparisons of mean values such as mean percent cilia across replicate experiments were compared using an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test. Analyses of individual measurements such as cilia length were subjected to normality tests (Kolmogorov–Smirnoff, D’Agostino and Pearson, and Shapiro–Wilk). If data passed all normality tests, unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used; if not, the Mann–Whitney U test was used. If data passed normality by some tests but not others, both types of analyses were performed. Results were similar between parametric and nonparamentric tests unless stated otherwise.</p>
