        <p>Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modifies synaptic strengths based on timing information available locally at each synapse. Despite this, it induces global structures within a recurrently connected network. We study such structures both through simulations and by analyzing the effects of STDP on pair-wise interactions of neurons. We show how conventional STDP acts as a loop-eliminating mechanism and organizes neurons into in- and out-hubs. Loop-elimination increases when depression dominates and turns into loop-generation when potentiation dominates. STDP with a shifted temporal window such that coincident spikes cause depression enhances recurrent connections and functions as a strict buffering mechanism that maintains a roughly constant average firing rate. STDP with the opposite temporal shift functions as a loop eliminator at low rates and as a potent loop generator at higher rates. In general, studying pairwise interactions of neurons provides important insights about the structures that STDP can produce in large networks.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The connectivity structure in neural networks reflects, at least in part, the long-term effects of synaptic plasticity mechanisms that underlie learning and memory. In one of the most widespread such mechanisms, spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic spiking across a synapse determines whether it is strengthened or weakened. Therefore, the synapses are modified solely based on local information through STDP. However, STDP can give rise to a variety of global connectivity structures in an interconnected neural network. Here, we provide an analytical framework that can predict the global structures that arise from STDP in such a network. The analytical technique we develop is actually quite simple, and involves the study of two interconnected neurons receiving inputs from their surrounding network. Following analytical calculations for a variety of different STDP models, we test and verify all our predictions through full network simulations. More importantly, the developed analytical tool will allow other researchers to figure out what arises from any other type of STDP in a network.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a widespread mechanism that modifies synapses on the basis of the intervals between ensembles of pre- and postsynaptic spikes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Dan1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Caporale1">[2]</xref>. The most prevalent form of STDP involves potentiation of the synapse when presynaptic spikes precede postsynaptic spikes, and depression for the reverse ordering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Markram1">[3]</xref>. STDP is inherently a local synaptic modification rule because the determinant of synaptic modification is the timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Neurons, on the other hand, are typically embedded in interconnected networks in which each neuron receives thousands of synapses from other neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Braitenberg1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Stepanyants1">[5]</xref>. A number of studies have explored how STDP shapes the distribution of synaptic weights for a population of synapses converging onto a single neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Song1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Babadi1">[10]</xref>. Here, we consider the more difficult problem of bridging the gap between the locality of STDP and the global structures that it generates in a recurrent network of spiking neurons.</p>
      <p>The problem of STDP in a recurrent network has been addressed before in a number of studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Song2">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Clopath1">[22]</xref>. The generally antisymmetric shape of the STDP window, in which reversing the ordering of pre- and postsynaptic spikes reverses the direction of synaptic change, led to the proposal that this synaptic modification rule should eliminate strong recurrent connections between neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Song2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Abbott1">[23]</xref>. This idea has recently been expanded by Kozloski and Cecchi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Kozloski1">[21]</xref> to larger polysynaptic loops in the case of “balanced” STDP in which the magnitudes of potentiation and depression are equal. These authors also showed that balanced STDP organizes network neurons into in- and out-hubs. The possibility of enhancing recurrent connections through pair-based STDP was also proposed by Song and Abbott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Song2">[11]</xref> and is further explored by Clopath and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Clopath1">[22]</xref> in a more complex model. An excessively active group of neurons has been shown to decouple from the rest of the network through STDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Morrison1">[13]</xref>, and in presence of axonal delays, STDP enhances recurrent connections when the neurons fire in a tonic irregular mode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Lubenov1">[14]</xref>. Here, we show that, surprisingly, all of these network properties can be explained through an understanding of the effect of STDP on pairwise interactions of neurons. This provides an analytically tractable way of relating the structures arising in a network to properties of the STDP model being used to modify synapses.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>STDP is characterized by a change of synaptic strength, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, induced by a pair of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials with time difference (pairing interval) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The functional relation between the synaptic modification and the pairing interval is given by<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002906.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
      <p>The positive parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> specify the maximum potentiation and depression, respectively. We express the synaptic strengths in units of the membrane potential (mV), so <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> have mV units. The time constants <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> determine the temporal spread of the STDP window for potentiation and depression. The parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, when it is nonzero, introduces a shift in the STDP window such that for positive values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> even in cases where a presynaptic action potential precedes a postsynaptic spike by a short interval (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the corresponding synapse gets depressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Babadi1">[10]</xref>. Conversely, for negative values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the synapse gets potentiated even when a postsynaptic action potential precedes a presynaptic spike by a short interval (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Lubenov1">[14]</xref>. We recover conventional STDP by setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For conventional STDP, spike interactions are all-to-all, meaning that all possible pre-post pairs contribute to plasticity. However, using an STDP model with only nearest-neighbor interactions does not qualitatively alter the obtained results (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>). The main motivation for using all-to-all interactions in the first cases analyzed below is the clarity of explaining the resulting synaptic dynamics with these interactions. In the case of shifted STDP (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), we use only nearest-neighbor spike pairs to drive plasticity, for reasons of stability explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Babadi1">[10]</xref>. Moreover, as the results show, the background firing rates of neurons play an important role in synaptic dynamics with nearest-neighbor interactions if the STDP window is shifted.</p>
      <p>The effect of STDP on synaptic weights depends not only on properties of the STDP window function of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002906.e003">equation 1</xref>, but also on how boundaries are imposed on the range of allowed synaptic weights <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-vanRossum1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Gtig1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Rubin1">[24]</xref>. In the case of “soft” boundaries, the synaptic dynamics will be confined only to a narrow region in the middle of the range of synaptic strengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Rubin1">[24]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s002">figure S2</xref>), whereas in the case of “hard boundaries”, the synapses can explore the whole range of their allowed strengths. Therefore, we restrict our analysis to the case of hard boundaries as it results in more interesting network structures.</p>
      <p>To gain analytical insights into the structures that arise from STDP in a network and then to verify those insights, we take a dual approach for each form of STDP we study. First, we consider a pair of connected neurons that we imagine to have been extracted from a full network, representing the remaining neurons of the network as independent Poisson input to each of these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g001">figure 1</xref>, middle, with network inputs shown as gray connections). This simplified model allows us to perform a detailed analytic study of how STDP affects the synapses between the two explicitly modeled neurons (drawn in yellow and green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g001">figure 1</xref>, middle). Modifications of synapses from the rest of the “network” onto these two neuron is not modeled directly, but is duplicated by changing the mean effective network input into each neuron, which alters its baseline firing rate. Despite these simplifications, many of the structures induced by STDP in a large network can be explained by analogy with properties of this two-neuron system. As the second component of our approach, we verify that analytic predictions extracted from the simplified model apply to full networks with STDP acting at all synapses by simulating these full networks.</p>

          <p>Two representative neurons embedded in a network are shown with their reciprocal synapses (middle). <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the probability density of pairing intervals <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between the two spike trains, which is superimposed on the STDP window. Both synapses are modified by the pairings of the baseline spike trains of the neurons (blue area in top and bottom panels). Whenever neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fires, the synapse <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (yellow) induces a transient increase in the firing rate of neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which in turn increases the probability of pairings with short intervals (yellow areas in top and bottom panels). This transient firing rate increase potentiates <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, because it falls into the potentiation domain of STDP (top), but it falls into depression domain for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (bottom). The transient increase in the firing rate of neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in response to spikes of neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (green areas in top and bottom panels) has the opposite effect.</p>

      <p>The two representative excitatory neurons drawn from the network are labeled neuron 1 and neuron 2, and are reciprocally connected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g001">figure 1</xref>, middle). We denote the strength of the synapse from neuron 1 to neuron 2 as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the strength of the synapse from 2 to 1 as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Due to the additional “network” inputs, each neuron fires at a baseline rate, given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. We assume that there are no significant correlations between the baseline spike trains of neurons 1 and 2, because the recurrent inhibition is strong. In the presence of a strong recurrent inhibition, spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations accurately track each other and cancel the effect of shared input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Renart1">[25]</xref>, and this is true for the networks we study except where otherwise indicated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s003">figure S3</xref>). It is worth noting that we do not assume that the baseline firing rates are constant; they are functions of the synaptic strengths in the network and therefore change with STDP. We are interested in the local dynamics of pairs of reciprocal synapses given the current values of baseline firing rates. As we will see below, this pairwise analysis can predict how the baseline firing rates will change over time as STDP affects the network. Under the conditions we assume, synapses are modified primarily by random pre-post pairings of their baseline spike trains. The average amount of modification due to this baseline activity is the same for both synapses (i.e. the same for both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). On top of the baseline firing, the reciprocal synaptic connections induce correlations between the spike trains of the two neurons. Each spike arriving from neuron 1 to neuron 2 transiently increases the firing rate of neuron 2 proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g001">figure 1</xref>, yellow areas).

Because the synaptic strengths are bounded between 0 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the drift of the synaptic pair, as described by these equations, is restricted to a limited region in the state space . As we will see in the following sections, this restriction results in a number of interesting effects that would not arise in a strictly linear system.</p>
      <p>In what follows, we first examine the effect of different parameterizations of the STDP window on the synaptic pair. This leads to a number of predictions about the structures that arise from STDP in networks. We then test each prediction through numerical simulations of a large network. In the case in which the STDP window is not shifted (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the time constants of the window are assumed to be equal (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), but we vary the balance between potentiation and depression by changing the maximum values <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The same qualitative results hold when the maximum values are set equal and the potentiation/depression balance is modified by changing the time constants (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Balanced STDP</title>
        <p>The simplest form of STDP that we consider is balanced with equal potentiation and depression domains, i.e. with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In this case, the coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vanishes because the baseline potentiation and depression cancel each other. In addition, the coefficients <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are equal. These conditions greatly simplify the system of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002906.e037">equations (2)</xref>. We visualize the dynamics of the synaptic pair by phase planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g002">figure 2</xref>). Note that all phase planes throughout this paper are snapshots of the dynamics for a given network firing rate, and as we will see below, they should be recomputed if the baseline firing rates change appreciably. When the baseline firing rates are equal (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the values of the synaptic weights do not change when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are equal, i.e. the synaptic drift is zero on the line <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g002">figure 2A</xref>, solid line). However, this equilibrium is unstable. If the two synapses have unequal strengths, the stronger synapse grows even stronger and weakens the other synapse until they reach the boundary of their allowed range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g002">figure 2A</xref>, arrows). Then, the synapses continue their dynamics along the boundary edge until they reach the upper-left (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or lower-right (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) corner of the state space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g002">figure 2A</xref>, filled circles), depending on which synapse was stronger to begin with. These “attractors” of the synaptic dynamics indicate that, at steady-state, loops between pairs of neurons are eliminated by this form of STDP. A linear system of differential equations cannot have more than one attractor. The existence of two attractors here is a consequence of restricting the dynamics to a limited range, and it suggests that STDP favors unidirectional connections and eliminates loops in a network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g003">figure 3A</xref>), in agreement with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Kozloski1">[21]</xref>. The attractors also imply that, for each neuron, the strengthening of an incoming synapse is accompanied by the weakening of an outgoing synapse and vice versa. If we consider the effect of this interplay at the level of a network, it is expected that for each neuron the number of above-threshold incoming and outgoing synapses will be linearly related with a coefficient of -1, such that their sum remains constant. Our simulation results and previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Kozloski1">[21]</xref> also confirm this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g003">figure 3B</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>When the baseline rates of the two neurons are not equal, the line of equilibrium is tilted to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g002">figure 2B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>). As a result, the size of the basins of the two attractors differ, and the outgoing synapses of the neuron with the higher firing rate are more likely to strengthen, while its incoming synapse are likely to weaken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g002">figure 2B</xref>, top-left corner). Conversely, outgoing synapses from the neuron with the lower firing rate are more likely to weaken and its incoming synapses strengthen. If we generalize this behavior to the context of a network, an important prediction can be made: neurons with low initial firing rates should attract strong excitatory synapses onto themselves but project weaker synapse to other neurons. Neurons with high firing rates should experience the opposite trend; they lose incoming synaptic input through synaptic weakening, while their outgoing synapses strengthen. Therefore, if the external input is biased to give a sub-population of excitatory neurons an initially higher (lower) firing rate than the rest of the network, these neurons will become out-hubs (in-hubs) through STDP. We tested this by setting the mean of the external input to the neurons such that the initial firing rate of the first hundred excitatory neurons (1–100) was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the initial firing rate of the next hundred excitatory neurons (101–200) was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the initial firing rate for the rest of the excitatory neurons (201–500) together with that of the inhibitory neurons was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The results show that the sub-population with high initial rate indeed turns into out-hubs, while the sub-population with low initial rate turns into in-hubs once the synaptic weights reach steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g003">figure 3C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Another related prediction is that the firing rates of neurons in the network tend to equalize through STDP. This is because neurons with high initial firing rate become out-hubs, thereby receiving less input from the rest of the network, which lowers their final, equilibrium firing rates. At the same time, they share their initial high firing rate with the other neurons of the network through the strengthening of their outgoing synapses. The opposite happens to neurons with low initial firing rates; they turn into in-hubs. As a result the final firing rates of the neurons become homogenized across the network at steady-state. To test this prediction, we tracked the evolution of the average firing rates of the above three sub-populations throughout the simulation. The results confirm that the final firing rates of all three sub-populations equalize once the synaptic weights reach steady-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g003">figure 3D</xref>).</p>
        <p>As another prediction, the steady-state mean of the synaptic weights is expected to converge to the midpoint of its allowed range, regardless of the initial distribution of weights and the initial firing rate of the network. This is due to the precise balance between the potentiation and depression domains of STDP in this case. If the initial mean is already at the midpoint of the allowed range, the potentiation and depression events have equal probabilities across the network due to this balance. If the initial mean is smaller than the midpoint, a number of depression events would not be fully realized because they are likely to push the synaptic weights to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, so equality of potentiation and depression is disrupted in favor the former, and the mean tends to increases. Similarly, if the initial mean is larger than the midpoint, some of the potentiation events push the corresponding weight above the maximum value and are truncated. This decreases the mean. Therefore, the mean tends to the midpoint in both cases, and the baseline firing rate (which already has the tendency to equalize) does not change this scenario. The simulation results confirm this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g003">figure 3F</xref>). If the initial value of the weights are drawn from a uniform distribution, the mean will be at the midpoint from the very beginning, and it remains there throughout the simulation, making the final network firing rate equal to the initial rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g003">figure 3E</xref>). Note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g003">figure 3E</xref>, and in similar figures to follow, we plot quantities as a function of the initial firing rate of the network, as opposed, for example, the external input used to modify this rate. We do this to make apparent changes in the network firing rate caused by STDP.</p>

        <title>STDP with dominant potentiation</title>
        <p>In studies of a single neuron receiving Poisson input through synapses that are modified by STDP, it has been shown that stability requires depression to dominate over potentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Song1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Gtig1">[9]</xref>. If potentiation dominates in this case, all the synaptic weights get potentiated to the maximum allowed value. Interestingly, for STDP within a network of neurons, potentiation dominated STDP can be stable because this instability is counteracted by the depression induced on reciprocal pairs of synapses. In other words, if one synapse between a reciprocally connected pair of neurons grows, the other synapse is likely to be weakened, preventing the outcome in which all the synapses are maximally potentiated.</p>
        <p>When the potentiation/depression balance is tipped in favor of potentiation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in our examples), the coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002906.e037">equation (2)</xref> becomes larger than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>). In addition, the baseline parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is positive. By setting the right-hand-sides of equations (2) to zero, the fixed point values of the two synaptic weights are found to be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Both of these values are negative, so the fixed point lies outside the allowed range of synaptic strengths. Furthermore, this fixed point is unstable (in both directions), which means that the weights tend to drift away from it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g004">figure 4</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We now examine the influence of the outlying, unstable fixed point on the dynamics within the allowed region of synaptic values when the baseline firing rates of the two neurons are equal. If the initial weights are fairly close to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g004">figure 4A</xref>, red area), they eventually end up at the attractor in the upper-right corner of the phase space due to repulsion from the outlying, unstable fixed point. This attractor corresponds to strong recurrent connections. Trajectories of weights that hit the upper boundary (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) perpendicularly, form another fixed point that is unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g004">figure 4</xref>, open circle on top). Trajectories to the left of this critical line are eventually absorbed by the attractor at the top-left corner (corresponding to a unidirectional connection), while trajectories to its right are absorbed by the top-right attractor (corresponding to recurrent connections). A similar unstable fixed point exists on the rightmost boundary (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g004">figure 4</xref>, open circle on the right). As a result, the state-space of the weights is partitioned into three basins of attraction: one leading to the attractor corresponding to recurrent connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g004">figure 4</xref>, red shading) and the others to attractors that produce unidirectional connections (yellow and green shadings).</p>
        <p>The appearance of the attractor corresponding to recurrent connections leads to a prediction about networks: STDP with dominant potentiation can generate loops in a network in contrast to balanced STDP. This prediction is confirmed by our numerical simulations showing that there are more loops induced in the steady-state weight matrix of a network in this case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g005">figures 5A</xref>).</p>

        <p>As the baseline firing rates of the neurons increase, the basin for the attractor with recurrent connections expands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g004">figure 4B</xref>, red area). This leads to the prediction that when a network is driven by stronger external input and consequently has a higher initial average firing rate, it will have more loops. Numerical simulation confirms this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g005">figure 5B</xref>). To quantify the degree of recurrence in a network, we define a “recurrence index” as the sum of the number of loops with less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> synapses divided by the sum of similar loops in a shuffled version of the network (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Simulation results show that the recurrence index increases as a function of the initial firing rate of the network and rises rather abruptly when the initial rate exceeds <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and slightly decreases when the initial rate exceeds <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g005">figure 5B</xref>). The eventual decrease of the recurrence index is due to the effect of correlations in the baseline firing, which appear in high rates and are not included in our analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s003">figure S3</xref>). The baseline correlations originate from the shared input that the neurons receive from the embedding network and is not related to their pairwise connectivity. Therefore it induces modifications to the reciprocal synapses regardless of the attractor structure explained here.</p>
        <p>The existence of the attractor corresponding to the recurrent connections also leads to the prediction that a network modified by potentiation dominant STDP settles into higher steady-state firing rates than a network with balanced STDP, starting from the same initial conditions. The simulations confirm this prediction as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g005">figure 5C</xref>). The steady-state mean synaptic weight is expected to increase as a function of the initial firing rate because the basin of attraction corresponding to recurrent connections expands at high firing rates. The simulation results agree with this expectation up to the initial firing firing rate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, after which the steady-state mean decreases slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g005">figure 5D</xref>). As in the case of the recurrence index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g005">figure 5B</xref>) this decrease is due to the baseline correlations that appear at high firing rates.</p>

In this case, however, the fixed point is a saddle node, which attracts trajectories from one direction and repels them from the other (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>

This tendency makes the origin an attractor of the dynamics within the allowed range of synaptic weights. This attractor correspond to completely disconnected neurons.

        <p>The dynamics of the synaptic pair we have considered suggests that some pairs of neurons in a network should become disconnected when depression dominates over potentiation. This is a more potent mechanism for eliminating loops than the previous cases, so we expect that STDP with dominant depression eliminates more loops in a large network than the other forms we have considered. Numerical simulations confirm that, indeed, there are fewer loops in the steady-state of a network with depression-dominated STDP compared to the previous cases (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g007">figure 7A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g003">figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g005">5A</xref>).

In a newtork, when neurons become excessively active, more connections should thus be eliminated, and the average rate should return to a lower value. Thus, the steady-state firing rate of a network with depression-dominated STDP should be lower than that of a network with balanced STDP starting from the same initial conditions. Simulation results corroborate this observation by showing that the steady-state firing rate of the network increases moderately as a function of the initial firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g007">figure 7C</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g003">figure 3E</xref>), so depression dominant STDP implements a partial buffering of steady-state firing rates.

        <title>STDP with a rightward shifted window</title>
        <p>The rightward shifted STDP model, in which nearly synchronous pre- and postsynaptic action potentials induce depression, has been shown to stabilize the distribution of the synaptic weights converging onto a single neuron. The rightward shift can arise from the finite rise time of activation of NMDA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Babadi1">[10]</xref>. Here, we study this model in the context of a network. The restriction of spike pairings that induce plasticity to those between nearest neighbor pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which is necessary in this case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Babadi1">[10]</xref>, makes the dynamics of the pair of weights more complicated than in the previous cases, because the coefficients <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002906.e037">equations (2)</xref> depend on the baseline firing rates (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>). Furthermore, the coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can become negative at high firing rates, which makes the behavior of the system even more complicated. However, if we divide the analysis into three different rate regimes, we can elucidate the full range of behaviors. If depression dominates over potentiation in this model, the synaptic dynamics will be tantamount to the depression-dominant unshifted STDP described above, and the shift only makes depression even more dominant. Novel properties of this model only arise when potentiation dominates over depression, thus we assume that the potentiation domain is larger than the depression domain (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Babadi1">[10]</xref>), and we set the amount of the shift to be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>When the initial baseline firing rates of the two neurons are low, the coefficients <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are all positive. This is because the pairing intervals are not typically short enough to fall into the depression domain caused by the shift. In addition, the coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is slightly smaller than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This makes the fixed point for the weights positive and large, meaning that once again it falls out of the putative range of allowed synaptic weights, but this time on the positive not the negative side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g008">figure 8A</xref>). We use the term “putative” here because, as we will see, the upper limits on the synaptic weights are not actually required in this case. The fixed point is a saddle node (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>) and attracts the trajectories of weights along the direction toward the top-right corner of the state space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g008">figure 8A</xref>, arrows), which corresponds to recurrent connections. This case is qualitatively similar to what we found for STDP with dominant potentiation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g008">figures 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g004">4A,B</xref>), so the baseline firing rate tends to become higher than its initial value and eventually the dynamics of the system falls into the regime described by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g008">figure 8B</xref>.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>At higher baseline firing rates, the coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> becomes negative. This occurs because the pairing intervals between presynaptic spikes and their causally induced postsynaptic spikes become short enough to fall into the depression domain caused by the shift. This creates a single stable fixed point for the two weights that lies within the putative allowed range of synaptic weights. Both weights are attracted to this fixed point, forming a recurrent connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g008">figure 8B</xref>, arrows; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>), though not of maximal strength.</p>
        <p>If the two neurons start with even higher baseline rates, the coefficients <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are both negative. This follows because at very high firing rates, even the intervals between randomly paired spikes of the baseline activity are short enough to fall into the depression domain caused by the shift. This pushes the fixed point of the weights out of the allowed range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g008">figure 8C</xref>) but, in this case, on the negative side. Because this fixed point is stable, the weights tend to approach it, creating an attractor at the origin that eliminates both weights and disconnects the neurons. This mechanism prunes the weights in the embedding network until the baseline firing rate decreases enough to make the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> positive. Then, the regime with a stable fixed point within the allowed range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g008">figure 8B</xref>) is restored. This is why no upper bounds on the synaptic weights are required in this case.</p>
        <p>Combining these effects, we find that, if the shift is larger than a critical value (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in this case, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s001">figure S1</xref>), a network will settle into a regime with a single stable fixed point within a narrow range of steady-state firing rates, regardless of the initial firing rate or the strength of the external input. The condition for this scenario to occur is that the fixed point of the weights becomes stable before it grows negative, as the initial firing rate increases. This happens when the potentiation domain is larger than depression domain and the shift is sufficiently large. The calculations show that a shift of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> fulfills this condition for our chosen values of potentiation and depression magnitudes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s001">figure S1</xref>). By generalizing from the dynamics of a pair of synapses, two predictions can be made. First, the steady-state matrix of synaptic weights should have many recurrent connections because there is no mechanism to eliminate loops, and reciprocal connections should tend to be strengthened. This prediction is confirmed by numerical simulations that show a highly recurrent steady-state connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g009">figure 9A</xref>). Second, because the pairwise connections settle into a regime with a single stable fixed point regardless of the initial baseline rate, the steady-state firing rate of the network should be resilient to changes in the external input or in the initial firing rate. Numerical simulations show that the steady-state firing rate of the network varies very slightly as a function of the initial firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g009">figure 9B</xref>). Interestingly, the narrow range of the steady-state firing rates agrees precisely with the prediction of the pairwise analysis (dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g009">figures 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s001">figure S1</xref>). Thus, rightward shifted STDP implements a homeostatic mechanism that strongly buffers the steady-state firing rates from external influences. Finally, the mean synaptic weight decreases with increased initial firing rate in this case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g009">figure 9C</xref>).</p>

        <p>When the initial baseline firing rate is low, the coefficients <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are positive (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is negative. This is because the pairing intervals are not typically short enough to fall into the potentiation domain caused by the shift. As a result the fixed point is positive, unstable in both directions, and out of the allowed range of weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g010">figure 10A</xref>). The weight trajectories tend to drift away from the fixed point in the direction that passes through the origin, so this behavior is qualitatively similar to what we found for STDP with dominant depression. The attractor at the origin corresponds to completely disconnected neurons, therefore the baseline firing rate tends to become less than its initial value.</p>

        <p>For higher initial baseline firing rates, coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> becomes negative, because the pairing intervals between pre- and postsynaptic spikes become short enough to fall into the potentiation domain caused by the shift. This turns the fixed point into a saddle node and pushes it into the allowed range of weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g010">figure 10B</xref>). The weights drift away from the fixed point in the directions that passes through the origin and the top-right corner, and are attracted to it in the perpendicular direction. As a result, both the origin and top-right corner turn into attractors, corresponding to disconnected and recurrently connected neurons respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g010">figure 10B</xref>, closed circles). Because these two points are the only attractors of the system, the network is expected to become highly recurrent in this case and the neurons to become either recurrently connected or disconnected. This regime happens for a narrow range of initial firing rates. As the initial firing rate increases, the basin of the top-right attractor becomes larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g010">figure 10C</xref>). As a result, more recurrent connections form and hence the baseline firing rate increases, which eventually pushes the system into the regime described in the following paragraph.</p>
        <p>For even higher initial baseline firing rates, not only coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> becomes negative, but also <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> turns positive and the fixed point is pushed out of the allowed range on the negative side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g010">figure 10D</xref>). It remains a saddle node, so the weights are repelled from it in the direction that passes through the top-right corner, which becomes the only attractor of the system corresponding to recurrent connection. Therefore, it is expected that all the synapse in the network potentiate up to the upper limit of the weights in this case.</p>
        <p>In summary, the above description shows that as the initial baseline firing rate increases, the networks undergoes three different phase: 1) for low initial rates it behaves similarly to depression-dominant STDP, i.e. recurrent connections are eliminated and the steady-state firing rate is partially buffered; 2) for higher initial rates the network becomes highly recurrent and the steady-state rate increases; 3) for even higher initial rates, all the weights become potentiated up to the maximum, and the firing rate is pathologically high. The simulation results confirm these predictions. When the initial rate is less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the steady-state rate increases modestly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g011">figure 11B</xref>, left) and the the mean of synaptic weights decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g011">figure 11C</xref>, left) as a function of initial rate. The number of loops also decrease in this regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g011">figure 11A</xref>, blue). For higher initial rates, the mean synaptic weight and the steady-state rate increase rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g011">figures 11B-C</xref>, middle) and the network is highly recurrent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g011">figure 11A</xref>, red). For initial rates higher than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the mean synaptic weight equals the maximum allowed value, implying that all the weights are maximally potentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002906-g011">figure 11C</xref>, right), and the steady-state rate is pathologically high. Although the simulation results qualitatively show the full range of behaviors predicted by pairwise analysis, the initial firing rate at which the transitions occur in simulations is lower than that predicted from calculations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s004">Text S1</xref>). This discrepancy is due to baseline correlations that appear at high rates (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002906.s003">figure S3</xref>). In presence of baseline correlations, the neurons tend to fire synchronously regardless of their pairwise connections, and hence the synapses get potentiated indiscriminately due to leftward shift of the STDP.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>By analyzing pairwise interactions of neurons affected by STDP, we clarified how conventional pair-based STDP functions as a loop-eliminating mechanism in a network of spiking neurons and organizes neurons into in- and out-hubs, as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Kozloski1">[21]</xref>. Loop-elimination increases when depression dominates, and turns to loop generation when potentiation dominates. STDP with dominant depression implements a partial buffering mechanism for network firing rates. Rightward shifted STDP can generate recurrent connections in a network and functions as a strict buffering mechanism to maintain a roughly constant network firing rate. STDP with leftward shift functions as a partial buffer of firing rates and a loop eliminator at low rates, and as a potent loop generator at higher rates.</p>
      <p>All of our analytical results were obtained by considering the effect of imposing weight constraints on a linear system describing pairwise interactions of neurons in the presence of STDP. The effect of constraints on Hebbian plasticity has been explored before to explain the formation of visual receptive fields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Miller1">[26]</xref>. Our work can be viewed as an extension of this approach to a specific form of Hebbian plasticity that involves the timing of spikes, namely STDP. In the context of a recurrent network, this method can predict the outcome of STDP in shaping the connectivity of the network and qualitatively captures the direction of change of firing rates in the network. However, the steady-state firing rate of the network cannot be quantitatively calculated by this approach, since the analysis is focused on the snapshots of the weight dynamics given the current firing rates.</p>
      <p>The network used in our numerical simulations was densely connected so that every neuron could potentially form a synaptic connection to every other one. However, our analytical results does not rely on any particular assumption about the density or sparsity of network connectivity. Instead, the results indicate that STDP can organize patterns of connectivity in particular ways within the framework provided by anatomical constraints, developmental hard-wiring and other physiological mechanisms, such as other forms of plasticity.</p>
      <p>In a series of articles, Gilson and colleagues studied the structures that arise from STDP in a recurrent network in response to the patterns of correlations in the external input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Gilson1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Gilson6">[20]</xref>. Here, we took a different approach. We focused on the network structures that arise in the absence of correlations either imposed by external input or originated from common inputs within the network, inspired by the observation that these are dramatically reduced by fast and strong recurrent inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Renart1">[25]</xref>. Instead, we systematically studied the effect of the shape of the STDP window on the structures that arise in this decorrelated state. Our results can be viewed as a basis over which any structures induced by external correlations will be mounted.</p>
      <p>A prominent feature of STDP is its ability to organize neurons into in- and out-hubs. The dependence of hub-formation on baseline firing rate shows how heterogeneity at the level of external inputs can influence the internal structure of a neural network. Moreover, this property of STDP can play an important protective role in pathological cases in which a sub-population of excitatory neurons fires at atypically high rates. Through STDP, most of the incoming synapses to this sub-population will be weakened to mitigate the excessive high firing rate. Decoupling of a highly active sub-population from an embedding network through STDP has been observed previously in networks with an excitation-inhibition balance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Morrison1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A related study based on simulations of a small network showed that depending on the external input, an STDP rule that is phenomenologically similar to the triplet model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Pfister1">[27]</xref> can either induce feedforward structures or recurrent connections, which was argued to be incompatible with simple pair-based STDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Clopath1">[22]</xref>. Although our study only addressed structures arising from pair-based STDP, our results show that recurrent connections can arise if potentiation dominates depression or the plasticity window is shifted. Interestingly, the dependence of the structures on external input in the case of leftward shifted STDP is similar to that of the more elaborate model studied by Clopath and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Clopath1">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A number of studies indicate that, apart from the timing of spikes, several other factors including firing rates, inhibitory inputs, dendritic spikes and neuromodulation influence plasticity induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Pfister1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Vogels1">[30]</xref>. Various STDP rules (including the multi-spike STDP models reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Froemke1">[31]</xref>) have been proposed to incorporate some of these factors. The method we have developed can be used with these other STDP models, but we did not include an analysis of multi-spike STDP or more complex models because we did not want an excessive number of examples nor complexity in the STDP rule to obscure the basic approach and the insights that it provides.</p>
      <p>The ability of pair-based STDP to generate recurrent connections has been shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Song2">[11]</xref>. Although in that case the depression domain was elongated, but the magnitude of potentiation domain was larger such that overall potentiation was dominant over depression, which agrees with our results on loop generation through STDP. Lubenov and colleagues have shown that STDP with leftward shifted window, arising from axonal conduction delays, can generate recurrent connections and thereby synchronize neurons when the network is initialized with a tonic irregular firing mode. In the bursting mode, leftward shifted STDP has the opposite effect, i.e. it eliminates loops and desynchronizes the neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Lubenov1">[14]</xref>. Because the networks we studied were in excitatory/inhibitory balanced state in which the firing patterns are irregular and asynchronous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-vanVreeswijk1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Vogels1">[30]</xref>, our findings about loop generation through leftward shifted STDP agree with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Lubenov1">[14]</xref>, even though the same model can function as a loop eliminating mechanism at low initial firing rates.</p>
      <p>A combination of axonal, synaptic and dendritic propagation delays can induce a leftward shift in STDP window <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Lubenov1">[14]</xref>. On the other hand, the finite rise time of the NMDA receptor activation can give rise to a rightward shift in the window <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Babadi1">[10]</xref>. Thus the exact magnitude and direction of the shift depends on the relative contribution of these opposing factors. For instance, because the back-propagating postsynaptic spikes arrive at distal synapses with a longer delay than at proximal ones, leftward shifted STDP is expected to be observed more in the distal dendrites and rightward shift is expected at proximal sites. Moreover, the relative magnitude of potentiation and depression varies considerably along the dendritic tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Froemke1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Froemke2">[34]</xref>. Therefore, each of the different versions of STDP window analyzed in our study may be relevant in a particular region of the dendritic tree. A general prediction of our study is then that different regions of the dendritic tree may participate in different network structures as a result of differences in their STDP windows.</p>
      <p>In a number of studies, clusters of three or four synaptically connected neurons have been observed in cortical slices at a higher frequency than expected from a random or distance-based connectivity pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Song3">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Perin1">[36]</xref>. We doubt that STDP can account for these clusters unless network synapses were unrealistically strong, so strong that the causal effect of single spikes from one neuron can pass through two or more synapses and transiently increase the firing rate of another neuron. Otherwise the effects of STDP would be restricted to mono-synaptically connected neurons, even in larger ensembles. In fact, our results show that loops of length 3 are usually the loops least affected by STDP. This can be explained by the direct effect of STDP being confined to loops of length 2. In loops of length 3, unlike longer loops, there is no contribution from reciprocally connected pairs of neurons (loops of length 2).</p>
      <p>In conclusion, studying pairwise interactions of neurons through STDP provides a number of important insights about the structures that arise from this plasticity in large networks. This approach can be extended to networks with more complex STDP models and more structured external input.</p>

        <title>Counting loops</title>
        <p>To count the number of closed loops implied by the matrix of excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic weights (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), we first turn the network into a directed graph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002906-Kozloski1">[21]</xref>. This is done by comparing each synaptic weight to a threshold value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and assigning the value 1 to the synapse if its weight is greater than or equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and assigning a zero otherwise. This defines the adjacency matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the resultant directed graph, which can be written formally as<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002906.e168"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e168" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the Heaviside step function.

To evaluate the degree of recurrence in a network, we compare the number of closed loops obtained from the above equation with the number in a randomly permuted (shuffled) version of the same matrix. This distinguishes recurrent connections formed by chance from those that arise from plasticity. In the following sections, whenever we mention the number of loops in a network, we are in fact referring to the number of loops in the adjacency matrix formed by turning the network into a directed graph as described above. In addition, when we refer to a “number” of synapses, we really refer to the number of synapses with strengths greater than the threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To obtain a loop count that is not biased by the overall strengths of the weights, we chose <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002906.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be equal to the mean of the excitatory synaptic weights.
