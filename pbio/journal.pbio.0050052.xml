        <p>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) facilitates synapse formation in the developing brain, while beta-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, which is associated with Alzheimer disease, results in synaptic loss and impaired neurotransmission. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is a cytoplasmic mRNA binding protein whose expression is lost in fragile X syndrome. Here we show that FMRP binds to the coding region of APP mRNA at a guanine-rich, G-quartet–like sequence. Stimulation of cortical synaptoneurosomes or primary neuronal cells with the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist DHPG increased APP translation in wild-type but not <italic>fmr-1</italic> knockout samples. APP mRNA coimmunoprecipitated with FMRP in resting synaptoneurosomes, but the interaction was lost shortly after DHPG treatment. Soluble Aβ<sub>40</sub> or Aβ<sub>42</sub> levels were significantly higher in multiple strains of <italic>fmr-1</italic> knockout mice compared to wild-type controls. Our data indicate that postsynaptic FMRP binds to and regulates the translation of APP mRNA through metabotropic glutamate receptor activation and suggests a possible link between Alzheimer disease and fragile X syndrome.</p>

          <p>Alzheimer disease (AD) and fragile X syndrome (FXS) are devastating neurological disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction resulting in cognitive impairment and behavioral deficits. Despite these similar endpoints, the pathobiology of AD and FXS have not previously been linked. We have established that translation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is cleaved to generate neurotoxic βamyloid, is normally repressed by the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in the dendritic processes of neurons. Activation of a particular subtype of glutamate receptor (mGluR<sub>5</sub>) rapidly increases translation of APP in neurons by displacing FMRP from a guanidine-rich sequence in the coding region of APP mRNA. In the absence of FMRP, APP synthesis is constitutively increased and nonresponsive to mGluR-mediated signaling. Excess APP is proteolytically cleaved to generate significantly elevated βamyloid in multiple mutant mouse strains lacking FMRP compared to wild type. Our data support a growing consensus that FMRP binds to guanine-rich domains of some dendritic mRNAs, suppressing their translation and suggest that AD (neurodegenerative disorder) and FXS (neurodevelopmental disorder) may share a common molecular pathway leading to the overproduction of APP and its protein-cleaving derivatives.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The plaques are predominantly composed of beta-amyloid (Aβ), a 39–42 amino acid peptide cleaved from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is likely important for synapse formation in the developing brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b001">1</xref>], while excess Aβ causes impaired synaptic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b002">2</xref>]. Disordered synaptic transmission is also a hallmark of other neuronal disorders, such as epilepsy and fragile X mental retardation syndrome (FXS).</p>
      <p>FXS is the most prevalent form of inherited mental retardation, affecting one in 4,000 men and one in 8,000 women. This X chromosome–linked disorder is characterized by moderate to severe mental retardation (overall IQ &lt;70), autistic-like behavior, seizures, facial abnormalities (large, prominent ears and long, narrow face) and macroorchidisim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b003">3</xref>]. At the neuroanatomic level, FXS is distinguished by an overabundance of long, thin, tortuous dendritic spines with prominent heads and irregular dilations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b005">5</xref>]. The increased length, density, and immature morphology of dendritic spines in FXS suggest an impairment of synaptic pruning and maturation.</p>
      <p>In the majority of cases, FXS results from a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat expansion to &gt;200 copies in the 5′-UTR of the <italic>fmr-1</italic> gene (located at Xq27.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b006">6</xref>]. The CGG expansion is associated with hypermethylation of the surrounding DNA, chromatin condensation, and subsequent transcriptional silencing of the <italic>fmr-1</italic> gene, resulting in the loss of expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b007">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>FMRP is an mRNA-binding protein that is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, with significantly higher levels in young animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b008">8</xref>]. The protein has two heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K homology domains and one RGG box as well as nuclear localization and export signals. FMRP interacts with BC1 RNA as well as a number of RNA-binding proteins, including nucleolin and YB1 and the FMRP homologs FXR1 and FXR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b009">9</xref>]. FMRP has been implicated in translational repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b015">15</xref>], and in the brain, cosediments with both translating polyribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b016">16</xref>] and with mRNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b012">12</xref>]. The RGG box of FMRP binds to intramolecular G quartet sequences in target mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b017">17</xref>], while the KH2 domain has been proposed to bind to so-called kissing complex RNAs based on in vitro selection assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b018">18</xref>]. In addition, FMRP binds to uridine-rich mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b020">20</xref>]. In aggregate, more than 500 mRNA ligands for FMRP have been identified, many with the potential to influence synaptic formation and plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b017">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>FMRP is required for type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)–dependent translation of synaptic proteins, including FMRP and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b022">22</xref>]. Both PSD-95 and FMRP mRNAs contain putative G-quartets in their 3′-UTR and coding sequence, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b023">23</xref>]. Database searches revealed that APP mRNA possesses a G-quartet–like motif in the coding region (position 825–846 of the mouse sequence) embedded within a guanine-rich domain (694–846) containing several DWGG repeats. APP mRNAs (70% of APP695 and 50% of APP751/770) are associated with polyribosomes in rat brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b024">24</xref>], suggesting that translational regulation could play an important role in APP production. Indeed, APP contains a 5′-UTR iron response element previously implicated in translation control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b025">25</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that APP mRNA translation would be regulated by FMRP.</p>
      <p>We now show that after stimulation with the mGluR agonist DHPG, APP levels increased significantly in wild-type (WT) but not synaptoneurosomes (SNs) or cultured neurons from knockout (KO) animals. In KO SNs or neurons, APP was constitutively elevated. APP mRNA coimmunoprecipitated with FMRP in WT, resting SNs, but this interaction was lost with DHPG treatment. FMRP monomer bound to the 5′ end of the G-rich sequence in the coding region of APP mRNA. Our data indicate that FMRP represses the translation of APP through mGluR-dependent interactions with APP mRNA. Consistent with constitutively elevated APP levels, the proteolytic products Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> are elevated in the brains of <italic>fmr-1</italic> KO mice compared to WT.</p>

        <title>APP mRNA Coimmunoprecipitates with Anti-FMRP</title>
        <p>Our laboratory has shown that FMRP and PSD-95 mRNAs are rapidly translated in mouse primary cortical neurons in response to the type 1 mGluR agonist DHPG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b022">22</xref>]. Normal regulation was lost in <italic>fmr-1</italic> KO-derived neurons, implicating FMRP in this process. These and other FMRP-regulated mRNAs contain G-quartets, which have been proposed as at least one site of mRNA/FMRP interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b017">17</xref>]. Database searches of brain mRNAs revealed that the coding region of human, mouse, and rat APP mRNAs contained a G-quartet–like sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) within a G-rich domain containing several DWGG repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The putative G-quartet motif in APP mRNA has the potential to form a stable structure containing three guanine planes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050052-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). FMRP binds to G-rich sequences (so-called G-quartets; consensus site: DWGG-N<sub>(0–2)</sub>-DWGG-N<sub>(0–1)</sub>-DWGG-N<sub>(0–1)</sub>-DWGG, where D is any nucleotide except C and W is A or U) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b017">17</xref>] arranged in a planar conformation and stabilized by Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds. In the human APP mRNAs, the G-rich region containing the putative G-quartet motif is found in all three splice variants (APP695, APP751, and APP770; 87 nucleotides upstream of the sequence coding for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain, which is missing in APP695). FMRP also binds to kissing complex sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b018">18</xref>], but APP mRNA lacks such a site. Therefore, we prepared cortical lysates as well as SNs from WT mice and immunoprecipitated FMRP. Contrary to a previous report utilizing a different protocol for the preparation of SNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b026">26</xref>], APP mRNA is present in SNs, and reverse transcription (RT)–PCR revealed that the message was brought down with specific, but not control, antisera in cortical lysates as well as SNs (unpublished data). Thus, APP mRNA is a potential target of FMRP, presumably via the coding region putative G-quartet.</p>

        <title>FMRP Regulates APP Translation</title>
        <p>APP is highly expressed in neurons and dendrites and may promote synaptic maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b001">1</xref>]. Conversely, overexpression of APP and its proteolytic product, Aβ, have been implicated in the synaptic losses seen early in the development of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b027">27</xref>]. Therefore, we asked if APP translation was regulated by dendritic FMRP. We utilized <italic>fmr-1</italic> KO mice, a rodent model for FXS, that display dendritic spine anomalies similar to that in the human disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b030">30</xref>]. Cortical SNs were prepared from both WT and <italic>fmr-1</italic> KO mice, and overall protein synthesis was analyzed in response to DHPG (100 μM)–induced mGluR activation. SNs from either animal were metabolically active with equivalent total <sup>35</sup>S-Met incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, FMRP was not required for basal protein synthesis, which is in agreement with a prior report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b031">31</xref>]. However, we did not observe an increase in overall protein synthesis in response to DHPG, whereas Weiler and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b031">31</xref>] observed a 1.3-fold increase in <sup>35</sup>S-Met incorporation after 5 min of stimulation.</p>

        <p>To assess de novo synthesis, <sup>35</sup>S-labeled WT or KO SNs were immunoprecipitated with anti-APP. After 15 min of incubation, untreated WT SNs translated modest amounts of APP, which rapidly increased by 2.7-fold with DHPG treatment. After 1 hr, APP remained elevated in stimulated SNs over the control, but the difference was less (1.6-fold) than at 15 min, suggesting more persistent translation in the unstimulated controls, slowing of new synthesis after stimulation, and/or compensatory protein turnover in the DHPG-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g003">3</xref>B). In KO SNs, APP synthesis was less than in WT SNs and showed a minimal response to DHPG. The translational inhibitor anisomycin blocked DHPG-mediated synthesis of APP, as did the specific mGluR<sub>5</sub> inhibitor MPEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g003">3</xref>D).</p>

        <p>In order to assess changes in steady-state levels, rather than new protein synthesis, APP was measured in WT and KO SNs in response to DHPG by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In WT SNs, there was a rapid increase in total APP levels within 5 min of DHPG treatment (1.6-fold, <italic>n =</italic> 3), which was completely absent in KO SNs. Regardless of treatment, APP levels remained nearly constant over time in KO SNs, as did β-actin. In the absence of DHPG, steady-state levels of APP were substantially higher in KO SNs compared to WT SNs. Within 20 min of DHPG treatment, APP levels in WT SNs approached those seen in unstimulated KO SNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Protease inhibitors increased steady-state levels of APP in WT SNs to those seen in KO SNs (unpublished data). These data suggest that APP mRNA is translationally repressed by FMRP in unstimulated WT SNs. mGluR activation rapidly derepresses APP synthesis as shown for FMRP and PSD-95 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b022">22</xref>].

        <p>SNs are a relatively crude preparation of pre- and postsynaptic densities that are contaminated with other cell types, such as astrocytes, which form synapses with neurons. Thus, we prepared primary embryonic day–18 cortical neuron cultures from WT and <italic>fmr-1</italic> KO brains and assessed dendritic APP levels by immunofluorescence.

        <p>FMRP and homologs have been implicated in the control of mRNA decay. There are increased APP mRNA levels in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in a FXS mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b032">32</xref>], and FXR1P, an FMRP homolog, is an AU-rich element–binding protein that binds to and regulates TNFα mRNA stability and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b033">33</xref>]. APP mRNA contains two 3′-UTR <italic>cis</italic>-elements within 200 bases of the stop codon that mediate message stability. Hence, we analyzed APP mRNA and 18S rRNA decay in SNs by real-time PCR. APP mRNA did not decay over 120 min regardless of mGluR activation in WT and KO SNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050052-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). These data indicate that mGluR-dependent APP translation was independent of mRNA stabilization.

We asked if the APP mRNA/FMRP interaction changed after DHPG.

APP mRNA was readily detected in anti-FMRP pellets in untreated WT SNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). However, APP mRNA associated with FMRP could not be detected in DHPG-stimulated WT SN immunopreciptates (IPs) or in the KO with or without DHPG within 40 cycles of real-time PCR. The negative controls for this experiment were duplicate IPs in the absence of 7G1–1 FMRP antibody, which also did not produce any real-time PCR Ct values for APP mRNA within 40 cycles (data not shown). The &gt;60-fold difference in FMRP-associated APP mRNA was highly significant.

        <title>FMRP RNP Binds to G-Rich Sequences</title>
        <p>FMRP is a component of large RNP complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b038">38</xref>]. The data presented here demonstrate that APP mRNA is also associated with this RNP. To determine the likely interaction site, in vitro RNase protection assays were performed on FMRP IPs from whole-cortex lysates. Residual APP mRNA was mapped by RTqPCR with primers immediately surrounding the predicted G-quartet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050052-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Surprisingly, the G-rich area immediately preceding the G-quartet (nt 699–796) was approximately 4-fold more protected from nuclease digestion than fragments containing the predicted G-quartet (825–846). Although this protected area does not contain a canonical G-quartet motif, the sequence is very G-rich and contains several closely spaced DWGG repeats. The smallest amplicon (nt 774–871) containing the predicted G-quartet motif amplified a 98-base fragment, of which 46 nucleotides were guanines (47% G-rich; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050052-st001">Table S1</xref>). Although this is the most G-rich amplicon of those tested, and T1 ribonuclease cuts 3′ of single-stranded G-residues, the 98-nt protected fragment (amplicon 699–796) was 40% G-rich, providing nearly equivalent numbers of targets for digestion. Thus, nucleotides 699–796 in the coding region of APP mRNA possess a G-rich sequence that is protected from nuclease digestion by an RNP complex containing FMRP.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Synaptic plasticity is required for normal learning and memory and is impaired in FXS. High dendritic spine density is normal for young mice, but synapse pruning during postnatal development is absent in the KO, resulting in increased spine density in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b042">42</xref>]. The molecular basis for defective pruning in <italic>fmr-1</italic> KO mice is unknown, but likely reflects the loss of FMRP-regulated translation of synaptic mRNA. FMRP regulates group 1 mGluR-dependent translation of mRNA targets important in diverse neuronal functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b036">36</xref>]. For example, FMRP normally represses the translation of microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) mRNA during synaptogenesis. In FXS, MAP1B expression is constitutively elevated, leading to abnormally increased microtubule stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b043">43</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great interest to identify FMRP-dependent synaptic mRNAs that contribute to dendritic structure and function.</p>
      <p>Herein, we show that APP mRNA is a previously unappreciated target for FMRP-mediated translational repression at the synapse. The normal physiologic role of APP remains ill defined, but increasing evidence suggests an important role in synapse formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b045">45</xref>] and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b001">1</xref>]. APP localizes to postsynaptic densities, axons, dendrites, and neuromuscular junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b046">46</xref>]. APP/APP-like protein 2 double-KO mice exhibit defective neuromuscular junctions, excessive nerve terminal sprouting, and defective synaptic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b047">47</xref>]. APP is developmentally regulated with maximal expression during synaptogenesis and subsequently declines when mature connections are completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b049">49</xref>]. Therefore, synaptic overexpression of APP during early development may contribute to the immature dendritic spines and inadequate synaptic pruning characteristic of FXS.</p>
      <p>We have identified a G-rich region located within nucleotides 699–796 in the coding region of APP mRNA as an FMRP-binding site. The G-quartet–like sequence immediately downstream of this G-rich region was not protected from nuclease digestions of FMRP IPs. This result was surprising because the intramolecular G-quartet motif has been identified by in vitro RNA selection assays as the site of interaction with FMRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b017">17</xref>]. As expected from the FMRP interaction site mapping results, alignment of the G-rich region (nt 699–796) and DWGG repeats of mouse APP mRNA is highly conserved with both the human (86%) and rat (93%) sequences. Our data suggest that there may be flexibility in the spacing of the DWGG repeats for G-quartet formation and agrees with previous findings that the presence of a G-quartet does not ensure binding by FMRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b017">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>We have determined that FMRP associates with APP mRNA in SN preparations, and that translation of APP mRNA increases in response to DHPG. DHPG-upregulated translation of APP can be blocked by the translational inhibitor anisomycin or the mGluR<sub>5</sub>-specific inhibitor MPEP. mGluR-mediated translation is concurrent with FMRP dissociation from APP mRNA and is independent of mRNA decay. The rapid dissociation of FMRP from APP mRNA, in response to mGluR activation, suggests that post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate FMRP binding activity. Ceman and colleagues have shown that FMRP is phosphorylated N-terminal to the RGG box and that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation status of the protein is correlated with binding to stalled versus active polyribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b050">50</xref>]. Our data support a model developing in the literature whereby FMRP acts as an immediate early-response protein that regulates translation at the synapse. When FMRP is bound to APP or other synaptic mRNAs, translation is repressed. Upon mGluR activation, FMRP is released from the nontranslating RNP, resulting in prompt protein synthesis. In FXS, high levels of protein are constitutively produced that are normally translationally repressed by FMRP.</p>
      <p>We would predict that constitutively upregulated APP would lead to increased processing to Aβ. Indeed, increased Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> are present in two mouse models for FXS. To date, the only abnormal neurpathologic observations in the human FXS brain have involved impaired synaptic pruning and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b051">51</xref>]; however, a very limited number of aged FXS brains have been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b052">52</xref>], so other neuropathologies, such as increased amyloid burden and synaptic degeneration normally associated with AD, cannot be excluded. It is difficult to measure cognitive decline in mentally retarded individuals; however, in support of our prediction, fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome in males is associated with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b053">53</xref>].</p>
      <p>The normal physiologic function(s) of APP are not well understood, albeit the protein is likely important for synapse formation in the developing brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b001">1</xref>]. A recent report demonstrates that children with severe autism and aggression express &gt;2-fold more secreted βAPP (1,200 pg/ml) than children without autism (500 pg/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b054">54</xref>]. Many people with FXS (67% of men and 23% of women) are also autistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b055">55</xref>]. Interestingly, the highest levels of secreted βAPP were found in two children with FXS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b054">54</xref>]. Thus, overproduction of secreted βAPP may contribute to the developmental disabilities observed in patients with FXS and autism. In addition, FMRP mRNA and protein expression are downregulated as a function of aging in the mouse brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b056">56</xref>], suggesting that repressed transcripts, such as APP, would be upregulated with aging, a well-known phenomenon in animals and humans.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, FMRP represses translation of APP mRNA in dendrites, suggesting a link between two neurodevelopmental disorders, FXS and autism, and a neurodegenerative disease, AD.</p>

        <p>The WT and <italic>fmr-1</italic> KO mice in the FVB and C57BL/6 backgrounds were a generous gift from Aaron Grossman and Dr. Bill Greenough (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). The <italic>fmr-1</italic> KO mice were originally developed by Frank Kooy and backcrossed &gt;11 times to FVB mice, albeit these FVB mice have the genes for pigmentation and normal vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b028">28</xref>]. Mice were housed two to four per microisolator cage on a 6am–6pm light cycle with ad libitum food (Purina 5015 mouse diet; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.purina.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.purina.com</ext-link>) and water. The cages contained seeds and a neslet as the only sources of environmental enrichment. All animal husbandry and euthanasia procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health and an approved University of Wisconsin–Madison animal care protocol through the Research Animal Resources Center. <italic>fmr-1</italic> genotypes were determined by PCR analysis of DNA extracted from tail biopsies.

        <title>SN preparation and stimulation.</title>
        <p>SNs were prepared from WT and <italic>fmr-1</italic> KO mouse cortical tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b058">58</xref>]. Briefly, mouse pups aged 14–17 d were killed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by removal of the brain cortices. The cortices were washed in ice-cold gradient medium (GM buffer: 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM Tris [pH 7.5], and 0.1 mM EDTA), transferred to a glass dounce homogenizer containing ice-cold GM buffer, and gently homogenized with five strokes of the loose pestle followed by five strokes of the tight pestle. The homogenate was spun at 1000<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C in round-bottom tubes to pellet cellular debris and nuclei. The supernatant (2 ml aliquots) was applied to percoll gradients (layers = 2 ml each of 23%, 15%, 10%, and 3% isomotic percoll) and spun at speed (32,500<italic>g</italic>) for 5 min at 4°C. The third band from the top of the gradient (the 23%/15% interface) containing intact SNs was removed and pooled for the experiments. The two higher-molecular-weight bands at the 15%/10% and 10%/3% interfaces contain broken membranes. The salt concentration of the SNs was adjusted by adding one-tenth volume of 10× stimulation buffer (100 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 4 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 40 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 800 mM NaCl). To suppress nonspecific excitation, 1 μM tetrodotoxin was added. The protein concentration of the SNs was determined by Bradford assay and ranged from 200–500 ng/μl.</p>
        <p>SNs were equilibrated to room temperature by rotation on a nutator mixer for a minimum of 10 min. DHPG was dissolved in 1× stimulation buffer immediately prior to use and added to the SNs (100 μM final concentration). Samples were mixed at room temperature in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes for the indicated times.</p>

        <p>WT and KO SNs (450 μl) were mixed with 25 μl Redivue Pro-Mix-L [<sup>35</sup>S] for 5 min prior to stimulation with 25 μl 2 mM DHPG. Samples were flash frozen at the indicated times. To analyze new protein synthesis, SN lysates were cleared of free isotope, percoll, and sucrose by purification with the PAGEprep Advance kit per the manufacturer's directions. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay, and 15 μg protein was denatured and loaded per lane on 12% SDS gels. The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphorimager screen.</p>
        <p>To specifically analyze APP synthesis, WT and KO SN lysates (500 μl) were immunoprecipitated with APP antibody. Briefly, SN lysates were precleared with protein A magnetic beads in 1 ml volumes containing 500 μl SNs, 500 μl 2× IP buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 400 mM NaCl, 60 mM EDTA [pH 8], and 2% Triton X-100), protease inhibitor cocktail, and 100 μl packed fresh protein A magnetic beads. For the immunoprecipitations, 10 μg anti-APP antibody (Zymed catalog number 51–2700) and fresh protein A magnetic beads were added and mixed overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with IP buffer, and the final, washed pellets were suspended in 40 μl 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min; the proteins were then separated on 12% SDS gels. The gels were transferred to nitrocelluose membrane, dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen, and scanned on a STORM 860 phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www6.amershambiosciences.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www6.amershambiosciences.com</ext-link>).

        <p>For the inhibitor studies, SNs (425 μl) were preincubated with 25 μl anisomycin (40 μM final concentration) or MPEP (10 μM final concentration) for 10 min prior to the addition of 25 μl <sup>35</sup>S-Met for 5 min and stimulation with DHPG (100 μM final concentration) for 15 min.

        <p>Pregnant females (embryonic day 18) were anesthetized with halothane prior to decapitation and transfer of the uterine sac to ice-cold HBSS. Cortices were removed, washed with ice-cold HBSS, lysed with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin for 25 min at 37 °C, washed with HBSS, suspended in NeuroBasal medium (supplemented with 2% B27 supplement, penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.5 mM glutamine), triturated 70× with a 10-ml pipet, and passed through a 70-μm cell strainer.

        <p>Aliquots of SNs were collected at the indicated timepoints and flash frozen at −80 °C. The samples were thawed and vortexed to prepare SN lysates. To directly reverse-transcribe RNA from SN lysates without an RNA purification step, a modified method for the detection of mRNA in single neurons was utilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050052-b059">59</xref>]. Briefly, 2 μl SN lysate was added per standard RT reaction containing RNase-free DNase I and random nonamer primer. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to destroy any contaminating genomic DNA, 65 °C for 5 min to inactivate the DNase I, and 20 °C for 10 min to anneal the random primer. Omniscript RT was added and reverse transcription proceeded at 37 °C for 60 min before inactivation at 93 °C for 5 min. The RT reactions were diluted 5-fold with DEPC water prior to real-time PCR analysis. For the statistical analysis, APP mRNA levels from triplicate experiments were determined, normalized to 18S rRNA, and plotted as a percentage of total APP mRNA. Error bars depict SEM.</p>

        <p>The PCR primers were designed with Primer Express software from Applied Biosystems, and BLAST homology searches of the amplicons revealed that the primers were gene specific. PCR reactions were optimized for primer and template concentrations and contained 500 nM APP primers (forward: 1701-ccgtggcacccttttgg-1717; and reverse: 1774-gggcgggcgtcaaca-1760) or 300 nM 18S primers (forward: 98-cattaaatcagttatggttcctttgg-123; and reverse: 181-tcggcatgtattagctctagaattacc-155), 10.5 μl 1:5 diluted RT reaction and 12.5 μl SYBR green PCR mix in a 25 μl reaction volume. The cycle conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C (40 cycles: 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C), followed by a dissociation stage for 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 15 s at 95 °C. The average PCR efficiencies for the APP and 18S primers over a 200-fold concentration range were 100% (APP) and 101% (18S) (<italic>n =</italic> 9 experiments each), with a delta slope of 0.079. As the difference in slopes between the sample PCR (APP) and the normalization control (18S) was less than 0.1, the comparative C<sub>T</sub> method was utilized to calculate the relative concentration of APP mRNA normalized to 18S rRNA. SNs are void of nuclei; however to ensure there was no genomic DNA contamination, control RT reactions on SN templates in the absence of reverse transcriptase were analyzed by real-time PCR and found void of APP PCR product. The final APP and 18S PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and were single bands of the correct molecular weight by EtBr staining (74 bp for APP; 84 bp for 18S).</p>
