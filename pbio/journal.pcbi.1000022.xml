In the absence of sensory stimuli, cerebral cortex exhibits spontaneous membrane potential transitions between an UP and a DOWN state. To reveal how cortical networks develop spontaneous activity, or conversely, how spontaneous activity structures cortical networks, we analyze the self-organization of a recurrent network model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which is realistic enough to replicate UP–DOWN states, with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The individual neurons in the self-organized network exhibit a variety of temporal patterns in the two-state transitions. In addition, the model develops a feed-forward network-like structure that produces a diverse repertoire of precise sequences of the UP state. Our model shows that the self-organized activity well resembles the spontaneous activity of cortical networks if STDP is accompanied by the pruning of weak synapses. These results suggest that the two-state membrane potential transitions play an active role in structuring local cortical circuits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Information processing by the brain relies crucially on neuronal circuits. Therefore, clarifying the structure of the brain circuitry is a crucial step towards understanding how the brain processes information. In particular, the cerebral cortex occupies a large portion of the brain in primates and humans, so the organization of local cortical networks is essential for the emergence of higher cognitive functions. However, the complex structure and computations of local cortical networks remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the neuronal wiring and activity self-organizing with synaptic plasticity in a model of local cortical networks. Synaptic plasticity describes how synapses between neuron pairs are modified according to activities of the individual pairs. The irregular activity self-organizing in our model surprisingly resembles the spontaneous cortical activity observed during sleep. Moreover, such an autonomous activity contains a diverse repertoire of precisely timed temporal sequences. Whether local cortical networks produce such precise temporal sequences is currently debated in neuroscience. The self-organization of temporal sequences in the sleep-like state suggests that they may play an active role in learning sensory experiences and motor skills, for which sleep is known to be crucial.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Grants in Aid for Scientific Research of Priority Areas (No. 17022036) from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cortical networks show complex dynamics of intrinsic activity when sensory inputs are absent.

Since blockade of glutermatergic synaptic transmissions eliminated the membrane potential transitions, recurrent synaptic input is considered to be crucial for these transitions.</p><p>These results indicate that the spontaneous cortical activity is not merely a collection of irregular neuronal firing, but is organized into the spatiotemporal patterns that possibly reflect the structure of local cortical networks. We may raise several questions regarding this issue. How can recurrent cortical networks maintain the two-state membrane potential transitions? Does the self-organized spontaneous activity exhibit precise temporal sequences? What is the likely structure of the local cortical networks self-organized through the two-state transition? Does the two-state transition exert a significant impact on the network structure?</p><p>To address these issues, we constructed a recurrent network model of pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking interneurons with synapses between pyramidal neurons modifiable by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Bi1">[20]</xref>. As observed in cortical networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Mao1">[17]</xref>, the minority of the model's pyramidal neurons displays autonomous membrane potential transitions in the absence of synaptic input. We show that, driven by the autonomous activity, the network self-organizes repeated epochs of UP-state propagation that exhibit irregular durations and intervals. This irregular network activity well resembles the experimentally-observed cortical activity if we prune weak excitatory synapses. Furthermore, transitions from the DOWN state to the UP state (UP transitions) exhibit precisely-timed sequences in the self-organized network.</p><p>Self-organization of spontaneous two-state transitions was studied partially in our previous model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Kang1">[21]</xref>. A novel finding in the present paper is a repeated activation of temporal sequences during network UP states, in which UP transitions propagate through the entire network. While such sequences were not remarkable in the previous model consisting of homogeneous neuronal populations, the inhomogeneous intrinsic properties of the present model induce neuron-dependent excitabilities that promote sequential neuronal activation. We demonstrate the role of the self-organized synapses and the nontrivial interactions between the self-organizing process and the two-state transitions in generating the repeated sequences. In addition, the non-homogeneous intrinsic properties create a wide variety of firing patterns, as observed in experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Self-Organized Spontaneous Network Activity</title><p>Pyramidal neurons were numbered in the ascending order of the excitability, with neuron #512 having the highest excitability. In this model, the neuron-dependent excitability of each neuron was adjusted by the density of H-current. Some arguments favorable to the use of H-current are given in the discussion. In highly excitable (HiE) neurons, H-current is slowly activated in the DOWN state and eventually depolarizes the membrane potential to cause an UP transition. H-current is rapidly inactivated in the UP state, and a hyperpolarizing current in turn grows by slow activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent potassium current, so the neurons may return to the DOWN state. Thus, the HiE neurons display autonomous two-state transitions through the intrinsic mechanism even without synaptic inputs. In the present study, the excitatory neurons with indices &gt;400 were classified as the HiE neurons, which in reality may correspond to the layer 5 pyramidal neurons that initiate the spread of UP state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-SanchezVives1">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Self-organization of recurrent synapses proceeded as in our previous network models with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Kang1">[21]</xref> and without <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Kitano1">[22]</xref> two-state membrane potential transitions. The pyramidal-to-pyramidal connections were initially all-to-all and had equal weights, i.e., the half maximum conductance. Due to the activity regulation by STDP, the average weight was reduced to approximately half of the initial value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g001">Figure 1A, <italic>left</italic></xref>), and the weights of self-organized recurrent synapses developed a bimodal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g001">Figure 1A, <italic>right</italic></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Song1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Cteau1">[24]</xref>.

Driven by recurrent synapses, activities of the neurons were strongly synchronized in the beginning of self-organization. During the initial stage transient, short-term depression at the pyramidal-to-pyramidal AMPA synapses prevented too rapid increases in firing rate of each neuron, thus preventing too rapid decreases in the maximum synaptic conductance by STDP. Thus, short-term depression made it much easier to maintain the persistent network activity. As recurrent synapses settled down on the steady distribution, pyramidal neurons started to exhibit spatiotemporal activity patterns representing the spread of UP transitions to the entire network (network UP state) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Recurrent excitation maintained the network UP state, until the negative feedback effects by the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent potassium currents, inhibitory interneurons and synaptic depression would terminate it.</p><p>Effects of the various inhibitory feedbacks on self-organization were quantitatively studied in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000022.s001">Figure S1A</xref>. In general, a weaker inhibition results in higher firing rates of excitatory neurons during network UP states. Since the synapses are significantly modified by STDP during these states, the average synaptic weight in the steady state was decreased (as STDP is LTD-dominant). However, an overly weak inhibition failed to produce epochs of the DOWN state in the spontaneous network activity (see the slowly decaying curves in some of the leftmost panels). Such a continuous UP state made the synaptic weights too weak to maintain the persistent network activity (asterisks in the rightmost panels). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000022.s001">Figure S1B</xref> schematically summarizes the resultant patterns of network activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Self-Organization with Different STDP Rules</title><p>If the network activity could survive the initial-stage down regulation by LTD, a steady state with a moderate firing rate was robustly obtained for additive STDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Song1">[23]</xref> with different timing windows or different LTD/LTP area ratios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000022.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). In contrast, the steady state with a low firing rate was not achieved by other rules of STDP that do not exhibit activity regulation, e.g., a multiplicative STDP rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-vanRossum1">[25]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000022.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). In such a case, all neurons in the network displayed very high-frequency (&gt;150 Hz) tonic firings, in which searching for a structure in network activity is meaningless. The result is also consistent with that of a recent study of self-organization without the two-state transitions using a variant of multiplicative rule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Morrison1">[26]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Activation Patterns of the Individual Neurons</title><p>The model neurons displayed a broad range of firing patterns depending on their temporal positions in the activity spread.

The different activity patterns resulted in quite different profiles of the bi-modal membrane-potential distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g001">Figure 1C, <italic>middle column</italic></xref>). The distributions exhibited clearly distinct bimodal peaks in the LoE neurons, whereas such peaks were obscure in the HiE neurons.

In HiE neurons, the distribution was strongly biased towards weak synapses due to the asymmetric flow of neuronal activity from HiE to LoE neurons.</p><p>Why do pyramidal neurons display this variation of firing patterns? In particular, why do LoE neurons exhibit highly irregular firing patterns when they are driven by the near-regular firing of HiE neurons? In our model, the complex interactions between recurrent inhibition and the inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current <italic>I</italic><sub>AR</sub> enhance the irregular firing of LoE neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). A LoE neuron may exhibit UP transitions when it receives volleys of excitatory synaptic input. However, such input does not necessarily elicit a prolonged spike generation. A strong excitatory input is often followed by a strong inhibitory synaptic input, which may quickly hyperpolarize the membrane potential to activate <italic>I</italic><sub>AR</sub>. Then, the neuron may briefly stop firing, or even make a DOWN transition. Thus, the inhibitory regulation, at least partly, causes irregular firing of the driven neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Structure of the Self-Organized Neuronal Circuit</title><p>To get an insight into the network dynamics, we show the structure of the self-organized neuronal wiring in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. Here, we selected every 8 neurons from LoE to HiE neurons (i.e., 64 neurons in total) and arranged them anti-clockwise along a ring in the ascending order of the excitability, with the least excitable neuron at the three o'clock position. Hereafter, we call the information flow directed from HiE to LoE neurons “feed-forward”. Strong, modest and weak synaptic connections are separately shown, and red or blue lines indicate feed-forward or feedback connections, respectively. The figures show that the neuronal wiring is highly asymmetric, i.e., most of the strongest projections are feed-forward whereas almost all weak synapses are feedback. However, some feedback projections are also strong, and they are dense especially among HiE neurons. The activities of these neurons were modulated by the slow intrinsic rhythms, so the relative times of their firing were varied in repeated network UP states. This is why STDP does not eliminate the feedback connections among them. Nevertheless, the feed-forward–dominant organization of the self-organized network is apparent from the average weights of the synapses terminated on or sent from the individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-1000022-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000022.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Structure of the self-organized excitatory neuronal network.</title><p>(A) We selected every 16 neurons from LoE to HiE neurons and arranged the 64 selected neurons along a ring anticlockwise in the ascending order of the excitability.

This manipulation keeps the distribution of synaptic weights unchanged over the whole network. However, it mixes up the synapses among the neurons and changes the weight distribution on each neuron. As a result, the synaptic mechanism to regulate neuronal activity was destroyed and the firing rate of excitatory neurons were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, it eliminated the hyperpolarizing DOWN state (hence, the spontaneous two-state transitions) from the network activity. These results indicate that the additive STDP regulates the activity of the recurrent network, and that such a regulation is crucial for the spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations.</p><p>The propagation of neuronal activity in the self-organized network may resemble that observed in cortical networks <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Luczak1">[27]</xref>. However, synchronized network UP states in the self-organized activity occurred in narrower time windows and in more regular temporal patterns than those in the cortical activity. These discrepancies were robustly seen in the spontaneous two-state transitions obtained in our simulations. Interestingly, however, eliminating weak excitatory synapses makes the self-organized network activity better resemble the <italic>in vivo</italic> cortical activity. In fact, the elimination of the weakest 40% of excitatory synapses, which involved a large fraction of the feedback connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g002">Figure 2D, <italic>right</italic></xref>), generated irregular activity patterns quite similar to the experimentally observed ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g002">Figure 2D, <italic>left</italic></xref>). Such an elimination of the recurrent synapses significantly reduced the frequency and amplitude of inhibitory feedback synaptic current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), and allowed each neuron to stay in the UP state for longer periods of time. However, a further elimination of the synapses (60% elimination) spoiled the propagation of UP states to the far downstream neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). An optimal degree of the elimination exists.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Precise Temporal Sequences Associated with UP Transitions</title><p>We have shown that the self-organized network has a primarily feed-forward neuronal wiring.

To this end, we detected the onset times of the UP state in each neuron by monitoring transient changes in the calcium concentration (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). By using a template matching method (timing jitters&lt;1 ms: see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we looked for such precise sequences that consisted of more than two UP transitions and repeated in more than one UP-state epoch.

Both cases generated approximately the same number of UP transitions. In B and C, filled bars refer to the number of UP transitions, while empty bars to that of temporal sequences.

As shown previously, the individual neurons display quite different temporal activation patterns depending on their relative positions in the UP-state propagation. Moreover, the driven LoE neurons participate in sequences more often than the driving HiE neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000022.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), presumably reflecting the fact that the driven neurons fire in narrower temporal windows in the repeated network UP states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000022.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). In constructing the non-stationary Poisson sequences, we attempted to preserve such a sub-structure of network activity, since it may be crucial for generating the repeated sequences. To this end, we divided the excitatory neural population into eight subgroups of equal sizes and calculated the UP-transition rates in each subgroup in successive time windows sufficiently shorter than the typical duration of network UP states. Then, in each subgroup we set the time evolution of the population event rate of the Poisson sequences equal to thus calculated time evolution of UP-transition rate. Thus, the non-stationary Poisson events preserve the spatial and temporal structure of UP transitions in larger scales, while randomizing the fine spatiotemporal structure of the events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000022.s002">Figure S2C</xref>).

To show this, we shuffled the synaptic connections in a completely random manner. This manipulation destroys the weight distributions on the individual neurons, while preserving the distribution of the synaptic weights over the entire network. Shuffling synaptic connections eliminated most of the DOWN states, and therefore greatly reduced both the number of UP transitions and that of recurrent patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In order to rescue the DOWN states, we rescaled all the excitatory synapses by a factor less than unity. This manipulation recovered the number of UP transitions to the original level, but not that of temporal sequences. The results strongly indicate that the specific structure of self-organized neuronal wiring underlies the repeated sequences.</p><p>To further elucidate the role of the self-organized synapses, we examined whether a recurrent network might generate temporal sequences without STDP. We connected pyramidal neurons randomly by excitatory synapses of identical strength, and adjusted the synaptic strength such that the network could exhibit spontaneous two-state transitions at a low rate similar to that of the self-organized network activity. The connectivity of the resultant random recurrent excitation was about 20%. The number of precise sequences was significantly smaller in the random network than in the self-organized one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000022.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These results confirm that the precise temporal sequences are a consequence of STDP.</p><p>Excitatory neurons were activated nearly in a sequential manner in each network UP state. However, the order of activation was not strictly fixed across different epochs of the network UP state, but rather jittered from epoch to epoch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, unlike in experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Ikegaya1">[16]</xref>, the sequences did not generally repeat similar temporal patterns of the subthreshold membrane-potential fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The results seem to reflect the fact that the present self-organized network is not a purely feed-forward network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), which would generate only small jitters in the activation order and repeat similar fluctuating patterns of the membrane potential (or postsynaptic current).

Thus, an apparent role of the membrane potential transitions in the self-organizing process is to maintain the spontaneous activity. Do they also play an active role in sequence generation? We studied this intriguing question by testing whether precise temporal sequences can self-organize without clearly-distinct two-state transitions.

Since LTD is the dominant component of STDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Froemke1">[47]</xref>, it rapidly reduces the weights of recurrent synapses during the self-organization. Thus, without the self-sustained activity, the network would easily fall into a permanent quiescent state.</p><p>Previous models of UP and DOWN states hypothesized very strong recurrent connections to induce and maintain UP states, and a potassium-dependent intrinsic mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Compte1">[48]</xref> or short-term synaptic depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Holcman1">[49]</xref> to terminate the UP state. However, due to the powerful down regulation by STDP, recurrent excitatory connections in our model could not remain strong enough to maintain network activity without the intrinsic drive by the HiE neurons. It is likely that under the continuous influence of STDP the persistence of spontaneous activity requires an intrinsic mechanism to initiate the UP state. As mentioned above, here the H-current serves for this role. To turn off the UP state, this model employed a potassium-dependent intrinsic mechanism, short-term synaptic depression and recurrent inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In principle, we could induce DOWN transitions solely with any one of these mechanisms. In such cases, however, it was difficult to keep the values of the related parameters in moderate ranges. In addition, the network UP states exhibited approximately fixed temporal lengths and regular periodicity (data not shown).

However, the network also develops a non-negligible amount of relatively weak feedback synaptic connections. We have shown that pruning the weak excitatory synapses, most of which are feedback connections, broadens the epochs of network UP state and increases the epoch-to-epoch variability in the duration of network UP states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000022-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), as seen in cortical networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000022-Luczak1">[27]</xref>.

Then, we searched for all UP transitions that occurred in other neurons after <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> to construct an event vector, [<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> … <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> <italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub> …]. We constructed similar event vectors taking every UP transition in neuron <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> as the reference event. We compared all possible pairs of thus obtained event vectors as follows. Whenever the same neuron, say <italic>n</italic><sub>k</sub>, appeared in the two vectors, we examined whether the time differences <italic>t<sub>k</sub></italic>−<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> are equal in the two vectors with a precision of ±0.5 ms (criteria 1). If so, we kept the chain <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub>−<italic>n</italic><sub>k</sub> and repeated the same procedure until we reached the end of the vectors, adding every neuron satisfying criteria 1 to the chain. If the final chain contained more than two neurons (including <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> itself), we regarded this chain as a precise sequence (criteria 2). We repeated the above procedure for all possible choices of the reference neuron. It is noted that this algorithm might count some sequences in multiple times. However, these redundant counts were negligibly small since the majority of precise sequences contained only three UP transitions in the present simulations (thus, multiple counting was rejected by criteria 2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000022.s001" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000022.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Parameter dependence of the self-organizing network behavior. (A) The time courses of the population firing rate (left) and normalized average synaptic weight (middle) during the self-organizing process are shown. We conducted the simulations while varying the values of the depressing factor, interneuron-to-pyramidal synaptic connectivity, maximum conductance of the GABAergic synapses and maximum conductance of potassium-dependent calcium current. All these parameters control the overall inhibitory effects on the recurrent network. The average population firing rates are also shown for the steady states of self-organization (right). Error bars show SD. (B) The steady states obtained at various levels of the overall inhibitory effect are schematically illustrated.
