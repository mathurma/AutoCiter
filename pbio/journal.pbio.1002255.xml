<article-title>Mosquitoes Trade Fertility for Immune Defense against Malaria</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) is a key immune factor that determines mosquito resistance to a wide range of pathogens, including malaria parasites. Here we report a new allele-specific function of TEP1 in male fertility. We demonstrate that during spermatogenesis TEP1 binds to and removes damaged cells through the same complement-like cascade that kills malaria parasites in the mosquito midgut. Further, higher fertility rates are mediated by an allele that renders the mosquito susceptible to <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. By elucidating the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying TEP1 function in spermatogenesis, our study suggests that pleiotropic antagonism between reproduction and immunity may shape resistance of mosquito populations to malaria parasites.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>While Anopheline mosquitoes are the most efficient vectors of human malaria, they do have protective mechanisms directed against the causative parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Their immune system targets the invading parasites through activation of the mosquito complement-like system. A central component of this system, thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1), is a highly polymorphic gene with four allelic classes. Although one class, called R1, mediates efficient parasite elimination, the other classes render the mosquitoes susceptible to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections. Until now, it was not clear how or why any of these susceptible <italic>TEP1</italic> alleles were maintained in the population. Here we discover a new role of TEP1 in male fertility. We demonstrate that mosquitoes use the same mechanism—nitration of target surfaces—to flag both damaged sperm and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cells. Binding of TEP1 to, and removal of, the aberrant sperm is critical to preserve high fertility rates. In the absence of TEP1, accumulation of damaged sperm degrades male fertility. Surprisingly, in spite of the common mechanism of TEP1 activation, distinct alleles of <italic>TEP1</italic> mediate efficient removal of defective sperm and killing of malaria parasites. Our results suggest that pleiotropic function in immunity and reproduction is one of the mechanisms that maintain <italic>TEP1</italic> polymorphism in mosquito populations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquitoes are the most efficient vectors of human malaria. Mosquitoes actively respond to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections by mounting immune responses that destroy the majority of invading parasites. These responses are largely mediated by thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], a homologue of the mammalian complement factor C3. TEP1 is synthesized in the mosquito blood cells and is secreted into the blood or hemolymph, where a protein cascade called “mosquito complement-like system” tightly controls its activity. A series of studies on TEP1-mediated killing of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites demonstrated that a complex of two leucine-rich repeat proteins, leucine-rich immune protein 1 (LRIM1) and <italic>Anopheles Plasmodium</italic>-responsive leucine-rich protein 1C (APL1C), prevents precocious activation of TEP1 [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], whereas heme peroxidase 2 (HPX2) and NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) oxidases direct TEP1 binding to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> by modifying ookinete surfaces [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Elimination of any of these factors does not affect <italic>TEP1</italic> expression but abolishes its binding to parasites and increases mosquito susceptibility to infections [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, TEP1 function was only examined in the immune responses of females, which are responsible for malaria transmission.</p>
<p>Here we report a new function of TEP1 in male fertility. We demonstrate that TEP1 and other members of the complement-like cascade are present in the testes and uncover an allele-specific <italic>TEP1</italic> contribution to clearance of apoptotic cells during spermatogenesis. We also show that TEP1 binding to defective sperm cells is regulated by the same complement-like cascade that kills malaria parasites in the mosquito midgut. In spite of these similarities, our results demonstrate that male fertility is promoted by the <italic>TEP1*S2</italic> allele, which renders mosquitoes susceptible to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections. By elucidating the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying TEP1 function in reproduction, our study reveals an example of pleiotropic antagonism between alleles that may impact the genetic makeup of the mosquito resistance to <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.</p>

<title>TEP1 Occurrence in the Mosquito Testis</title>
<p>Using polyclonal antibodies and confocal microscopy of dissected whole mount testes, we observed TEP1 signal in the spermatogenic compartments of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic>. The mosquito spermatogenic compartments are distinguished by the shape of the sperm nuclei [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and by the expression pattern of <italic>β-tubulin</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The apical side of the testes contains a ring of hub cells, the niche of the germline stem cells (GSC) and somatic stem cells (SSC). Upon division, GSCs differentiate into the primary spermatogonia. These compartments do not express the <italic>β-tubulin</italic> gene whose expression begins in the spermatocytes. All sperm cells from the hub to the spermatocytes display rounded nuclei, whereas the nuclei of the spermatids and spermatozoa adopt their mature elongated shape. To facilitate mapping of TEP1-positive cells in the testes, we made use of the <italic>DSX</italic> transgenic line in which <italic>β-tubulin</italic> gene promoter directed the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter in spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. TEP1 signal was detected on spermatogonia (round nuclei, no expression of <italic>β-tubulin</italic>::<italic>eGFP</italic>, <xref rid="pbio.1002255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>) and on spermatozoa (elongated nuclei, expression of <italic>β-tubulin</italic>::<italic>eGFP</italic>, <xref rid="pbio.1002255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Given this surprising localization, we tested whether TEP1 expression correlates with spermatogonial development, which in mosquitoes is initiated at the larval stages and is completed a couple of days after the emergence of adults [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In <italic>Anopheles</italic> males, copulation triggers a new wave of spermatogenesis to replenish the ejaculated spermatozoa [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, we monitored the occurrence of TEP1 signal in the testes of virgin males during the first 2 wk after adult emergence and after mating. The percentage of testes with TEP1-positive spermatogonia decreased during the first week after male emergence and correlated with the termination of spermatogenesis (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). Consistent with the onset of sperm production, the proportion of testes with TEP1-positive spermatogonia increased after mating (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). In contrast, spermatogenesis did not promote the occurrence of TEP1-positive spermatozoa, whose numbers were increasing with time after adult emergence. These data suggest that TEP1 occurrence in the testes correlates with spermatogenic development.</p>

<title>The Conserved Complement-like Cascade Directs TEP1 Binding to Damaged Sperm for Removal</title>
<p>As spermatogenesis is accompanied by waves of apoptosis [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we asked whether TEP1 was recruited to defective spermatogonia. To this end, massive sperm damage was experimentally induced in <italic>DSX</italic> pupae by radiation [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We first gauged the impact of radiation on male fertility and confirmed that it drastically decreased hatching rates of the progeny (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). A significant reduction in egg laying was only observed in females mated with the <italic>DSX</italic> males irradiated with the highest dose (100 Gray [Gy]). Further, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of testes with TEP1-positive spermatogonia, which correlated with the reduction in the size of the spermatogonial compartment in 3-d-old irradiated <italic>DSX</italic> males (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C–2E</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002255.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), suggestive of TEP1 recruitment to defective cells. Indeed, radiation significantly increased the number of damaged cells, as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), which marks DNA breaks associated with cell death. Interestingly, all TEP1-positive cells in the testes of control and irradiated males were TUNEL positive, but not all TUNEL-positive cells were also stained with the anti-TEP1 antibody (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Moreover, radiation-induced cell damage and TEP1 signal were also detected in the GFP-negative germ-line compartment (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). These results suggest that TEP1 is recruited to damaged cells.</p>

<p>The specificity of the detected TEP1 signal was confirmed by two independent approaches. First, we used a mosquito transgenic line (<italic>7b</italic>) in which <italic>TEP1</italic> expression is constitutively repressed by a dominant transgene-mediated silencing (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Second, we injected irradiated <italic>DSX</italic> males with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) against <italic>TEP1</italic> 1 d after emergence. TEP1 signal was not detected in the testes of irradiated males in both TEP1 depletion methods, confirming signal specificity (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002255.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). We next examined whether other members of the complement-like cascade were present in the testes, using polyclonal antibodies against LRIM1 and HPX2 and confocal microscopy. Neither LRIM1 nor HPX2 signals associated with the sperm cells, but they were detected in the cells attached to the testes (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Since elimination of any of these factors does not affect TEP1 expression but abolishes TEP1 binding to parasites [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we exploited their silencing to discriminate whether TEP1 is expressed in or bound to the sperm cells. Depletion of either protein abolished TEP1 signal on spermatogonia but did not affect TEP1 expression, as evidenced by a clear TEP1 signal detected by immunoblotting in the hemolymph extracts of males (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002255.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the observed signal resulted from TEP1 binding to spermatogonia. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the complement-like cascade regulates TEP1 binding to defective sperm.</p>
<p>In mammals, complement contributes to the removal of apoptotic cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, we examined whether TEP1 binding mediated clearance of defective spermatogonia by comparing the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the testes of control and TEP1-depleted males in a similar genetic background of the F<sub>1</sub> progeny of a reciprocal cross between <italic>DSX</italic> and <italic>7b</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Significantly higher numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the absence of TEP1 in the testes of freshly emerged males (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>, day 1). Furthermore, while irradiation increased the number of damaged cells in all samples, their numbers decreased with time in controls but remained high in TEP1-depleted mosquitoes (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>, day 3). These results suggest that TEP1 binding to the spermatogonia correlates with removal of defective cells during spermatogenesis.</p>

<title>TEP1 Rescues Radiation-Induced Male Infertility</title>
<p>Based on these results, we proposed that TEP1 marks damaged spermatogonia for removal. Accumulation of dead cells degrades sperm quality [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that TEP1 deficiency should decrease male fertility after irradiation. Indeed, radiation significantly decreased larval hatching rates (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Importantly, a larger decrease was observed in the progeny of TEP1-depleted males as compared to controls, suggesting that TEP1 partially rescues radiation-induced male sterility.</p>

<p><italic>TEP1</italic> is a highly polymorphic gene with four major alleles that differ in their capacity to kill or to resist malaria parasites—namely, the resistance-associated alleles <italic>R1</italic> and <italic>R2</italic> and the susceptibility-associated alleles <italic>S1</italic> and <italic>S2</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Resistance alleles are believed to offer selective advantages to the mosquitoes infected with <italic>Plasmodium</italic>; however, the fitness costs of these alleles have not been experimentally tested. To explore the impact of <italic>TEP1</italic> polymorphism on the fertility of irradiated males, we generated three <italic>S1</italic>/<italic>S1</italic>, <italic>S2</italic>/<italic>S2</italic>, and <italic>R1</italic>/<italic>R1</italic> homozygous lines from the <italic>TEP1</italic>-heterozygous <italic>T4</italic> line of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> obtained from Imperial College, London (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). Indeed, <italic>TEP1</italic> genotyping of this line identified the following frequencies of <italic>TEP1</italic> alleles: <italic>R1</italic> (14%), <italic>S1</italic> (67%), and <italic>S2</italic> (19%). To obtain <italic>TEP1</italic> homozygous lines, the legs of virgin females and males were used for nested PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping, and the reciprocal crosses were set up between the selected individuals. Once the <italic>TEP1</italic> homozygosity of the established lines was confirmed, male pupae from each line were irradiated, and the testes of the resulting males were dissected, stained, and microscopically examined. Lower numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the testes of <italic>S2</italic>/<italic>S2</italic> as compared to <italic>S1</italic>/<italic>S1</italic> and <italic>R1</italic>/<italic>R1</italic> males (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Moreover, the progeny of <italic>S2</italic>/<italic>S2</italic> males had higher hatching rates than <italic>S1</italic>/<italic>S1</italic> and <italic>R1</italic>/<italic>R1</italic> irradiated males (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Importantly, no differences were observed between these lines in the absence of radiation. These results suggest that the <italic>TEP1*S2</italic> allele efficiently protects against radiation-induced male sterility. To exclude the possibility that the observed differences were caused by variation at an unrelated locus, we generated heterozygous <italic>S1</italic>, <italic>S2</italic>, and <italic>R1</italic> males depleted for TEP1 by crossing <italic>TEP1</italic> homozygous males from each of the three lines with <italic>7b</italic> females (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). Pupae of the resulting progeny were irradiated, and the obtained TEP1-depleted 3-d-old males were crossed with <italic>TEP1</italic>*<italic>S1</italic>-homozygous females. Similar sizes of egg batches and egg-hatching rates indicated that TEP1 depletion abrogated fertility advantages of the <italic>S2</italic> allele (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate the allele-specific contribution of <italic>TEP1</italic> to higher male fertility rates in stressful conditions induced by radiation.</p>

<title>Allele-Specific Role of <italic>TEP1</italic> in Male Fertility</title>
<p>We next evaluated whether TEP1 regulated male fertility under normal conditions. The radiation experiments described above were performed with young males (3-d-old). However, age plays a critical role in male mating behavior and insemination success. Although 3-d-old males are sexually competent, mosquito males show the highest levels of mating activity and form mating swarms several days later (7 to 9 d after emergence) [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, we compared the fertility of young (3-d-old) and mature (9-d-old) control and TEP1-depleted males. Moderate but significantly lower hatching rates were observed in the progeny of mature but not young TEP1-depleted males as compared to same-age controls (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), demonstrating that TEP1 regulates male fertility in the absence of radiation. To make sure that the observed phenotype was due to clearance of damaged sperm cells and not a consequence of microbial infections in TEP1-depleted mosquitoes, we examined bacterial loads in the testes and male accessory glands (MAGs) of control and TEP1-depleted 1- and 13-d-old mosquitoes by quantitative PCR of the conserved bacterial <italic>16S</italic> rRNA gene. No significant differences between the two groups were detected (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>), indicating that TEP1 depletion did not cause significant changes in microbiota proliferation in male reproductive tissues that could explain the observed impact of TEP1 depletion on male sterility.</p>

<p>To validate the specific contribution of the <italic>TEP1*S2</italic> allele to male fertility, we compared the fertility rates of mature males of the <italic>TEP1 S1/S1</italic>, <italic>S2/S2</italic>, or <italic>R1/R1</italic> homozygous lines described above. As in the radiation experiments, significantly higher hatching rates were detected in the progeny of <italic>S2</italic>/<italic>S2</italic> males (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). The causative effect of the <italic>TEP1</italic> polymorphism was further validated by reciprocal allele-specific RNA interference, which interrogates the effects of allele-specific silencing in an identical genetic background [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To this end, we performed reciprocal crosses between <italic>R1</italic>/<italic>R1</italic> and <italic>S2</italic>/<italic>S2</italic> homozygous lines and used males of F<sub>1</sub> progeny heterozygous for <italic>TEP1</italic> (<italic>S2</italic>/<italic>R1)</italic> for injections with allele-specific dsRNAs targeting <italic>S2</italic> (<italic>dsS</italic>) or <italic>R1</italic> (<italic>dsR</italic>). Injections of <italic>dsLacZ</italic> and <italic>dsTEP1</italic> served as negative and positive controls, respectively. A significant reduction in the expression of targeted alleles was confirmed by quantitative PCR (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We discovered a new function of the complement-like cascade in spermatogenesis that impacts male fertility in the malaria mosquito. We demonstrate that depletion of the complement-like factor TEP1 results in accumulation of defective sperm and decreases male fertility. Our study extends the role of the mosquito complement-like cascade from immunity to the removal of defective sperm during spermatogenesis and, thereby, to male fertility and reproduction.</p>
<p>We also show that TEP1 function in spermatogenesis is regulated by the same HPX2-LRIM1 axis that controls killing of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites in the midgut. We propose that activation of the TEP1/LRIM1/APL1C complex is induced by an unknown mechanism in the proximity of the damaged sperm cells. It appears that the surface modification mediated by HPX2 is required for TEP1 binding to the damaged sperm, suggesting that the same signals are used by the mosquitoes to label defective cells and invading pathogens (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). This conserved requirement for reactive nitrogen species in the activation of the mosquito complement-like system in immunity and reproduction suggests that nitration through oxidation of cell surface proteins may be a general mechanism of complement activation, which may be relevant for the activation of the alternative complement pathway in mammals (<xref rid="pbio.1002255.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). The role of the complement factor C3, a mammalian homologue of TEP1, in the clearance of apoptotic bodies is well documented [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, C3 deficient mice are fully fertile, and sperm quality is kept in check by a complement-independent mechanism, probably to prevent a deleterious complement activation on self surfaces and gamete damage [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Future studies should examine the mechanism(s) that mediate(s) removal of damaged cells and of invading parasites. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, electron microscopy detected traces of the abnormal sperm in the neighboring cells but also inside the macrophage-like cells present in the testis tissues [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although phagocytosis may contribute to the removal of the damaged sperm cells, this process is irrelevant for parasite clearance in the midgut, as no phagocytic cells have been detected by electron microscopy [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous reports demonstrated the causative role of the <italic>R1</italic> allele in mosquito resistance to infections with <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> and with some isolates of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, low rates of infected mosquitoes in natural populations question the impact of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> on <italic>TEP1</italic> evolution. Given the broad function of TEP1 in immune responses to bacteria and fungi [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], local microbial pressures on the larval stages may drive its exceptional variability across Africa [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a hypothesis that has never been experimentally proven. Here we show that <italic>TEP1</italic> affects reproduction at the age when males actively engage in mating, suggesting that our findings are relevant for male fitness in natural mosquito populations. Moreover, we report that in contrast to resistance to <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, a distinct “susceptible” <italic>S2</italic> allele mediates higher male fertility rates. At the structural level, the S2 form of TEP1 is mostly similar to the S1 form, except for a β-hairpin loop, shared with R1 and R2 and located on the convex surface of the thioester domain [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The exposed position of this loop is suggestive of its role in protein–protein interactions. Although interactions with distinct partners may define a critical role of S2 form in cell removal, further studies are needed to examine biochemical bases of <italic>TEP1</italic> pleiotropism. A recent report demonstrated the role of the mosquito heme peroxidase 15 (HPX15) in long-term female fertility by protecting sperm from oxidative damage during storage in spermathecae [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The results presented here uncover the role of the HPX2/TEP1/LRIM1 complement-like cascade in the removal of defective sperm cells in the testes, the process that promotes male fertility rates. As strong selective pressures apply to genes involved in reproduction [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and male fitness [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], even the moderate contribution of <italic>S2</italic> to male fertility revealed in our experiments may have important consequences for mosquito field populations, as enrichment in <italic>S2</italic> alleles may render mosquito populations more susceptible to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections. Taken together, we propose that pleiotropic antagonism may drive the evolution of the <italic>TEP1</italic> locus and shape the genetic makeup of resistance to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> in a major malaria vector.</p>

Protein membrane transfer, antibody incubations, and detection were carried out, as previously described [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], using anti-TEP1 [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (1/1,000) and anti-LRIM1 [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] antibodies (1/300), with anti-prophenoloxidase 2 (PPO2) (1/15,000) or anti-α-actin antibody (1/1,000) (Chemicon) as loading controls. Immunoblotting of HPX2 was conducted in native conditions as described [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Bound antibodies were detected by an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1/30,000) (Promega) using Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific).</p>

On day 7, individual females were placed into plastic vials containing 1–2 ml of water and closed with cotton pads. On days 9–10, the deposited eggs and larvae were counted in each vial. We confirmed that females that did not lay eggs had no sperm in their spermathecae, as previously reported [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For fertility assays with mature males, males were kept virgin, and on day 9 after emergence, they were mated to 3-d-old females and assessed as above.

<title>Comparison of the mosquito complement-like and the mammalian alternative complement activation pathways.</title>
<p>Unlike the classical or lectin pathways, in which complement activation is directed to self and nonself surfaces modified by antibody or lectin, respectively, the activation of the alternative pathway is thought to result from a constant spontaneous activation of C3, amplified at the surfaces by the C3b convertase [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Conserved requirement for reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the activation of the mosquito complement-like system revealed here led us to speculate that nitration may play an equally important role in targeting the complement activation to self and nonself in mammals. The mosquito complement-like pathway was designed following the previous studies [<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002255.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
