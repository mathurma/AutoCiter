<abstract>
<p>Ephrins and Eph receptors are involved in the establishment of vertebrate tissue boundaries. The complexity of the system is puzzling, however in many instances, tissues express multiple ephrins and Ephs on both sides of the boundary, a situation that should in principle cause repulsion between cells within each tissue. Although co-expression of ephrins and Eph receptors is widespread in embryonic tissues, neurons, and cancer cells, it is still unresolved how the respective signals are integrated into a coherent output. We present a simple explanation for the confinement of repulsion to the tissue interface: Using the dorsal ectoderm–mesoderm boundary of the Xenopus embryo as a model, we identify selective functional interactions between ephrin–Eph pairs that are expressed in partial complementary patterns. The combined repulsive signals add up to be strongest across the boundary, where they reach sufficient intensity to trigger cell detachments. The process can be largely explained using a simple model based exclusively on relative ephrin and Eph concentrations and binding affinities. We generalize these findings for the ventral ectoderm–mesoderm boundary and the notochord boundary, both of which appear to function on the same principles. These results provide a paradigm for how developmental systems may integrate multiple cues to generate discrete local outcomes.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>How embryonic tissues separate from each other to shape the developing organism is a fundamental question in developmental biology. In vertebrates, this process relies on local repulsive reactions specifically generated at contacts between cells of different types. These reactions are triggered by typical repulsive cell surface cues, the ephrin ligands, and Eph receptors. However, the expression of multiple ephrins and the Eph receptors by each cell type represents a puzzle: Why is repulsion observed only at the tissue interface and not within the tissue itself? By studying three cases of separation in the early amphibian embryo, we uncover a surprisingly simple logic underlying this phenomenon, which can be explained by the selectivity of ligand–receptor interactions and by their asymmetric distribution. The system is set such that, despite generalized interactions throughout the tissues, it is only at contacts between different cell types that the overall repulsive output is sufficiently strong to overcome cell–cell adhesion. Our study may serve as paradigm for how systematic dissection of complex cellular systems can reduce them to simple laws and make them intelligible.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In vertebrates, ephrins and Eph receptors have emerged as major players in the formation of cleft-like tissue boundaries. They control segmentation of rhombomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Cooke1">[1]</xref> and somites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Durbin1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Kemp1">[3]</xref> and the separation of embryonic germ layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Hwang1">[6]</xref>. Ephrins as well as Eph receptors are divided into A and B subclasses, based on their structural and binding characteristics. They are considered to bind promiscuously within each subclass, ephrinAs with EphAs and ephrinBs with EphBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Pasquale1">[7]</xref>, with the exceptions of EphA4, which can interact with both ephrinAs and Bs, and EphB2, which can bind ephrinA5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Himanen1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Murai1">[10]</xref>. Classically, a single ephrin–Eph pair is expressed in a complementary pattern in adjacent tissues. However, in many physiological situations, each cell type may express multiple ephrins and Eph receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Astin1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Hruska1">[12]</xref>. To explain the restriction of signaling to the tissue boundary, one must assume that these molecules interact in more selective ways. Consistently, in vitro studies have yielded a wide range of binding affinities between various ephrins and Eph receptors, suggesting a substantial degree of specificity, but the biological significance of these differences has not been clearly established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Astin1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-BlitsHuizinga1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Flanagan1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, the presence of ephrins and Ephs in the same cell introduces a whole additional layer of complexity involving effects such as ephrin–Eph cis-interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Kao1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Marquardt1">[16]</xref> as well as potential cross-talks between the downstream signaling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Murai1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Poliakov1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Understanding how the global output is determined under in vivo conditions has thus remained a daunting challenge. An example of where the integration of multiple co-expressed Eph receptors and ephrins can be tested is the ectoderm/mesoderm boundary in the early Xenopus embryo. We have demonstrated that ephrins and Ephs act directly at the tissue interface, where they generate cycles of attachments and detachments through transient activation of Rho GTPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>. This mechanism based on cell contact-mediated repulsion is highly reminiscent of neuronal contact guidance and utilizes the same molecular cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Harbott1">[18]</xref>. We showed that full separation required antiparallel forward signaling across the boundary such that ephrins in the mesoderm stimulate Ephs in the ectoderm and vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>. This observation was quite puzzling, as ephrin and Eph should in principle interact equally between cells within each tissue, which should cause repulsion and eventually lead to tissue dissociation. We ask here how cell repulsion is restricted to sites of contacts between the two tissues.</p>

<title>Asymmetric Expression of Specific Ephrins and Ephs Is Required at the Dorsal Ectoderm–Mesoderm Boundary</title>
<p>To address the issue of repulsion restriction, we conducted a comprehensive characterization of the ephrin–Eph system in the early gastrula. We first compared quantitatively the transcripts of all ephrins and Ephs in the dorsal ectoderm and in the mesoderm. Both tissues expressed multiple ephrins and Ephs. Although both A and B types are involved at the ectoderm–mesoderm boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Park1">[5]</xref> and unpublished data), the contribution of the A type appears less important, as they are not sufficient on their own to induce separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref> and unpublished data). We thus focused on the ephrin B subfamily and their receptors, which showed predominantly asymmetric patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Thus, ephrinB2 and EphA4 were strongly enriched in the mesoderm, whereas the ectoderm selectively accumulated ephrinB3 and EphB2–4. We next wanted to test whether asymmetric expression is functionally relevant for tissue separation. Interestingly, ephrinB2, ephrinB3, and EphA4 start to be expressed just at the onset of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), coinciding with the appearance of the ectoderm–mesoderm boundary and the onset of separation behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Wacker1">[19]</xref>. We thus focused on ephrinB2, ephrinB3, EphA4, EphB2, and EphB4 as strongly asymmetrically distributed molecules and included in our analysis ephrinB1 as an example of an evenly expressed ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Ephrin–Eph signaling is required for ectoderm–mesoderm separation. Sagittal section of gastrula embryos, injected with antisense MOs. Inserts show detail of the dorsal side. The boundary separating ectoderm (E) from mesoderm (M) is marked by arrowheads. The concave arrowhead indicates the position of bottle cells, and the arrow the anterior edge of the anterior mesoderm. COMO, control morpholinos; EphrinB3 MO, The boundary is largely absent. Arrowheads point to a fuzzy remnant of ectoderm–mesoderm interface. Mesoderm involution is strongly impaired (arrow and concave arrowhead). (B) Diagram of the early Xenopus gastrula and of the in vitro tissue separation assay. In this assay, test explants obtained by dissection from the inner layer of the ectoderm or from the involuting mesoderm (blastopore lip) are placed on an ectoderm substrate. Ectoderm explants rapidly integrate into the substrate, whereas mesoderm aggregates remain well separated. The percentage of explants remaining separate is scored after 45–60 min. (B′) Ectoderm injected with ephrinB3 MO fails to maintain separation and incorporate mesoderm explants (arrows). Arrowheads, explants remaining separated.

The same color code is used in all figures. (D) Each ephrin/Eph is specifically required. In vitro tissue separation assay. Depletion of ephrinB1 or ephrinB3 in the ectoderm (eB1MO, eB3MO) or EphA4 in the mesoderm (A4MO) led to inhibition of separation. Separation could be restored by treating directly the surface of the other tissue explant for 15 min with soluble Fc fragments of the corresponding ephrin/Eph molecule. Other ephrins/Ephs failed to rescue, with the exception of eB2, which could rescue eB3 depletion. cFc, control anti-human Fc antibody.

(E) The specific role of Eph receptors requires their extracellular domain, but the cytoplasmic tails are interchangeable. Chimeras were designed in which cytoplasmic domains of EphA4 and EphB4 were swapped. Each chimera was tested for the ability to rescue depletion of endogenous EphA4 in the mesoderm or EphB4 in the ectoderm. Depleted Ephs are represented by “ghost” shapes. Separation could be rescued by the constructs that contained the corresponding extracellular domain (AB for EphA4, BA for EphB4), but not by the constructs that contained the cytoplasmic domain. A* and B* were control constructs, which were wild type except for two amino acids within the end of the transmembrane domain, which had to be substituted in AB and BA to produce the chimeric constructs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>

<p>Although ephrin/Eph depletion severely disrupts the endogenous ectoderm–mesoderm boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), the embryonic phenotype is difficult to interpret, due to multiple functions of ephrins and Ephs in various aspects of gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Park1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Bisson1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Tanaka1">[22]</xref> (Winklbauer unpublished). We thus performed most of our study on a reconstituted boundary produced by apposition of ectoderm and mesoderm explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1B,B′</xref>), an assay that allows an in-depth dissection of tissue separation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Wacker1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Winklbauer1">[23]</xref>. By systematic depletions using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2A</xref>,D), we established that each ephrin and each Eph is required, either in the ectoderm, in the mesoderm, or in both. Their depletion inhibited tissue separation to a degree that generally correlated with their relative tissue enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s001">Figures S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">S2A</xref>). Interference with ephrins or with Ephs on one side of the boundary, by single or multiple depletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) or dominant negative constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>, led to a maximal reduction of separation to 30–40%, whereas simultaneous interference on both sides of the boundary led to a significantly stronger inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), consistent with a requirement for two antiparallel forward signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>After having established that each ephrin and Eph subtype is required, we asked next whether a given subtype could be replaced by another member of the family. An ephrin or Eph was depleted, and rescue was attempted by mRNA injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), or by direct activation at the boundary through incubation with soluble preclustered ephrin or Eph extracellular domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Results from both kinds of rescues were in perfect agreement. Subtypes typically failed to substitute for each other, as observed for ephrinB1 and B3, or for EphA4 and B4. The only exception was ephrinB2, which could substitute for ephrinB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), a result that will be explained in later experiments. The apparent lack of rescue was not due to a lower activity of a particular construct or Fc-fragment, as rescue of the same subtype was in all cases efficient. This was confirmed by comparing two different amounts of ephrinB1 and B3 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) and verifying their expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). The lower amount was sufficient to rescue depletion of the same subtype, but depletion of the other subtype could only be marginally rescued with the highest amount. These results demonstrated an unexpectedly tight, although not absolute, specificity of the requirements for each ephrin and Eph. Note that the ability of the EphA4-Fc fragment to rescue loss of EphA4 also uncovered a contribution from reverse signaling to tissue separation.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>The Specificity of Eph Receptors Resides in Their Extracellular Domain</title>
<p>The specific requirement for all ephrinB subtypes and their receptors could be due to specific differences in downstream signaling and hence to different roles during tissue separation. Alternatively, signaling could be uniform and additive, but depend on specific receptor–ligand interactions. To determine whether Eph receptor specificity resided in their cytoplasmic tail or in their extracellular domains, we constructed EphA4/B4 chimeras, where the respective cytoplasmic domains were swapped, which we tested for the ability to substitute for endogenous EphA4 or EphB4 proteins. We verified that these chimeric constructs were properly expressed at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) and activated by ephrin-Fc fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). The functional assays gave clear-cut results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1E</xref>): The AB chimeric construct, which contained the extracellular domain of EphA4 and the intracellular domain of EphB4, could perfectly rescue the loss of EphA4, but was unable to substitute for EphB4. Reciprocally, the BA construct could rescue EphB4 but not EphA4 depletion. These results showed that the extracellular domains were responsible for the Eph specificity. The cytoplasmic domains appeared interchangeable, suggesting that the requirement for each of these Eph receptors was probably not due to differences in signaling but rather reflected the ability to bind selected ligands. We postulated that specific combinations of receptor–ligand pairs could underlie the restriction of repulsion to the boundary.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Complementarily Expressed Ephrins and Ephs Selectively Interact to Form Functional Pairs</title>
<p>If indeed specific ephrin–Eph pairs formed preferentially at the boundary, we predicted that ectopic addition of ephrins normally enriched in the mesoderm should induce artificial separation of two ectoderm explants. This prediction was fully verified. Indeed, ectoderm explants could be induced to repel each other by treatment with soluble Fc fragments for mesoderm-enriched ephrinB2 but not ephrinB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, the separation of two mesoderm explants was efficiently induced by incubation with ephrinB3, which is normally expressed only in the ectoderm, but not by ephrinB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2A′</xref>). Ectoderm–ectoderm separation could also be induced by “mesodermal” EphA4-Fc, but not by EphB4-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2A″ and A″′</xref>).</p>

<title>Characterization of ephrin–Eph specificity.</title>
<p>(A) Identification of functional cognate receptors. The in vitro separation assay was performed using two explants from the same tissue (ectoderm–ectoderm or mesoderm–mesoderm). Under normal conditions these explants mix completely. Separation could be induced when these explants were exposed to soluble Fc fragments corresponding to ephrins or Ephs normally enriched in the other tissue (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), thus mimicking the endogenous asymmetric ephrin/Eph expression. The endogenous functional partners were then identified by depleting single candidate ephrins/Ephs in the receiving explant and determining which of them was required for ectopic separation. Note that in this set of experiments, Fc fragments were present during the assay, ensuring that both explants were continuously exposed. Separation can also be induced by treating only one explant, although the penetrance is lower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>. (A) Separation of ectoderm explants was induced by soluble Fc fragments corresponding to “mesoderm-specific” ephrinB2, but not ephrinB1, already endogenously enriched in the ectoderm. EphrinB2-Fc–induced separation was strongly inhibited by EphB4MO and more weakly by EphB2MO. (A′) Mesoderm aggregates were tested on large mesoderm layers artificially produced in the animal pole of the embryo (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Separation was induced by Fc fragments of “ectoderm-specific” ephrinB3, but not ephrinB2. Ephrin3-induced separation was reversed by EphA4MO but not by EphB4MO (red arrow). (A″) Ectopic separation between ectoderm explants was induced specifically by “mesodermal” EphA4 but not by “ectodermal” EphB4. Separation was inhibited only by ephrinB3MO (red arrow). (A″′) Examples of mixing of ectoderm explants incubated with control Fc (arrows) and of separation of ectoderm explants treated with EphA4-Fc (arrowheads). (B) Biochemical analysis of differential activation of Eph receptors by ephrin ligands. Ectoderm explants were treated with 40 nM ephrinB1, B2, B3 Fc fragments or with control anti-Fc antibodies for 1 h, and then lysed. Endogenous EphB2 and EphB4, and EphA4 were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting for phospho-tyrosine and for total Eph levels. In the case of EphA4, which is only expressed at low levels in the ectoderm, EphA4-GFP was ectopically expressed. EphA4 was strongly phosphorylated in response to both ephrinB2 and ephrinB3, but not ephrinB1, which gave levels similar to negative controls.

<p>The sensitivity of ectoderm and mesoderm to respond to a subset of ephrin/Eph fragments implied that each of these two tissues must specifically express respective partners. We used the induction of ectopic separation as a functional assay to identify these endogenous receptors. Explants depleted of single ephrins or Ephs were tested for their ability to separate upon incubation with an Fc fragment. Among potential candidate receptors for ephrinB2 in the ectoderm, EphB4 depletion strongly inhibited ephrinB2-Fc–induced separation, whereas EphB2 depletion had a weaker effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The ability of ephrinB3 to induce mesoderm separation was entirely dependent on the presence of EphA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2A′</xref>). Finally, of all the three ephrin ligands expressed in the ectoderm, ephrinB3 was clearly the one responsible for EphA4-Fc–induced separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2A″</xref>). Although some of these results were consistent with the relative mRNA enrichments of the various ligands/receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), others clearly implied functional selectivity. For instance, in EphA4-induced ectoderm–ectoderm separation, an explanation based only on relative expression levels and under promiscuous binding could explain the minimal role of ephrinB2, which is scarce in the ectoderm, compared to abundantly expressed ephrinB3. However, this explanation would predict a much stronger effect of ephrinB1 depletion, as the latter is present at significant levels. Thus, the best explanation was that ephrinB3 and EphA4 tended to interact preferentially.</p>
<p>We directly assessed functional selectivity at the level of Eph activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). After treatment of ectoderm explants with equal concentrations of ephrinB1, B2, or B3 Fc fragments, each Eph receptor was immunoprecipitated, and the levels of phosphorylation were monitored by Western blot using an anti–phospho-tyrosine antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Astin1">[11]</xref>. Because of poor immunoprecipitation of the endogenous EphA4 protein with available antibodies, EphA4-YFP was ectopically expressed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody. In these experiments, cells were stimulated for 30 min, a time that should be sufficient to reach a bona fide steady state in terms of repulsive behavior, as separation can be induced already after a few minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>. The results were clear cut: EphA4 was highly phosphorylated in response to ephrinB2 or ephrinB3 but not ephrinB1. EphB2 responded strongly to ephrinB2 and weakly to ephrinB1. EphB4 was activated by ephrinB2 but neither ephrinB1 nor ephrinB3. These results correlate well with ephrin–Eph affinities measured in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-BlitsHuizinga1">[13]</xref>, with the notable exception of ephrinB1–EphB2, for which the affinity was reported to be similar to ephrinB2–EphB2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Gale1">[24]</xref>. Combined with the asymmetric distribution of the various molecules, the differences in binding largely explained our functional data. For instance, the failure of EphB4 to induce ectoderm separation was due to the low levels of ephrinB2 in this tissue, which is its only strong interactor. On the other hand, the ectoderm could respond to EphA4 via ephrinB3, but not ephrinB1.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results show that each Eph receptor is selective for one or at most two ephrins. These results support the hypothesis that tissue separation is driven by asymmetric expression of specific receptor–ligand pairs. Most of the ephrin/Eph pairs identified functionally show indeed partially complementary expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). This is clearly the case for ectodermal ephrinB3 and mesodermaly enriched EphA4. Likewise, ectodermaly enriched EphB2 and EphB4 interact best with mesodermaly enriched ephrinB2. However, not all factors are expressed in simple complementary patterns. In particular, EphA4 interacts not only with ectodermal ephrinB3 but equally well with ephrinB2, which is abundant in the mesoderm. In contrast, ephrinB1, evenly expressed in both tissues, can only weakly activate EphB2, which is enriched in the ectoderm. Note that ephrinB1 depletion in either tissue had a rather strong phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) considering that it seemed to only interact weakly with EphB2. This may be indicative of the occurrence of an additional receptor for ephrinB1 yet to be identified (see also supplementary discussion in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s016">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Complementary Expression of Specific Ephrin–Eph Pairs Is Sufficient to Account for Tissue Separation</title>
<p>Our results suggested that tissue separation may be simply explained by the complementary expression of selective ephrin/Eph pairs, which would generate an excess of repulsive signal at the boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Nevertheless, it is conceivable that particular ephrins and Ephs would also be specifically needed on one or the other side of the boundary. We examined this possibility for the ephrinB3–EphA4 pair, which is closest to a fully complementary expression pattern. We depleted ephrinB3 in the ectoderm and EphA4 in the mesoderm and asked whether separation could be rescued by ectopic re-expression of these two molecules in the opposite tissues. The results were unambiguous: Swapping ephrinB3 and EphA4 efficiently restored separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g003">Figure 3A′</xref>). The same result was obtained when ephrinB3 was provided as a soluble ligand to the surface of the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g003">Figure 3B′</xref>). Thus, the presence of ephrinB3 and EphA4, respectively, in the ectoderm and the mesoderm is not required for separation; the complementary expression appears sufficient.</p>

Swapping ephrinB3 and EphA4 efficiently restored separation. EphrinB3 could be replaced by ephrinB2, consistent with the latter also being a ligand for EphA4. However, EphA4 could not be substituted by EphB4, in agreement with EphA4 being the only receptor of ephrinB3. The weak nonsignificant rescue was likely due to a slight boost in the ephrinB2–EphB4 signal. (B, B′) Similar experiment, but with the ephrin ligand substituted by direct incubation of the receiving explant with the corresponding soluble Fc fragment. EphrinB3 and EphA4 were depleted, EphA4 was overexpressed in the ectoderm, and ectoderm explants were incubated with the indicated Fc fragments. Overexpression of EphA4 led to a partial rescue of separation (control Fc), likely by activating ephrinB2–EphA4 signaling across the boundary (red dashed double arrow). Incubation with ephrinB3-Fc fully rescued separation. EphrinB2-Fc but not the ephrinB1-Fc fragment could also rescue, in agreement with the selectivity of EphA4.</p>

On the contrary, they acted as dominant negatives, decreasing levels of receptor phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s004">Figure S4D</xref>) and inhibiting separation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s004">Figure S4A</xref>) to similar levels as MO depletion or expression of cytoplasmic truncated forms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>). This inhibition was fully rescued by co-expression of wild-type EphA4/B4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). We further tested the effect of these KD mutants in two other situations—that is, (a) in ectopic separation of two ectoderm, or of two mesoderm explants by soluble ephrinB2, respectively, B3 Fc fragments (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), or (b) in rescues of ephrinB2/B3 depletions by the corresponding Fc fragments (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

<title>Enhanced Eph Signaling and Myosin Activation at the Ectoderm–Mesoderm Boundary</title>
<p>Immunostaining of sections from wild-type gastrulae with an antibody recognizing a conserved phosphorylated site present in all EphBs demonstrated that Eph signaling was indeed activated in both ectoderm and mesoderm, but was significantly stronger at the boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g004">Figure 4A,A′</xref>). A similarly increased signal was observed with an anti–phospho-EphA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g004">Figure 4A′</xref>). We confirmed biochemically the existence of basal signaling in the tissues and enhanced activity at ectoderm–mesoderm contacts. Such contacts were maximized by mixing dissociated ectoderm and mesoderm cells to produce heterogeneous aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The levels of phosphorylated EphAs and EphBs in extracts of mixed aggregates were compared with those of pure ectoderm and mesoderm aggregates. Mixed aggregates showed higher p-EphA and p-EphB signals than combined homogenous ectoderm and mesoderm aggregates. We further showed that EphA phosphorylation in these ectoderm–mesoderm aggregates required ephrinB3, but not ephrinB1, further confirming the specificity of EphA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2D′</xref>). Thus, high local Eph activation is consistent with cell repulsion being restricted to the boundary, due to the preferential interactions between complementary pairs of ephrins and Ephs enriched on opposite sides of the boundary.</p>

<title>Separation Is Controlled by the Balance Between Ephrin–Eph-Dependent Repulsion and Cadherin-Mediated Adhesion</title>
<p>Significant Ephrin–Eph signaling also takes place within each of the two tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>). To account for the fact that the tissues remained coherent and overt cell detachments occurred only at the interface, we considered the role of cell–cell adhesion. We proposed that cohesion or separation is determined by a balance between cadherin adhesion and Eph signaling-dependent contractility. Although cadherin levels are lower in the most anterior mesendoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Krieg1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Winklbauer2">[31]</xref> and unpublished data), they are quite similar between the ectoderm and the mesoderm analyzed in our experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s005">Figure S5B</xref>), implying that the balance would mostly depend on the strength of Eph signaling. This signaling would take place at all cell contacts, but only at the boundary would the signal be sufficiently intense to overcome adhesion, thus causing cell detachment.</p>
<p>This model predicted that increasing cadherin levels or decreasing contractility should inhibit detachments between ectoderm and mesoderm cells, while on the contrary decreasing cell adhesion or increasing Eph signaling should lead to visible detachments between mesoderm cells. This hypothesis was consistent with the observation that ectoderm–mesoderm separation was impaired upon cadherin overexpression, which could be rescued by boosting Eph signaling across the tissue interface by incubation with soluble ephrin Fc fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Note that Eph depletion did not significantly affect cadherin levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s005">Figure S5B</xref>), arguing against a direct regulation of cadherins by ephrin–Eph signaling.</p>
<p>To explore the behavior at individual homotypic and heterotypic cell–cell contacts, we juxtaposed single cells obtained by dissociation of early gastrula tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g005">Figure 5A–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s009">Movies S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s015">S7</xref>). Our dissociation conditions fully preserved both the capacity of cells of the same tissue to rapidly re-establish stable adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g005">Figure 5D–G</xref>) and the ability for contacts between ectoderm and mesoderm cells to reproduce the alternating cycles of attachment/detachment characteristic of the separation behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g005">Figure 5A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s009">Movie S1</xref>). We first tested the effect of increasing cadherin levels on the normal repulsion between ectoderm and mesoderm cells.

<p>Because we expected mild repulsion between mesoderm cells, we predicted that detachments should become more prominent if adhesion would be experimentally decreased. We subjected mesoderm cells to a mild cadherin depletion (∼30%, not shown) and observed that contacts were now much less stable and cells displayed the typical repulsive behavior normally observed at contacts with ectoderm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g005">Figure 5E,H</xref> and Movies S4 and S5). These retractions were entirely dependent on intact ephrin/Eph signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g005">Figure 5F,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s014">Movie S6</xref>). We also predicted that mesoderm cells could become repellent even with normal cadherin levels if repulsive signals would be increased. We chose to express ephrinB3 and EphB4, because they are normally enriched in the ectoderm, and are the respective specific partners for mesoderm-enriched EphA4 and ephrinB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

<title>Simulating the Ephrin/Eph Network Reveals the Robustness and the Limits of the Model</title>
<p>Our results suggested that separation could be explained by the asymmetric expression of a subset of specific ephrin–Eph pairs, which resulted in widespread ephrin–Eph signaling, but with an altogether higher output across the boundary. Although the concept is intuitively coherent, the actual system is complex, with many ephrins and Ephs, including pairs that could interact extensively within one tissue (e.g., ephrinB2–EphA4 in the mesoderm). To better estimate the validity of this model, we simulated it by computing the contribution of all the various ephrin–Eph interactions established at homotypic contacts within the tissues and heterotypic contacts between tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s007">Figure S7</xref>). We considered a minimal model taking into account two parameters: (a) the affinities between the extracellular domains of ephrins and Ephs and (b) their relative expression in the different tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s016">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s007">Figure S7</xref>).

Endogenous levels for the different ephrin and Eph proteins could not be measured directly, due to lack of adequate antibodies, but were approximated based on relative mRNA levels determined by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) and on a global estimate obtained indirectly (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s016">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Note that these “apparent” affinities and concentrations are here purely operational terms. The actual system is hugely complex, constituted of multiple ligands and receptors, all of them membrane proteins, capable of spontaneous or ligand-induced clustering, and potentially also of cis-interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Kao1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Carvalho1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-WimmerKleikamp1">[37]</xref>. Most of these additional parameters and their impact on ephrin–Eph function are still ill-defined, and a formal description of such a system is a largely unresolved problem.</p>
<p>However, this simple model where receptor activation depends on its own concentration, the concentrations of its various potential ligands, and the corresponding affinities turned out to describe with surprising accuracy the situation at this boundary.

Quite strikingly, the result of the simulation closely resembled the relative levels of phosphorylated receptors in our immunofluorescence images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s007">Figure S7D and E</xref>, reproduced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The model was further tested for the ability to predict the outcome of loss- and gain-of-function experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s007">Figure S7F–J</xref>). The simulation recapitulated very well the major characteristics of the system. In particular, the specific induction of “separation” between ectoderm cells by activation with mesoderm-enriched ephrinB2 or EphA4, the inhibition of normal separation upon ephrin or Eph depletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s007">Figure S7G</xref>,H), and most importantly the fact that rescue could not be obtained indifferently by any ephrin (or Eph) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s007">Figure S7H</xref>) argued against widespread ligand–receptor promiscuity. It also accounted for our original observation that strong inhibition of separation required interfering with receptors on both sides of the boundary (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s007">Figure S7J</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2A</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude that a system of partially complementary and semiselective ephrin–Eph pairs is indeed sufficient to explain ectoderm–mesoderm separation. The robustness of the simulation provides strong support for the general principles of this model. Although multiple additional factors are likely to impact on the apparent concentrations and affinities, on the response curves of Eph activation, and more downstream on the contractile activity of boundary cells, such factors may not affect significantly the final global pattern. The reason for this robustness appears to be the very limited set of pairs that can effectively interact and thus influence the system, and the fact that three out of five of these pairs are asymmetrically expressed (ephrinB3–EphA4, ephrinB2–EphB2, and ephrinB2–B4). The simulation indicated that, for these five pairs, differences up to 10-fold in apparent affinities would change the relative strength of the outputs, but the signal remained strongest at the boundary under most conditions. The few aspects of our experimental data that were not well simulated are discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s016">Text S1</xref>. Discrepancies were certainly expected considering the many additional mechanisms that can modulate ephrin–Eph signaling. Nevertheless, the predictions of the simulation were surprisingly good given the simplicity of the assumptions. We conclude that a combination of multiple semiselective pairs is sufficient to explain a large part of the system's behavior.</p>

<title>Selective Ephrin–Eph Pairs at the Ventral Ectoderm–Mesoderm and at the Notochord Boundaries</title>
<p>We wondered whether the principles found for the early ectoderm–mesoderm boundary would similarly apply to other boundaries. Ephrin and Eph expression is indeed widespread in the gastrula embryo, and two other important boundaries form during this phase. A ventral boundary appears at midgastrula to separate the ectoderm for the ventral mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), which is known to have properties different from those of dorsal axial mesoderm. At the end of gastrulation, the dorsal mesoderm is partitioned into the axial notochord and lateral paraxial mesoderm (prospective somitic mesoderm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). In the latter case, we recently showed that ephrins and Ephs were indeed involved in separation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Fagotto1">[38]</xref>. We decided to systematically analyze the patterns of ephrin/Eph expression in these two regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). We found that the same set of ephrins and Ephs was expressed in those regions. The expression patterns revealed common themes as well as some significant differences (summarized in the diagrams of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In the case of the ventral boundary, the ephrinB3–EphA4 complementarity and the mesoderm enrichment of ephrinB2 were preserved. However, EphB4, which was enriched in the ectoderm on the dorsal side, was now homogenously expressed, whereas on the contrary ephrinB1, equal on both sides of the dorsal boundary, was here strongly asymmetric, now fully complementary to its receptor EphB2. In the late gastrula, the two new structures emerging from the dorsal mesoderm showed very interesting expression patterns: The notochord had preserved strong EphA4 and ephrinB2 expression, which were the major characteristics of the early mesoderm. The paraxial mesoderm, however, had dramatically modified its ephrin/Eph expression, acquiring typical features of ectoderm—that is, low EphA4 and high EphB4. Note that the complementarity was strong for Eph receptors, but rather mild for the ephrins. However, a similar trend was observed, where the notochord remained more “mesoderm-like” (higher ephrinB2, lower ephinB3), and the paraxial mesoderm was now more “ectoderm-like” (lower ephrinB2, higher ephinB3).</p>

The top drawings represent sagittal sections of the corresponding stages and highlight the two tissues forming the corresponding boundary. At stage 14, the boundaries between the notochord (no) and the paraxial mesoderm (pm) form perpendicular to the plane of the section. Cross-section is shown in insert. ar, archenteron roof; ne, neuroderm. In the lower diagrams, the position of the boxes representing each molecule symbolizes its general distribution: A box placed on one side of the boundary corresponds to strong asymmetric distribution. Weakly asymmetric or homogenous distributed molecules are drawn overlapping the boundary. The double arrows link the functional pairs. The patterns at the dorsal and the ventral boundaries are similar, with two prominent differences: EphrinB1 shifts from equal in the two dorsal tissues to more mesodermal in the ventral side. EphB4, on the contrary, shifts from mainly ectodermal to equally distributed. At the end of gastrulation, the dorsal mesoderm experiences significant changes: Compared to the earlier dorsal mesoderm, the notochord (no) keeps EphA4 and ephrinB2, but the paraxial mesoderm (pm) loses EphA4 and acquires ephrinB3 and EphB4, which were until then typically ectodermal. Note that the major asymmetries concern EphA4 and B4; the other components are only slightly enriched in one or the other sides of the boundary.</p>

<p>These observations suggested that tissues that became separated by boundaries expressed some sort of “modules” characterized in particular in all cases by complementary ephrinB3–EphA4 expression, but had some flexibility for other components. We then tested the role of key players, at both boundaries. In the case of the ventral boundary, we used the classical separation assay, attempting both loss- and gain-of-function experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s008">Figure S8</xref>). All the results were in perfect agreement with the expression patterns and with our model. Similar to the dorsal boundary, depletion of either the ectoderm-enriched ephrinB3 or of its mesoderm partner EphA4 inhibited separation. In addition, ephrinB1 depletion in the mesoderm, which had only a weak effect on the dorsal side, affected here separation much more drastically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). Depletion in the ectoderm of its receptor EphB2 similarly inhibited separation.</p>
<p>In gain-of-function experiments, both mesoderm-enriched ephrinB1 and B2 could induce robust separation between two ectoderm explants when added as soluble Fc fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s008">Figure S8C</xref>), an effect that could not be obtained with ephrinB1 on the dorsal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). We used this phenotype to identify the functional partner of ephrinB1 on the ectoderm surface. We found that EphB2, but not EphB4, depletion significantly inhibited separation, functionally validating our biochemical results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of ephrins and Ephs on the notochord boundary was examined by targeted depletion in a restricted region of the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Fagotto1">[38]</xref>. The effect on the integrity of the boundary was examined on sections of whole embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We tested depletion of the two strongly asymmetric Eph receptors, A4 and B4, and of their ligands ephrinB2 and B3. We observed in each case strong disruption of the boundary. However, each ephrin/Eph MO disrupted the boundary only when targeted to the expressing tissue: ephrinB3 MO and EphB4 MO in the paraxial mesoderm, EphA4 MO in the notochord. EphrinB2 MO was the only one that had an effect on both sides. These phenotypes were perfectly consistent with the distribution and partial specificity of these molecules. For the receptors, which were strongly asymmetrically expressed, MO injection obviously had an effect only when targeted to the tissue where they were enriched. For the ligands, the results were explained by their specificity. Indeed, the only receptor for ephrinB3 is EphA4, enriched in the notochord; thus, despite the poor complementarity of ephrinB3 distribution, its depletion only impaired separation when targeted to the opposite tissue (paraxial mesoderm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g007">Figure 7D,E,L</xref>). EphrinB2, however, can stimulate both EphA4 and EphB4 and was thus predicted to significantly contribute to generate repulsion at both sides of the boundary, explaining the widespread effect of its depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g007">Figure 7L</xref>). We further verified that this functional selectivity was purely due to extracellular interactions: We used the EphA4 and B4 chimeras to rescue disruption of the notochord boundary upon EphA4 or EphB4 depletion. In both cases, rescue was only achieved by expression of the chimeric construct that harbored the proper extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g007">Figure 7F–K,M</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Summary of ephrin and Eph expression and of the functional pairs (double arrows) in the dorsal mesoderm at stage 14 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). (B–M) Manipulations were targeted to a restricted region of the dorsal mesoderm. Embryos were fixed at stage 14, and the dorsal structure was analyzed on sections. Injected cells were detected by the tracer Myc-GFP (red). Only the strongest signal is visible on these images but is sufficient to indicate the position of the injected area. Membranes were labeled with an anticadherin antibody (green). In (D) and (E), FoxA4-positive nuclei appear in green–cyan. FoxA4 is used as the notochord marker. (B) Control. Normal boundaries (highlighted by dashed lines) were characterized by a smooth alignment of the notochord and paraxial mesoderm cells. (C) Strong boundary disruption in an ephrinB2 MO-injected embryo. The position of the left boundary can still be located (arrowheads), but the alignment is jagged (arrowhead). On the right side, the two tissues are continuous, without a detectable boundary. Arrows point to the approximate limit of the notochord. (D and E) The boundary is effectively disrupted by ephrinB3 MO targeted to the paraxial mesoderm (arrows in D), but not to the notochord (E). (F–H) EphA4 MO injection in the notochord, the tissue fused with the paraxial mesoderm (F, arrows). A boundary can be rescued by the coinjection of mRNA coding for the AB Eph chimera (G, dashed lines) but not by the BA chimera (H, boundaries lack on both sides, arrows). Thus, the extracellular domain of EphA4 is necessary and sufficient for its function in the notochord. (I) Inhibition of separation by EphB4 MO targeted to the paraxial mesoderm. Left boundary is missing (arrows). (J) Rescue by the BA chimera. The injection was targeted to the right boundary. (K) The AB chimera fails to rescue. The injection was targeted to the left side (arrows). The right boundary is intact (dashed line). (L) Quantification of boundary disruption by ephrin/Eph depletion. Individual boundaries were scored as follows: 1, intact boundary; 0.5, partially disrupted boundary (rare cases); 0, fully disrupted boundary. The first column (t) compiles data of all embryos, (no) and (pm) the number of boundaries where injection was mainly targeted to the notochord or to the paraxial mesoderm. Numbers on top are numbers of embryos (2–6 independent experiments). EphrinB2, which can interact with both EphA in the notochord and EphB4 in the paraxial mesoderm, was required in both tissues. EphrinB3 and EphB4 depletion strongly disturbed the boundary when targeted to the paraxial mesoderm, but had no effect in the notochord. The opposite was observed for EphA4, consistent with the expression patterns and the selective interactions. (M) Quantification of rescues by wild type and chimera forms of EphA4 and EphB4. In all cases, complete rescue was obtained with the corresponding wild-type proteins and with the chimera containing the correct extracellular domain. The nature of the intracellular domain was indifferent. Numbers on top indicate total number of boundaries in each category.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reconciles several previous puzzling observations and provides a coherent description of boundary formation based on selective repulsion between two cell populations. In particular, it explains how in tissues with widespread expression of multiple ephrin ligands and Eph receptors, cell–cell repulsion due to receptor–ligand interaction can be restricted to tissue boundaries. Situations where ephrins and Ephs are co-expressed were expected to be dauntingly complex, considering the many possible cross-regulations proposed to occur and the potentially distinct pathways that each member of these families may stimulate. However, we found that the essence of the early boundaries can be represented by a surprisingly simple model where the final output can be largely predicted based on the relative selectivity of the extracellular interactions and the abundance of the various components.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the system cannot be simply reduced to the sum of binary inputs of individual specific pairs expressed in opposite tissues, but must rather be viewed as an integrated network made of semiselective pairs. Most of the molecules have more than one partner (ephrinB2 interacts will all receptors), and expression patterns range from equal distribution on both sides of the boundary to strong enrichment in one tissue, with intermediate partial asymmetries being most frequent. These characteristics of the network explain well its reaction to experimental manipulations: Although each component was required to a degree that generally corresponded to its expression levels and distribution, the specificity of the requirement was not absolute, as it could in some cases be substituted by another subtype that shared the same partner (ephrinB2 and ephrinB3 with EphA4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In other words, the role of each of the ephrins and of the Eph receptors is dictated by the possibility to establish an interaction with a partner across the boundary. Note that some weaker degree of rescue was also achieved by components that did not interact with the same partner, as in the cases of ephrinB1 and ephrinB3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). In those cases, overexpression could apparently boost signaling through a different ephrin–Eph pair, although this did not efficiently compensate for the loss of the original signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). These partial compensations are fully expected in this type of network. Arguably the most definitive validation of the model came from the ephrinB3–EphA4 swapping experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g003">Figure 3</xref>), which demonstrated that separation did not depend on the presence of a particular ephrin or Eph in the ectoderm or the mesoderm, but on the ability of selective pairs to establish interactions across the boundary.</p>
<p>Having said that the system is an integrated network, it is equally important to highlight the fact that only a subset of potential ephrin–Eph combinations (five out of nine) can establish interactions of functional significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This subset of functional pairs is identical to the one determined as capable of in vitro binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-BlitsHuizinga1">[13]</xref>. Thus, our data represent a solid in vivo validation of the notion of partial ephrin–Eph specificity of ligand-receptor interactions. As discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s016">Text S1</xref>, the fact that ephrins and Ephs are all expressed at similar levels, that the affinities of the five functional pairs are all in the same range, and that the impact of varying these affinities is predicted to be limited allow us to summarize the system in a simple model, where all functional pairs may be considered as producing equivalent contributions. The output appears then largely imposed by the partially complementary patterns of several of these pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, there data represent to our knowledge the most extensive dissection of network made of multiple ligands and receptors. Its success relied on the extensive use of combinations of loss- and gain-of function experiments comparing in parallel different ephrins and Ephs. Concerns often arise when attempting to evaluate the ability of one member of a gene family to substitute for another, due to the difficulty to control for the activity of the reagents. In this context, the strength of our experimental system resides in the high coherence of the systematic comparison of multiple conditions, including cross-rescues, where each reagent was validated in at least one of the complementary conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g001">Figure 1D,E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The comparison of three morphologically similar, cleft-like boundaries that form during Xenopus gastrulation and depend on Eph–ephrin signaling allowed us to extract recurrent regulatory motives in the form of complementary receptor–ligand pairs: ephrinB3—EphA4, ephrinB1–EphB2, and ephrinB2–EphB4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g007">Figure 7</xref>). For each boundary, at least two of these three pairs show complementary expression patterns. Moreover, we had shown previously that complete ectoderm–mesoderm boundary formation requires antiparallel ligand–receptor signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>. We observed now that at all three boundaries studied here, the respective complementary pairs were arranged in an antiparallel pattern (e.g., ephrinB3–EphA4 from ectoderm to mesoderm, ephrinB2–EphB2 from mesoderm to ectoderm). Of the complementary pairs, ephrinB3–EphA4 is most systematically exploited in the different contexts, suggesting that it may be specialized in tissue separation.</p>
<p>Altogether, the logic of ephrin/Eph-dependent repulsion regulation at tissue interfaces can be reconstructed as follows. For the complete cleft-like separation, a minimum of two antiparallel receptor–ligand pairs is required. If both receptors and both ligands were completely specific, signaling would be completely restricted to the boundary, as the ligands and receptors co-expressed in each tissue would interact only with partners in the adjacent tissue. If interactions were completely promiscuous, signaling intensity within each tissue were similar to that across the boundary, leading to the disintegration of the whole array. If interactions were relatively specific, favoring signaling between complementarily expressed pairs, repulsion could be restricted to the boundary by a threshold mechanism where full cell–cell detachment occurs only above a certain level of signaling intensity. In this situation, additional expression of receptors and ligands, with additional strong or weak interactions, would be compatible with proper boundary formation as long as signaling remained below the threshold within each tissue, and exceeded it at the tissue interface. This third scenario is the one that we encountered in the embryo. Such a dynamic yet robust system appears perfectly suited for the complex morphogenesis of vertebrate embryos. For example, they allow combining multiple functions of ephrin/Eph signaling, in the same tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Poliakov2">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Smith1">[40]</xref> and Winklbauer unpublished).</p>
<p>The rules identified in this study provide a coherent logic to tissue separation. For instance, one now understands how separation between dorsal ectoderm and mesoderm is established at the onset of gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Wacker1">[19]</xref>. The system builds on the EphB receptors, which are already expressed before gastrulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Their enrichment in the prospective ectoderm is the typical default distribution for maternal components. This intrinsic bias in expression becomes functionally relevant once the mesoderm starts expressing ephrinB2, the strongest ligand for EphB receptors, initiating a forward signal into the ectoderm. The simultaneous expression of ephrin B3 in the ectoderm and its receptor EphA4 in the mesoderm provides the antiparallel forward signal into the mesoderm, completing the requirement for full tissue separation at this boundary. In subsequent stages, this pattern is progressively modified. Complementary expression of ephrinB3 and EphA4 is still involved in all cases, but other components, including those which were maternally expressed, are now tightly regulated and change their expression pattern. This is the case for ephrinB1, which, while ubiquitously expressed and hence neutral during dorsal ectoderm–mesoderm boundary formation, becomes mesoderm-enriched to play a prominent role on the ventral side. Other pairs, such as ephrinB2–EphA4, should interact extensively within a tissue, presumably providing tissue-specific functions.</p>
<p>Are other boundaries controlled by a similar integrated network? Information of ephrin/Eph expression patterns in other systems is incomplete and not quantitative, but somites and most rhombomeres express more than one ephrin and/or Eph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Cooke1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Kemp1">[3]</xref>, in patterns that are consistent with the basic principles described in our study: For instance, ephrinB3 and EphA4 are expressed in complementary patterns in several rhombomeres and are never enriched on the same side of the boundary. EphrinB2, on the contrary, is found both opposite to as well as on the same side as its receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Kemp1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Flanagan1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Cooke2">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>These findings reveal that the surface of embryonic cells is endowed with a rich array of receptors that upon direct contact with neighboring cells can establish very specific interactions. We show how such systems, by integrating the signals generated by all the combinations of high- and low-affinity interactions, can produce clear-cut decisions at tissue interfaces and at the same time tolerate a good degree of within-tissue signaling. The key to this behavior of the ephrin/Eph system is the balance of adhesion and repulsion and its regulated breakdown at a preset threshold for repulsion.</p>
<p>Although this model can largely explain tissue separation, our results do not exclude that particular ephrins or Ephs may play important additional roles. They may allow for the fine-tuning of the various signals, both at the boundary and within the tissues. EphrinB2–EphA4 constitutes an example of a pair that, at all stages, interacts extensively within a tissue and may provide tissue-specific functions. One such additional layer of regulation that remains to be investigated is suggested by our reaggregation assays, which showed that ephrinB2 or EphB4 depletion decreased cohesion of the ectoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Rohani1">[4]</xref>, indicating that at least under some circumstances these molecules behave as “pro-adhesive” in the ectoderm, while they are repulsive in the mesoderm and across the boundary.</p>
<p>We also provide here an important distinction between activities that are intrinsic to each tissue and reactions that occur specifically at the boundary. Our observation that global levels of myosin activation are much higher in the ectoderm is fully consistent with its well-known stiffness and much lower capacity for spreading on adhesive substrates and for migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Wacker1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Krieg1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Winklbauer2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Krens1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Luu1">[43]</xref>. However, we also detect a second p-MLC pool, which, unlike the former, is Eph-dependent, and highly concentrated at the boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Despite a large difference in “basal” myosin activity, the two tissues cannot remain separated in the absence of Eph signaling. Previous hypotheses based on differential adhesion/tension fail to accurately describe this situation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Krieg1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Matre1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Matre2">[45]</xref>. Our observations are, however, in full agreement with our model of “selective repulsion” controlled by potent and highly localized ephrin–Eph reactions, dominating at specific cell–cell contacts over the adhesive and tensile tissue properties. Adhesion (and cortical tension) does participate in the global equation by setting the general properties of the tissues, and we show here that separation results from the balance between adhesion and ephrin-mediated repulsion. The network of Ephrin signaling is thus set at the appropriate level to overcome adhesion along the boundary, without jeopardizing cohesion within the tissues. Experimental manipulation of cadherin levels can disrupt this balance, at least in the situation of the early ectoderm and mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001955-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001955.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The notochord boundary is, however, an example where separation is remarkably robust, resisting to rather strong changes in cadherin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Fagotto1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Reintsch1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001955-Ninomiya1">[47]</xref>. How adhesion, basal tension, and ephrin signaling are differently set at difference boundaries to confer their specific characteristics will be an important question to investigate.</p>
<p>To explain his original discovery of cell sorting, Holtfreter had hypothesized that various cell types harbor different surface cues that he called “affinities.” The combinatorial network of ephrins and Ephs here unraveled provides a molecular basis to this concept. Ephrins and Ephs and other similar cell–cell contact-dependent cues are expressed in a wide variety of tissues, both in the embryo and in the adult, and we predict that the principles uncovered in the Xenopus gastrula may apply to a vast spectrum of cellular processes and account for the ability of cell types to distinguish between “self” and “nonself” and thus organize into multicellular structures.</p>

For instance, separation was strongly inhibited by ephrinB3 but not ephrinB2 depletion in the ectoderm, whereas ephrinB2 depletion had a strong effect in the mesoderm. Depletion of ephrinB1 gave intermediate inhibition in both tissues. The separation remaining after multiple ephrin or Eph depletions in one tissue was ∼30%–40%. Maximal inhibition could be reached in some cases by depletion of single molecules (e.g., ephrinB3 or EphB2 in the ectoderm).

GFP, immunolabeled here in red, was coexpressed as a tracer. Both chimeras were well expressed at the plasma membrane. (B) Eph phosphorylation. Eph receptors appeared as major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in gastrula extracts, which allowed estimation of activation levels by blotting whole extract with an anti–p-Tyr antibody. Wild-type ectoderm explants or explants expressing AB or BA chimeras were incubated with ephrinB2 or ephrinB3 fragments for 30 min before extraction. Total extracts were analyzed by immunoblot using antibodies against p-Tyr and EphA4/B4 extracellular domains. EphB4 recognized a single band, but P-Tyr and EphA4 showed multiple bands. In the case of the anti-EphA4 antibody, this reflected cross-reactivity with other Eph receptors. However, comparison of controls and AB/BA overexpression indicated that the highest band in p-Tyr and EphA4 blots (long arrow) appeared specific for EphA4, whereas the intermediate band (short arrow) corresponded to EphB4, the lower bands (arrowheads) a combination of both. Multiple bands may be due to differences in posttranslational modifications, in particular phosphorylation on multiple residues. Altogether, both chimeras appeared to be activated to similar levels by Fc fragments corresponding to cognate ligands. Note a slight activation by ephrinB2 Fc in controls, reflecting the abundance of endogenous receptors for ephrinB2 in the ectoderm.</p>

Contacts between ectoderm and mesoderm cells underwent cycles of attachment (arrowheads) and repulsion/detachment (arrows). This movie shows maximum projection of 3 z planes of 0.2 µm distance.</p>
