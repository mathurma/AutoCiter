<abstract>
<p>Brain development requires a massive increase in brain lipogenesis and accretion of the essential omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Brain acquisition of DHA is primarily mediated by the transporter Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain containing 2a (Mfsd2a) expressed in the endothelium of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and other abundant cell types within the brain. Mfsd2a transports DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) esterified to lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC-DHA). However, the function of Mfsd2a and DHA in brain development is incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate, using vascular endothelial-specific and inducible vascular endothelial-specific deletion of <italic>Mfsd2a</italic> in mice, that Mfsd2a is uniquely required postnatally at the BBB for normal brain growth and DHA accretion, with DHA deficiency preceding the onset of microcephaly. In Mfsd2a-deficient mouse models, a lipidomic signature was identified that is indicative of increased de novo lipogenesis of PUFAs. Gene expression profiling analysis of these DHA-deficient brains indicated that sterol regulatory-element binding protein (Srebp)-1 and Srebp-2 pathways were highly elevated. Mechanistically, LPC-DHA treatment of primary neural stem cells down-regulated Srebp processing and activation in a Mfsd2a-dependent fashion, resulting in profound effects on phospholipid membrane saturation. In addition, Srebp regulated the expression of Mfsd2a. These data identify LPC-DHA transported by Mfsd2a as a physiological regulator of membrane phospholipid saturation acting in a feedback loop on Srebp activity during brain development.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The brain is the most lipid-rich organ in the body. Brain development involves a tremendous increase in the synthesis and accretion of fatty acids. De novo synthesis of fatty acids is mediated by Srebp transcription factors, whereas acquisition of essential fatty acids via uptake of plasma-derived lysophosphatidylcholine containing the essential omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (LPC-DHA) is mediated by the transporter Mfsd2a in the cells that line the blood vessels in the brain. The function of Mfsd2a and DHA in brain development is incompletely understood. Our study determined that Mfsd2a is required at the blood-brain barrier for brain development and accretion of DHA after birth in mice. Moreover, we determined that a major function of DHA in the brain is to negatively regulate Srebp activation, resulting in profound effects on membrane phospholipid composition. These findings reveal that LPC-DHA transported by Mfsd2a plays a physiological role in both brain growth and in maintaining plasma membrane phospholipid composition during brain development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The brain is one of the most lipid-rich organs in the body, consisting mostly of glycerophospholipids, cholesterol, and sphingolipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref001">1</xref>]. Prenatal brain development is a complex developmental process that involves the coordinated establishment of hundreds of specialized cell types and the building of synaptic connectivity, together with a functioning blood-brain barrier (BBB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref004">4</xref>]. Postnatal brain growth involves proliferation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, myelination of axons, and expansion of neuron dendrites. A common and essential requirement for both prenatal and postnatal brain development is the biosynthesis of a massive amount of membrane phospholipid, the origin of which was believed to be exclusively derived from de novo biosynthesis within cells of the brain, and acquisition of essential fatty acids from the periphery into the developing brain. De novo lipogenesis is driven by sterol regulatory-element binding proteins (SREBPs), identified by Brown and Goldstein to be transcription factors that are important for the regulation of genes that maintain cellular lipid homeostasis. There are 3 known isoforms—Srebp-1a, -1c, and Srebp-2; Srebp-1c regulates genes in fatty acid biosynthesis, Srebp-2 regulates genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, and Srebp-1a regulates both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref005">5</xref>]. Srebp-1c and -2 predominate in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref006">6</xref>]. In the presence of cholesterol or oxysterols, the precursor form of Srebp (about 130 kDa), in complex with its chaperone protein sterol cleavage-activating protein (Scap), is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bound to insulin-induced gene 1 (Insig-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref007">7</xref>]. In the absence of sterols, the Srebp-Scap complex is released from Insig-1 and transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus on COPII vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref008">8</xref>]. At the Golgi, the Srebp precursor is cleaved by Site-1 and Site-2 proteases, releasing the N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor domain (about 60–70 kDa) that enters the nucleus and activates target genes by binding to sterol regulatory elements (SREs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref009">9</xref>]. Underscoring the importance of de novo lipogenesis for brain development, targeted deletion of Scap in brain resulted in perinatal lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 fatty acid that is highly enriched in brain phospholipids, particularly in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) pools and comprises up to 15% or more of the total fatty acid composition of the prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref012">12</xref>]. During human fetal development, a rapid increase in brain DHA level is reported to occur at the end of the second trimester, which coincides with the development of the BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref014">14</xref>]. The accretion of DHA in brain continues from early postnatal days until approximately 2 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref017">17</xref>]. Decreased levels of DHA in the developing brain have been linked with negative effects on cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref019">19</xref>] and neurodevelopmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref022">22</xref>]. Importantly, DHA itself cannot be de novo synthesized efficiently in brain and must be transported across the BBB. Our laboratory discovered Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain containing 2a (Mfsd2a), a sodium-dependent lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) transporter highly expressed by the endothelium of the BBB and the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), to be the major pathway for brain and eye DHA accretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref024">24</xref>]. Mfsd2a does not transport unesterified DHA, but DHA esterified as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC-DHA). Mice with gene-targeted deletion of <italic>Mfsd2a</italic> (2aKO) exhibited severe microcephaly and brain DHA deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref025">25</xref>]. Importantly, we have also identified 3 families with homozygous nonsynonymous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>Mfsd2a</italic> that presented with severe microcephaly and intellectual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref027">27</xref>]. Moreover, plasma LPC levels were increased in affected patients relative to controls and, similar to 2aKO mice, consistent with a lack of brain uptake of LPCs. Collectively, these findings suggested that brain growth and function was impaired in patients because of the lack of transport of LPCs, and likely in part because of brain deficiency in DHA. Despite the abundance and importance of DHA in the developing brain, very little is known about its biochemical and molecular function. In the current study, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Mfsd2a is required at the BBB during postnatal life to mediate normal brain growth and that DHA deficiency precedes the onset of microcephaly. Moreover, using an unbiased gene-profiling approach, we determined that a major function of DHA during brain development is to regulate Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 activity resulting in major changes in phospholipid saturation.</p>

<title>Mfsd2a is required at the BBB for postnatal brain growth</title>
<p>We previously found that the brain sizes of conventional gene-targeted Mfsd2a knockout mice (2aKO) at embryonic day 18.5 (e18.5), a stage equivalent to late third trimester in human development, were similar to wild-type (WT) littermates, and the brains were DHA deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref023">23</xref>]. These findings suggest that DHA deficiency precedes the development of microcephaly in 2aKO brain and that the development of microcephaly occurs postnatally. While Mfsd2a expression is highest in endothelial cells of the BBB, Mfsd2a is expressed in other cell types within the brain parenchyma—notably the oligodendrocyte lineage, and at lower levels in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s003">S1A Fig</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref028">28</xref>]; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s003">S1B Fig</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref029">29</xref>]). To determine if Mfsd2a deficiency at the BBB endothelium is responsible for microcephaly reported in 2aKO mice, an endothelial-specific deletion of Mfsd2a was generated using a floxed allele of Mfsd2a (2a<sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>) crossed to the endothelial cre-driver line Tie2 (2aECKO). Brain weights of adult 2aECKO mice were significantly reduced relative to control floxed mice (2a<sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), consistent with reduced brain size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This reduction in brain size in 2aECKO mice was similar to the microcephaly of 2aKO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref023">23</xref>] and indicates that Mfsd2a in the BBB is essential for brain development.</p>

<p>To determine if Mfsd2a at the BBB is required for postnatal brain development, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible endothelial-specific Mfsd2a deletion mouse model using the Cdh5ERT2-cre driver line crossed to 2a<sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice (2aiECKO). Deletion of Mfsd2a was induced by tamoxifen injection of pups for 3 consecutive days beginning at the day of birth, and brains were harvested at 4 weeks of age (injection scheme, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s004">S2A Fig</xref>), a time when brain growth is largely completed. Immunofluorescence imaging indicated reduced Mfsd2a at the BBB in 2aiECKO mice relative to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s004">S2B Fig</xref>). Brain weights and sizes of 2aiECKO mice were significantly reduced relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Because neurogenesis and cortical patterning are completed before birth, prenatal causes of microcephaly commonly result in changes in cortical patterning, while postnatal causes of microcephaly often result in decreased neuron arborization (i.e., decreased neuron dendrite branching) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref030">30</xref>]. Remarkably, despite the reduction in size of the adult brain cortex of 2aKO mice, cortical patterning of 2aKO is similar to WT brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). In addition, the cortex of brains of 2aKO mice at e18.5, prior to the development of microcephaly, also showed normal cortical patterning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s006">S4 Fig</xref>). Consistent with a role of Mfsd2a in postnatal brain growth, brains of 2aKO and 2aiECKO exhibited significantly reduced neuronal arborization and decreased dendrite length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g001">Fig 1E, 1F and 1G</xref>). These data indicate that Mfsd2a is required for postnatal brain growth and are consistent with the conclusion that LPC transport into the brain provides lipid for the rapidly expanding brain.</p>

<title>Mfsd2a expression at the BBB is indispensable for DHA accretion during postnatal brain growth</title>
<p>Given that Mfsd2a is required at the BBB for postnatal brain growth, we tested whether Mfsd2a at the BBB is also required for postnatal brain DHA accretion. We took a targeted lipidomic approach to quantify major DHA-containing brain phospholipids in PC, PE, and PS in the rapidly growing postnatal day 8 (P8) brain. Consistent with the development of postnatal microcephaly, 2aECKO and 2aiECKO brains were already significantly smaller at P8 relative to 2a<sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>). Targeted lipidomic analysis of 2aECKO demonstrated a profound 70% decrease in DHA-containing phospholipids in the combined PC, PE, and PS pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, heatmaps illustrating percentage of individual PC, PE, and PS phospholipid species shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s007">S5 Fig</xref>). We have previously shown that 2aKO mice exhibited a significant increase in arachidonic acid (AA)-containing brain phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref023">23</xref>]. However, 2aECKO brains had a 40% decrease in AA-containing phospholipids in the combined PC, PE, and PS pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s007">S5 Fig</xref>), suggesting that increased AA observed in brains of 2aKO was the result of Mfsd2a deficiency at the BBB combined with deficiency in the brain parenchyma. Notably, a significant 6-fold increase in the combined PC, PE, and PS pools containing a fatty acid sum composition of 3 double bonds was observed in 2aECKO brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s007">S5 Fig</xref>). An increase in fatty acid desaturation is intriguing, because these fatty acid species are the products of fatty acid desaturases (i.e., SCD and FADS) that are rate-limiting enzymes in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthesis. Increases in these particular fatty acid species in 2aECKO brains were also noted in 2aKO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref023">23</xref>]. Performing the same targeted lipidomic analysis on P8 brains of 2aiECKO and controls revealed that 2aiECKO brains had a significant 40% reduction in DHA-containing phospholipids in the combined PC and PE pools and an 18% reduction in AA-containing phospholipids in the combined PC, PE, and PS pools, albeit at a lower magnitude difference relative to 2aECKO brains. Similar to 2aECKO brains, a significant 4-fold increase in the combined PC, PE, and PS pools containing a fatty acid sum composition of 3 double bonds was observed in 2aiECKO brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, heatmaps illustrating percentage of individual PC, PE, and PS phospholipid species shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s008">S6 Fig</xref>). These lipidomic analyses indicated that Mfsd2a plays an essential role for DHA accretion at the BBB during the rapid phase of postnatal brain growth. In addition, Mfsd2a deficiency at the BBB resulted in a lipidomic signature suggestive of increased de novo lipogenesis of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>

<title>De novo lipogenesis pathways are up-regulated in DHA-deficient brains</title>
<p>Mfsd2a knockout mice (i.e., 2aKO, 2aECKO, 2aiECKO) are the first genetic models of brain DHA deficiency without the need to feed mice omega-3 fatty acid–deficient diets. We reasoned that Mfsd2a deficiency models could be a suitable tool to identify biochemical pathways that are regulated by DHA, thus revealing functions of DHA in the growing brain. To exploit Mfsd2a deficiency models for this purpose, transcriptome analysis using gene microarrays was performed on the cerebrums of P8 or P9 2aKO, 2aECKO, and 2aiECKO and their respective age-matched controls (WT or 2a<sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>). Remarkably, the top predicted Reactome pathway for up-regulated genes in brains of 2aKO, 2aECKO, and 2aiECKO was the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins pathway that contains lipogenic targets of the transcription factor Srebp-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In addition, the cholesterol biosynthesis and steroid metabolism pathways were up-regulated in brains of 2aKO and 2aECKO, which contain targets of the transcription factor Srebp-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). MA plots were used to visualize the mean expression versus fold-change relationship for all genes, with individual targets in the Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 pathways indicated as red circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>, respectively). It is also interesting to note that these findings are consistent with the top 2 predicted up-regulated pathways in eyes from 2aKO mice, which are also DHA deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref024">24</xref>], suggesting that this result is likely a common adaptive response to Mfsd2a deficiency. Validation of increased Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 target gene expression was carried out by direct quantification of mRNA using Nanostring analysis. Consistent with the gene microarray findings, brains of 2aECKO mice had up-regulation of Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 target genes relative to controls, while only Srebp-1 target genes were up-regulated in brains of 2aiECKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>, respectively; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s009">S7 Fig</xref> for normalized counts of individual RNA targets). It is important to note that the increased brain content of phospholipids containing fatty acids derived from desaturase enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g002">Fig 2B and 2D</xref>) is consistent with increased expression of Srebp-1 target genes. Consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref006">6</xref>], Srebp-1c is the major Srebp-1 isoform in brain and up-regulated in brains of 2aECKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s010">S8 Fig</xref>). Next, we tested whether Srebp target genes would be up-regulated due to DHA deficiency prior to the development of microcephaly. Indeed, 2aECKO brains at e18.5 had a significant up-regulation of Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 target gene expression relative to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). These findings indicate that up-regulation of Srebp target gene expression might be a proximal adaptation to DHA deficiency, and the first demonstration of increased Srebp target gene expression as a result of DHA deficiency in brain.</p>

Immunolocalization of Mfsd2a in e18.5 WT and 2aKO brains showed that, in addition to Mfsd2a expression in the endothelium of the BBB, Mfsd2a was also found to be expressed in cells surrounding the ventricle, a region known to contain neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs), and co-localized with the neural stem cell marker Nestin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s011">S9A and S9B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref033">33</xref>]. To determine if NSCs express Mfsd2a, we generated an NSC deficiency model of Mfsd2a (NSC<sup>KO</sup>) using a Nestin-cre driver line that is expressed in NSCs.

<p>To further demonstrate that cell autonomous effects of down-regulation of Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 target gene expression by LPC-DHA are Mfsd2a dependent, we reintroduced WT Mfsd2a into NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells using adenovirus transduction. As a control, NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells were transduced with adenovirus expressing the Mfsd2a inactive mutant harboring a point mutant in the sodium-binding site where residue Aspartate-96 is converted to Alanine (Mfsd2a D96A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref023">23</xref>]. Non-adenovirus–transduced NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells were used as an additional control. Western blot analysis confirmed Mfsd2a expression in NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells transduced with Mfsd2a WT or Mfsd2a D96A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s012">S10A Fig</xref>). Indeed, in LPC-DHA–treated NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells re-expressing WT Mfsd2a, Srebp target genes were repressed relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). In contrast, repression of Srebp target genes was not observed in LPC-DHA–treated NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells expressing Mfsd2a D96A mutant, consistent with repression of Srebp target genes being dependent on Mfsd2a transport activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Inhibition of Srebp processing and therefore target gene expression in response to cholesterol loading or treatment of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol occurs on a rapid timescale of several hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref034">34</xref>]. To determine the kinetics of LPC-DHA–mediated down-regulation of Srebp target gene expression, we quantified transcriptomic changes from 1 to 16 hours of exposure to LPC-DHA in NSC<sup>WT</sup> cells using Nanostring analysis. Significant down-regulation of Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 target genes was observed as early as 4 hours posttreatment relative to untreated time point–matched control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). The inhibitory effect plateaued between 12 and 16 hours posttreatment. These findings indicate that down-regulation of Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 target gene expression in response to LPC-DHA treatment is rapid and exhibited a similar kinetic profile.</p>

<title>LPC-DHA inhibits Srebp activity and de novo lipogenesis</title>
<p>To investigate the specificity for LPC species and Mfsd2a dependency for repression of Srebp target gene expression, we used Scd1 protein levels as an initial readout. Western blot analysis was carried out using lysates on individual NSC<sup>WT</sup> and NSC<sup>KO</sup> cell lines isolated from 5 different mice for each genotype. Indeed, Scd1 protein levels were significantly decreased in all 5 NSC<sup>WT</sup> lines to a greater extent than in NSC<sup>KO</sup> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). These findings indicate both robustness of the repressive effect and dependency on Mfsd2a transport. It is known that PUFAs, which can enter cells through diffusion and not via Mfsd2a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref023">23</xref>], repress Srebp-1 processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref035">35</xref>]. Treatment of NSCs with unesterified DHA reduced Scd1 levels to a similar extent in both NSC<sup>WT</sup> and NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells, indicating that repression of Srebp activity in response to unesterified DHA is normal in NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Although transporter-independent passive diffusion of unesterified DHA occurs in vitro and represses Srebp-1 activation, previous findings have clearly demonstrated that brain uptake and accretion of DHA in vivo are dependent on LPC-DHA and Mfsd2a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref036">36</xref>].</p>

<p>(A) Western blot analysis of Scd1 and Mfsd2a expression in NSC<sup>WT</sup> and NSC<sup>KO</sup> treated with or without 50μM LPC-DHA.

(B) Western blot analysis of Scd1 and Mfsd2a expression in of NSC<sup>WT</sup> and NSC<sup>KO</sup> treated with or without 50 μM LPC-DHA or 50 μM DHA. DHA works in an Mfsd2a-independent manner to decrease Scd1 expression to a similar extent in NSC<sup>WT</sup> and NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells. β-actin served as a loading control. Capital letters above each lane represent biological replicates for each genotype (<italic>n</italic> = 2 for NSC<sup>WT</sup> and NSC<sup>KO</sup>). (C) Specificity of LPC species for down-regulation of Scd1. Western blot analysis of Scd1 and Mfsd2a expression in NSC<sup>WT</sup> treated with or without 50 μM each of LPC18:1, LPC18:2, LPC18:3, LPC20:4, or LPC22:6. Scd1 expression is more greatly reduced with increasing unsaturation of LPC-PUFAs. Mfsd2a expression remained relatively unchanged. β-actin served as a loading control. Technical replicates were carried out for each LPC treatment. (D) Dose-response effect of LPC-DHA on Srebp transcriptional activity. NSC<sup>WT</sup> and NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells were transfected with pSynSRE and treated with or without increasing concentrations of LPC-DHA, as indicated, or 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol, as a positive control for repression of Srebp activity. The bar chart shows percent luciferase activity to respective untreated control as mean ± SE.

The bar chart shows percent luciferase activity to untreated controls as mean ± SE. Sterols inhibit Srebp and were used as a positive control for inhibition of Srebp transcriptional activity. Increased repression of Srebp transcriptional activity relative to control was observed with increasing unsaturation of LPC-PUFAs, consistent with effects observed for down-regulation of Scd1 expression shown in panel (C).

Western blot analysis of Srebp-1 expression in NSC<sup>WT</sup> treated with or without 50 μM of LPC-DHA.

T0901317 (T0), an LXR agonist; GSK2033 (GSK), an LXR antagonist; Mevastatin plus mevalonic acid (Mev) inhibits HMG-CoAR activity; 25-hydroxycholesterol plus cholesterol (25-HC) inhibits Srebp-2 processing. β-actin served as a loading control.

<p>To explore the nature of LPC specificity for repression of Srebp pathway genes, NSC<sup>WT</sup> cells were treated with species of LPC having fatty acids with varying degrees of unsaturation and carbon chain length. Western blot analysis indicated that Scd1 levels declined with increasing unsaturation of the LPC, in line with Mfsd2a having a higher affinity for transporting LPCs with polyunsaturated acyl chains like DHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref023">23</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). To corroborate these findings using a different approach, we first determined the dose-response effect of LPC-DHA on Srebp transcriptional activity. Measurement of transcriptional activity was carried out by utilizing an 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase promoter (pSynSRE) plasmid construct containing 2 sterol response elements upstream of a luciferase reporter gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref037">37</xref>]. NSC<sup>WT</sup> and NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells transfected with pSynSRE were treated with increasing concentrations of LPC-DHA, and percent luciferase activity of control nontreated cells was quantified. Treatment of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol plus cholesterol was used as a positive control for inhibition of Srebp transcriptional activity. LPC-DHA inhibited Srebp transcriptional activity in a concentration-dependent fashion in NSC<sup>WT</sup> but not NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells, with approximately 50% inhibition at 25 μM LPC-DHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). This finding is significant because these effective LPC-DHA concentrations are within the physiological concentrations for LPCs containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (LPC-PUFA) found in human and mouse plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref038">38</xref>]. Consistent with western blot data for Scd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), Srebp transcriptional activity was inhibited to a greater extent by LPCs with increasing unsaturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>The effect of LPC-DHA to inhibit Srebp transcriptional activity would strongly point to an inhibitory effect on Srebp processing. To test this idea, western blot analysis was carried out to detect Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 precursor and nuclear forms in NSC<sup>WT</sup> cells treated with LPC-DHA. Positive controls for increased processing of Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 were the Liver X Receptor (LXR) agonist T0101317 and Mevastatin, respectively. LXR activation increases Srebp-1 expression and processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref041">41</xref>], while the LXR antagonist GSK2033 reduces Srebp-1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref042">42</xref>]. Positive controls for inhibition of Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 processing were the LXR antagonist GSK2033 and 25-hydroxycholesterol plus cholesterol, respectively. Treatment of NSC<sup>WT</sup> cells with activators or inhibitors of Srebp-1 processing gave the expected outcomes, indicating that Srebp-1 in NSC<sup>WT</sup> cells exhibited canonical regulation. LPC-DHA treatment was effective in significantly reducing both nuclear and precursor Srebp-1 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), indicating that LPC-DHA acts at the level of Srebp-1 processing. However, because Srebp-1 regulates its own gene expression, we cannot be certain that the proximal effect of LPC-DHA is solely on Srebp-1 processing. In contrast, while positive and negative activators of Srebp-2 processing resulted in expected outcomes on Srebp-2 processing, LPC-DHA did not detectably reduce nuclear Srebp-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s012">S10B Fig</xref>). Whether this finding indicates a novel mechanism whereby LPC-DHA regulates Srebp-2 transcriptional activity remains to be determined. Nonetheless, to determine if inhibition of Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 activity by LPC-DHA reduces fatty acid and sterol synthesis in NSCs, an in vitro [<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate lipogenesis assay was carried out. NSC<sup>WT</sup> cells were treated with either 10 μM or 50 μM of LPC-DHA for 16 hours before supplementing the media with [<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate for 2 hours. Sterols and fatty acid fractionations were purified and radioactivity was quantified. Indeed, 50 μM LPC-DHA reduced the synthesis of cholesterol by 25% and fatty acids by 55% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g005">Fig 5G</xref>), consistent with reduced Srebp activity and target gene expression.</p>

A combination of T0901317, 25-hydroxycholesterol plus cholesterol treatment, which increases LXR and Srebp-1 activity but decreases Srebp-2 processing, mildly reduced Mfsd2a expression, similar to that of GSK2033 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g005">Fig 5H</xref>).

<title>LPC-DHA affects membrane phospholipid saturation</title>
<p>Given our findings that LPC-DHA negatively regulates Srebp activity in an Mfsd2a-dependent fashion, we addressed whether these effects translated into significant changes in membrane lipid composition. To test this concept, NSC<sup>WT</sup> and NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells were treated with LPC-DHA for 16 hours followed by targeted lipidomic analysis. As anticipated, NSC<sup>WT</sup> cells were significantly enriched in DHA-containing PC, PE, and PS relative to NSC<sup>KO</sup> cells, consistent with transporter-mediated uptake of LPC-DHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, heatmaps illustrating percentage of individual PC, PE, and PS phospholipid species shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006443.s013">S11 Fig</xref>).

(D) Model for physiological role of LPC-DHA in regulating membrane phospholipid homeostasis and brain growth. In the developing brain, de novo lipogenesis mediated by Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 and accretion of DHA in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC-DHA) uptake at the BBB by Mfsd2a are essential for brain development. LPCs are synthesized by the liver and circulate in blood bound to albumin. In the left panel, Mfsd2a is present at the BBB to transport LPC-DHA from blood into brain, resulting in enrichment of DHA in phospholipid pools during pre- and postnatal brain development. Phospholipid DHA pools attenuate Srebp activity, leading to decreased lipogenesis. Moreover, Mfsd2a itself is regulated by Srebp, forming a negative feedback loop to balance de novo lipogenesis with exogenous uptake of LPC-DHA, with the result of maintaining homeostasis of membrane phospholipid composition. Conversely, in the right panel, Mfsd2a deficiency at the BBB, consistent with the lack of LPC-DHA transport across the BBB into brain, LPC-DHA accumulates in plasma and postnatal brain growth and phospholipid DHA pools are reduced, resulting in microcephaly. Consequential to reduced levels of phospholipid DHA pools prior to the onset of microcephaly, Srebp activity is enhanced, leading to a compensatory increase in lipogenesis.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DHA, an essential and abundant lipid in brain thought to be critical for normal brain development, is transported into brain as LPC by Mfsd2a. However, biochemical functions of DHA in brain that make it essential are not well understood. In the current study, we have addressed several fundamental questions pertaining to the role of LPC-DHA and Mfsd2a in brain growth and determined a critical role for DHA in regulating membrane lipid composition through regulation of lipogenic pathways. Our findings support the following 2 major conclusions: (1) Mfsd2a expression is required at the BBB for normal postnatal brain growth and Mfsd2a deficiency activates Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 target gene expression; (2) LPC-DHA transported by Mfsd2a represses Srebp activity, leading to reduced de novo lipogenesis and synthesis of PUFAs. These combined findings indicate that Mfsd2a–mediated transport of LPC-DHA has profound effects on membrane phospholipid composition during brain development, in part through its regulation of the Srebp pathway.</p>
<p>Most genetic forms of microcephaly are categorized as primary microcephaly disorders, which result from defects in cellular proliferation and differentiation during prenatal brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref030">30</xref>], while postnatal forms of microcephaly manifest as defects in neuron arborization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref046">46</xref>]. Using an inducible endothelial-specific Mfsd2a deletion mouse model, we have definitively proven that Mfsd2a deficiency results in a unique form of microcephaly manifesting as postnatal microcephaly. Similar to other genetic causes of postnatal microcephaly, such as Angelman Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and Christianson Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref046">46</xref>], postnatal neurons of Mfsd2a deficiency mouse models fail to fully arborize, a process that relies on lipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref048">48</xref>]. Importantly, similar to our findings in mice, humans with loss-of-function mutations in Mfsd2a are born with head circumferences in the normal or slightly reduced range, and develop severe microcephaly within the first year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref027">27</xref>]. It has been reported that 2aKO mice have increased BBB permeability through the process of transcytosis, which is normally absent in the endothelium of the BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref049">49</xref>], raising the possibility that a leaky BBB might be causative for microcephaly and DHA deficiency in this model. However, it has been reported that BBB permeability, but not microcephaly or DHA deficiency, can be completely rescued in 2aKO mice by genetic deficiency of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Moreover, mice with a homozygous mutation of the sodium-binding residue Aspartate-96 to Alanine-96 in Mfsd2a, a mutation that completely inactivates lipid transport function but does not affect expression, also presented with microcephaly and DHA deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref025">25</xref>]. These findings indicate that microcephaly and DHA deficiency are primary phenotypes of Mfsd2a deficiency and not a result of a leaky BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref025">25</xref>], and LPC transport activity is required for DHA accretion and brain growth.</p>
<p>Our findings revealed that DHA deficiency and activation of the Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 pathways are present prenatally before the onset of microcephaly. This is the first evidence of regulation of Srebp-1 and -2 in brain in response to changing DHA levels. What would be the biochemical function of regulating Srebp activity in response to the uptake of LPC-DHA and accretion of DHA into phospholipid pools during the rapid stages of brain growth? A likely explanation based on our findings points to issues of not only membrane biogenesis but membrane composition, in which a tight homeostatic balance might be predicted to be achieved between cholesterol and phospholipid-containing PUFA, with each having opposite effects on membrane fluidity and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref050">50</xref>]. Because LPC-DHA uptake and thus membrane phospholipid levels of DHA might be regulated by a homeostatic mechanism similar to regulation of cholesterol synthesis and turnover in the brain, the effects that we report here for LPC-DHA on membrane composition might be most relevant to the growing brain, or in aging or neurological disease in which brain DHA levels decline and Srebp lipogenic target genes have been reported to be elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>It is understood that the PUFAs AA and DHA down-regulate Srebp-1, but not Srebp-2, processing and activation of target gene expression in both immortalized cell lines in culture and in mouse liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref061">61</xref>]. The characterized biochemical mechanisms for PUFA effects on inhibiting Srebp-1 processing involve both direct effects on the ER-associated degradation machinery mediating the degradation of Insig-1, and inhibition of LXR activity that regulates Srebp-1 expression and processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref062">62</xref>]. There is recent evidence that oxysterols generated from products of the Srebp-2 pathway and acting through LXR are required to maintain Srebp-1 expression in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref064">64</xref>]. An intriguing aspect of our findings is that Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 target genes were reduced on a similar timescale following LPC-DHA treatment in NSCs, but without detectable reductions in the nuclear form of Srebp-2. These data might imply the existence of a mechanism that links Srebp-1 with Srebp-2 activity to regulate cholesterol biosynthesis and membrane phospholipid saturation. In support of this idea, intestinal deletion of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), an important acyltransferase that generates polyunsaturated phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref065">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref067">67</xref>], in mice resulted in elevated Srebp-2 activity and cholesterol synthesis, indicating that membrane phospholipid saturation can regulate membrane cholesterol biosynthesis via Srebp-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006443.ref068">68</xref>].</p>
<p>Our combined findings are particularly relevant to the period in fetal and postnatal brain development involving a rapid and extensive acquisition of DHA and membrane lipid. We propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006443.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) in which LPC-DHA transported via Mfsd2a at the BBB regulates the level of Srebp-1 and Srebp-2 activity, thereby balancing the need for de novo synthesis of membrane PUFA with exogenous PUFA uptake and impacting dynamic changes in membrane saturation and fluidity. Moreover, Mfsd2a is regulated by Srebp and constitutes a previously unknown negative feedback loop to modulate de novo lipogenesis.</p>
