<p>Real-time monitoring of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in native cells suggests that the receptor for thyroid stimulating hormone remains active after internalization, challenging the current model for GPCR signaling.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are generally thought to signal to second messengers like cyclic AMP (cAMP) from the cell surface and to become internalized upon repeated or prolonged stimulation. Once internalized, they are supposed to stop signaling to second messengers but may trigger nonclassical signals such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Here, we show that a GPCR continues to stimulate cAMP production in a sustained manner after internalization. We generated transgenic mice with ubiquitous expression of a fluorescent sensor for cAMP and studied cAMP responses to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in native, 3-D thyroid follicles isolated from these mice. TSH stimulation caused internalization of the TSH receptors into a pre-Golgi compartment in close association with G-protein α<sub>s</sub>-subunits and adenylyl cyclase III. Receptors internalized together with TSH and produced downstream cellular responses that were distinct from those triggered by cell surface receptors. These data suggest that classical paradigms of GPCR signaling may need revision, as they indicate that cAMP signaling by GPCRs may occur both at the cell surface and from intracellular sites, but with different consequences for the cell.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cells respond to many environmental cues through the activity of cell surface receptor proteins, which sense these cues and convey that information to signaling molecules inside the cell. G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the largest eukaryotic family of plasma membrane receptors. They convert the information provided by extracellular stimuli into intracellular second messengers, like cyclic AMP (cAMP). After prolonged stimulation, they are internalized inside cells, an event that to date has been thought to terminate the production of second messengers. Though many of the key steps of GPCR signaling are known in detail, precisely how signaling and termination actually occur in time and space (i.e., in subcellular compartments or microdomains) is still largely unexplored. To observe GPCR signaling in living cells, we generated mice expressing a fluorescent sensor that allows monitoring the intracellular levels of cAMP with a microscope. We utilized this system to study, directly in native thyroid follicles, the signal sent by the receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Our findings indicate that TSH receptors are internalized rapidly after activation but continue to stimulate cAMP production inside cells and that this sustained, cAMP production is apparently required for localized activation of downstream components. These data challenge the current model of the GPCR-cAMP pathway by suggesting the existence of previously unrecognized intracellular site(s) for cAMP generation and of differential signaling outcomes as a result of intracellular GPCR signaling. Such intracellular site(s) may provide specialized signaling platforms, thus contributing to the spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP production and to signaling specificity within the GPCR family.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>G-protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is thought to involve a series of steps occurring at the cell surface: coupling of receptors to G-proteins, activation of G-proteins, and ultimately, triggering of G-protein-regulated effectors (i.e., adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, calcium channels, GIRK channels, etc.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Pierce1">[1]</xref>. Soon after activation, many GPCRs desensitize in a process that involves phosphorylation by G-protein–coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and binding of β-arrestins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Pierce1">[1]</xref>. Subsequently, most GPCRs are internalized via clathrin-coated pits or other less characterized pathways, and are either dephosphorylated and recycled back to the cell surface or targeted to lysosomes for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Pierce1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although receptor internalization was originally considered to contribute to desensitization by reducing the number of receptors present on the cell plasma membrane, endocytosis has been subsequently and unexpectedly found to promote or even be required for receptor resensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Pierce1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Pippig1">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, novel data suggest that receptor internalization does not always lead to signal termination. This possibility has been clearly demonstrated for tyrosine kinase receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), that were shown to continue signaling after being internalized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Sorkin1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-vonZastrow1">[6]</xref>. In the case of GPCRs, instead, internalized receptors are thought capable of switching to a “nonconventional” signaling pathway, i.e., a β-arrestin-mediated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lefkowitz1">[7]</xref>. A very recent study has revealed yet another type of intracellular GPCR signaling in yeast: Gpa1, the yeast homolog of Gα can be activated by pheromone receptors on endosomes, where it stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Slessareva1">[8]</xref>. Despite such recent data, there is a current consensus that activation of canonical G-protein effectors, such as adenylyl cyclase, by GPCRs occurs exclusively at the cell surface.</p>
<p>Describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling cascades is a major goal of cell biology. In the case of GPCR signaling, this would imply answering fundamental questions such as: Where in the cell and for how long are GPCRs active after interacting with their ligands? Are there subcellular microdomains specialized for different types of GPCR-mediated signals? What are the functional consequences of GPCR internalization on signaling? Does signaling to cyclic AMP (cAMP) or other second messengers occur only at the plasma membrane, or are there additional sites of GPCR activity inside the cell? Most of these questions are still awaiting answers. The major reason for this relies on the fact that biochemical techniques, until recently the only ones available for such analyses, require cell disruption and therefore have limited temporal and, generally, no spatial resolution. To tackle those limitations, we and others have developed a series of genetically encoded fluorescent reporters that allow the direct visualization of key steps of GPCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Janetopoulos1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lohse1">[11]</xref> and cyclic nucleotide signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Zaccolo1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev2">[19]</xref>, by means of microscopy techniques based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The introduction of these techniques has led to new insights into the mechanisms of GPCR activation and the biology of cAMP.</p>
<p>Despite the important advance represented by the introduction of FRET-based techniques, most studies required transfection of genetically encoded fluorescent reporters into primary cells or cell lines—thus, quite far from the physiological context. This is a fundamental issue, as the type, location, and concentration of each component, as well as the size and shape of cells, are expected to greatly influence the spatiotemporal features of signaling networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Kholodenko1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Kholodenko2">[22]</xref>. To be able to study GPCR-cAMP signaling in a highly physiological context, here we generated reporter mice with ubiquitous expression of an inert fluorescent sensor for cAMP. These mice were utilized to study the dynamics of a GPCR-cAMP signaling cascade, i.e., that activated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), within the intact multicellular functional unit that constitutes thyroid tissue.</p>

<title>Generation of Transgenic Mice with Ubiquitous Expression of a cAMP Sensor</title>
<p>To monitor cAMP levels in living cells and tissues, we generated transgenic mice (CAG-Epac1-camps) with ubiquitous expression of our previously described cAMP sensor (Epac1-camps) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev1">[14]</xref>. We followed the same strategy used to create green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Okabe1">[23]</xref>. Instead of GFP, we cloned the Epac1-camps sequence (encompassing the yellow fluorescent protein [YFP], the cAMP binding domain of Epac1, and the cyan fluorescent protein [CFP]) under the control of the hybrid CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and performed pronuclear injections of one-cell–stage mouse embryos with this construct. After several rounds of injections, we obtained ten PCR-positive pups, three of which showed a high level of body fluorescence and gave rise to transgenic offspring according to the Mendelian ratio. Careful analysis of isolated cells and tissues from these three lines demonstrated that two of them had a heterogeneous expression of the sensor, which was present in only 60%–80% of the cells. By contrast, the third line expressed Epac1-camps in virtually all cells and was therefore chosen for subsequent experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g001">Figure 1</xref> reproduces fluorescent images of the head and a series of organs isolated from the transgenic mice. Compared to wild-type littermates, these mice had high levels of sensor expression in almost all tissues and cells, excluding erythrocytes and hair. For example, we found high fluorescence in the eye and the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), as well as in the brain, heart, kidney, and ileum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, transgenic mice did not show any abnormalities and had a normal life expectancy, demonstrating that the presence of the sensor in most cells of the organism did not interfere with its proper development and physiological functions.</p>

<title>Real-Time cAMP Measurements</title>
<p>Next, we isolated several types of embryonic and adult primary cells from CAG-Epac1-camps mice to measure cAMP levels in real time. cAMP levels were monitored by FRET microscopy on live cells as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev1">[14]</xref>. From E14.5 embryos, we obtained murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and cortical neurons, which showed high fluorescence. Stimulation of MEFs with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol resulted in a robust decrease of the YFP/CFP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), indicative of an increase of cAMP levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev1">[14]</xref>. As already reported in other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Mongillo1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Terrin1">[25]</xref>, this response was transient, due to the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent activation of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which could be counteracted by addition of a specific inhibitor (rolipram). In cortical neurons, isoproterenol induced a similar type of reaction, though of smaller amplitude. Like in MEFs, the response was transient and could be enhanced by addition of rolipram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). From adult mice, we isolated cardiac myocytes and peritoneal macrophages. In line with our previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev3">[26]</xref>, β-adrenergic stimulation of cardiac cells led to an increase of cAMP levels, which was further enhanced by rolipram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The cAMP response to isoproterenol in macrophages was more sustained and only minimally affected by rolipram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Finally, the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol completely inhibited the effect of isoproterenol on cAMP production in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), thus showing that the observed FRET variations were specific.</p>

<title>Establishment of a 3-D Culture of Thyroid Follicles</title>
<p>Then, we utilized CAG-Epac1-camps mice to monitor GPCR-cAMP signaling in an intact physiological system. We chose thyroid cells for several reasons. First, these cells are strictly dependent for all their functions, e.g., thyroid hormone production and growth, on the activation of a GPCR, the TSH receptor, which is expressed on their basolateral membrane and the effects of which are largely mediated by cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Vassart1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Calebiro1">[28]</xref>. Second, thyroid cells form supracellular structures, known as thyroid follicles, which constitute both the anatomical and the functional units of thyroid tissue. Importantly, it is possible to isolate and culture thyroid follicles so to maintain their original 3-D structure and polarization, which is reflected by a high spatial organization of the TSH receptor-cAMP signaling cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Vassart1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Toda1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Kusakabe1">[30]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, they represent a unique model to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of GPCR-cAMP signaling. For this purpose, we established a method that allowed us to isolate, maintain, visualize, and manipulate mouse thyroid follicles under the microscope. Among various protocols, the best results were obtained by enzymatic dissociation followed by deposition on a thin layer of collagen gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This protocol preserved good 3-D morphology for at least 24–48 h of culture, without hampering microscopic observation or manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s017">Video S1</xref>).</p>

<title>The thyroid follicle model.</title>
<p>(A) Thyroid follicles constitute the anatomical and functional units of thyroid tissue. They are composed of a monolayer of epithelial cells that defines an inner cavity where thyroid hormones are stored in the form of an iodinated protein (thyroglobulin). Upon binding of TSH to its receptor located on the basolateral membrane, cAMP is produced with consequent activation of PKA and phosphorylation of a series of targets, located in different cellular compartments (e.g., cytosol, nucleus, Golgi complex, apical membrane). These events lead to a fast induction of thyroglobulin reuptake with release of free thyroid hormones into the blood stream and a slow up-regulation of thyroglobulin synthesis and iodination. Thyroid cells are highly polarized, as the basolateral and apical membranes have completely different compositions and extremely specialized functions. (B) Method used to culture thyroid follicles. Isolated mouse thyroid follicles were placed in a glass-bottom Petri dish, coated with a thin layer of collagen gel. Shown are representative images of a single follicle isolated from CAG-Epac1-camps mice after 12 h of culture. Top right, bright field image. Bottom left, maximum projection of YFP fluorescence (corresponding to the Epac1-camps sensor) calculated from individual image slices on the <italic>z</italic>-axis, captured with a laser-scanning confocal microscope.

<title>Real-Time Monitoring of cAMP Levels in Intact Thyroid Follicles</title>
<p>Next, we utilized thyroid follicles isolated from CAG-Epac1-camps mice to monitor in real time the cAMP response to TSH stimulation. Saturating concentrations of TSH resulted in a fast and robust decrease of the YFP/CFP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s018">Video S2</xref>), indicative of an increase of cAMP levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev1">[14]</xref>. Nevertheless, the Epac1-camps sensor was not saturated, as shown by the further decrease of FRET values obtained by fully activating adenylyl cyclase with forskolin. In contrast to what was observed in other cell types, like for example, embryonic fibroblasts and cortical neurons (for comparison see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), no reduction of cAMP levels was seen after prolonged exposure to various concentrations of TSH (up to 30 min), consistent with limited or no PDE activation under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This type of sustained cAMP response further drove our attention to TSH receptor signaling in thyroid cells.</p>

<p>To rule out the possibility that the presence of the Epac1-camps sensor might interfere with cAMP signaling, we compared the cAMP-response to TSH stimulation in thyroid cells isolated from wild-type and CAG-Epac1-camps mice. The intracellular levels of cAMP, measured by an immunoenzymatic assay, were indistinguishable between wild-type and transgenic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Temporal Dynamics of cAMP Signaling in Thyroid Follicles</title>
<p>Importantly, the lack of appreciable desensitization of the TSH receptor-cAMP signal allowed us to evaluate the kinetics of the return of cAMP to baseline after transient stimulation with TSH. To ensure controlled and fast stimulation, thyroid follicles were kept under laminar-flow perfusion with an apparatus that allowed the rapid exchange between different extracellular solutions. First, we applied very short (10 s) and repeated stimuli with TSH (30 U/l), which were followed by a complete return of cAMP to basal values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Then, we stimulated thyroid follicles with saturating (30 U/l) or supra-saturating (300 U/l) concentrations of TSH for 30 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), or 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Note that 300 U/l were required to reach maximum activation within 30 s, whereas 30 U/l were sufficient for 2-min and 10-min applications. Stimulation with these fully activating concentrations of TSH produced comparable changes of cAMP levels, independently of the duration of the application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Unexpectedly, stimuli of duration equal or longer than 30 s were associated with an incomplete return of cAMP to basal levels even after extensive washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g005">Figure 5B–5D</xref>). Interestingly, the extent of signal irreversibility increased with the duration of the TSH application, but was not dependent on the cumulative dose of TSH (for example, compare the effect of 300 U/l for 30 s to that of 30 U/l for 2 min), occurred already after 30 s, and was nearly maximal after 10-min stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g005">Figure 5F and 5G</xref>). In contrast to TSH receptor activation, stimuli of comparable intensity and duration with a forskolin analog, which directly activates adenylyl cyclase, yielded completely reversible cAMP signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<p>In theory, the incomplete restoration of cAMP levels observed after prolonged TSH stimulation might have been due to an inactivation of PDEs. To investigate this possibility, we added a nonselective PDE inhibitor (IBMX) at the end of the washout phase. In contrast to control follicles that were not previously stimulated with TSH, on which IBMX had only a marginal effect, IBMX treatment caused a robust increase in cAMP levels when applied after TSH stimulation for 10 min and subsequent washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These results demonstrated that, after extensive washout from a prolonged TSH stimulus, PDEs were still highly functional. Thus, it is unlikely that an inactivation of PDEs was the cause of the incomplete recovery of cAMP levels. On the contrary, the fast and robust increase of cAMP levels after IBMX addition suggested that the receptor-adenylyl cyclase system was indeed continuing to signal.</p>

<title>TSH Receptor Internalization</title>
<p>The extent and kinetics of endogenous TSH receptor internalization in primary thyroid cells have been difficult to evaluate due to its very low expression levels. However, the available information suggests that the TSH receptor is internalized and recycled back to the plasma membrane, without being targeted to lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-BarattiElbaz1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lahuna1">[32]</xref>. To monitor the internalization of the endogenous TSH receptor, we utilized the well-established method of following the endocytosis of a fluorescent ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Sorkin1">[3]</xref>. For this purpose, we labeled bovine TSH with a fluorescent dye (Alexafluor594), which resulted in no major alterations of its biological activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s003">Figure S3A</xref>); in addition, TSH-Alexa594 bound specifically to HEK293 cells transfected with TSH receptor cDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Initially, to simultaneously monitor TSH and TSH receptor internalization, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with a YFP-tagged TSH receptor construct and β-arrestin 2, which in this context is required for efficient TSH receptor internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Frenzel1">[33]</xref>, and stimulated them with TSH-Alexa594 for different periods of time. Both ligand and receptor were found to cointernalize rapidly, reaching a maximum after approximately 20 min (unpublished data). Interestingly, 40 min after stimulation, the ligand and the receptor still appeared to be present in the same intracellular compartments, suggesting that they were not sorted apart during this period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000172.g007" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Then, we utilized the fluorescent ligand to follow TSH receptor internalization in primary thyroid cells. When we attempted to visualize whole thyroid follicles loaded with TSH-Alexa594, we found them to have a relatively high autofluorescence in the whole visible spectrum. Thus, visualization of TSH-Alexa594 was largely hampered, and possible only to a limited extent through spectral unmixing. The resulting images, though of poor quality, were suggestive of TSH-Alexa594 being efficiently internalized in thyroid follicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s004">Figure S4</xref>). To better evaluate this phenomenon, we analyzed the binding and internalization of TSH-Alexa594 in single primary mouse thyroid cells, which showed much lower autofluorescence. Interestingly, we found that TSH internalized quickly, with TSH-Alexa594–positive vesicles being detectable 5 min after TSH stimulation and maximal internalization reached approximately after 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Importantly, at this point, a major fraction of labeled TSH was found inside the cells, in vesicles prevalently concentrated around the nucleus. To further investigate the structure and the dynamics of TSH-containing vesicles, we performed a series of time-lapse experiments on cells stimulated with TSH-Alexa594 that were visualized with a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope set to have a high penetration depth. This approach allows us to visualize cytoplasmic structures close to the plasma membrane with a high signal/background ratio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Tokunaga1">[34]</xref> and appeared particularly suited for thyroid cells that assume a very thin shape in culture, having a maximal thickness of approximately 1–2 µm only (unpublished data). Interestingly, we found that TSH-Alexa594 was contained in tubulovesicular organelles, forming a highly dynamic and interconnected network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g009">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s019">Video S3</xref>), the structure of which could be appreciated only partially by confocal microscopy.</p>

<title>Subcellular Localization of G-Proteins and Adenylyl Cyclases</title>
<p>So far, our results suggested that the TSH receptor internalized quickly without evidence of cAMP desensitization and that, after prolonged stimulation, a significant proportion of the TSH receptor-cAMP signal became irreversible. Of note, both phenomena, i.e., receptor internalization and signal irreversibility, had roughly similar kinetics. We therefore hypothesized that, over time, a fraction of the receptors was brought to a state or a compartment where they could no longer be freed of their ligands, but were still able to signal. Trimeric G-proteins are frequently found at non-plasma membrane compartments, such as endosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi, where they are thought to play roles in vesicle trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Slessareva1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Helms1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Sato2">[36]</xref>. Similarly, adenylyl cyclase activity and immunoreactivity have been found on intracellular membranes, though such studies were frequently limited by the very low expression of adenylyl cyclases and the relatively low affinity of the available antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Mons1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Head1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, it appeared possible that the other components required for TSH receptor signaling might also be present inside the cell. Based on these considerations, we attempted to localize Gα<sub>s</sub> as well as adenylyl cyclase III, V, and VI, the major isoforms expressed in thyroid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Vanvooren1">[39]</xref>, by immunofluorescence. Our results indicated that Gα<sub>s</sub> was present on intracellular vesicles and tubulovesicular structures that were typically concentrated around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s005">Figures S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g010">10</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g011">11A and 11B</xref>). Adenylyl cyclase staining was of much lower intensity. Nonetheless, adenylyl cyclase immunoreactivity was found occasionally on the plasma membrane and largely on intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s005">Figures S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g011">11C</xref>). TSH stimulation did not cause apparent modifications of Gα<sub>s</sub> or adenylyl cyclase subcellular localization (unpublished data). The specificity of Gα<sub>s</sub>, adenylyl cyclase III, and adenylyl cyclase V/VI staining was checked by competition with the peptides used to raise the primary antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s006">Figure S6</xref>). In addition, the specificity of Gα<sub>s</sub> immunofluorescence was evaluated by comparing its subcellular pattern to the localization of YFP-tagged Gα<sub>s</sub> transfected in HEK293 cells (unpublished data).</p>

<p>To identify the structures that were positive for Gα<sub>s</sub>, we performed a series of colocalization experiments with markers of intracellular compartments. First, we used a fluorescent transferrin conjugate to label early endosomes and the recycling endosomal compartment. This is a frequently used method that takes advantage of the endocytosis and recycling of transferrin together with its receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Ghosh1">[40]</xref>. To this end, primary mouse thyroid cells were stimulated with fluorescent transferrin for various periods of time (2–60 min), followed by fixation and immunofluorescent staining of Gα<sub>s</sub>. Early time points (2–5 min) were used to visualize early endosomes, whereas later time points were employed to identify recycling endosomes. Gα<sub>s</sub> and transferrin were not found simultaneously on early endosomes (unpublished data). However, at later time points (20–60 min) transferrin appeared to be contained in vesicles, presumably a recycling compartment, associated with the perinuclear tubulovesicular structure positive for Gα<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). Of note, some of these vesicles were also positive for Gα<sub>s</sub>. In addition, primary mouse thyroid cells were simultaneously treated with fluorescent transferrin and TSH to evaluate whether they followed similar or distinct endocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g010">Figure 10B</xref> and unpublished data). A partial colocalization between internalized TSH and transferrin was observed at all time points considered (2–60 min)—notice that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g010">Figure 10B</xref>, several TSH-positive vesicles contain also transferrin—suggesting that they followed to some extent the same trafficking pathway. An antibody against Rab7 was used to label late endosomes. No colocalization was observed between Gα<sub>s</sub> and Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g010">Figure 10C</xref>). Finally, an antibody against a Golgi-resident protein, Golgi 58K, was used to mark the Golgi compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Gao1">[41]</xref>. A high degree of colocalization was present between Gα<sub>s</sub> and Golgi 58K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g010">Figure 10D</xref>), suggesting that a relevant fraction of Gα<sub>s</sub> was located on membranes of the Golgi complex.</p>
<p>Next, we treated primary thyroid cells with TSH-Alexa594, as a marker of TSH receptor, and looked at its colocalization with Gα<sub>s</sub> and adenylyl cyclases. Interestingly, internalized TSH and Gα<sub>s</sub> were frequently found in close association, with TSH being present on vesicles adjacent to the Gα<sub>s</sub>-positive tubulovesicular structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g011">Figure 11A and 11B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s020">Video S4</xref>). As observed in the case of transferrin, some of these vesicles were also positive for Gα<sub>s</sub>. TSH and adenylyl cyclase III were found to colocalize occasionally on the plasma membrane and more frequently on intracellular vesicles or tubulovesicular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g011">Figure 11C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s021">Video S5</xref>). Little colocalization was observed between internalized TSH and adenylyl cyclase V/VI (unpublished data).</p>
<p>To further investigate the subcellular localization of adenylyl cyclases, we labeled them with BODIPY-forskolin, a fluorescent forskolin analog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Liu1">[42]</xref>. The specificity of BODIPY-forskolin staining was initially evaluated in HEK293 cells transfected with adenylyl cyclase VI cDNA, which showed a stronger labeling compared to control mock-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g012">Figure 12A</xref>). Then, we utilized BODIPY-forskolin to stain primary thyroid cells that were visualized with a TIRF microscope as described above. BODIPY-forskolin staining was largely present on intracellular vesicles and tubulovesicular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g012">Figure 12B</xref>). Utilizing this approach, we could also visualize simultaneously the internalized TSH-Alexa594 and BODIPY-forskolin in cells that were stimulated with the fluorescent ligand. A consistent colocalization was observed at the level of several intracellular vesicles and tubulovesicular structures, in agreement with the previous immunofluorescence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g012">Figure 12C</xref>). The dynamic nature of these intracellular structures can be appreciated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s022">Video S6</xref>. Finally, we utilized the fluorescent forskolin analog to perform triple stainings in which we attempted to simultaneously visualize the internalized TSH-Alexa594, Gα<sub>s</sub> (by immunofluorescence), and adenylyl cyclases. The resulting images were indicative of the three components being simultaneously present on vesicles that were often adjacent to the perinuclear tubulovesicular structure positive for Gα<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g012">Figure 12D</xref>). Of note, the latter structure was also labeled by BODIPY-forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g012">Figure 12D</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we utilized immunogold electron microscopy to evaluate the subcellular localization of the internalized TSH, Gα<sub>s</sub>, and adenylyl cyclase III at the ultrastructural level.

To visualize the internalized TSH, we labeled it with Alexafluor488, which was recognized by a specific antibody. Similarly to TSH-Alexa594, TSH-Alexa488 had a conserved biological activity (unpublished data). Consistent with the previous immunofluorescence results, both TSH-Alexa488 and adenylyl cyclase III were found to be present in endosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of Receptor Internalization on cAMP Signaling</title>
<p>Although our data were so far compatible with TSH receptor signaling from intracellular sites, direct functional evidence was still missing. We therefore reasoned that if our hypothesis was correct, treatments capable of inhibiting TSH receptor endocytosis should hamper TSH receptor sequestration and, as a result, increase the reversibility of cAMP signals after TSH washout. We first tried several treatments that have been reported to inhibit GPCR internalization, such as concanavalin A, phenylarsine oxide and hypertonic sucrose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lefkowitz1">[7]</xref>. Concanavalin A and phenylarsine oxide were found to partially inhibit forskolin-dependent cAMP production and, therefore, were not further evaluated (unpublished data). By contrast, pretreatment with 0.43 M sucrose for 10 min did not hamper TSH-dependent cAMP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g013">Figure 13A</xref>), whereas it almost completely inhibited TSH-Alexa594 internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g013">Figure 13B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s023">Video S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s024">Video S8</xref>). Importantly, pretreatment of thyroid follicles with hypertonic sucrose was associated with a complete reversibility of the cAMP signal produced by TSH stimulation for 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g013">Figure 13C</xref>). The mechanism of action of hypertonic sucrose is not completely understood, though this treatment is known to alter the polymerization of clathrin, thus hampering the formation of coated pits at a very initial phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lefkowitz1">[7]</xref>. Another frequently used method to inhibit GPCR internalization is to interfere with dynamin function. Dynamin is in fact required for later phases of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, such as pinching and release of completed coated pits from the plasma membrane. Recently, Macia et al. developed a membrane permeable dynamin inhibitor, dynasore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Macia1">[43]</xref>, which could be applied directly to intact thyroid follicles. We therefore repeated the same experiments in the presence of dynasore, which had a consistent inhibitory effect on TSH internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g013">Figure 13D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s025">Video S9</xref>). Analogously to what was observed with hypertonic sucrose, pretreatment for 20 min with 80 µM dynasore, a concentration that produced a maximal effect on TSH internalization, resulted in a major increase of cAMP signal reversibility after TSH washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g013">Figure 13E</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that TSH receptor internalization was responsible for the observed irreversibility of cAMP signaling.</p>

<title>Effect of pH on TSH Receptor-cAMP Signaling</title>
<p>A possible concern when considering the occurrence of TSH receptor signaling on endocytic membranes is the effect of acidic pH on TSH–TSH receptor interactions. In fact, the low pH of early (pH 5.9–6.2) and late endosomes (pH.5.0–6.0) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Faundez1">[44]</xref> is known to promote the dissociation of several receptor–ligand complexes. To evaluate the effect of acidic pH on TSH receptor signaling, we incubated primary thyroid follicles at different pH levels and evaluated the cAMP response to TSH stimulation by FRET microscopy. In agreement with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Moore1">[45]</xref>, our results suggested that efficient TSH binding and activation of the TSH receptor was still possible at pH 5.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell Fractionation Experiments</title>
<p>To further verify the hypothesis that the TSH receptor may continue to signal to Gα<sub>s</sub>/adenylyl cyclase after internalization, we conducted a series of experiments based on cell fractionation. Since in initial tests we found that these studies required a higher amount of starting material than could be obtained from primary thyroid cells, these experiments were performed on the FRTL5 thyroid cell line. FRTL5 cells are a widely used model of well-differentiated thyroid cells, which, among other features of normal thyrocytes, express thyroid-specific genes, conserve a functional TSH receptor-cAMP signaling pathway and retain the capability to synthesize thyroid hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Calebiro1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-AmbesiImpiombato1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>First, we established a method to separate the intracellular content from the plasma membrane. In order to allow a better characterization of the supposed intracellular TSH receptor signaling compartment, we looked for a method that was fast, as gentle as possible, and produced with high yield an intracellular fraction with the lowest possible contamination from the plasma membrane. The best results were obtained utilizing a protocol based on the separation of the plasma membrane with magnetic beads coated with concanavalin A, which binds selectively to the glycoproteins present on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lee1">[47]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g014">Figure 14A</xref> shows the results of a typical fractionation experiment.

<p>The plasma membrane and the intracellular fractions of FRTL5 cells were obtained by separation with concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads. (A) Western blot analysis of subcellular markers in the obtained fractions. The following markers were used: Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>ATPase for the plasma membrane, the early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) for early endosomes, and Golgi 58K for the Golgi complex. 1, total homogenate. 2, first eluate from the magnetic beads, corresponding to the plasma membrane fraction. 3, postnuclear supernatant. 4, second eluate from the magnetic beads. 5, intracellular fraction. (B) Western blot for Gα<sub>s</sub> and adenylyl cyclase III (AC III) in the same fractions as in (A). (C) Effect of TSH stimulation on adenylyl cyclase activity in the subcellular fractions. FRTL5 cells were starved for 24 h in medium without TSH and either stimulated with 30 U/l TSH for 30 min or mock stimulated (control), followed by cell fractionation with concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads. The adenylyl cyclase activity in the plasma membrane and intracellular fractions was then determined in the absence of stimuli (−) or in the presence of either 30 U/l TSH (+TSH) or 10 µM forskolin. The results were normalized for the maximal adenylyl cyclase activity measured in the presence of forskolin. Shown are the data from three independent experiments. Error bars indicate SEM.</p>

<p>Next, we evaluated by Western blot analysis the presence of Gα<sub>s</sub> and adenlyl cyclase III in the different subcellular fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g014">Figure 14B</xref>). As expected, bands corresponding to Gα<sub>s</sub> and adenylyl cyclase III were present in the total homogenate as well as in the plasma membrane fraction. In addition, the same bands were also present in the intracellular fraction, thus confirming the evidence based on the results of the immunofluorescence experiments that both Gα<sub>s</sub> and adenylyl cyclase III were present in significant amounts also in the intracellular compartment.</p>
<p>Once the fractionation method was established, we attempted to directly measure the activity of adenylyl cyclase in the plasma membrane and in the intracellular fraction of cells that were previously stimulated with TSH. The prediction was that if the TSH receptor continued to signal to Gα<sub>s</sub>/adenylyl cyclase after internalization, this should result in an increase of the adenylyl cyclase activity in the intracellular fraction. This appeared to be indeed the case, as we found that pretreatment of FRTL5 cells for 30 min with TSH was associated with an increased adenylyl cyclase activity in the intracellular fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g014">Figure 14C</xref>). By contrast, pretreatment with TSH was not associated with any modifications of the adenylyl cyclase activity in the plasma membrane fraction. This is not surprising, as TSH is expected to dissociate from the TSH receptors present on the plasma membrane during the time required for the cell fractionation. Nevertheless, a certain amount of functional receptors was left on the plasma membrane, as adenylyl cyclase activity in this fraction could be increased by adding TSH in the reaction mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g014">Figure 14C</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results further supported the hypothesis that the TSH receptor continued to signal to Gα<sub>s</sub>/adenylyl cyclase after internalization.</p>

<title>Simulations</title>
<p>To better understand the possible consequences of intracellular GPCR signaling, we generated a mathematical model of the GPCR-cAMP pathway. Our model is based on the recent work done by Neves et al. on β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Neves1">[21]</xref>. In this model, the receptor, G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase are placed on the plasma membrane, whereas ATP, cAMP, PDE4, and PKA are cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g015">Figure 15A</xref>). In addition, to mimic an intracellular signaling compartment (ICSC), we placed G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase also on an intracellular membrane and simulated the internalization of both GPCR and ligand to this compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g015">Figure 15B</xref>). Simulations were performed with the Virtual Cell software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Loew1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Slepchenko2">[50]</xref>. Initial non-spatially resolved simulations, aimed at validating the model and assessing the effects of different geometries and parameters as well as of receptor recycling, are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s016">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s009">Figures S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s011">S11</xref>. Subsequently, a system of partial differential equations was used to obtain a spatiotemporal description of the GPCR-cAMP pathway. The results of the simulations performed with this model were in good agreement with our experimental data. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g015">Figure 15C</xref> are reported the results of a spatial simulation in which a cell was given a transient stimulus, by mimicking a perfusion system that provided and subsequently removed the ligand from the extracellular space. Notice that in the absence of the ICSC, the cAMP response is fully reversible. On the contrary, in the presence of the ICSC, the signal is no longer reversible, in agreement with the results of the FRET experiments. Interestingly, the different types of cAMP gradients generated in the presence or absence of the ICSC are also reflected by different degrees and spatial patterns of PKA activation. Thus, our mathematical model predicted that GPCR signaling to cAMP from an ICSC should have important consequences also on the spatiotemporal dynamics of downstream signaling events.</p>

In a first simulation in which signaling from the ICSC was not implemented (no ICSC), the cAMP response was completely reversible.

<title>Functional Consequences of cAMP Signaling from Internalized Receptors</title>
<p>Based on the results of the mathematical simulations, we investigated whether the inhibition of TSH receptor internalization had some effects on the signaling events downstream of cAMP production. One of the earliest effects of TSH in thyroid cells is the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. This is a well-known phenomenon, mainly consisting in the depolymerization of stress fibers, that is implicated in the reuptake of thyroglobulin and in the induction of thyroid-specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Roger1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Fortemaison1">[53]</xref>. Therefore, we evaluated whether blocking receptor internalization might affect the depolymerization of actin in response to TSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figure 16A and 16B</xref>). Primary mouse thyroid cells were stimulated with TSH in the presence or absence of endocytosis inhibitors, as described above, then fixed and stained for actin with fluorescent phalloidin. Hypertonic sucrose itself was found to induce a modification of actin architecture, and was not further evaluated (unpublished data). Instead, dynasore treatment did not cause any appreciable modifications of cellular shape or actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figure 16A</xref>). As expected, TSH alone caused a generalized depolymerization of actin, which was observed both in the central cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figure 16A</xref>) and in lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figure 16B</xref>). By contrast, in the presence of dynasore, TSH induced only a partial depolymerization in the central cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figure 16A</xref>) and failed to induce depolymerization in lamellipodia, which showed an even thicker actin mesh compared to that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figure 16B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A and B) Actin depolymerization in response to TSH. Mouse primary thyroid cells were preincubated with normal medium or medium plus 80 µM dynasore for 20 min and stimulated with 30 U/l TSH for an additional 20 min in the presence or absence of dynasore as indicated. Cells were then fixed, and actin was stained with fluorescent phalloidin. Note that dynasore largely prevented the depolymerization of actin in response to TSH. (B) High-magnification images of actin rearrangement in lamellipodia, where the effect of dynasore was more pronounced. (C) VASP phosphorylation. Primary mouse thyroid cells were preincubated with normal medium or medium plus 80 µM dynasore for 20 min. Cells were then stimulated with 1 U/l TSH for 30 min, in the presence or absence of dynasore as indicated. Levels of P-VASP (Ser 157) and total VASP were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Shown are the mean P-VASP levels of three independent experiments. Error bars indicate SEM. (D) Subcellular localization of VASP.

Mouse primary thyroid cells were preincubated and stimulated with TSH in the presence or absence of dynasore as explained above. Cells were then labeled by immunofluorescence with an antibody against VASP phosphorylated at Ser 157 (red) together with fluorescent phalloidin to stain actin (green).

(F) Actin depolymerization and pattern of VASP phosphorylation in response to forskolin. Cells were treated as in (E), with the exception that instead of TSH, they were stimulated with 10 µM forskolin.

Images in (A and B) and (D–F) are representative of at least three independent experiments.</p>

<p>The PKA-substrate vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a key effector of cAMP in the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lebrand1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Trichet1">[55]</xref>. VASP is concentrated at actin hot spots (lamellipodia, filopodia, cell–substrate, and cell–cell contacts) where it regulates the polymerization and branching of actin filaments. Importantly, its function is regulated by PKA via phosphorylation at Ser 157 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lebrand1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Trichet1">[55]</xref>. We therefore investigated whether VASP was phosphorylated in response to TSH stimulation in thyroid cells and the possible consequences of TSH receptor internalization on this pathway. VASP phosphorylation was evaluated by Western blot analysis, both by monitoring the intensity of the slower migrating band detected by a VASP antibody and by utilizing an antibody specific for VASP phosphorylated at Ser 157. In the absence of endocytosis inhibitors, TSH caused a 2-fold induction of VASP phosphorylation. However, pretreatment with endocytosis inhibitors caused a substantial reduction of VASP phosphorylation in response to TSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figures 16C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000172.s012">S12</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm the possible involvement of VASP in the control of actin polymerization in thyroid cells, we examined its subcellular localization by immunofluorescence. As observed in other cells in which VASP regulates actin polymerization, VASP was concentrated at the ends of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figure 16D</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we evaluated whether blocking TSH receptor internalization also altered the spatial pattern of VASP phosphorylation by PKA. To this end, we stimulated thyroid cells with TSH alone or in the presence of dynasore, and visualized VASP phosphorylated at Ser 157 by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figure 16E</xref>). In the absence of dynasore, TSH caused a robust increase of VASP phosphorylation throughout the cell. In particular, phosphorylated VASP colocalized with spots of depolymerized actin in the central cellular compartment. By contrast, only a minor induction of VASP phosphorylation and no spots of phosphorylated VASP in the central cellular compartment were observed in the presence of dynasore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figure 16E</xref>). As a control, the generalized depolymerization of actin and the pattern of VASP phosphorylation induced by forskolin were not modified by dynasore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g016">Figure 16F</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that TSH receptor internalization not only modifies the temporal dynamics of cAMP signaling by leading to persistent cAMP production, but may also affect the intensity and the spatial patterning of downstream signals.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The conventional model of GPCR signaling is based on the central concept that signaling to second messengers such as cAMP is taking place only at the cell plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Pierce1">[1]</xref>. The role assigned to receptor internalization is essentially to reduce the number of GPCRs present on the cell surface, thus contributing to signal desensitization, or to bring the receptors to an intracellular site for dephosphorylation and resensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Pierce1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Pippig1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-vonZastrow2">[56]</xref>. Whatever the fate of the internalized GPCRs, they are thought to stop signaling to second messengers once inside the cell. Here, we provide evidence that a GPCR continues to stimulate cAMP production after internalization. cAMP signaling by internalized receptors appears to be different from that occurring at the plasma membrane, as it is of a sustained nature and leads to a different pattern of downstream signals.</p>
<p>Although the biochemical steps involved in GPCR signaling are known in detail, their location in space and time in living cells is poorly understood. This represents a major drawback, as there is emerging evidence that signaling cascades are highly organized in space and time, and intrinsically dynamic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Kholodenko1">[20]</xref>. On such a basis, there is an urgent need to develop new tools and techniques to monitor signaling events with submicrometer resolution and fast temporal dynamics. Recently, the application of FRET to color variants of <italic>Aequorea victoria</italic> GFP has allowed the development of a toolbox of genetically encoded sensors to observe intracellular signaling events in real time. Several sensors have been described that exhibit FRET changes on exposure to cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev4">[57]</xref>. A sensor based on the dissociation of the PKA subunits was first described by Adams et al. (using rhodamine and fluorescein as fluorophores) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Adams1">[58]</xref> and later modified by Zaccolo and colleagues to be genetically encoded by substituting rhodamine and fluorescein with GFP variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Zaccolo1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Zaccolo2">[13]</xref>. This sensor has led to major insights into the biology of cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Zaccolo2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Terrin1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Zaccolo3">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Warrier1">[61]</xref>. We have recently described another type of sensors, including Epac1-camps, that are based on a single cAMP-binding domain derived from cAMP-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev3">[26]</xref>. These sensors, being based on a cAMP-binding domain alone and not on the entire protein, are devoid of any signaling activity. Therefore, they are extremely well tolerated and are expected not to alter the functions of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev4">[57]</xref>. This is probably why the CAG-Epac1-camps mice are viable and healthy, whereas attempts to create genetically modified organisms with ubiquitous expression of PKA-based sensors have so far been unsuccessful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lissandron1">[62]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Kim1">[63]</xref>.</p>
<p>The newly generated cAMP reporter mice were used to monitor GPCR signaling in living cells. A major strength of our study was the use of a highly physiological system, i.e., 3-D thyroid follicles. Thyroid follicles represent a unique model to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of cAMP signaling because they maintain the supracellular organization, size, and polarization possessed by thyroid cells in vivo, and constitute a rare example of cells that are under the strict control of a GPCR (the TSH receptor) and of cAMP for virtually all their functions (e.g., thyroid hormone production, cell proliferation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Vassart1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Calebiro1">[28]</xref>. The conservation of the original cellular architecture of thyroid tissue is reflected by the high degree of spatial organization of the TSH receptor-cAMP signaling cascade: the TSH receptor is expressed on the basolateral membrane; upon binding of TSH, cAMP produced at the basolateral membrane diffuses through the cytosol to activate cytosolic PKA I and PKA II, mainly located in the Golgi complex; PKAs in turn phosphorylate targets localized in different cellular compartments (e.g., cytosol, nucleus, as well as apical and basolateral membranes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Vassart1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Calebiro1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Feliciello1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Porcellini1">[66]</xref>. The maintenance of the original cellular size and shape is of fundamental importance, as modifications of these parameters are expected to alter the properties of signaling cascades, including the shape of the gradients of cAMP and other soluble messengers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Kholodenko1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Kholodenko2">[22]</xref>. Another advantage of thyroid follicles is that they already express all the required signaling machinery at endogenous levels. Here, we describe a method to directly visualize cAMP signaling in thyroid follicles, thus allowing, for the first time to our knowledge, a precise monitoring of the kinetics of a GPCR-cAMP signaling cascade, at endogenous levels of expression and in its native multicellular functional unit. We believe that this represents a major step towards depicting signaling pathways in their natural context.</p>
<p>By monitoring cAMP signaling and receptor internalization, we obtained a series of unexpected findings. First, the TSH receptor internalizes rapidly and consistently into a pre-Golgi compartment in close association with Gα<sub>s</sub> and adenylyl cyclase III. Second, the robust internalization of the TSH receptor is not associated with any appreciable desensitization of the cAMP signal. Third, prolonged TSH receptor stimulation leads to a sustained production of cAMP; by contrast, short stimuli are completely reversible. Fourth, blocking receptor internalization can prevent the irreversibility of cAMP signals. Fifth, TSH receptor internalization is required to ensure a normal pattern of actin rearrangement and VASP phosphorylation downstream of cAMP. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that the TSH receptor continues to signal to adenylyl cyclase after internalization, and that the location of TSH receptor-cAMP signaling affects the spatial patterns of the downstream signals.</p>
<p>The consequences of GPCR signaling from inside the cell appear to be multiple, as anticipated by Miaczynska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Miaczynska1">[4]</xref>. First, sustained cAMP production from internalized receptors may provide a memory mechanism, allowing thyroid cells to maintain constant thyroid hormone production in the presence of fluctuations in plasma TSH concentration. Indeed, TSH release from the pituitary follows a circadian rhythm, with a zenith in the first hours of the morning, but those fluctuations are not associated with a change in the production of thyroid hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Goichot1">[67]</xref>. Additionally, intracellular membranes may provide specialized platforms for signal compartmentalization. This is the case of MAPK activation by GPCRs, which appears to happen selectively on endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lefkowitz1">[7]</xref>, and of tyrosine kinase receptors that activate a distinct subset of substrates once inside the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Sorkin1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-vonZastrow1">[6]</xref>. In the case of cAMP signaling, internalized receptors appear to be more efficiently coupled to PKA, as suggested by the effect of endocytosis inhibitors on VASP phosphorylation. This could be explained if the receptors need to be brought close to an intracellular pool of PKA for efficient kinase activation and/or VASP phosphorylation.</p>
<p>The existence of spatial microdomains of cAMP signaling inside the cell has been debated for years. Unlike Ca<sup>++</sup>, whose apparent diffusion is limited by the high buffering capacity of cytosolic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Smith1">[68]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Thorn1">[69]</xref>, measurement of cAMP diffusion gave values in the range of 270–780 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, i.e., as fast as would be expected in a simple electrolyte solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Bacskai1">[70]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Chen1">[71]</xref>. For this reason, cAMP has been traditionally considered a far-reaching messenger, capable of crossing the whole cell to convey the information generated at the plasma membrane. Although this might be the case in certain circumstances, as for example, in the case of long-term facilitation in <italic>Aplysia</italic> sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Emptage1">[72]</xref>, it is difficult to reconcile the free diffusion of cAMP with the high spatial organization of the cAMP signaling cascade (adenylyl cyclases, PKAs, AKAPs, PDEs, etc.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lohse1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev4">[57]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Zaccolo3">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Emptage1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Lohse2">[78]</xref>. This paradox has been partially resolved by recent reports of restricted cAMP diffusion. A striated pattern of cAMP signaling has been observed in cardiomyocytes with a genetically encoded PKA-based sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Zaccolo2">[13]</xref>. In addition, a study by our group has revealed that in these cells, β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors produce generalized cAMP responses, whereas β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors generate locally confined signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Nikolaev3">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, the existence of cAMP microdomains is supported by a body of indirect evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-DiPilato1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Zaccolo3">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Zaccolo4">[75]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Jurevicius1">[79]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Mongillo2">[86]</xref>, and the formation of cAMP gradients is predicted on the basis of the spatial segregation of adenylyl cyclases on the membrane and PDEs in the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Kholodenko1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Kholodenko2">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Fell1">[87]</xref>. Recent calculations suggest that such gradients may have a length of 2.5–4 µm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-Kholodenko2">[22]</xref>. If this is indeed the case, signals originating near the plasma membrane could hardly reach deep inside the cell. In this perspective, GPCR-cAMP signaling from intracellular sites might provide a new basis to explain the activation of distant targets and the specific effects observed with different types of activation.</p>
<p>In an attempt to identify the intracellular compartment(s) where sustained TSH receptor-cAMP signaling was occurring, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the internalized TSH, Gα<sub>s</sub>, and adenylyl cyclases by a combination of experimental approaches. In agreement with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000172-BarattiElbaz1">[31]</xref>, our results indicate that TSH and its receptor are internalized rapidly in endosomes. Later on, at least part of the internalized TSH is found together with transferrin in perinuclear vesicles that probably represent a recycling endosomal compartment. Interestingly, some of these vesicles appear to contain also Gα<sub>s</sub> and adenylyl cyclases. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that subdetectable levels of Gα<sub>s</sub> may be present together with adenylyl cyclases in early endosomes and that TSH receptor-cAMP signaling might be taking place also in this compartment, those perinuclear vesicles that simultaneously contain TSH, Gα<sub>s</sub>, and adenylyl cyclases are the most likely candidates to be the intracellular sites of TSH receptor-cAMP signaling. An interesting aspect that emerges from our experiments and that should be taken into consideration is the highly dynamic nature of the intracellular structures where the internalized TSH, adenylyl cyclases, and Gα<sub>s</sub> are present. These compartments appear in fact highly complex, sometimes having specialized subdomains that prevalently contain one component and rapidly exchange their contents by fusing to each other or through budding of new vesicles. Additional studies, probably requiring the generation of better antibodies and new tools to simultaneously monitor the localization of the receptor, Gα<sub>s</sub> and adenylyl cyclases in real time, are needed to further investigate the microscopic anatomy and the dynamic nature of the intracellular cAMP signaling compartment(s).</p>
<p>In summary, our data show that GPCR signaling in a physiological setting may be more complex than current knowledge, based mostly on studies with transfected cells, suggests. In particular, the subcellular localization of GPCRs, either on the plasma membrane or intracellular, appears to be an important parameter affecting the duration and the spatial pattern of downstream signals. These findings may lead to reconsidering the current model of GPCR signaling and suggest new and intriguing scenarios on the function of GPCRs inside the cell.</p>

The lobes were collected in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, containing 1 ml of digestion medium, which consisted of 100 U/ml collagenase I, 100 U/ml collagenase II, and 1 U/ml dispase, dissolved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12. Enzymatic digestion was carried out for 1 h in a 37°C water bath, with manual shaking every 15 min. After digestion, isolated individual follicles were washed three times with culture medium and plated on glass-bottom 35-mm Petri dishes, coated with a thin layer of collagen gel. The collagen gel was prepared by spreading 8 µl of a collagen solution (3 mg/ml in 0.2% acetic acid) onto the glass surface, followed by addition of a neutralizing solution (0.4 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.2 M HEPES [pH 7.4]).

FRET was monitored using MetaFluor 5.0 software (Molecular Devices) as the ratio between emission at 535±20 nm (YFP) and emission at 480±15 nm (CFP), upon excitation at 436±10 nm. The imaging data were analyzed utilizing MetaMorph 5.0 (Molecular Devices) and Prism (GraphPad Software) software, by correcting for spillover of CFP into the 535-nm channel and direct YFP-excitation, to give corrected YFP/CFP ratio data. Images were acquired every 5 s, with 5-ms illumination time, which resulted in negligible photobleaching for over 30-min observation.

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Values are expressed as mean±standard error of the mean (SEM). Data normality was checked with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differences between means were assessed by two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test (for two groups) or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test (for three or more groups). For analysis of signal normalization after TSH washout, signal reversibility was calculated from YFP/CFP ratio values by setting the minimum value equal to zero and the value before TSH stimulation equal to 100%. The values obtained from different replicates were globally fitted to a first-order exponential function. Fits were compared by using F test, having a null hypothesis that <italic>Y</italic><sub>max</sub> values were the same for all datasets. Alternatively, data from each replicate were individually fit to a first-order exponential function, and the obtained <italic>Y</italic><sub>max</sub> values were compared by one-way ANOVA.</p>

Reported is a representative trace from a thyroid follicle that was initially stimulated for 3 min and later on for 10 min. Note that DMPB-forskolin produced cAMP increases comparable to those obtained with TSH (for comparison, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000172-g005">Figure 5B–5D</xref>). In contrast to what was observed with TSH, the signals produced by DMPB-forskolin were completely reversible upon washout. Data are representative of ten independent experiments.</p>

<p><bold>Fluorescent TSH internalization in whole thyroid follicles.</bold> Primary thyroid follicles obtained from CAG-Epac1-camps mice were stimulated with 3 µg/ml TSH-Alexa594 for 60 min, fixed, and then visualized by confocal microscopy. To isolate the Alexa594 signal, the background autofluorescence was subtracted from the image by spectral unmixing. To this end, an additional reference image was acquired at 405-nm excitation and 425–450-nm emission. This reference image was multiplied by a correction factor (calculated from the relative intensities of Alexa594 and of reference images of unlabeled thyroid follicles) and subtracted from the Alexa594 image. Shown is the corrected Alexa594 image. Images are representative of 15 follicles visualized in three independent experiments.</p>

Representative images of the intracellular localization of TSH-Alexa488 and adenylyl cyclase III are shown. (A–C) Immunogold labeling with an antibody against Alexa488. No staining was observed in cells that were not stimulated with TSH-Alexa488 (A). By contrast, in cells that were stimulated with TSH-Alexa488 for 30 min, a positive immunogold staining was present in early and late endosomes (B), as well as in denser vesicles probably representing a degradative compartment (C). (D and E) Immunogold labeling with an antibody against adenylyl cyclase III. Adenylyl cyclase III was found occasionally on the plasma membrane and on small subplasmalemmal vesicles (unpublished data), in the Golgi area (D) and on endosomal membranes (E). Stimulation with TSH-Alexa488 appeared to just slightly modify the distribution of adenylyl cyclase III, with a tendency towards a reduction in the Golgi area and an increase in the endosomal compartment.
