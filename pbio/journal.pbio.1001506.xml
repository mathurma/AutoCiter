        <p>Hypothalamic neurons are main regulators of energy homeostasis. Neuronal function essentially depends on plasma membrane-located gangliosides. The present work demonstrates that hypothalamic integration of metabolic signals requires neuronal expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS; UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase). As a major mechanism of central nervous system (CNS) metabolic control, we demonstrate that GCS-derived gangliosides interacting with leptin receptors (ObR) in the neuronal membrane modulate leptin-stimulated formation of signaling metabolites in hypothalamic neurons. Furthermore, ganglioside-depleted hypothalamic neurons fail to adapt their activity (c-Fos) in response to alterations in peripheral energy signals. Consequently, mice with inducible forebrain neuron-specific deletion of the UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase gene (<italic>Ugcg</italic>) display obesity, hypothermia, and lower sympathetic activity. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated <italic>Ugcg</italic> delivery to the arcuate nucleus (Arc) significantly ameliorated obesity, specifying gangliosides as seminal components for hypothalamic regulation of body energy homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Obesity is a growing health threat that affects nearly half a billion people worldwide, and its incidence rates in lower income countries are rising dramatically. As obesity is a major risk factor for type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease, significant effort has been put into the exploration of causes, prevention, and potential treatment. Recent research has demonstrated that a region of the brain called the hypothalamus is a major integrator of metabolic and nutrient signals, adapting food intake and energy expenditure to current metabolic needs. Leptin or insulin receptors located in the plasma cell membrane of neurons sense energy signals from the body. They transmit this information inside the cell, which then regulates neuronal function. In this study, we show that leptin receptors interact with gangliosides, a class of plasma membrane lipids. This interaction is a prerequisite for proper receptor activation. Consequently, ganglioside loss in hypothalamic neurons inhibits leptin receptor signal transduction in response to energy metabolites. Furthermore, mice lacking gangliosides in distinct forebrain areas, amongst them the hypothalamus, develop progressive obesity and hypothermia. Our results suggest a previously unknown regulatory mechanism of plasma membrane lipids for hypothalamic control of body weight.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The investigation of pathogenetic mechanisms underlying obesity has attained significant interest, as obesity has become an endemic metabolic disturbance worldwide. Elevated peripheral energy storage can develop as a consequence of alterations in the neuronal feedback circuits regulating energy homeostasis. The hypothalamus is the main CNS integrator of peripheral energy signals, matching energy intake to energy expenditure for body weight maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Morton1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Among the most extensively studied peripheral molecules involved in regulating energy homeostasis and feeding behavior in the CNS are the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin as well as insulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Lee1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Knner1">[3]</xref>. Among numerous leptin- and insulin-sensitive brain areas, the hypothalamic Arc is one of the main regions integrating peripheral energy signals and initiating adaptive metabolic and behavioral responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Schwartz1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, several CNS regions targeted by leptin have emerged that are involved in the regulation of energy metabolism, such as the brain stem nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and reward circuits involving the ventral tegmental area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Leshan1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Myers1">[6]</xref>. Still, leptin is suggested to exert anti-obesity effects by signaling through “long form” leptin receptors (ObR) abundantly present on both orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons and anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the Arc. Excess NPY signaling abates sympathetically mediated thermogenesis, thereby reducing energy expenditure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Bing1">[7]</xref>. NPY and AgRP expression is attenuated upon ObR-induced phosphatidylinositol-3-OH-kinase (PI3k) signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Morrison1">[8]</xref>. Conversely, leptin stimulates the expression of the POMC-derived neurotransmitter α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-Stat) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Mnzberg1">[9]</xref>. Alpha-MSH, a potent agonist of melanocortin receptors, inhibits food intake and stimulates the expenditure of excess energy in the body, thus preventing obesity development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Pierroz1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Insulin exerts its anorexigenic effects in hypothalamic neurons by directly stimulating insulin receptor autophosphorylation and activation of PI3k. Even though both insulin and leptin receptor stimulation leads to activation of PI3k and subsequent formation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Plum1">[11]</xref>, it has been shown that both hormones exert converging direct actions on POMC neurons, while having opposite effects on AgRP/NPY neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Xu1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>GCS is the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and gangliosides, a class of acidic GSLs abundantly expressed by neurons and glial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Ledeen1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Silajdzic1">[14]</xref>. Ganglioside-depleted neurons are viable and show apoptosis rates comparable to wild-type neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Jennemann1">[15]</xref>. GSLs including gangliosides contribute to the formation of membrane microdomains, which are important mediators of intracellular signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Simons1">[16]</xref>. GCS expression is crucial for initial postnatal brain maturation and <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//NesCre</sup> mice with constitutive <italic>Ugcg</italic> deletion in brain tissue under the control of the nestin promoter die within 3 wk after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Jennemann1">[15]</xref>. In 2003, it was shown that GM3 synthase-deficient mice are more sensitive to insulin, thereby protecting these mice from high-fat-diet-induced insulin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Yamashita1">[17]</xref>. A different ganglioside species, GD1a, has been shown to exert activating effects on tyrosine kinase receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Liu1">[18]</xref>. To address the functional role of GCS in neuronal regulation of energy homeostasis, we have generated and characterized mice with inducible neuron-specific <italic>Ugcg</italic> deletion in adult mouse CNS (<italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice). Cre activity in this mouse model was restricted to distinct populations of forebrain neurons. Hypothalamic nuclei involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis were targeted by this approach. Explicitly, Cre activity was absent in the brain stem NTS, which also contributes to regulation of energy homeostasis.</p>
      <p>The present study highlights GCS-derived gangliosides as mediators for ObR-dependent signal transduction at the hypothalamic neuronal membrane. GCS-depleted neurons failed to show ObR activation upon leptin stimulation. Major neuronal gangliosides GM1 and GD1a were recruited to ObR upon ligand stimulation and subsequent signal transduction depended on ganglioside expression in hypothalamic neurons. <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice deficient in GSLs in hypothalamus developed progressive obesity and decreased sympathetically mediated thermogenesis. rAAV-mediated <italic>Ugcg</italic> delivery to the hypothalamic Arc with ensuing nucleus-specific GSL synthesis significantly ameliorated obesity.</p>

Additional Cre activity was detected in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), in hippocampus, and in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s001">Figure S1A</xref>,B). Notably, Cre activity was absent in the ventromedial hypothalamus and the NTS in the brain stem (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s001">Figure S1A</xref>,B). Ganglioside depletion was confirmed in Cre-targeted areas by GD1a immunofluorescence, whereas non-targeted areas retained GD1a expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001506-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>Consistent with the expected Cre-activity pattern, in situ hybridization showed <italic>Ugcg</italic> mRNA depletion in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, amygdala, as well as hypothalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s001">Figure S1C</xref>).

Ceramide levels in Cre-targeted neuronal populations were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001506-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), and a slight increase in sphingomyelin could be detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s001">Figure S1F</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to investigate if ganglioside depletion abated general neuronal function and integrity in <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice, both electron microscopy and electrophysiological slice recordings were done at late time points p.i.

        <p>In order to confirm these findings in vitro, immortalized mouse hypothalamic cells (N-41 cells) expressing GCS-derived gangliosides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s003">Figure S3A</xref>,B) were treated with n-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) specifically inhibiting GCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Platt1">[20]</xref>.

        <title>GCS-Derived Gangliosides Regulate Leptin Receptor Signaling in Hypothalamic Neurons at the Plasma Membrane</title>
        <p>Since the number of neurons in the Arc did not differ between <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice and controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s008">Figure S8A</xref>), a functional analysis of the Arc was performed.

            <p>(A) Stat3 phosphorylation was markedly decreased in Arc sections of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice in response to peripheral leptin (5 mg/kg; 45 min) 6 wk p.i. (<italic>n</italic> = 16–33). Three independent animal groups were analyzed.

(C) mRNA expression analysis for suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3) expression in Arc-enriched hypothalamic tissue was carried out 2, 6, and 9 wk p.i. <italic>Socs-3</italic> expression normalized to the housekeeping gene tubulin was unaltered (<italic>n</italic> = 3–5). (D) mRNA expression analysis for the long form of the leptin receptor, <italic>Leprb</italic>, in mediobasal hypothalamus was carried out 6 wk p.i. <italic>Leprb</italic> expression normalized to the housekeeping gene tubulin was unaltered at that time point (<italic>n</italic> = 4–5). (E) Immortalized mouse hypothalamic cells (N-41 cells) were analyzed for cell surface expression of ObR. Non-detergent-treated cells were fixed and simultaneously stained with two ObR antibodies. A proximity ligation assay (PLA) indicated quantifiable and unchanged ObR expression on the surface of controls and cells treated with the specific GCS inhibitor NB-DNJ (<italic>n</italic> = 41–47 cells). PLA principle is depicted on the right side. (F–G) N-41 cells were incubated with either saline or 100 ng/ml leptin (10 min). Close interactions between GCS-derived neuronal gangliosides GD1a/ObR (F) and GM1/ObR (G) were detected by PLA. Leptin treatment dynamically increased the GD1a/ObR and GM1/ObR PLA spots per cell (<italic>n</italic> = 48–67 cells). (H) Extracts from saline- and leptin-treated N-41 cells were immunoprecipitated with an ObR antibody, lipids were extracted, and GD1a and GM1 were visualized by immune overlay TLC. GD1a and GM1 co-immunoprecipitated (Co-IP) with ObR, which tended to be stronger in leptin-treated cells. Addition of a blocking peptide almost totally abolished ganglioside signals. Gangliosides GD1b and GT1b, expressed in mouse brain tissue, were not co-precipitated with ObR from hypothalamic tissue of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice (5 mg/kg leptin, 45 min). (I) Co-IP showed significantly decreased leptin-induced complex formation between ObR and Jak in NB-DNJ-treated N-41 cells (<italic>n</italic> = 4). (J) Sustainable Jak phosphorylation could be induced in N-41 cells after 15 min of leptin treatment (0.5 µg/ml). NB-DNJ-treated cells showed a markedly delayed response to leptin.

        <p>It has been shown that deficient ObR signaling due to leptin resistance of the Arc in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) is a consequence of long-term elevated leptin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Mnzberg2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Levin1">[27]</xref>.

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001506-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, hypothalamic ObR expression, usually elevated in leptin-resistant rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Lin1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Huang1">[30]</xref>, was normal in <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice 6 wk p.i.

        <p>To further investigate if GCS-derived gangliosides regulate proper leptin receptor signaling at the level of the plasma membrane in hypothalamic neurons, we first assured that loss of gangliosides would not interfere with ObR transport to the membrane, which would have impaired ObR signaling per se. ObR was labeled by an in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) on non-detergent-perturbed cells by two ObR antibodies. The number of detected surface ObR PLA spots on cells treated with NB-DNJ was similar to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001506-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that ObR at the plasma membrane of ganglioside-depleted hypothalamic cells is not significantly changed compared to control cells.</p>
        <p>As GCS-derived gangliosides have previously been shown to modulate the activity of plasma-membrane-located receptors through close interactions in both adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Yamashita1">[17]</xref> and neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Mutoh1">[31]</xref>, we investigated ObR interactions with major neuronal gangliosides. The PLA indicating close proximity events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Greenberg1">[32]</xref> indeed revealed proximity between ObR and gangliosides GM1 and GD1a. In demonstration of activity-dependent interaction between GSL and ObR, the number of GD1a/ObR and GM1/ObR PLA spots increased upon stimulation with leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001506-g005">Figures 5F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s008">S8E</xref>). Complex formation between GD1a/GM1 with ObR was further corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) of ObR and GD1a/GM1 in saline- and leptin-stimulated N-41 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001506-g005">Figures 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s008">S8F</xref>). As N-41 cells do not express the complex neuronal gangliosides GD1b and GT1b, potential interactions with ObR had to be analyzed in hypothalamic tissue of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice. GD1b and GT1b could not be co-precipitated with ObR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001506-g005">Figure 5H</xref>).</p>
        <p>Ganglioside-depleted cells were then assessed for leptin-dependent signal transduction. Ganglioside-depleted cells did not show the leptin-stimulated increased complex formation between ObR and Jak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001506-g005">Figures 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s008">S8G</xref>). Time- and dose-dependent Jak phosphorylation could be induced by leptin treatment in N-41 cells and was decreased in NB-DNJ-treated GSL-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001506-g005">Figures 5J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s008">S8H</xref>). It has to be noted that NB-DNJ evokes ganglioside depletion by only approximately 80%–90% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Thus, residual gangliosides in the plasma cell membrane may explain the appearance of a P-Jak signal at a late time point after stimulation of NB-DNJ-treated cells. Ganglioside-depleted N-41 cells showed decreased Jak phosphorylation 30 min after stimulation with 0.5 µg/ml leptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001506-g005">Figure 5J,K</xref>).</p>
        <p>These results have now shown that two major neuronal GCS-derived gangliosides, GD1a and GM1, form dynamically leptin-stimulated complexes with ObR on the plasma membrane and that loss of gangliosides decreases signal transduction in hypothalamic neurons.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although the seminal role of CNS feedback responses to peripheral energy signals for the regulation of energy homeostasis has been extensively studied, the role of the lipid microenvironment for energy signal receptor function has not yet been addressed. The present study demonstrates that GCS-derived GSLs are critically involved in a to-date unknown mechanism of hypothalamic control of body weight. In line with the finding that neurons of the constitutive <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//NesCre</sup> mice do not show increased apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Jennemann1">[15]</xref>, ganglioside-deficient hypothalamic neurons are viable and they show normal membrane and organelle appearance both in vivo and in vitro. Electrophysiological recordings from Arc neurons in slices of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice at 12 wk p.i. did not show a major disruption of membrane functions. However, resting membrane potential and action potential threshold were both shifted to slightly more depolarized values. The molecular mechanism underlying the altered membrane potential remains presently elusive. However, it is well feasible that the shift of threshold is secondary to the slight depolarization, which might inactivate a fraction of Na<sup>+</sup> channels. In line with the largely normal properties of neurons from brain slices, biophysical parameters of primary hypothalamic neurons devoid of gangliosides were unaltered. Thus, failure of basic electrophysiological membrane functions is unlikely to cause the observed phenotype of mice with ganglioside deficiency.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the present work focuses on interactions of leptin receptors with the ganglioside-containing lipid microevironment in which receptors are embedded. We show with independent methods that two major neuronal GCS-derived gangliosides, GD1a and GM1, closely interact with leptin receptors on the neuronal membrane. This interaction is dynamically enhanced by stimulation with leptin. Both <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice and ganglioside-depleted hypothalamic cells display deficient ObR signal transduction upon leptin stimulation, as assessed by decreased leptin-induced Jak phosphorylation, Stat3 phosphorylation, and PIP3 formation. Corroborated in situ by deficient leptin responsiveness in Arc neurons of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice, these results indicate that GCS-derived GSLs, primarily gangliosides, are seminal regulators for neuronal leptin signal transduction. Consequently, <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice with deficient leptin-induced hypothalamic neuronal responsiveness develop progressive obesity.</p>
      <p>Numerous hypothalamic feedback systems involved in body weight maintenance are known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Morton1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Schwartz1">[4]</xref>. Admittedly, the robust phenotype of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice may be caused by several peripheral hormones and defective ensuing signaling events occurring in various Cre-targeted CNS regions of this mouse model. The brain stem NTS, though an important mediator of metabolic control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Luckman1">[37]</xref>, is not targeted by activity under the CamK II <italic>alpha</italic>-dependent Cre recombinase used in this study. Consequently, the NTS shows normal responsiveness to leptin in obese <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice and can be excluded to contribute to the observed phenotype. Recent reviews also highlight the LHA as an important regulator of energy balance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Leinninger1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Stanley1">[39]</xref>. In fact, compensating neurocircuits involving nontargeted CNS regions may be considered for the return of food intake from initial hyperphagia to normal levels in obese mice despite the striking increase in orexigenic neuropeptides. Even though X-Gal staining could be seen in parts of the LHA, we could not verify Cre targeting of a major part of ObR-expressing LHA neurons in <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001506.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). In strong support to this line of reasoning, we demonstrate that partial <italic>Ugcg</italic> replenishment in the Arc mediated by stereotactic injection of rAAV significantly ameliorates obesity and hyperleptinemia in <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice. Even though limited infection of closely attached tissue by rAAV injection could not be definitely excluded, mainly Arc neurons were targeted by this approach, as assessed by X-Gal stainings of brains co-injected with LacZ-expressing viruses. The present investigation has thus been restricted to GCS effects focused on the MBH harboring Arc neurons.</p>
      <p>Deficient leptin signaling as a consequence of leptin resistance occurs predominantly in the Arc of DIO mice with severe long-term hyperleptimenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Mnzberg2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Levin1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Myers2">[40]</xref>. Socs-3 is a major negative feedback pathway of ObR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Munzberg1">[41]</xref>. Thus, elevated Socs-3 expression levels are found in the hypothalamus of leptin-resistant rodent models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Mnzberg2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Bjorbaek1">[42]</xref>. In line with observations in obese <italic>db/db</italic> mice with nonfunctioning ObR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Mnzberg2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Bjorbaek1">[42]</xref>, <italic>Socs-3</italic> expression in the Arc remains indistinguishable from control littermates in nonobese and obese <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice 2, 6, and 12 wk p.i. Elevated hypothalamic ObR expression, as it occurs in DIO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Lin1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Huang1">[30]</xref>, has also been proposed as a potential mechanism playing a role in the development of leptin resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Gamber1">[28]</xref>. However, normal ObR expression in <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice supports the hypothesis that the ObR signaling in their neurons must be deficient due to ganglioside loss and not merely due to secondary leptin resistance. Furthermore, the nontargeted hypothalamic VMH and brain stem NTS retain leptin responsiveness even in obese mice 6 wk p.i. These results in combination with the decreased ObR signal transduction in ganglioside-depleted and non-leptin-resistant N-41 cells strongly suggest that loss of GCS-derived GSLs including gangliosides GD1a and GM1 is the reason for failing ObR activation and subsequently inhibited intracellular signaling.</p>
      <p>GCS-depleted Arc neurons display normal leptin sensitivity 1–2 wk p.i., a time point when gangliosides are still present. Furthermore, onset of body weight gain, deficient neuronal activity in the Arc, and abolished ObR signaling coincide with ganglioside depletion 3 wk p.i. This strongly suggests that the mentioned defects are due to ganglioside depletion in these cells rather than due to lack of the enzyme GCS itself.</p>
      <p>Further evidence for the postulate that ganglioside deficiency-dependent inhibition of ObR signaling in hypothalamic neurons leads to impaired neuronal function is based on our in situ results in ganglioside-depleted Arc of both obese and nonobese <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice. Whereas leptin injection increases c-Fos immunoreactivity and thus neuronal activity in the Arc neurons of fasted lean mice, this response did not occur in GCS-deficient neurons. Leptin specifically engages POMC neurons. Even though the effects of PI3k- and Stat3-dependent signaling in POMC neurons do not overlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Xu1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Plum2">[43]</xref>, both pathways are activated by leptin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Plum1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Xu1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Huo1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Niswender1">[45]</xref> and contribute to maintenance of energy homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Xu2">[46]</xref>. In ganglioside-depleted POMC neurons, neither PStat3 nor PIP3 formation is increased by peripheral leptin injections, strongly suggesting that defects in both pathways may contribute to partial failure of obesity prevention. As peripheral leptin stimulates both pathways through ObR activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Plum1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Sweeney1">[47]</xref>, defective ObR function is very likely to be assumed.</p>
      <p>In NPY neurons, it has been demonstrated that Jak-Stat3 signaling plays an important role in maintaining NPY/AgRP-mediated energy homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Gong1">[48]</xref>. Additional ObR-mediated PI3k activation seems to be required for inhibiting <italic>Npy</italic> and <italic>Agrp</italic> gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Morrison1">[8]</xref>. <italic>Npy</italic> and <italic>Agrp</italic> expression is markedly increased in the MBH of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice, which may be a consequence of absent leptin-induced PStat3 formation in NPY neurons. On the other hand, leptin-induced PIP3 formation does not differ in neither of the groups, which goes in line with the hypothesis that leptin-dependent PIP3 formation in AgRP/NPY neurons is stimulated by an indirect mechanism involving synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Xu1">[12]</xref>. Overactive NPY neurons in obese ObR-deficient <italic>Lepr</italic><sup>fa/fa</sup> rats were shown to inhibit sympathetic nervous outflow to BAT and cause hypothermia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Bing1">[7]</xref> as observed in <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice. With regard to the fact that <italic>Npy</italic> and <italic>Agrp</italic> but not <italic>Pomc</italic> expression differ in <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice, the role of GCS expression in regulating neuropeptide expression and secretion has to be elucidated. Especially the role of hypothalamic insulin receptor signaling, which also regulates the expression of <italic>Pomc</italic> and <italic>Npy/Agrp</italic> in part similar to ObR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Plum1">[11]</xref> and is antagonized by GM3 in the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Yamashita1">[17]</xref>, constitutes a promising target for further clarifying the differential neuropeptide expression. Moreover, a potential contribution of Cre-targeted ObR-expressing neurons in the median preoptic area of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice to hypothermia may also be considered.</p>
      <p>Dynamic membrane microdomains are widely accepted as critical components involved in membrane receptor functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Simons1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Inokuchi1">[49]</xref>. Since GCS-derived gangliosides are important constituents of these microdomains, they potentially interact with and regulate a variety of membrane components including receptors such as Trk receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Mutoh1">[31]</xref> and insulin receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Yamashita1">[17]</xref>. In contrast to mice with neuron-specific insulin receptor deletion, which only display a gender- and diet-dependent subtle increase in body weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Plum1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Brning1">[50]</xref>, the obesity and glucose intolerance observed in db/db mice can be rescued by neuron-specific re-expression of ObR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-deLuca1">[51]</xref>. Furthermore, deficient ObR signaling in POMC neurons of the Arc itself leads to the development of mild obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Balthasar1">[52]</xref>. In consideration of these findings—despite the existence of potential alternative pathways that might be impaired in neurons of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice—we ascribe ObR and its regulation of activity to a major function in our model pointing to a novel mechanism for CNS metabolic regulation.</p>
      <p>We demonstrate that GCS-derived gangliosides GD1a and GM1 closely interact with ObR. The leptin-induced increase in GD1a/ObR and GM1/ObR interaction assumes recruitment of these gangliosides to the ObR upon leptin stimulation. These results in combination with the demonstrated deficient ObR signaling in ganglioside-depleted hypothalamic neurons both in vivo and in vitro leads us to surmise that the lipid microenvironment surrounding the ObR can significantly modulate leptin-dependent intracellular signal transduction in hypothalamic neurons. Altogether, these results provide evidence that GM1 and GD1a are actively involved in enhancing the effects of leptin in hypothalamic neurons.</p>
      <p>As insulin receptors contain a lysine residue predicted for interaction with GM3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Kabayama1">[53]</xref>, loss of GM3 synthase showed already a prominent effect on peripheral insulin receptor signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Yamashita1">[17]</xref>. It is a widely accepted concept that in the state of insulin resistance in peripheral adipocytes, the IR segregates from caveolae into GM3-enriched microdomains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Kabayama1">[53]</xref>, an endogenous inhibitory mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Yamashita1">[17]</xref>. Indeed, elevated GM3 synthase expression could be detected in adipose tissue of obese Zucker <italic>fa/fa</italic> rats and <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Inokuchi2">[54]</xref>. Pharmacologic GCS inhibition in the periphery has been shown to exert beneficial effects on peripheral insulin sensitivity and liver steatosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-vanEijk1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Zhao1">[56]</xref>. With regard to the fact that different ganglioside species can exert either stimulatory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Liu1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Lang1">[57]</xref> or inhibitory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Yamashita1">[17]</xref> effects on membrane receptors, the mentioned studies including the present work support the concept that any perturbation, either loss or excess, of membrane GSLs can alter receptor function. Contributions of GCS-derived lipid raft components apart from gangliosides, namely neutral GSLs in the CNS, to leptin receptor function have yet to be elucidated and constitute a challenging target for future investigations. Besides gangliosides, lactosylceramide has been shown to contribute to formation of lipid microdomains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Nakayama1">[58]</xref>. We, however, propose in the present study that in line with the findings for the insulin receptor, hypothalamic leptin receptor signaling is to a significant extent regulated through interactions with the dominant gangliosides GD1a and GM1.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have highlighted the central role of systemic ceramide biosynthesis and GCS in the regulation of energy homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Yang1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-KohyamaKoganeya1">[60]</xref>. In accordance with earlier findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Jennemann1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001506-Aerts1">[61]</xref>, we show that neuronal ceramide levels in <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice are indistinguishable from control mice, virtually excluding any effects of ceramides.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our study highlights the expression of neuronal GCS-derived GSLs, foremost gangliosides, as a novel class of hypothalamic metabolic regulators. Gangliosides GM1 and GD1a enhance the action of leptin on intracellular signaling and neuronal activity, most likely through dynamic changes of the lipid microenvironment of the ObR. We demonstrate by independent methods that gangliosides GD1a and GM1 strongly interact with the ObR upon leptin stimulation. Loss of these gangliosides leads to impaired responsiveness. By this relevant influence on hormone signaling, <italic>Ugcg</italic> deletion in adult mouse CNS leads to development of progressive obesity, hyperleptinemia, and glucose intolerance. The obesity can be partially ameliorated by restoration of GCS activity and ganglioside expression in the hypothalamic Arc of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice. Neuronal GCS expression therefore constitutes a novel mechanism for hypothalamic regulation of body weight maintenance.</p>

(D) Increased <italic>Npy</italic> and <italic>Agrp</italic> mRNA expression in the MBH of <italic>Ugcg</italic><sup>f/f//CamKCreERT2</sup> mice 6 and 9 wk p.i. (<italic>n</italic> = 3–6). Datasets for each time point were acquired individually. Immunofluorescence and image acquisition for each dataset (treated and untreated controls and knockouts) were performed simultaneously. <italic>n</italic> = 3–7 sections; *<italic>p</italic>≤0.05; **<italic>p</italic>≤0.01; ***<italic>p</italic>≤0.001.
