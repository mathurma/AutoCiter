<abstract>
<p>Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), the second most common subtype of lung cancer, is strongly associated with tobacco smoking and exhibits genomic instability. The cellular origins and molecular processes that contribute to SqCC formation are largely unexplored. Here we show that human basal stem cells (BSCs) isolated from heavy smokers proliferate extensively, whereas their alveolar progenitor cell counterparts have limited colony-forming capacity. We demonstrate that this difference arises in part because of the ability of BSCs to repair their DNA more efficiently than alveolar cells following ionizing radiation or chemical-induced DNA damage. Analysis of mice harbouring a mutation in the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a key enzyme in DNA damage repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), indicated that BSCs preferentially repair their DNA by this error-prone process. Interestingly, polyploidy, a phenomenon associated with genetically unstable cells, was only observed in the human BSC subset. Expression signature analysis indicated that BSCs are the likely cells of origin of human SqCC and that high levels of NHEJ genes in SqCC are correlated with increasing genomic instability. Hence, our results favour a model in which heavy smoking promotes proliferation of BSCs, and their predilection for error-prone NHEJ could lead to the high mutagenic burden that culminates in SqCC. Targeting DNA repair processes may therefore have a role in the prevention and therapy of SqCC.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Human lungs are constantly exposed to inhaled chemicals that have the potential to damage cellular DNA. Lung stem cells must therefore have the ability to repair DNA damage to survive and achieve tissue homeostasis. Lung airways are composed of different types of cells, including basal cells, which have been proposed to be the stem cells of the lung. Here, we show that lung basal stem cells have a superior ability to resolve DNA damage compared to alveolar progenitor cells, thus allowing these cells to survive and proliferate after injury. Accordingly, basal stem cells isolated from patients with a long history of tobacco smoking had remarkable proliferative potential compared to those extracted from never smokers. However, we demonstrate that basal stem cells predominately use nonhomologous end joining to repair DNA double-strand breaks, a notoriously error-prone pathway. A subset of polyploid basal stem cells was observed in cigarette-smoking patients, pointing to the accumulation of genetic instability in these long-lived cells. Gene expression analyses revealed that lung squamous cell carcinoma, a subtype of lung cancer that almost exclusively occurs in smokers, carries a transcriptional fingerprint of basal cells, suggesting that lung basal stem cells could be the cells of origin of this subtype of lung cancer. We postulate that further unravelling of DNA repair in lung cells may lead to potential therapeutic targets in the prevention or treatment of lung diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human lungs are constantly exposed to inhaled environmental and chemical insults that have the potential to damage cellular DNA. Lung stem and progenitor cells must be capable of repairing their DNA to maintain healthy survival. The failure of stem cells to repair DNA damage can contribute to tissue loss through damage-induced cell death, whereas unfaithful DNA repair in stem cells may invoke carcinogenesis through the accumulation of genetic aberrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref001">1</xref>]. Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), the second most common histological subtype of lung cancer, exhibits strong genomic instability and occurs almost exclusively in smokers, with 96% of patients having a history of tobacco use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref004">4</xref>]. The carcinogens present in cigarette smoke are likely responsible for the extraordinarily high mutational rate observed in SqCC compared to other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>The early molecular events caused by tobacco exposure and the cell types in which these genetic aberrations occur to induce SqCC formation are not well known. Stem/progenitor cells are putative tumour-initiating cells because of their capacity for renewal and their longevity, allowing for accumulation of genetic lesions. Susceptibility of different lung epithelial progenitor cells to DNA damage has not been explored and could further inform the mechanisms involved in smoking-induced carcinogenesis. DNA damage encompasses alterations to bases, strand cross-links, single-strand breaks (SSBs), and double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs, which have been shown to arise after cigarette smoke exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref007">7</xref>], are the most dangerous type of DNA lesion, as they can result in loss or gain of genetic information through insertions, deletions, or chromosomal translocations. DSB repair occurs through either homologous recombination (HR), a high-fidelity DNA repair mechanism, or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), an unfaithful mechanism that is implicated in genomic instability and tumour formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Different types of lung progenitor cells have been proposed in distinct anatomical regions of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref009">9</xref>]. Lung airways are composed of basal, secretory, ciliated, and neuroendocrine cells. Basal stem cells (BSCs), present only in the human cartilaginous airways or the mouse trachea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref010">10</xref>], are located between the basement membrane and the luminal airway cells and have been proposed as stem cells of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref013">13</xref>]. The alveolar compartment is composed of alveolar type 1 and type 2 (AT1 and AT2) cells. AT2 cells have progenitor activity and can replenish both AT1 and AT2 cells following lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref015">15</xref>], although recent studies suggest that AT1 cells could also serve as progenitors in the mouse lung after pneumonectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref017">17</xref>]. Different cell surface markers have been used to isolate human lung BSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref019">19</xref>], but few markers allowing separation of other lung epithelial cell types have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we used flow cytometry to isolate BSCs, luminal (club, goblet, and ciliated) cells, and AT2 cells from fresh human proximal and distal lung tissue and showed that BSCs and AT2 cells behave as progenitor cells in an in vitro colony-forming assay. BSCs from heavy smokers had an increased proliferative potential compared to those of never smokers, whereas AT2 progenitor activity was diminished in patients with long smoking histories. To investigate this striking difference in lung stem/progenitor cell response to cigarette smoke exposure, we asked if the DNA repair mechanisms differed between the two cell types. DNA damage studies following ionizing radiation or exposure to a chemical agent demonstrated that human and mouse BSCs repair their DNA more efficiently than alveolar progenitor cells using the unfaithful NHEJ pathway, leading to cell survival and proliferation. In addition, polyploidy, a phenomenon occurring during oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref022">22</xref>], was only observed in the BSC subset, indicating that these cells may be more prone to transformation. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that lung SqCCs carry a transcriptional fingerprint of human lung BSCs, suggesting that BSCs may behave as the cells of origin of this subtype of lung cancer. In addition, high expression levels of key NHEJ genes in lung SqCCs are associated with increased genomic instability. Collectively, our data indicate that error-prone DNA repair is a hallmark of lung SqCC and suggest that targeting NHEJ may play a role in SqCC prevention and/or treatment.</p>

<title>Isolation of Epithelial Progenitor Cells in the Human Lung</title>
<p>Fresh human lung samples were obtained from patients undergoing lung cancer surgery and held intact in media until processing. The tissues were collected distally from the tumour sites and subdivided into proximal (containing cartilaginous airways and surrounding parenchyma) and distal (containing distal noncartilaginous airways and surrounding parenchyma) regions. A novel fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) strategy was developed to deplete pre-erythrocytes, fibroblasts, and haematopoietic and endothelial cells from lung cell suspensions. Epithelial cells (EpCAM<sup>+</sup>, epithelial cell adhesion molecule) were then subdivided based on their expression level of CD166 (encoded by <italic>ALCAM</italic>), CD49f (α<sub>6</sub> integrin), and T1α (also known as podoplanin). Three populations were defined in proximal samples: CD49f<sup>hi</sup>T1α<sup>+</sup>CD166<sup>mid</sup> (termed P5), CD49f<sup>mid</sup>T1α<sup>-</sup>CD166<sup>hi</sup> (termed P6), and CD49f<sup>mid</sup>T1α<sup>-</sup>CD166<sup>mid</sup> (termed P10), and two populations in distal samples: CD49f<sup>mid</sup>T1α<sup>-</sup>CD166<sup>hi</sup> (P6) and CD49f<sup>mid</sup>T1α<sup>-</sup>CD166<sup>mid</sup> (termed P10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s001">S1A Fig</xref>).

P5 cells expressed high levels of the basal cell markers <italic>TP63</italic> and keratin 5 (<italic>KRT5</italic>). In contrast, both proximal and distal P6 populations contained cells that exhibited strong expression of markers of club (secretoglobin 1A1, <italic>SCGB1A1)</italic>, goblet (mucin 5AC, <italic>MUC5A</italic>C), and ciliated cells (forkhead box J1, <italic>FOXJ1</italic>; acetylated-tubulin) indicating this subpopulation is enriched in luminal airway cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g001">Fig 1B, 1C and 1D</xref>). The P10 subsets expressed high levels of the AT2 lineage marker surfactant protein C (<italic>SFTPC</italic>). Transmission electron microscopy further showed that the P5 population (referred to as BSC) contained cells with numerous mitochondria and keratin filaments, consistent with a basal cell phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref023">23</xref>] and their exclusive location in the proximal lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g001">Fig 1A and 1E</xref>).

These data establish that the expression of EpCAM, CD49f, CD166, and T1α is sufficient to delineate cellular compartments enriched in BSCs, luminal cells, and AT2 cells in human lung samples.</p>

<title>Human Lung BSCs Are Activated by Cigarette Smoke Exposure</title>
<p>We then assessed the colony-forming capacity of the five cellular subsets described above in a three-dimensional assay. Only BSCs and AT2 cells generated colonies that were phenotypically distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). BSCs formed clonal, hollow, spherical colonies, whilst AT2 colonies were saccular and less uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s001">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). Immunostaining showed that BSC colonies maintain expression of KRT5, whilst AT2 colonies expressed SFTPC, indicating that the cells retain their lineage commitment in this culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Distal AT2 cells had a significantly higher number of colony-forming units (CFUs) than proximal AT2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), suggesting heterogeneity in the AT2 population between proximal and distal lung. We focused on the distal AT2 compartment (named AT2 from now on) because of its increased progenitor activity. Diversity in the basal cell compartment has also been suggested from studies in the mouse trachea, with BSCs and basal progenitor cells possessing different colony-forming capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref024">24</xref>]. Heterogeneity in the BSC population may also exist in the human lung and could explain the variability in BSC CFUs observed in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). To further interrogate the diversity in the colony-forming capacity of BSCs, we investigated the association between patient tobacco-smoking history and the proliferative potential of human lung progenitor cells. Strikingly, BSCs isolated from an exsmoker patient formed numerous large colonies compared to BSCs isolated from a never smoker, which only formed a limited number of small colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Conversely, AT2 cells isolated from an exsmoker had reduced colony-forming capacity compared to AT2 cells from a never smoker that formed multiple large saccular colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Linear correlation analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between years of smoking and the number of BSC CFUs, whereas tobacco exposure was inversely correlated with the number of AT2 cell  CFUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). The number of years since a patient had quit smoking, patient age, and patient sex did not correlate with colony-forming capacity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s002">S2A, S2B and S2C Fig</xref>). These data demonstrate that exposure to cigarette smoke activates lung BSCs yet impairs AT2 cells and that this effect is maintained after smoking cessation.</p>

<title>Human and Mouse BSCs Possess Increased DNA Repair Capacity</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms driving the differential response of AT2 cells and BSCs to cigarette smoking, we performed RNA sequencing on freshly isolated cells from current and exsmokers. Unsupervised clustering showed that each population was molecularly distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Gene ontology analyses revealed that cell cycle and DNA repair genes were up-regulated in BSCs compared to AT2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Human BSCs also expressed high levels of telomere maintenance genes, including <italic>TERT</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), and were found to have longer telomeres than AT2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Given that both active DNA repair and telomere maintenance are properties of stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref026">26</xref>], these findings align with mouse studies and confirm that BSCs have greater stem cell-like characteristics than the AT2 progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref027">27</xref>]. BSCs exhibited up-regulation of key genes that control the activation of DNA repair pathways, including <italic>ATM</italic> (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), suggesting that BSCs may have an enhanced ability to respond to DNA damage. To evaluate the sensitivity of human lung stem and progenitor cells to DNA damage, we subjected fresh human lung tissue to ionizing radiation (IR) and assessed the presence of DSBs over time by immunofluorescence analysis of phosphorylated histone 2AX (γH2AX), an early marker of DSBs. Strong γH2AX staining was observed in both the alveolar and BSC compartment 1 h after IR exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). However, DSBs were resolved in the basal cell compartment 24 h post IR, whereas γH2AX staining was still detected in the alveolar region at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). These results suggest that human BSCs exhibit an increased capacity to repair their DNA following IR compared to alveolar cells.</p>

<p>Given that the transcriptomic analysis and the study of the response to IR were performed on human samples from patients with different smoking histories, we sought to determine whether this striking difference in gene expression profile and DNA damage response of human BSCs and AT2 cells was acquired as a result of chronic cigarette smoke exposure or if it was an inherent property of the cells. Healthy lungs from never smokers are difficult to obtain; hence, we performed RNA-seq transcriptional profiling on mouse tracheal BSCs and lung alveolar cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Gene expression profiles of mouse BSCs and alveolar cells significantly correlated with their human counterparts, indicating that the transcriptome of lung stem/progenitor cells is highly conserved between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Consistent with the human data, we observed that DNA repair genes and cell cycle genes were up-regulated in mouse BSCs compared to alveolar cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), suggesting that both mouse and human lung BSCs may be intrinsically positioned to repair DNA damage. γH2AX immunofluorescence staining of mice subjected to IR revealed that both BSCs and alveolar cells had DSBs 1 h post IR, and this was detected in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). However, γH2AX expression was resolved in BSCs 4 h post IR, whilst it was still strongly detected in the alveolar compartment 24 h after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Similar results were observed when the mice were injected with bleomycin, a DNA-damaging agent known to induce DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref029">29</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The sensitivity of mouse alveolar cells to IR was reflected in increased apoptosis that was not observed in BSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s004">S4D and S4E Fig</xref>). Whilst it is possible that BSCs undergo cell senescence, BSCs proliferated 4 h and 8 h after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), suggesting that senescence in these cells is unlikely. Therefore, lung BSCs have superior DNA repair capabilities leading to cell survival and proliferation that is conserved across species, while alveolar cells exhibit limited DNA repair capacity resulting in DNA damage-induced cell death.</p>

<title>BSCs Use NHEJ to Repair DNA DSBs</title>

Strikingly, DSBs were still detected in tracheas of SCID<sup><italic>prkdc</italic></sup> mice 8 h post IR, whereas DSBs were completely resolved in WT tracheas at this time point, indicating that BSCs use NHEJ to rapidly repair their DNA following damage (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g006">6A</xref>).

<title>BSCs Are the Candidate Cells of Origin of Lung SqCC</title>
<p>Use of the error-prone NHEJ repair pathway has been associated with increased genetic alterations and genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref001">1</xref>].

Additionally, BSCs expressed high levels of <italic>APOBEC</italic> cytidine deaminase genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g007">Fig 7E</xref>), which could explain the APOBEC signature observed in lung SqCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref004">4</xref>]. Interestingly, lung SqCCs express higher levels of DNA repair and cell proliferation genes compared to lung adenocarcinoma, a cancer that arises from lung AT2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s007">S7A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref036">36</xref>].

These data suggest that DNA repair by NHEJ could prove to be a hallmark of lung SqCC. We propose that the use of NHEJ by BSCs could lead to the accumulation of genetic alterations that may culminate in SqCC formation in cigarette-smoking patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g008">Fig 8</xref>), although this hypothesis will need to be validated with functional studies in vivo.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we used a novel combination of cell surface markers to simultaneously isolate distinct human lung epithelial cell populations and observed that lung BSCs have more stem cell-like characteristics than AT2 progenitor cells. BSCs were found to have longer telomeres and a superior ability to repair DSBs compared to AT2 cells. Our study provides new evidence to indicate that adult lung stem cells have developed more efficient DNA repair mechanisms than differentiated cells to promote cell survival and tissue repair. Consistently, haematopoietic stem cells appear more resistant to IR-induced cell death than myeloid progenitors and were found to activate NHEJ to repair their DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref038">38</xref>]. NHEJ has also been proposed as a mechanism for DSB repair in breast and hair follicle bulge stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref040">40</xref>] as a process to evade apoptosis and ensure stem cell longevity.</p>
<p>Cigarette smoke contains a complex mix of carcinogens and toxins that cause DNA damage, including oxidative base damage, the formation of DNA adducts, SSBs, and DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref042">42</xref>]. The observation that lung BSCs have a greater capacity to repair DNA damage compared to alveolar progenitor cells may explain the varied smoking-induced pathologies observed in specific anatomical regions of the lung. Loss of AT2 cells has been identified as a mechanism participating in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema-like diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref044">44</xref>]. Different genetic mutations have been associated with the development of these diseases, including aberrations in telomere maintenance genes, <italic>SFTPC</italic>, <italic>MUC5B</italic>, and alpha-1 anti-trypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref047">47</xref>]. Our data showing that AT2 cells are highly sensitive to DNA damage, leading to increased cell death and reduced colony-forming capacity, suggest a novel molecular mechanism that may participate in tobacco smoking-induced emphysema. They also provide further supporting evidence that epithelial cell dysfunction plays a role in the pathogenesis of degenerative lung diseases. Radiation therapy is frequently used in lung cancer patients yet is often associated with damage of surrounding normal tissue, resulting in reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref048">48</xref>]. Our observation that AT2 progenitor cells have limited DSB repair capacity and increased cell death following IR may also provide insights into the adverse loss of alveolar cells and radiation-induced fibrosis following γ-irradiation.</p>
<p>We observed that BSCs isolated from heavy tobacco users are drastically more proliferative than those from never-smoker patients, which is consistent with the basal cell hyperplasia frequently observed in cigarette smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref049">49</xref>]. Multiple mechanisms most likely account for the activation of BSC proliferation following exposure to tobacco smoke. Firstly, endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to influence the proliferative capacity of lung cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref018">18</xref>], and elevated ROS levels, like those induced by cigarette smoke exposure, could participate in the higher proliferative potential of BSCs observed in smoker patients. Secondly, cigarette smoking damages luminal airway cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref050">50</xref>], and BSCs could be activated to replenish differentiated airway cells. Consistently, studies in mice have shown that depletion of luminal airway cells results in the expansion of BSCs and their differentiation into secretory cells and ciliated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref012">12</xref>]. We propose an additional mechanism by which the enhanced DNA repair capabilities of BSCs promote their proliferation after cigarette smoke exposure and could participate in smoking-induced basal cell hyperplasia.</p>
<p>Our findings provide evidence that BSCs are more proficient than alveolar cells in using NHEJ to repair their DNA. NHEJ has been implicated in the accumulation of genetic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref051">51</xref>] and plays a role in chromothripsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref054">54</xref>]—phenomena that participate in the initiation of tumour formation. Quiescent haematopoietic stem cells use NHEJ and displayed increased genomic instability after irradiation compared to progenitor cells, further implicating NHEJ in oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref038">38</xref>]. We propose the ability of BSCs to rapidly repair DNA through error-prone NHEJ allows the cells to survive longer and places them at greater risk than lung progenitor cells to accumulate mutations, which may ultimately lead to the induction of carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000731.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>
<p>In vivo studies in genetically modified mice have been used to demonstrate the cell of origin of cancer. AT2 cells were found to act as the tumour-initiating cells in K-Ras<sup>G12D</sup>-driven lung adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref036">36</xref>], whilst inactivation of <italic>Tp53</italic> and <italic>Rb</italic> specifically in lung neuroendocrine cells resulted in small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref055">55</xref>]. Based on its anatomical location in the upper airways and the expression of BSC markers, lung SqCC is thought to arise from BSCs. Surprisingly, a recent study in genetically modified mice showed that overexpression of <italic>Sox2</italic> in a <italic>Cdkn2ab/Pten null</italic> background could drive SqCC formation from BSCs, Club cells, or AT2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref056">56</xref>]. It remains to be seen whether multiple cells of origin are observed in other mouse models of lung SqCC, including mice with genetic backgrounds such as <italic>Lkb1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>, <italic>Lkb1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>/Pten</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>, or kinase-dead <italic>Ikkα</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref059">59</xref>]. In addition, such results may not be directly translatable in humans, given that mouse and human cells may not have the same degree of plasticity. Human tumours also carry much more genetic diversity than mouse cancer models, which is particularly relevant in lung cancer given its high levels of genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref004">4</xref>]. To take into account the complexity of human cancers, computational comparison of normal cellular subset gene expression signatures to cancer subtypes has been used to gain insights into the cell of origin of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref061">61</xref>]. Here we show that BSC gene expression signature closely resembles the human SqCC gene signature, suggesting that human lung BSCs are the candidate cells of origin of lung SqCC. An important caveat of such comparisons is the genetic signature of end-stage tumours may not fully represent the origin of the cancer. Our hypothesis will therefore need to be validated by introducing multiple genetic alterations in primary human lung cell subsets and determining their propensity for SqCC formation.</p>
<p>Invasive SqCC develops from preinvasive lesions in tobacco-smoking patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref062">62</xref>]. One-third of patients with basal cell hyperplasia will progress to carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref063">63</xref>]; however, there are currently no biologic biomarkers to predict disease progression. Such biomarkers would greatly inform follow-up monitoring and perhaps enable early detection of invasive lesions. The discovery that BSCs are NHEJ competent and proliferate in response to DNA damage suggests that high levels of DNA-PKcs activation in cigarette smoking-induced basal cell hyperplasia may be a predictor of progression towards malignant disease. Assessment of the correlation between NHEJ activity in basal cell hyperplasia and progression to malignant disease would be necessary to validate this hypothesis. Advanced SqCCs are notoriously resistant to DNA-damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref064">64</xref>]. Our data suggest that patients with strong expression of DNA repair genes such as <italic>PRKDC</italic> may benefit from therapy combining inhibitors of DNA repair and DNA-damaging agents. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of fine-tuned control of DNA repair in stem/progenitor cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents, in which both unfaithful repair and failure to repair contribute to disease pathogenesis.</p>

For human qPCR analyses, cDNA was generated using the SuperScript III system (Life Technologies) and subject to qRT-PCR using the Sensimix SYBR Hi-Rox kit (Bioline) on the Rotorgene RG-6000 (Corbett Research) under standard conditions. Three technical replicates were performed for each sample. Taqman gene expression assays were used for <italic>MUC5AC</italic> (Hs0087365_mH) and <italic>FOXJ1</italic> (HS00230964_m1) using <italic>18S</italic> (HS99999901_s1) or <italic>GAPDH</italic> (HS99999905_m1) as reference genes (Life Technologies). The sequence of the primers is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000731.s008">S1 Table</xref>.</p>

<title>RNA-seq Analysis</title>
<p>Human RNA-seq reads were aligned to the hg19/GRCh37 genome, and mouse reads were aligned to the mm10 genome using Rsubread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref065">65</xref>]. Reads were assigned to Entrez gene IDs using featureCounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref066">66</xref>] and Rsubread’s in-built RefSeq annotation. The raw sequence data and read counts are available from GEO series GSE83492 (human) and GSE83991 (mouse). Filtering and normalization used the edgeR package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref067">67</xref>]. Genes were filtered if their counts per million (CPM) values were above 1 in fewer than three samples for the human data and above 0.2 in fewer than three samples for the mouse data. Library sizes were normalized by the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref068">68</xref>]. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots were produced using edgeR’s plotMDS function with the default settings. Distances between points on the MDS plots represent leading fold change, the root-mean-square log2-fold change for the 500 genes that best distinguish each pair of RNA samples.</p>
<p>Differential expression analyses used the limma package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref069">69</xref>]. Counts were transformed to log2-CPM values with associated precision weights using the voom function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref070">70</xref>]. Gene set tests were performed using roast rotation gene set testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref071">71</xref>]. Signature genes were defined for each normal cell population to be those genes that were consistently either up- or down-regulated in that population versus every other cell population of the same species. Differential expression was assessed for this purpose using limma’s treat function with fold change thresholds varying from 1 to 1.2 and a false discovery rate of 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref072">72</xref>]. Larger fold-change thresholds were used for populations with more signature genes. A log-fold change was associated with each signature gene, being the log2-fold change for that gene between the population for which it is a signature and the next closest population.</p>

<title>CLCGP Microarray Data</title>
<p>Normalized microarray gene expression profiles for 261 lung cancers were downloaded from The Clinical Lung Cancer Genome Project (CLCGP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref033">33</xref>]. Gene symbols were converted to current official symbols with limma’s alias2SymbolTable function. Probes were filtered if their average log expression was in the bottom 50% or if no official symbol could be assigned. When more than one probe associated with the same gene, the probe with the highest average expression was retained. A signature score was computed for each normal lung cell population in each tumour profile: the signature scores were defined as Sum(w<sub>g</sub> y<sub>g</sub>) / Sum(|w<sub>g</sub>|), where y<sub>g</sub> is the log expression of the gene in the tumour and w<sub>g</sub> is the log-fold change of the gene between the normal populations. The sums were taken over all signature genes for the normal population. Signature scores were scaled to be between 0 and 1 for each normal population. Barcode plots were created using limma’s barcodeplot function. Correlation between normal expression signatures and cancer subtypes was assessed using rotation gene set tests, with 9,999 rotations and with the normal cell log-fold changes as gene weights.</p>

<title>TCGA RNA-seq Data</title>
<p>Genewise RNA-seq read counts for 125 lung adenocarcinomas, 224 SqCC, and 54 normal lung samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project were obtained from GEO series GSE62944 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref073">73</xref>]. Genes were filtered if they failed to achieve 0.1 CPM in at least 54 samples. TMM normalization was applied, and differential expression between the cancer subtypes and normal samples was assessed using limma-voom and moderated <italic>t</italic> tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref070">70</xref>]. The proportion of the genome altered for each of the lung SqCCs (derived from somatic copy number information) was downloaded from the TCGA data portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://cancergenome.nih.gov</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Measurement of Telomere Length</title>
<p>Telomere lengths were determined as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000731.ref074">74</xref>]. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from snap-frozen FACS sorted human lung epithelial pellets or from 293T (ATCC) snap-frozen cell pellets using an Illustra Tissue and Cells GenomicPrep kit (GE Healthcare). The mastermix contained Sybr green I (0.75X, Life Technologies), AmpliTaq Gold (0.625 U, Life Technologies), Buffer II (1X, Life Technologies), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (3 mM, Ambion), DTT (1 mM, Ambion), betaine (1 M, Sigma Aldrich), dNTPs (0.2 mM, Life Technologies), albumin primers (900 mM, IDT), and telomere primers (900 mM, IDT). The master mix was combined with 20 ng of experimental DNA and analysed in triplicate alongside a four-point 293T standard curve (50 to 1.85 ng of DNA) using albumin as the single-copy gene. PCR was performed on a Rotorgene RG-6000 using the following conditions: (15 min, 95°C) x 1, (15 s, 94°C − 15 s, 49°C) x 2, (15 s, 94°C − 10 s, 62°C −15 s, 74°C − 10 s, 84°C − 15 s, 88°C) x 32. Telomere lengths were calculated by determining the ratio of telomere signal (T) to single-copy gene signal (S) as determined from the 293T standard curve.</p>
