        <p>By analyzing cellular and molecular changes in key cell populations in the tailbud during embryogenesis, this work uncovers critical signaling events that determine vertebrate body length.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The endogenous mechanism that determines vertebrate body length is unknown but must involve loss of chordo-neural-hinge (CNH)/axial stem cells and mesoderm progenitors in the tailbud. In early embryos, Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) maintains a cell pool that progressively generates the body and differentiation onset is driven by retinoid repression of FGF signalling. This raises the possibility that FGF maintains key tailbud cell populations and that rising retinoid activity underlies cessation of body axis elongation. Here we show that sudden loss of the mesodermal gene (Brachyury) from CNH and the mesoderm progenitor domain correlates with FGF signalling decline in the late chick tailbud. This is accompanied by expansion of neural gene expression and a similar change in cell fate markers is apparent in the human tailbud. Fate mapping of chick tailbud further revealed that spread of neural gene expression results from continued ingression of CNH-derived cells into the position of the mesoderm progenitor domain. Using gain and loss of function approaches in vitro and in vivo, we then show that attenuation of FGF/Erk signalling mediates this loss of Brachyury upstream of Wnt signalling, while high-level FGF maintains Brachyury and can induce ectopic CNH-like cell foci. We further demonstrate a rise in endogenous retinoid signalling in the tailbud and show that here FGF no longer opposes retinoid synthesis and activity. Furthermore, reduction of retinoid signalling at late stages elevated FGF activity and ectopically maintained mesodermal gene expression, implicating endogenous retinoid signalling in loss of mesoderm identity. Finally, axis termination is concluded by local cell death, which is reduced by blocking retinoid signalling, but involves an FGFR-independent mechanism. We propose that cessation of body elongation involves loss of FGF-dependent mesoderm identity in late stage tailbud and provide evidence that rising endogenous retinoid activity mediates this step and ultimately promotes cell death in chick tailbud.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The mechanism that determines body length is unknown but likely operates at the elongating tail end of vertebrate embryos. In the early embryo, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling maintains a proliferative pool of cells in the tailbud that progressively generates the body. It also protects these cells from the differentiating influence of retinoic acid, which is produced by the maturing mesoderm tissues of the extending body. We show here, in the chick embryo, that the “endgame”—that is, the termination of body axis elongation—comes when the mesodermal gene brachyury is suddenly lost from axial stem cell population and presumptive mesoderm cells in the tailbud late in development. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that this step is mediated by loss of FGF signalling. We present evidence that this is due to rising retinoid signalling in the tailbud and that FGF signalling in the tailbud no longer opposes retinoid synthesis and activity. Finally, we reveal that these events are followed by local cell death in the tailbud, which can be reduced by the attenuation of retinoid signalling but involves a mechanism that is independent of FGF signalling via its usual receptor. We propose that cessation of body elongation involves loss of FGF-dependent mesoderm identity in the late tailbud and that this is mediated by rising endogenous retinoid activity, which ultimately promotes cell death in the chick tailbud.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cells located in the tailbud of the vertebrate embryo generate the body progressively. These cell populations include axial stem cells in the chordoneural hinge (CNH, classically defined as caudal-most ventral neural tissue and distal notochord) that contribute to notochord, somites, and ventral neural tube in a self-renewing manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Catala1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Tzouanacou1">[3]</xref> and more caudally located somitic mesoderm progenitors, which have a limited self-renewing ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Cambray1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-McGrew1">[5]</xref>. Extrinsic signals, including Wnt and FGF, are required for continued body axis elongation in the early embryo (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Wilson1">[2]</xref>), and this process relies on the regulated differentiation of newly generated cells as they exit the tail end. At a specific point, however, body axis elongation ceases and this must involve the regulated differentiation and/or loss of axial stem and mesoderm progenitor cells.</p>

      <p>Changes in a number of signalling pathways can induce axial truncations in the early embryo, although how they act on specific cell populations in the later forming tailbud has not been explored. Exposure to exogenous retinoic acid (RA) can arrest body elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Murakami1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Kessel1">[7]</xref> by inhibiting expression of <italic>Wnt3a</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Kessel1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Takada1">[9]</xref>. A critical level of bone morphogenetic protein signalling is also required for normal axis elongation; loss of the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist Noggin or Noggin overexpression both generate a truncation phenotype, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Wilson1">[2]</xref>. Loss of FGF signalling also leads to body axis truncation at early, pre-tailbud stages, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Wilson1">[2]</xref>. Importantly, Wnt3a is required for maintenance of <italic>Fgf8</italic> in the caudal regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Aulehla1">[10]</xref>, and this regulatory relationship provides a link from Wnt signalling to mechanisms that protect tail-end cells from endogenous RA, all of which in higher vertebrates are, so far, downstream consequences of FGF signalling. FGF signals maintain expression of <italic>Cyp26A</italic> (which catabolises RA) in the tail end, repress expression of the retinoic acid receptor <italic>RARß</italic> in the neuroepithelium, and critically inhibit expression of the retinoid synthesising enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (<italic>Raldh2)</italic> in the forming somites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-DiezdelCorral1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Wahl1">[13]</xref>. At early stages while FGF signalling antagonises the RA pathway, RA in turn drives differentiation in neural and mesodermal tissues by inhibiting expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-DiezdelCorral1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Stavridis1">[14]</xref>. However, while cells generated at the tail end continue to experience sequentially FGF and then retinoid signalling as they leave this region, it is not known whether this mutual antagonism between these signalling pathways is maintained throughout development. Indeed, it is clear that as the body axis elongates in chick and mouse, the presomitic mesoderm initially gets longer, separating FGF and RA signalling centres, but then shortens following tailbud formation. The tailbud forms after about half the body axis has been generated, from the remnants of the primitive streak and adjacent epiblast or stem zone, and in the chick generates body axis tissues from the level of somites 27–26 to ∼52 and in mouse from somite 35 to ∼65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Sanders1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Gomez1">[16]</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Wilson1">[2]</xref>). So although established in early embryo, it has yet to be determined whether FGF still represses <italic>Raldh2</italic> at tailbud stages or if RA can still inhibit expression of Fgf ligands and, as somite formation nears the tailbud, finally overwhelm FGF signalling to arrest axis elongation. A further indication that this may be the case is the recent observation that <italic>Raldh2</italic> appears in a new domain within the tailbud itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Tenin1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mutation of several transcription factors also truncates the body axis. These include Cdx and Hox genes that are part of a positive regulatory loop with FGF and Wnt signalling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Young1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Naiche1">[22]</xref>. The T-box factor, Brachyury (<italic>Bra</italic>) or T also controls body axis elongation as indicated by the T-mouse mutant phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-DobrovolskaiaZavadskaia1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Herrmann1">[24]</xref>. In zebrafish, retinoic acid represses Bra/Ntl, which normally protects mesoderm progenitors in the tailbud from retinoid signalling by inducing expression of <italic>Cyp26a</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Martin1">[25]</xref>. However, it is not clear that these regulatory relationships are conserved in higher vertebrates, as caudal <italic>Cyp26a</italic> expression is dependent on FGF signalling in chick and mouse embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Wahl1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Reijntjes1">[26]</xref>, while in zebrafish neither <italic>Cyp26a</italic> nor <italic>Bra/Ntl</italic> require FGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Martin1">[25]</xref>. It is also worth noting that different enhancers control the expression of <italic>Bra</italic> in distinct domains in the notochord and paraxial mesoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Yamaguchi1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Harvey1">[28]</xref> and that little is known about how <italic>Bra</italic> expression is regulated in distinct cell populations within the mature tailbud nor how these might be influenced by retinoid signalling.</p>
      <p>Exogenous RA and loss of <italic>Wnt3a</italic> can induce programmed cell death in the tailbud, however such signalling events do not always elicit apoptosis when the body axis is truncated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Young1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-AbuAbed1">[29]</xref>. It is not known whether endogenous RA signalling acts in the tailbud by promoting programmed cell death nor if this takes place in specific cell populations at key times within the maturing tailbud. Intriguingly, an imbalance of retinoid, Wnt3a, or FGF signalling can also alter the neural versus mesodermal cell fate decision in caudal regions of the early embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Shum1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Takada1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-AbuAbed1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Martin2">[34]</xref>. Rising endogenous RA activity in the late tailbud might therefore act by altering signals that maintain the axial stem cell niche and/or mesoderm progenitors, resulting in loss of multipotency and diversion towards neural fate.</p>
      <p>Although many gene regulatory relationships are conserved between vertebrate embryos, the development of caudal-most structures seems to differ; in humans, this appears to be closest to that observed in the chick embryo: both undergo secondary neurulation and caudal regression and lack the extended tail characteristic of the mouse. Indeed, recent work has shown that the chick but not the mouse tailbud is an endogenous source of RA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Tenin1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Cunningham1">[35]</xref>, raising the possibility that distinct mechanisms may operate in different species. Here we address the mechanism of body axis termination in the chick by tracking FGF and retinoid signalling dynamics in specific tailbud cell populations and correlate this with cell movements and cell specification changes as elongation ceases. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches we demonstrate that continued generation of mesoderm along the body axis, as indicated by Brachyury expression, depends on FGF signalling and show that it is attenuated by rising retinoid signalling, which also eventually promotes cell death.</p>

        <title>Loss of Mesodermal and Spread of Neural Gene Expression in the Late Tailbud</title>
        <p>In the early embryo, FGF activity is required to promote mesodermal over neural cell fate, and so declining FGF signalling might cause body axis elongation to cease if normal cell fate specification is lost in the tailbud. To examine whether cell fates change in specific cell populations in the maturing tailbud, we analysed expression of two key marker genes in detail. Strikingly, the neural progenitor marker <italic>Sox2</italic> was found to expand into the positionally defined mesodermal progenitor domain between HH22–24, separating the distal swelling of the notochord from the mesoderm progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2A–2C′</xref>) (<italic>Sox2</italic> is also detected in the remnant of the tail gut at HH20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s001">Figure S1</xref>), but is lost as this cell population degenerates by HH22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Miller1">[38]</xref>). Concomitant with expansion of the <italic>Sox2</italic> domain, transcripts of the early mesoderm marker <italic>Bra</italic> were lost from the position of the medial mesoderm progenitors, which surround the notochord tip (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2B′ and 2F′</xref>). In addition, <italic>Bra</italic> was downregulated in the CNH (both the distal notochord swelling and caudal-most ventral neural tube) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2F–2H′</xref>). This dramatic local change in gene expression correlates with the loss of the morphologically defined contiguous notochord/CNH (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2E′, 2F′</xref>). These observations suggest that the axial stem cell population of the CNH and the “mesodermal progenitors” in the tailbud lose their mesoderm potential coincident with cessation of segmentation at HH24. At later stages, the broadened <italic>Sox2</italic>-expressing domain then differentiated into a multi-lumen neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2I–2I″</xref>).</p>

The mesoderm progenitor marker <italic>Brachyury</italic> (<italic>Bra</italic>) is expressed in notochord, CNH, and caudal presomitic mesoderm at HH22. Expression is lost from the distal notochord/CNH (* in E′ and F′) and from neural CNH and mesoderm progenitors (arrows in E′ and F′) from HH24–27 analysed in wholemount (E–H) and in medial saggital sections (E′–H′). Transverse sections from rostral to caudal through HH26–27 tailbud showing termination in <italic>Sox2</italic>-expressing tissue with multiple lumens (I–I″). Immunocytochemistry for Sox2 and Bra in chick tailbuds at HH22 (J–J″). Overlap of Sox2 and Bra is confined to the neural-CNH (white dashed line), and Bra domain is continuous between notochord and CNH and mesoderm progenitors (indicated by * marking distal notochord). At HH24 (K–K″), Bra is lost from distal notochord (*) and surrounding medial mesoderm progenitors, as well as the neural CNH (which is reduced in size; white dashed line), while Sox2-expressing cells are now located between the notochord and CNH and in the “mesoderm progenitor” domain at HH26. (L–L″) Bra is detected at the caudo-lateral edge of the mesoderm progenitor domain, and the Sox2/Bra-expressing CNH is reduced still further (white dashed line).

        <p>This critical change in gene expression was further assessed at the protein level by analysis of double immunocytochemistry for Bra and Sox2 at HH22, HH24, and HH26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2J–L″</xref>). This revealed a sharp loss of Bra protein in the distal notochord tip and surrounding cells in the position of mesoderm progenitors (asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2J′, 2K′</xref>) and a reduction in Bra in the neural CNH (defined by Sox2/Bra co-expressing cells continuous with the caudal-most neural tube), which progressively diminishes from HH24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2J″–L″</xref>). In addition, in the positionally defined mesoderm progenitor domain, Sox2 positive cells (white arrows in Figure K, K″) were also apparent as well as some Sox2/Bra co-expressing cells (which here may reflect a transitional cell state as Bra is lost in this cell population).</p>
        <p>Importantly, analysis of these proteins in serial sections of the human tailbud at Carnegie Stage (CS) 12 (26–30 days, 21–29 somites, equivalent to early tailbud HH18 in terms of somite number) (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and at CS16 (37–42 days, 38–39 somites; corresponds to the end of axis elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-ORahilly1">[39]</xref> equivalent to HH26/27) (<italic>n</italic> = 1) revealed a similar loss of CNH (Sox2/Bra cell population) and of Bra expression as this tailbud matures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2M–N′</xref>). At CS12 Sox2 was detected at high levels in neural tube, but also in an adjacent discrete cell group that co-expresses Bra, which may be equivalent to the CNH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2M, 2M′</xref>). Bra was also detected at high levels in notochord at CS12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g004">Figure 4M′</xref>). Analysis of serial sections through the later CS16 human tailbud revealed that by the end of somitogenesis this was capped at its terminal end by Sox2 expressing neuroepithelium and Bra was now confined to the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g002">Figure 2N, 2N′</xref>). These observations indicate that arrest of body axis elongation in chick and human is characterised by loss of Bra expression in the tailbud, leaving terminal cells with a neural character.</p>

        <title>Fate Mapping the Late Tailbud Demonstrates Continued Cell Ingression from the CNH</title>
        <p>To understand the contribution that cell movement might make to these changing patterns of gene expression, a series of fate mapping studies were carried out in the tailbud in ovo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). DiI was used to label focal groups of ∼20–40 cells in the caudal-most neural tube, the “neural CNH,” or the mesoderm progenitor domain at HH20 (local labelling was confirmed by observation in the whole embryo, and to ensure accurate labelling, a subset of embryos were fixed immediately and sectioned to define position of DiI labelled cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g003">Figure 3B–3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001415-t001">Table 1</xref>). After 30 h incubation (to HH24/25), neural tube cells were found to contribute only to neural tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g003">Figure 3B′–3B′″</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001415-t001">Table 1</xref>), while cells in the CNH contribute to neural tissue and the positionally defined mesoderm progenitor domain, presomitic mesoderm, and somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g003">Figure 3C–3C′″</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001415-t001">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that at least some of the Sox2 positive cells that appear in this “mesoderm progenitor” territory at HH24 are derived from the CNH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g003">Figure 3C′″</xref>). We also wished to ascertain whether cells present in the <italic>Bra</italic> positive mesoderm progenitor domain at HH20 (prior to the appearance of Sox2 here at HH24) later come to express Sox2. Mesoderm progenitors labelled at HH20 were therefore assessed for Sox2 expression at HH24. However, the majority of DiI-labelled cells left the mesoderm progenitor domain and contributed to pre-somitic, somitic, and/or more lateral mesoderm, and few remaining cells were in the new Sox2 expressing domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g003">Figure 3D′″</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001415-t001">Table 1</xref>). These data (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) therefore suggest that Sox2 expansion into the tailbud core is due to maintenance of this gene and loss of <italic>Bra</italic> in cells that have recently ingressed from the CNH.</p>

To test whether decline in FGF signalling underlies this striking change, FGF signalling was blocked in HH19–22 tailbuds using the Fgf receptor inhibitor PD173074 or the Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) antagonist PD184352, which blocks downstream Erk1/2 activity.

        <p>Finally, grafting an FGF4 delivering bead into the HH20–22 tailbud induced ectopic expression of <italic>Bra</italic> (BSA bead control <italic>n</italic> = 0/7; FGF4 beads <italic>n</italic> = 4/6 embryos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g004">Figure 4F–4F″″</xref>).

This initially surprising result may reflect the regulation of <italic>Sox2</italic> by distinct enhancer elements active around the organiser region (N1) and in the developing spinal cord (N4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Uchikawa1">[41]</xref>; expansion of <italic>Sox2</italic> expression on FGF inhibition (results above) may be indicative of spinal cord differentiation via N4 activity, while induction of <italic>Sox2</italic> by high-level FGF may reflect the N1 element, which is FGF/Wnt responsive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Takemoto2">[42]</xref> and might be indicative of formation of an ectopic CNH.</p>
        <p>To address if a CNH-like state is induced, we determined whether FGF-induced ectopic Sox2 positive cells co-express Bra, as observed in the endogenous CNH. In most cases, ectopic co-expression was detected, suggesting that these cells have CNH character (BSA <italic>n</italic> = 0/4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g004">Figure 4H–4H′</xref>; FGF4 <italic>n</italic> = 4/6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g004">Figure 4I–4I′</xref>). Some of the ectopic Sox2/Bra cells formed small groups, but we also detected strong Sox2 expression in Bra positive cells in mesoderm progenitor domain/presomitic mesoderm in tails with FGF beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g004">Figure 4I–4I′″</xref>). In 3/6 embryos, ectopic Sox2/Bra foci exhibited a polarised configuration, being flanked at either end by Sox2 or Bra only expressing cells, reminiscent of tissue organisation around the endogenous CNH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g004">Figure 4I′–4I′″</xref>). Together these findings (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g004">Figure 4J</xref>) therefore suggest that maintenance of mesoderm progenitors and the CNH depends on FGF/Erk signalling and that reduction of such signalling leads to neural differentiation in the tailbud, while high-level FGF activity can promote a CNH-like cell state.</p>

        <p>As FGF signalling is attenuated by RA provided by somites in the early embryo, we next tested whether the RA synthesising enzyme <italic>Raldh2</italic> continues to be expressed in somites throughout body axis elongation and if expression of RA signalling pathway genes alter in the tailbud.

        <title>Analysis of RA Activity in the Maturing Tailbud</title>
        <p>To assess the pattern of retinoid activity, we first analysed the expression of <italic>RARβ</italic> (a canonical Direct Repeat (DR)5 RARE (Retinoic Acid Response Element)–driven gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-deThe1">[43]</xref>).

As <italic>Raldh2</italic> is expressed in the tailbud at this time, these observations support the possibility that the <italic>RARβ</italic> (DR5) RARE does not reveal all sites of retinoid activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Rossant1">[44]</xref>. We therefore analysed expression of a gene with different RARE elements, as these might be recognised by distinct combinations of RAR/RXRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Bastien1">[45]</xref>. <italic>Cellular retinoic acid binding protein</italic> (<italic>Crabp2</italic>) is an established RA target and its transcription is trans-activated by RARE1 and RARE2 DR motifs that are separated by one (DR1) and two (DR2) base pairs, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-deThe1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Bastien1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Durand1">[46]</xref>.

From HH15/16, <italic>Crabp2</italic> transcripts are detected at low levels in the tailbud (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s003">S3A</xref>′), and detailed analysis from HH19/20 to HH26 revealed that <italic>Crabp2</italic> then steadily encroaches on mesoderm progenitors and the CNH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g005">Figure 5I–5L″″</xref>): at HH19–22 <italic>Crabp2</italic> is absent from the CNH but detected in mesoderm progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g005">Figure 5I′–5J″″</xref>); by HH24, <italic>Crabp2</italic> is detected in neural/CNH (ventral caudal-most neural tube) and surrounding medial-most mesoderm progenitors, but not the distal-notochord portion of the CNH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g005">Figure 5K′–5K″″</xref>); by HH26, a small group of <italic>Crabp2</italic>-expressing cells are then detected in the now abrupt distal end of the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g005">Figure 5L–5L″</xref>), while transverse sections through the tail tip at this stage confirmed the multi-lumen nature of the terminating neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g005">Figure 5L′″, 5L″″</xref>). These expression patterns correlate well with onset of <italic>Raldh2</italic> and downregulation of <italic>Cyp26a</italic> at HH22–24 and indicate an increase in retinoid signalling in key cell populations of the maturing tailbud (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g005">Figure 5M</xref>).</p>
        <p>Although <italic>Crabp2</italic> is an established RA target in cultured cells, this has not been demonstrated in the embryo. To test this, RA-delivering beads were implanted between the caudal lateral epiblast/stem zone and presomitic mesoderm in HH9–10 chick embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g005">Figure 5N</xref>). RA upregulated <italic>Crabp2</italic> expression at the tail-end (<italic>n</italic> = 4/5) compared to control DMSO beads (<italic>n</italic> = 0/5), assessed after 16 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g005">Figure 5N′–5N″</xref>). In addition, tailbuds at HH20/22 treated with 100 nM RA for 24 h in vitro also demonstrated increased <italic>Crabp2</italic> expression in comparison with DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s003">Figure S3B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s003">S3B</xref>′). To determine whether <italic>Crabp2</italic> transcription depends on RA signalling, <italic>Crabp2</italic> expression was next assessed in Vitamin-A-deficient quail embryos. <italic>Crabp2</italic> transcripts were much reduced in VAD quails (<italic>n</italic> = 3/3) compared to normal quails fixed and processed in parallel (<italic>n</italic> = 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g005">Figure 5O–5O′</xref>). To specifically test the requirement for RA for <italic>Crabp2</italic> expression in the tailbud, retinoid signalling was blocked using RAR/RXR antagonists; this leads to <italic>Crabp2</italic> repression in 9/12 explant pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g005">Figure 5P–5P″</xref>). In addition, tailbud explants were treated with the RA synthesis inhibitor disulfiram, and RAR/RXR antagonist delivering beads were transplanted into the HH20/21 tailbud in vivo, and in both conditions <italic>Crabp2</italic> expression was reduced compared with DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s003">Figure S3C, S3C</xref>′, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s003">S3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s003">S3</xref>D′). These data demonstrate that <italic>Crabp2</italic> provides an alternative, D1/D2–RARE-mediated reporter for retinoid signalling in vivo and that it reports increasing RA activity in the tailbud.</p>

        <title>Fgfs Are Repressed by RA and FGF Represses Somitic <italic>Raldh2</italic> During Axis Elongation</title>
        <p>From the early tailbud (∼HH22) <italic>Crabp2</italic> overlaps with Fgf-responding domains, raising the question of whether FGF and RA signalling maintain their mutually inhibitory interactions in the tailbud. To test the regulatory relationships between these two pathways, we first exposed the prospective tailbud region at HH9–10 to exogenous RA delivered locally on a bead in vivo. This led to loss of <italic>Fgf8</italic> and truncation of the body axis (RA beads <italic>n</italic> = 8/9, DMSO beads <italic>n</italic> = 0/5 embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g006">Figure 6A, 6B</xref>). To address the effects of RA on tailbuds at later stages we explanted and cultured tails from HH16 chick embryos for 24 h in DMSO with or without RA. In all cases, while control (DMSO exposed) tissue maintained <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression (<italic>n</italic> = 6), RA-treated tailbuds all lost <italic>Fgf8</italic> transcripts (<italic>n</italic> = 6/6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g006">Figure 6C–D′</xref>). To determine whether RA retains the ability to repress FGF signalling, RA was administered to HH19–22 tailbuds. After 24 h, <italic>Fgf8</italic> and <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression were still detected in control explants (<italic>n</italic> = 9 and <italic>n</italic> = 8, respectively), but in the presence of high (10 µM) or low (100 nM) RA, both these genes were repressed (<italic>Fgf8</italic> 10 µM, <italic>n</italic> = 9/10; <italic>Fgf8</italic> 100 nM, <italic>n</italic> = 3/4; <italic>Fgf4</italic> 10 µM, <italic>n</italic> = 8/8; <italic>Fgf4</italic> 100 nM, <italic>n</italic> = 3/4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g006">Figure 6E–G′</xref>).

Consistent with this, we find that treatment of HH19–22 tailbuds with RA (100 nM) for 24 h abolishes expression of <italic>Spry2</italic> and additionally leads to loss of <italic>Bra</italic>, caudal expansion of <italic>Sox2</italic>, and also attenuation of <italic>Tbx6L</italic> in the mesoderm progenitor domain of the tailbud (<italic>Spry2</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 0/4, RA <italic>n</italic> = 4/4 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7A–7A″</xref>]; <italic>Bra</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 2/11; RA <italic>n</italic> = 8/14 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7B–7B′</xref>]; <italic>Sox2</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 2/16, RA <italic>n</italic> = 12/17 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7C–7C′</xref>]; <italic>Tbx6L</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 0/7, RA <italic>n</italic> = 7/9 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7D–7D′</xref>]). To test the requirement for endogenous retinoid signalling specifically in the tailbud, we further treated tailbuds with the RA synthesis inhibitor disulfiram, which reduced <italic>Crabp2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s003">Figure S3B, S3B</xref>′). This led to expansion of <italic>Spry2</italic> and <italic>Bra</italic> expression in the region of the mesoderm progenitor domain (<italic>Spry2</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 0/4, disulfiram <italic>n</italic> = 4/4 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7A′, 7A″</xref>]; <italic>Bra</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 0/6, disulfiram <italic>n</italic> = 9/11 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7B, 7B″</xref>]), while <italic>Sox2</italic> expression was reduced caudally (<italic>Sox2</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 0/11, disulfiram <italic>n</italic> = 10/13 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7C, 7C″</xref>]), and <italic>Tbx6L</italic> remained strongly expressed, but did not consistently expand its domain in this timeframe (<italic>Tbx6L</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 4/4, disulfiram <italic>n</italic> = 4/4 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7D, 7D″</xref>]). These findings suggest that levels of endogenous RA determine FGF activity and subsequent neural versus mesoderm cell fate choice in the mesoderm progenitor domain of the tailbud.</p>

        <p>To test whether endogenous RA activity mediates this step in an in vivo context, Vitamin A–deficient (VAD) quail embryos were examined at early tailbud stages HH14–15; retinoid deficiency is embryonic lethal due to heart defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Kostetskii1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Niederreither1">[53]</xref>, and this was the latest stage at which such embryos were readily available. These embryos exhibit ectopic dorsal domains of <italic>Bra</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> within the neural tube in the caudal-most region (<italic>n</italic> = 0/4 normal quails, <italic>n</italic> = 5/6 VAD quails, <italic>Bra</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7E–7F′</xref>]; and <italic>n</italic> = 0/5 normal quails, <italic>n</italic> = 4/4 VAD quails, <italic>Fgf8</italic>, [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7G–7H′</xref>]). <italic>Sox2</italic> expression was detected throughout the neural tube in normal quails (<italic>n</italic> = 4), while asymmetric reduction was observed in the dorsal neural tube of some VAD embryos (<italic>n</italic> = 2/4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7I–7J′</xref>). These findings indicate that endogenous RA signalling is required for the correct assignment of neural and mesodermal cell fates and for the normal downregulation of <italic>Fgf8</italic> in the early tailbud. To test the continued involvement of retinoid signalling at the latest tailbud stages in vivo, we then grafted beads soaked in RAR/RXR antagonists into the tailbud at HH20–21 and cultured them for a further 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7K</xref>). We first confirmed that delivery of these antagonists in vivo reduced expression of <italic>Crabp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s003">Figure S3D, S3D</xref>′) (and in more rostral regions <italic>RARb</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 0/7, RAR/RXR antagonists <italic>n</italic> = 5/6; unpublished data). We then ascertained that blocking RA signalling in this context lead to increased FGF signalling as indicated by levels of <italic>Spry2</italic> (<italic>Spry2</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 1/5; RAR/RXR, <italic>n</italic> = 6/6 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7L, 7L′</xref>]) and to ectopic expression of <italic>Bra</italic> in the tailbud (<italic>Bra</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 0/8; RAR/RXR <italic>n</italic> = 3/6 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7M–7M′</xref>]). In addition, <italic>Bra</italic> was also ectopically maintained by exposure to RAR antagonist alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s004">Figure S4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s004">S4B</xref>′) controlling for potential effects on heterodimers formed by RXRs with receptors unrelated to retinoid signalling. These antagonists did not, however, elicit a consistent change in <italic>Sox2</italic> expression (<italic>Sox2</italic>, DMSO <italic>n</italic> = 6; RAR/RXR <italic>n</italic> = 5 cases [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g007">Figure 7N–7N′</xref>]), which may reflect maintenance rather than excess levels of FGF signalling in this condition. In conclusion, in all three assays, VAD embryos, tailbuds explanted and treated with disulfiram or exposed to RAR/RXR antagonists in vivo, retinoid deficiency lead to ectopic maintenance of FGF signalling and <italic>Brachyury</italic> expression, supporting a role for endogenous retinoid activity in the loss of FGF signalling and mesodermal cell fate assignment at the end of axis elongation.</p>

        <title>Endogenous Retinoid Signalling Promotes Cell Death Via an FGF-Independent Mechanism</title>

The precise timing of apoptosis in individual cells varies within a given tissue, and so TUNEL labelled cells were examined in at least five embryos at each stage to establish the prevailing cell death pattern. Apoptotic cells were detected in the chick-primitive streak from HH10 (unpublished data; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), however only from HH24 in the chick were dying cells present in the CNH and mesoderm progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g008">Figure 8B–8C′″</xref>). Dying cells were then detected intensely throughout the tailbud tip by HH26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g008">Figure 8D–8E′″</xref>).

        <p>Previous studies have shown that exposure to excess RA can promote cell death in the tailbud, and this was confirmed by RA treatment of tailbud explants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s005">Figure S5A, S5A</xref>′). To investigate whether endogenous retinoid signalling normally regulates cell death, chick tailbuds explanted at HH20–22 were exposed to RAR/RXR inhibitors for 24 h. This revealed a reduction in cell death around and within the CNH (0/8 DMSO; 6/8 RAR/RXR antagonist treated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g008">Figure 8F–8H″</xref>). Although exposure to exogenous FGF8 reduced cell death in explanted tailbud pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s006">Figure S6A, S6A</xref>′), inhibition of FGFR signalling with PD173074 did not increase cell death in comparison with DMSO controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001415.s006">Figure S6B, S6B</xref>′). These findings show that during normal development apoptosis is only widespread after loss of <italic>Bra</italic> in neural CNH and mesoderm progenitors and <italic>Sox2</italic> expansion in this tissue and suggest that rising endogenous retinoid signalling can promote cell death in the chick tailbud via an FGF-independent mechanism.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study provides a detailed account of the cellular and molecular changes in the chordo-neural-hinge and mesoderm progenitors in the chick tailbud that underlie the normal process of body axis termination. It reveals a critical loss of mesodermal cell identity in these cell populations in the late tailbud and shows that this is due to a decline in FGFR/Erk signalling, high levels of which can promote a CNH-like cell state. We provide evidence that rising endogenous Retinoid signalling mediates FGF signalling loss and regulates the survival of CNH/axial stem cells and their tailbud derivatives.</p>
      <p>Fate maps of the tailbud made with chick/quail chimeras or GFP expressing cells at stage HH15 (25 somites) have shown that medially located cells defined as CNH can still give rise to both neural and mesodermal derivatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Catala1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-McGrew1">[5]</xref>. In agreement, we observe that later at HH22 cells located in the equivalent region express both <italic>Bra</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic>. Moreover, our data reveal a striking loss of the mesodermal gene <italic>Brachyury</italic> specifically in the neural and notochord portions of the CNH and in cells located in the mesoderm progenitor domain. This is accompanied by an expansion of the neural progenitor marker Sox2 into this “mesoderm progenitor” territory in the late (HH24) chick tailbud. Importantly, we show that the neural and notochord CNH persist and remain contiguous with the mesoderm progenitor domain at HH22 (∼44 somite stage) and that cells continue to ingress from the neural CNH into the tailbud at stages leading up to HH24. These findings therefore indicate that the conditions for cessation of body axis elongation arise discretely in the late tailbud and coincide with the end of segmentation at HH24.</p>
      <p>This cell state change is coincident with FGF signalling decline in these cell populations, and we demonstrate that blocking FGF/Erk signalling precisely mimics this step, specifically repressing <italic>Bra</italic> in the CNH and mesoderm progenitors and leading to caudal expansion of the <italic>Sox2</italic> expression domain. Consistent with this role for FGF signalling, a recent report analysing the spectrum of phenotypes for human syndromes generated by heterozygous constitutive activation of FGFR2 (Pfeiffer, Crouzon, and Beare-Stevenson syndromes) included an ectopic “caudal appendage” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Sureka1">[56]</xref>, suggesting conservation in humans of a mechanism that attenuates FGFR signalling for normal cessation of body axis elongation. Our finding that the maturing human tailbud also exhibits loss of Bra and terminates in a Sox2-expressing neural structure further supports conservation of the role of FGF in determining cell fates at the end of body axis elongation.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, human tails with activated FGFR2 have a variable form, with or without vertebrae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Sureka1">[56]</xref>, indicating that excess FGF signalling can generate ectopic and disorganised tail end structures. This phenotype may depend on the level of FGF activity and relate to our finding of ectopic CNH-like cells co-expressing Bra and Sox2 in response to high-level FGF delivered by beads. Our gain- and loss-of-FGF-function experiments indicate that while loss of FGF promotes neural differentiation, FGF maintains mesoderm progenitors and even higher levels may then promote the axial stem cell state of the CNH. The effects of elevated FGF and Wnt signalling may also explain the large club-end truncation phenotype of Cdx2 mis-expressing mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Gaunt1">[57]</xref> as Cdx genes are upstream of these pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Young1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Savory1">[19]</xref>, which need to be downregulated for segmentation and differentiation in the body axis. Similarly, long-term loss of RA (leading to maintenance of FGF) in the tailbud is not predicted to lead to an ever-lengthening body axis, because RA is also required for subsequent differentiation. Indeed, it is likely that driving FGF only in the CNH would be required for continued axis elongation.</p>
      <p>Our findings are consistent with the direct regulation of <italic>Bra</italic> by FGF signalling in lower vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Isaacs2">[58]</xref>, the positive regulatory loop of FGF and Wnt signalling in the early mouse embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Naiche1">[22]</xref> and of Bra and Wnt3a in caudal regions in mouse and zebrafish early embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Yamaguchi1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Arnold1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Martin3">[60]</xref>. Furthermore, mice mutant for <italic>Bra</italic> exhibit body axis truncation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-DobrovolskaiaZavadskaia1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Herrmann1">[24]</xref>, and it may be important that the sudden loss of Bra/Wnt/FGF that we observe coincides with the cessation of segmentation of the presomitic mesoderm in the chick at HH24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Sanders1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Tenin1">[17]</xref>. Indeed, Bra/T box proteins exert direct positive regulation on the Notch pathway ligand <italic>Delta1</italic> and oscillations in this pathway underpin the segmentation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Hofmann1">[61]</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Wardle1">[62]</xref>). The regulation of <italic>Bra</italic> by FGF/Erk signalling thus appears to be a pivotal mechanism that determines vertebrate body length by maintaining mesoderm potential and also by control of a key Notch pathway gene integral to the segmentation of the body axis.</p>
      <p>Importantly, using in vivo and in vitro assays, we show that specifically in the tailbud FGF no longer inhibits <italic>Raldh2</italic> expression or RA activity. The downregulation of the p450 enzyme <italic>Cyp26a</italic> in the early tailbud, a known FGF-dependent gene in caudal regions in chick and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Wahl1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Reijntjes1">[26]</xref>, further suggests that RA is no longer degraded in the chick tailbud. However, we show that RA retains the ability to repress <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> in the tailbud; this could be indirect via loss of Wnt3a, which maintains <italic>Fgf8</italic> (although we also show here that FGF in turn maintains <italic>Wnt3a</italic>, as in the early mouse embryo) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Aulehla1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-AbuAbed2">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Iulianella1">[64]</xref> and/or directly through binding of an RARE in the <italic>Fgf8</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Brondani1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Zhao1">[66]</xref>. This breakdown of the oppositional signalling between FGF and RA pathways and the loss of homeostatic regulation of RA turnover provide a mechanism for the steady increase in endogenous RA levels.</p>
      <p>We present multiple lines of evidence that rising endogenous retinoid signalling then contributes to loss of FGF/Bra in the tailbud. Using <italic>Crabp2</italic> we show that as FGF signalling declines, endogenous RA activity increases in mesoderm progenitors and the neural CNH and, eventually, in the CNH/notochord distal tip. <italic>Crabp2</italic> transcription is well-established as an RA target in primary cells and cell lines (e.g., human skin fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Astrom1">[67]</xref>, F9 teratocarcinoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Giguere1">[68]</xref>, P19 embryonic carcinoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Durand1">[46]</xref>, and ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Chen1">[69]</xref>). It is validated here as a reporter of RA activity in the embryo by its increase in response to exogenous RA delivered by beads or directly on explanted tailbud and its reduction in Vitamin A–deficient quails and inhibition by RA synthesis inhibitor disulfiram and by RAR/RXR antagonists in in vitro and in vivo late stage tailbuds. In these multiple retinoid deficiency assays, we then consistently find ectopic maintenance of FGF signalling and <italic>Bra</italic>, strongly suggesting a role for endogenous retinoid signalling upstream of the loss of mesodermal potential in this tissue. In addition, recent work has confirmed that the chick tailbud is a source of RA, as explanted late-stage tailbuds stimulate expression of an RARb-RARE-LacZ reporter cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Tenin1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Sonneveld1">[70]</xref>. In the same assay, the mouse tailbud appears not to provide RA, despite also up-regulating <italic>Raldh2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Tenin1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Cunningham1">[35]</xref>. Most recent data suggest that retinoic acid is not synthesised in the mouse tailbud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Cunningham1">[35]</xref> and so implicate a different mechanism for attenuation of FGF/Wnt signalling as elongation ceases in this animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Cambray1">[4]</xref>. This species difference may relate to the retention of the mouse tail, while rising retinoid signalling in the chick additionally regulates cell death and possibly the later normal process of caudal regression in chick and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Schoenwolf1">[71]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Increasing levels of apoptosis were detected in the CNH and medial mesoderm progenitors after HH24. This may serve to remove remaining axial stem and mesoderm progenitor cells but appears too late to be responsible for the localised loss of <italic>Bra</italic> expression. Fate maps of the HH15 tailbud do not indicate that most terminal tissue contributes to neural tube when assessed at HH30 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Catala1">[1]</xref>, further suggesting that terminal neural tissue identified here may also subsequently undergo apoptosis. A secondary role for cell death in the regulation of axis elongation is consistent with the phenotypes of mice in which RA levels are raised; in <italic>Cyp26a</italic> null embryos, ectopic neural tubes form at the expense of mesoderm, but cell death is not increased in the truncated body axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-AbuAbed1">[29]</xref>, nor are cell death patterns altered in truncations induced by Cdx mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Young1">[18]</xref>. This suggests that endogenous cell death is induced by exposure to higher or longer duration RA and, as inhibition of FGFR signalling did not increase cell death in our assays, may act via a distinct mechanism to promote this further step.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, these data define a series of regulatory events that control the cessation of body axis elongation in the late stage chick tailbud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g009">Figure 9</xref>). It will be important now to identify the signals that promote <italic>Raldh2</italic> expression in the tailbud, what regulatory mechanism blocks retinoid synthesis in mouse tailbud, and the extent to which the mechanisms identified here in the chick are conserved across other vertebrate species. It will further be interesting to assess if the same signalling dynamics are deployed to arrest elongation of other axial outgrowths, such as the limb and beak that are also truncated by excess retinoic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Tickle1">[72]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Brown1">[73]</xref>.</p>

          <p>At HH22 <italic>Bra</italic> is expressed in notochord, CNH, and mesodermal progenitors (overlapping with <italic>Sox2</italic> in neural CNH) and is maintained by FGF (and Wnt) signalling, while <italic>Sox2</italic> is confined to neural tube and neural-CNH (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). From this stage <italic>Raldh2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Tenin1">[17]</xref> and <italic>Crabp2</italic> begin to be detected in tailbud mesoderm progenitors (signals that induce <italic>Raldh2</italic> here remain to be determined). FGF signalling no longer inhibits <italic>Raldh2</italic> nor represses <italic>Crabp2</italic>, and <italic>Cyp26a</italic> is downregulated; consequently, RA signalling begins to rise in the tailbud. FGF signalling is required to maintain <italic>Bra</italic> (except in proximal notochord) as well as <italic>Tbx6L</italic> and <italic>Wnt3a</italic> (not shown) in mesoderm progenitors. At HH24 FGF signalling suddenly declines, leading to loss of <italic>Bra</italic> and expansion of <italic>Sox2</italic> expression (dashed arrow) into the previous mesoderm progenitor domain, which reflects continued cell ingression from the CNH. At this stage <italic>Crabp2</italic> is now detected in the neural-CNH and position of the mesoderm progenitors, indicating rising retinoid signalling, which can repress FGF ligands and signalling. By HH26/27 FGF signalling is not detected and the notochord ends abruptly encircled by <italic>Sox2</italic> expressing cells. Cell death is widespread in the tailbud and is promoted by retinoid signalling.</p>

        <title>Implanting Beads into Stage Late Stage Tail Bud in Vivo</title>
        <p>HH stage 20/21 embryos were accessed in ovo for bead grafts. AGX-21 beads were soaked in RAR and RXR antagonists LG100815 and LG101208 (1 mM) (Ligand Pharmaceuticals) or DMSO for controls, and heparin-coated beads were used to present FGF4 (100 µM) or control BSA. After opening the egg shell, the vitelline membrane, blood vessels, and the amnion around the tail bud region were gently displaced/peeled away with fine forceps. The tail bud was lifted and stabilised on its side by placing a thin slice of agarose gel (2% agarose, 1×PBS, 0.01% Fast green) beneath it (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). A small opening was made in the caudal tail bud using a tungsten needle into which a bead was implanted. The agar was then slid away and the tailbud eased back into its normal vertically hanging position, the egg sealed, and re-incubated for 24 h.</p>

        <p>DiI labelling of cell groups was carried out as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001415-Brown2">[78]</xref>. DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′ tetram-ethyl-indocarbocyanineperchlorate, Cell Tracker CM-DiI, Invitrogen) 1 µg/µl in DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) was used to label small cell groups in the caudal most neural tube, the chordo-neural-hinge, and mesoderm progenitors in the stage 20/21 embryos. DiI was injected by glass capillary after temporary stabilization of the exposed tail bud on the agarose gel as described above. Following labelling, cell position was confirmed, agar removed, and tailbud eased back into position before sealing the egg and incubation for a further ∼30 h (a subset of embryos were fixed immediately, imaged, and sectioned to determine labelling accuracy; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001415-g003">Figure 3</xref> legend). Embryos were then fixed in 4% PFA for 2 h and washed in PBS. Whole tails were imaged before sectioning and analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001415-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Standard methods for whole mount in situ hybridisation were used. Explanted tissues were processed using an InsituPro machine (Intavis). Normal expression patterns were observed in at least four embryos per stage, per gene. Tailbud cell populations were analysed in sections prepared following standard cryosectioning. Immunocytochemistry in human embryos at CS12-17 for Sox2 and Bra was carried out using a standard protocol for wax sections, using citrate buffer antigen retrieval. Primary antibodies were as follows: Goat anti-Sox2 Immune Systems Ltd (GT15098; batch 401196) (1∶100); Rabbit anti-Brachyury (Santa Cruz) (SC-20109) (1∶50); and for Chick sections, Rabbit anti-Sox2 (Millipore Ab 5603) (1∶100) and Goat anti-Brachyury R&amp;D Systems. Secondaries were all from Molecular Probes and used at 1∶200; for Human tissue, Donkey anti-Goat A594 and Donkey anti-rabbit-A488; and for Chick tissue, Donkey anti-Goat A488 and Donkey anti-Rabbit A594.
