      <abstract>
        <p>This work introduces a coordinate-independent method to analyse movement variability of tasks performed with hand-held tools, such as a pen or a surgical scalpel. We extend the classical uncontrolled manifold (UCM) approach by exploiting the geometry of rigid body motions, used to describe tool configurations. In particular, we analyse variability during a static pointing task with a hand-held tool, where subjects are asked to keep the tool tip in steady contact with another object. In this case the tool is redundant with respect to the task, as subjects control position/orientation of the tool, i.e. 6 degrees-of-freedom (dof), to maintain the tool tip position (3dof) steady. To test the new method, subjects performed a pointing task with and without arm support. The additional dof introduced in the unsupported condition, injecting more variability into the system, represented a resource to minimise variability in the task space via coordinated motion. The results show that all of the seven subjects channeled more variability along directions not directly affecting the task (UCM), consistent with previous literature but now shown in a coordinate-independent way. Variability in the unsupported condition was only slightly larger at the endpoint but much larger in the UCM.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Daily motor tasks typically involve more degrees-of-freedom than strictly required. For instance, pressing a button in the elevator only requires positioning the fingertip at a three-dimensional location in space. However, to move the arm we need to control many more degrees-of-freedom (at least seven, only considering the shoulder, elbow and wrist) than required by the task, each with its own variability due to physiological factors such as tremor. Variability at proximal joints (e.g. shoulder or elbow) is expected to be amplified and projected at the distal end (fingertip). Remarkably, inter-joint coordination reduces the final variability at the fingertip position. Recent theories, such as the uncontrolled manifold (UCM), distinguished between inter-joint variability that would not affect the finger position and variability that would affect the final task. A major issue is that traditional UCM methods rely on the coordinate system chosen to analyse the arm motion. Therefore, we introduce a coordinate independent UCM method for tasks performed with handheld tools, e.g. surgery. This paper describes a new method and demonstrates that it enables an accurate analysis of static pointing. The results clearly show that the subjects can channel variability in dimensions that do not affect the task outcome.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Although highly stereotyped, human movements performed with the same intention are never exactly the same, displaying large variability in consecutive trials. Rather than just ‘biological noise’, many studies have pointed out how variability may in fact provide important clues on the underlying neural strategies. Analysis of structure in variability, and its changes, has therefore become an important tool for researchers in neuromotor control and learning, especially in presence of redundancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Mller1">[1]</xref>. Here, we are interested in the analysis of accuracy of pointing tasks performed with hand-held tools, for applications such as surgery.</p>
      <p>The problem of variability in redundant motor tasks was formulated by Bernstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Bernstein1">[2]</xref>, who studied the kinematics of skilled movements performed by professional blacksmiths while striking a chisel with a hammer. Bernstein observed how the variability of the trajectory of the hammer, at its tip, was in fact smaller than the variability of the trajectory of each of the joints of the arm holding the hammer. This suggests that the individual joints are not controlled independently and that the brain exploits kinematic redundancy to accurately control the endpoint.</p>
      <p>Redundancy and motion variability are important not only for blacksmiths but characterize virtually every daily activity, from grasping a cup to signing off a letter, where we typically have many more degrees-of-freedom (dof) than necessary to fulfil the task. We are particularly interested in tasks involving hand-held tools such as microsurgery, where noise induced by tremor, amplified by the visual magnification provided by the optical microscope, is a critical factor of performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Kazemi1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this work, we consider static pointing tasks, such as the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002978-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, where a subject is asked to keep the tip of a pen-like tool, e.g. a surgical scalpel, in steady contact with another object. In other words, the position of the tip, characterized by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> dof of mobility, is prescribed while the subject is free to choose among different postures, which include positioning of the torso, joint angles of the arm (i.e. shoulder, elbow and wrist) as well as grasping pattern of the hand. For postures away from biomechanical limits, there exists a <italic>task-equivalent manifold</italic> consisting of distinct postures which do not affect the task. A major challenge with real-world scenarios is that, due to the large number of degrees of freedom involved in the task, biomechanical analysis would be either intractable or oversimplified.</p>

      <p>A key aspect of our study is that <italic>the tool itself has redundant degrees of freedom with respect to the task</italic>, i.e. subjects are asked to control position and orientation of the tool (6dof) while maintaining a steady tool tip position (3dof). On the one hand, this allows one to focus on the low-dimensional space of tool configurations, rather than the high-dimensional space of possible postures. On the other hand, by focusing on the tool, we can make use of the geometric properties of rigid bodies, as detailed in the following sections.</p>
      <p>Scholz and Schoner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Scholz1">[4]</xref> hypothesized that movement variance across task repetitions projects differently onto the task-equivalent manifold than it does onto the orthogonal complement directly affecting the task. A larger variance projected in the task-equivalent space (or nullspace) is indicative of neural control and the task-equivalent manifold (where larger variance is expected for skilled movements) was named uncontrolled manifold (UCM).</p>
      <p>Despite its appeal, the computational procedures behind UCM (and principal component analysis in general) have been recently criticized for being coordinate-sensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Sternad1">[5]</xref>. A fundamental issue with UCM is that the orthogonal space is typically defined via the standard Euclidean metric applied to the space of joint angles. Such an implicit choice is coordinate-dependent and the results of the UCM analysis would change if, for example, we decide to represent postures via joint angles instead of a normalized angle (e.g. the joint angle divided by the biomechanical range of motion).</p>
      <p>More importantly, covariance-based analysis may reach different results if the coordinates are transformed. Even the linear transformation of joint angle coordinates from absolute to relative leads to different conclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Sternad1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>More than a century ago, Physics undertook a geometrization process of its main theories in the effort to achieve descriptions of phenomena in a coordinate-independent way, using differential geometry. Computational modelling in motor control is still at an early stage although some attempts have been made in this direction, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Pellionisz1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Handzel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Biess1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Biess2">[9]</xref>. It is not clear which coordinate system might be adopted by the brain to represent postures, therefore any specific selection rests on an arbitrary choice of the researcher. In situations where the configuration space is the set postures determined by several joint angles, it is not clear how to introduce an appropriate metric structure which relates angles relative to different joints, with very different ranges of motion. For example, starting from a reference posture, can we say that two new postures achieved, respectively, via a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of ankle rotation and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of knee rotation are equally ‘distant’ from the reference posture?</p>
      <p>Although internal representations are largely unknown, it is clear that the brain does take into account the geometry and physics of the external world. Early studies on reaching tasks in the horizontal plane showed how we consistently move along straight lines in the extrinsic, end-point space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Morasso1">[10]</xref>. In the last three decades, similar studies have been conducted under different conditions, including visual distortion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Flanagan1">[11]</xref> and force perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Shadmehr1">[12]</xref>, producing evidence that the brain is able to learn and adapt in order to produce straight lines in the visually perceived space (so, sometimes slightly curved in the actual space). Computational studies showed how this large body of experimental observations is compatible with optimization of kinematic and/or dynamic costs which are related to the dynamics of the task, e.g. inertial and geometric properties of the human limbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Flash1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Uno1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Harris1">[15]</xref>. These studies make use of methods traditionally applied in Mechanics and Robotics.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a very recent study by Danziger and Mussa-Ivaldi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Danziger1">[16]</xref> supports the hypothesis that movement trajectories are based on the perceived geometrical properties of the object (such as the hand-held tool, in our paper) that is being controlled by the brain. The novelty of their approach is in the use of a virtual object controlled via the (hyper-redundant) posture of the fingers, an experimental paradigm designed to eliminate any bias due to limb dynamics and experience in reaching. The findings of Danziger and Mussa-Ivaldi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Danziger1">[16]</xref>, along with the work of Biess et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Biess1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Biess2">[9]</xref>, suggest that <italic>metric properties such as distance measures and geodesics (i.e. ‘straight lines’) of the operational space (be it virtual or real) play an important role in shaping our motor strategies</italic>. In this sense, Riemmanian geometry represents the appropriate theoretical framework for analytical investigation in motor control.</p>
      <p>In this paper we study accuracy during pointing via a coordinate-independent analysis of variance based on a choice of metric structure suggested by the specific application, in our case manipulation via hand-held tools. The paper outline is as follows. Next section will present all the steps involved in the classical UCM approach, based on vector calculus. Then an overview of the Riemannian geometric framework required to extend such vector calculus steps to more general settings is presented, along with the detailed formulation required to compute intrinsic variance based on metric properties of rigid bodies motions. This approach is then applied to the analysis of data of healthy subjects performing static pointing tasks. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> from the experiments are presented and discussed.</p>

        <p>The starting point for classical uncontrolled manifold (UCM) analysis is the definition of a forward kinematic model<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002978.e012"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e012" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>relating <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-dimensional human joint variables <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to a particular <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-dimensional variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which is hypothesized to be directly controlled by the brain. For example, to investigate how the center of mass (COM) is controlled by children during quiet stance, Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Wu1">[17]</xref> derived a forward kinematic model mapping seven joint angles (i.e. the angles formed between the foot, shank, thigh, trunk, head/neck, forearm, and upper arm segments with the horizontal) onto the anterior-posterior position of the center, a one-dimensional variable. The task is kinematically redundant as a 7D joint configuration space is mapped onto a 1D task space (anterior-posterior sway of the center of mass).</p>

        <title>A Riemannian framework for intrinsic statistical analysis</title>
        <p>Riemannian geometry allows generalizing to nonlinear spaces traditional concepts and tools from vector calculus, e.g all the steps behind the classical UCM approach. In this section, we shall try to build some intuition to help relating these new geometric tools with the classical ones. For a more comprehensive and detailed description, the reader is referred to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Biess1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Biess2">[9]</xref> and references therein. To motivate this need of generalization, one can think of cartography: our rigid rulers and goniometers work well on flat sheets of papers but not on a globe. Therefore cartographers draw charts by mapping points on the globe onto a sheet of paper. Clearly, patching the globe requires multiple charts, each with its own coordinate system (‘squared’ paper), and some rule to reconcile overlapping charts.</p>

        <p>To analyze variability during static pointing tasks with hand-held tools, experiments were conducted with 7 healthy subjects without any known history of neuromuscular impairment. All of them declared to be right-handed and gave their informed consent prior to the experiment. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Nanyang Technological University and was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Each subject was asked to hold a sensorized stylus of a Polhemus Liberty system (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e216" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e217" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> resolution within <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e218" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> range) at a specific gripping point <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e219" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the tip, onto which a hypodermic needle with luer connector (Terumo <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e220" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was attached.

For both needles, only 1 mm of the tip is exposed while the remaining part is isolated with tapes. The setup is such that a beeping sound is produced when electrical contact between the exposed tips of the two needles occurs.</p>

In each trial, the subject was asked to make a 15 seconds, steady contact between stylus and target tips separated each time by a large movement of the stylus approximately 20 cm away from the body. Only the inner most 10 seconds between two large movements were analyzed (thick solid lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002978-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Firstly, the furthest positions away from the target were detected (corresponding to minima in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002978-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) then a midpoint was calculated. For data analysis we considered only the data points within 5 seconds before or after the midpoint.</p>

        <title>Motor redundancy: a blessing or a curse?</title>
        <p>Complexity of the human body typically leads to an excess of degrees of freedom for virtually every motor task we are routinely involved with. Redundancy is also adopted in the design of artificial systems, e.g. articulated robots, as extra dof can increase dexterity and robustness. However, redundancy also requires sophisticated control strategies, for example in devising control laws which guarantee repeatable postures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-MussaIvaldi1">[32]</xref>. In this lies one of most fascinating aspects of human motion: the apparent conflict between repeatability and variability of the movement itself.</p>
        <p>From an analytical perspective, repeatability and variability of movement have traditionally been distilled from experimental data via statistical approaches, by computing average and standard deviation estimates of movement properties derived from repeated trials. As pointed out by Newell and Slifkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Newell1">[33]</xref>, the vast majority of motor control literature on normal human subjects has neglected movement variability, considering it as a reflection of ‘biological noise’, while literature on motor disorders would interpret ‘low’ variability as a deficit, e.g. as in the case of stereotypies. Thresholds for standard deviations according to which the amount of variability should be considered large or small are often unreported, reflecting a bias relative to the theoretical views of the investigator. Furthermore, there is clearly more to movement variability than just standard deviation.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, various researchers have started exploring the structure of variability rather than just its amount. Structure in variability has been so far explored along two major avenues: its temporal or its geometric features. These two aspects are by no means exclusive and, in general, a combined temporal and geometric analysis is likely to provide more insight into human motor control.</p>
        <p>In this paper, we considered a pointing task and we focused on the geometric structure of variability, and also estimated the power spectral density to verify the frequency signature of physiological tremor. Consistent with previous literature on physiological tremor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Morrison1">[31]</xref>, our spectral analysis confirmed, for all subjects, the presence of at least two peaks in the frequency ranges 0–7 Hz and 7–15 Hz. However, variability is not just tremor, in particular in goal directed tasks where voluntary control actions are expected to take place. Furthermore, despite being a static pointing task, temporal aspects are still present due to, for example, fatigue and learning effects. In our analysis of variance, a main effect of trials was always present. Given the simplicity of the task, we believe that fatigue rather than learning might have contributed to the trial effect.</p>
        <p>The geometric structure of variability was underlined by the pioneering work of Scholz and Schoner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Scholz1">[4]</xref> who hypothesized that variability in redundant tasks is largely restricted to a subspace (UnControlled Manifold, UCM) of the configuration space which does not affect the task. Along this line, other related approaches have been proposed such as the Goal-Equivalent Manifold (GEM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Cusumano1">[34]</xref> and Tolerance, Noise and Covariation (TNC) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Mller1">[1]</xref>. While it is expected that the variability of the distal segments increases with the degrees of freedom, Morrison and Newell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Morrison1">[31]</xref> showed that the contribution of more proximal upper limb segments to distal (finger) tremor is not simply additive, which is compatible with the hypothesis of neurally-driven compensatory strategies. In their study, Morrison and Newell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Morrison1">[31]</xref> asked healthy subjects to minimize motion at the tip of the index fingers while standing with the arms parallel to the ground, with both index fingers fully extended and the remaining fingers fully flexed. The contribution of different joints to the distal tremor was analyzed by successively increasing the support of upper-limb segments from proximal to distal. Among other things, their study highlighted how the synergistic action of the wrist joint resulted in significantly smaller tremor at the index finger during a postural task.</p>
        <p>Similarly to Morrison and Newell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Morrison1">[31]</xref>, we evaluated variability at a distal endpoint in two different conditions: supported (Exp I) and unsupported arm (Exp II). In addition, our task was designed to be kinematically redundant as we wished to analyze changes in terms of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ variability, where ‘good’ refers to the variability which does not affect the task (i.e. in the null space) and ‘bad’ denotes the variability directly reflected in the task space (i.e. in the orthogonal complement to the null space). As expected, in both experimental conditions, our results show that each subject shows a statistically significant difference (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e299" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) between the UCM components, projecting more tremor along directions which do not affect the task. Furthermore, in the unsupported-arm condition (Exp II), indeed more variability is introduced at the distal endpoint but that it is mostly channeled into ‘good’ variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002978-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This is also clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002978-g007">Fig. 7</xref> where the increase in both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ variability is analyzed when the experimental condition is changed from supported-arm (Exp I) to unsupported-arm (Exp II). While, in terms of mean values, ‘bad’ variability increases but does not double for all subjects, ‘good’ variability increases significantly for most of the subjects (for half of them, there is a five-fold increase).</p>
        <p>We performed a similar analysis comparing variability at the gripping point and at the tool-tip. Although leading to qualitatively similar results, UCM analysis leads to ‘crisper’ results in terms of statistical significance. This was expected since the goal of the task, clearly defined in pointing tasks, is fully captured by the UCM analysis.</p>

        <title>A new tool to analyze skill</title>
        <p>One of the most appealing aspects of the UCM method is the possibility to distinguish ‘good’ variance (not affecting the task success) from ‘bad’ variance (affecting task performance) and, therefore, to identify skillful performance. Subjects who are able to channel physiological tremor into movements which do not affect the task, might be deemed more skillful. Therefore one might be tempted to relate skills to the UCM ratio. However, our results suggest another possible explanation.</p>
        <p>From our experiments, there appear to be two groups of subjects: those who show a statistically significant improvement in terms of UCM ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002978-g007">Fig. 7</xref>-top) in relation to a change of experimental condition and those who do not. A possible interpretation is that, while all subjects perform well in the unsupported-arm condition, the former group (formed by subjects ‘ma’, ‘me’ and ‘ql’) performs equally well also in the supported-arm condition. The latter condition is characterized by a reduced number of redundant degrees of freedom. In this sense, when more dof are available, it might be easier to channel variability into motions which do not affect the task (‘good’ variability) and, thus, skill might be related to the ability of performing equally well with a reduced number of dof. However, the mechanism behind this group difference is unknown and this requires further investigation.</p>

        <title>Coordinate independence and objectivity</title>
        <p>Despite its appeal, a weakness in the UCM analysis has been recently pointed out in relation to its coordinate dependence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Sternad1">[5]</xref>. An issue with UCM is that the orthogonal space is usually defined via the standard Euclidean metric applied to the space of joint angles. This choice is coordinate-dependent, thus the results of the UCM analysis would change if, for example, we decide to represent postures via joint angles instead of a normalized angle (e.g. the joint angle divided by the biomechanical range of motion).</p>
        <p>As also mentioned by Sternad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Sternad1">[5]</xref>, in computational motor control a distinction should be made between <italic>internal</italic> coordinates, which are assumed to be used by the brain to process information as well as plan and execute actions, and <italic>external</italic> coordinates used to describe and analyze behavior by the investigator. In the latter case, care must be exercised to ensure that the results are independent of the researcher's choice of coordinates.</p>
        <p>Differently from the UCM approach, Sternad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Sternad1">[5]</xref> proposed a method where variability is evaluated in the “space of the result”, a task-related space, making it less sensitive to coordinates in the configuration (or execution) space. This is done in recognition of the fact that for unambiguously defined tasks there should be a natural way to evaluate performance, possibly leading to a well-defined metric in the task-space.</p>
        <p>From this perspective, a main contribution of this paper is the use of task-specific features to construct an appropriate metric, which leads to a frame-invariant and objective analysis in the sense of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Lin1">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In particular, manipulation via hand-held tools suggests the use of the scale-dependent left-invariant metric (18), a particular type of kinetic energy metric especially suitable for kinematic rather than dynamic analysis, initially proposed by Park and Brockett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Park1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Park2">[21]</xref>. Left-invariance guarantees independence of the inertial frame but the lack of a bi-invariant metric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Park2">[21]</xref> implies dependence on the choice of body-fixed frame. Nevertheless, in the case of kinetic energy metrics for rigid body motions, left-invariance is in fact <italic>sufficient to guarantee the principle of objectivity</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Lin1">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>From a mathematical perspective, it should be noted that one could have chosen a right-invariant metric to guarantee body-fixed frame indifference and forgo the left-invariance, i.e. bearing a dependence on the spatial frame. This would not be acceptable in our case, as the results would be dependent on the choice, for example, of the measuring system.</p>
        <p>Previous mathematical arguments are very general and do not take into account the specific requirements of the task. To describe the pose of a tool, the experimentalist needs to choose two coordinate frames: a fixed frame <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e300" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a moving frame <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e301" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Our left-invariant description does not depend on the fixed frame but, due to the nature of rigid body motions, necessarily depends on the moving frame, despite being an objective description in the sense of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Lin1">[35]</xref>. However, our experimental protocol explicitly requires the subject to grasp the tool at a prescribed position, i.e. at fixed distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e302" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the tip as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002978-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. Arguably, this induces a unique, natural choice for the position of the moving frame <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002978.e303" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It should be noted that <italic>our analysis only depends on the position of the moving frame and not on its orientation</italic>, as shown in supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002978.s001">Text S1</xref>. Therefore, although mathematically there might be a general dependence on the choice of the body frame, a well defined task should always induce a natural choice of such a frame. This is consistent with the idea that unambiguously defined tasks should allow to measure performance in an unambiguous way, as also observed by Sternad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Sternad1">[5]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Dynamic tasks</title>
          <p>In this paper, we focused on static pointing tasks. However, starting from the original work by Scholz and Schoner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Scholz1">[4]</xref> the classical UCM concept was applied to a variety of dynamic tasks, including sit-to-stand transitions, reaching and walking. In these works, the UCM method was applied to trajectories during consecutive movements which were re-scaled in time and aligned so that corresponding points occurring at the same normalized time could be sampled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Scholz1">[4]</xref>. The only difference of data analysis between static and dynamic tasks is in the way samples are collected. In the static task, the samples are consecutive postures within a specific trial. In dynamic tasks, an <italic>ensemble</italic> of trials is considered and, at a specific normalized time, one posture per trial is sampled. The analysis is then repeated at different time slices.</p>
          <p>In general, this approach might raise concerns in dynamic tasks which are not appropriately timed. When a task is self-paced, there is no guarantee that events occurring in different trials at the same normalized time are necessarily related.</p>
          <p>In any case, the method would still be applicable to <italic>tracking tasks</italic> where, repeatedly across trials, a subject is asked to track a visible target which evolves along a predefined path at a predefined speed (the whole path might or might not be displayed). At any given time, the subject is supposed to be on target. Therefore, postures at that very time could be sampled across trials and used in the UCM analysis, as for a static task.</p>

          <title>Visually perceived geometry</title>
          <p>In a recent study, Danziger and Mussa-Ivaldi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Danziger1">[16]</xref> asked subjects to control a simulated 2-link planar arm via a (hyper-redundant) map from finger postures to the two joint angles of the linkage. According to the type of visual feedback (one group of subjects could see the whole linkage while another group could only see the moving end-tip), subjects would move along paths which could be associated with the geodesics of the visually perceived tool, i.e. either a point or an articulated linkage. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, from visual observations, the brain can infer (geo)metric properties of tools and can adapt to produce controlled motions consistent with the perceived metric properties (e.g. moving along shortest paths).</p>

          <title>Intrinsic statistics</title>
          <p>As a final note, the type of statistical analysis needs not to be restricted to simple analysis of variance, as done in this paper along the line of classical UCM approach. Once a Riemannian framework is in place, as in our paper or in the work of Biess et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Biess1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Biess2">[9]</xref>, one is given a host of computational tools to perform intrinsic statistics, as recently presented for example in the field of medical imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002978-Pennec1">[18]</xref>.</p>
