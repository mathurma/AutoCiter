<abstract>
<p>Circadian disruption has multiple pathological consequences, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. To address such mechanisms, we subjected transformed cultured cells to chronic circadian desynchrony (CCD), mimicking a chronic jet-lag scheme, and assayed a range of cellular functions. The results indicated a specific circadian clock–dependent increase in cell proliferation. Transcriptome analysis revealed up-regulation of G1/S phase transition genes (myelocytomatosis oncogene cellular homolog [Myc], cyclin D1/3, chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 [Cdt1]), concomitant with increased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 and increased G1-S progression. Phospho-RB (Ser807/811) was found to oscillate in a circadian fashion and exhibit phase-shifted rhythms in circadian desynchronized cells. Consistent with circadian regulation, a CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for cancer treatment reduced growth of cultured cells and mouse tumors in a time-of-day–specific manner. Our study identifies a mechanism that underlies effects of circadian disruption on tumor growth and underscores the use of treatment timed to endogenous circadian rhythms.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Circadian misalignment caused by altered sleep–wake cycles, shift work, or frequent jet lag increases susceptibility to several disorders, including cancer. However, the mechanisms by which circadian disruption contributes to disease are not well understood, and so we addressed this issue by investigating the molecular, cellular, and biochemical consequences of chronic circadian desynchronization. Our studies using cancer cell or tumor tissue models show that chronic circadian desynchronization induces multiple oncogenic pathways to promote cell proliferation. In particular, chronic circadian desynchronization promotes phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein, thereby favoring G1/S phase cell cycle progression. Consistent with these findings, the antiproliferative activity of a selective inhibitor of the enzyme that phosphorylates RB has time-of-day–specific effects on cancer cells and mouse tumors, but this time dependence is abrogated by chronic jet-lag conditions. These data suggest a circadian regulation of G1/S cell cycle progression and provide an important molecular rationale for time-of-day–specific treatment of cancer patients, also known as chronotherapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In response to day–night cycles produced by earth's 24-hour rotation around its axis, almost all living organisms have evolved circadian clocks, endogenous timekeeping systems that adapt physiology to daily changes in the environment. In mammals, the circadian timing system consists of a central light-entrained clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain and numerous peripheral clocks located in most body organs, all of which are typically coordinated to constrain sleep and feeding, metabolism, and immune functions to appropriate times of the day. The basic timekeeping unit is the cell in that even single neurons and fibroblasts harbor a conserved, cell-autonomous circadian clock. At the molecular level, the basic mechanism consists of transcription-translation feedback loops, with the major loop in mammals comprised of the <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry</italic>) genes, which are rhythmically transcribed by circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (CLOCK)—brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1(BMAL1) transcription factors and repressed by their own protein products (PER, CRY). With further fine-tuning at transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels, the intrinsic molecular oscillator integrates multiple external signals to regulate expression of clock-controlled genes, which differ dramatically from tissue to tissue despite usage of largely the same core clock genes across the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Consistent with the adaptive physiological and cellular benefits of the circadian timing system, accumulating evidence indicates that disruption of circadian homeostasis by genetic alteration or irregular lifestyle has pathological consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref002">2</xref>]. For instance, epidemiological studies show that frequent misalignment of circadian rhythms caused by lifestyle factors such as chronic sleep deprivation, jet lag, or shift work is a potential risk factor for cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref003">3</xref>]. Even in experimental animal studies, genetic or environmental disruption of circadian rhythms highly increases the incidence or growth rate of various types of tumors, including lung, breast, skin, oral, and prostate cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref006">6</xref>]. The wide variety of tumors affected suggests that circadian disruption alters basic cellular physiology in a fundamental way that increases susceptibility to diseases like cancer; however, the underlying mechanism is not understood.</p>
<p>Increased tumorigenesis and accelerated tumor growth are often linked to a dysregulated cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref008">8</xref>]. The cell cycle consists of cell growth (G1), DNA replication (S), and cell division (G2/M) phases. Generally, control of cell proliferation occurs at the G1 phase, during which cells integrate multiple signals, ranging from growth factors to DNA damage, to determine entry into the S phase or exit to the G0 non-cycling quiescent phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref009">9</xref>]. Most human cancers are thought to develop from disruption of G1/S cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref010">10</xref>]. The G1/S phase boundary is regulated by the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein, which is sequentially phosphorylated by cyclin D1/cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 in early G1 and by cyclin E/CDK2 in late G1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref011">11</xref>]. Links between cell cycle regulators and the circadian clock have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref013">13</xref>], but how the circadian clock regulates cell cycle transitions is unclear, as is the mechanism by which circadian disruption affects tumor growth.</p>
<p>In addition to the relevance of circadian disruption for the development of disease, circadian rhythms can be quite important for the treatment of cancer and other disorders. In recent years, some studies have investigated the idea of exploiting the circadian clock in tumors for therapy, for instance, by modulating activity of circadian clock molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref014">14</xref>], enhancing intra-tumor circadian rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref015">15</xref>], and optimizing anticancer drug delivery by timing it to the host’s circadian rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref017">17</xref>]. Delivery timed to the appropriate time of day (chronotherapy) is expected to have better efficacy and possibly reduce the dose required, thereby limiting side effects, but the practice of chronotherapy is still in its infancy and would be facilitated by mechanistic insights into the temporal regulation of drug action.</p>
<p>In the present study, we sought to determine, on a cellular and molecular level, how circadian disruption affects basic cell function. Starting with cell-based circadian desynchronization experiments, we conducted extensive molecular, cellular, and biochemical analyses to reveal that chronic circadian disturbance promotes pro-proliferative signaling events, which converge to stimulate G1/S phase progression via CDK4/6-dependent RB phosphorylation. We also found that RB phosphorylation, particularly at S807/S811 sites, cycles in phase with rhythmic cyclin D1 gene expression, and it is increased and altered in fluctuation by chronic circadian perturbation. Using a mouse model, we show that circadian disruption also increases the growth of carcinogen- or melanoma-induced tumors in mice. Consistent with a role for RB-CDK4/6, we find that PD0332991, a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, has time-of-day–specific effects on proliferation in cells and mouse tumors, but this time dependence is abrogated by a chronic jet-lag protocol. Together, our findings indicate that the circadian clock regulates G1/S phase progression via the cyclin D1-CDK4/6–RB pathway, and provide a mechanism for the application of chronotherapeutic approaches to cancer patients.</p>

<title>Circadian desynchronization in a cell culture model mimics jet lag</title>
<p>Experimental disruptions of the circadian clock, such as chronic jet lag in mice and rats, have detrimental effects on health, causing aberrant behavioral and hormonal rhythms, cognitive deficits, weight gain, diabetes, apoptosis, and accelerated tumor development and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref018">18</xref>]. However, molecular, biochemical, or cellular mechanisms underlying these effects of circadian disturbance remain ambiguous. In order to determine consequences of circadian disruption on the most basic level, we sought to develop a cell-based, chronic circadian desynchrony (CCD) assay mimicking the experimental jet-lag protocol used in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref019">19</xref>]. To test the feasibility of an in vitro CCD approach, we chose a commonly used circadian model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref020">20</xref>], human U2 osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells expressing a <italic>Period2</italic> (<italic>Per2</italic>) promoter-driven destabilized luciferase reporter (<italic>pPer2-dLuc</italic>). This reporter cell line enables real-time measurement of cellular rhythms after synchronization with dexamethasone (dex), a synthetic glucocorticoid (GC) and potent clock synchronizer widely used in cell culture models ranging from fibroblasts to astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref023">23</xref>]. First, to assess the effect of CCD on cellular rhythmicity, we exposed control cells to 10 days of a regular change of dex (100 nM)-containing media at 24-hour intervals (Control; CTL), while experimental cells received serial 8-hour advances of the dex treatment cycle every 2 days (Jet lag; JL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

Analysis of bioluminescence rhythms during the first week (1<sup>st</sup>wk) post CCD revealed significantly dampened rhythms in JL cells, with lower amplitude and, notably, 6.8-hour delayed onset of rhythms (acro-phase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g001">Fig 1C, 1D and 1E</xref>). However, rhythms in JL cells were not different from those of CTL cells in subsequent weeks (2<sup>nd</sup>wk, 3<sup>rd</sup>wk), throughout which all cells showed nearly identical rhythmic cycles in luminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g001">Fig 1B, 1C and 1D</xref>). These effects are similar to those that occur with travel across different time zones, when rhythms are affected in the first week following travel but subsequently adapt to the new, stable environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref024">24</xref>]. A phase delay (8.2 hours) and reduced amplitude of JL cell rhythms were also observed in the first week after a short-term circadian desynchronization schedule of only 6 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The observations above concur with a previous mouse study showing that temporal patterns of circadian clock genes (<italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Cry1</italic>) in chronically jet-lagged mice exhibit lower amplitude as well as phase delays of 5.5–9.0 hours and 7.0–11.2 hours in the SCN and liver, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref019">19</xref>]. Moreover, in a recent human study, a similar set of circadian genes (<italic>PER1</italic>, <italic>PER2</italic>) as well as hormones (plasma cortisol, melatonin) showed between a 7- and 9-hour phase delay with decreased amplitude in human blood samples after a night shift protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref025">25</xref>]. Taking this evidence together, we conclude that our cultured cell-based CCD strategy closely mimics a physiological jet-lag model.</p>

<title>Circadian desynchrony affects cell physiology to selectively increase proliferation</title>
<p>To determine the effects of CCD on cellular function and physiology, we conducted a wide range of assays that tested for oxidative stress/senescence (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, glutathione [GSH]/glutathione disulfide [GSSG]), metabolism (NADP/NADPH), proteolysis, and apoptosis, but we did not find any significant differences between CTL and JL cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). To take a more unbiased approach, we investigated genome-wide changes of rhythmic gene expression following the CCD schedule. To this end, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of CTL and JL cell samples over a 24-hour cycle collected every six hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; black arrowheads). MetaCycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref026">26</xref>] analysis revealed significant circadian cycles of expression (q &lt; 0.1) for 44 transcripts in CTL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s011">S1 Table</xref>).

The expression of several known circadian genes also showed dampened or phase-altered oscillations in JL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g001">Fig 1H</xref>).

Interestingly, many genes up-regulated in JL cells function in disease pathways implicated in neurodegeneration and cancer: SRC homology domain-containing protein 21 (SH3D21) (ataxia-telangiectasia and colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref027">27</xref>]), exocyst complex component 3-like protein 2 (EXOC3L2) (Alzheimer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref028">28</xref>]), DEXH (Asp-Glu-X-His) box polypeptide 58 (DHX58) (mammary tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref029">29</xref>]), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 inhibitor (PCSK1N) (skin carcinogenesis, Alzheimer disease and parkinsonism-dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref030">30</xref>]), and jagged 2 (JAG2) (myeloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref031">31</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g001">Fig 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s013">S3 Table</xref>).

<p>Prompted by this, we compared gene expression patterns between CTL and JL samples for well-characterized oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. We found that several oncogenes (56/95) were up-regulated in JL cells, with significant induction noted for 11 genes (e.g., musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene B [MAFB], Jun proto-oncogene related gene d [JUND], musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene B [MAFA], oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 [OLIG2], nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2 [NFKB2], jun oncogene [JUN], cyclin D3 [CCND3], high mobility group AT-hook 1 [HMGA1], erbb2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 [ERBB2], myelocytomatosis oncogene cellular homolog [MYC], alpha serine/threonine kinase 1 [AKT1]; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, tumor suppressor genes (58/66) were largely unaffected or significantly down-regulated (e.g., annexin A1 [ANXA1], neurofibromin 1 [NF1], cluster of differentiation 36 [CD36], breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein [BRCA1]; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s014">S4 Table</xref>). This gene expression pattern is more clearly visible when plotting the log<sub>2</sub> fold-change values for oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Overall expression of oncogenic retinoic acid syndrome (RAS) signaling factors as well as receptors and ligands of several growth factor signaling pathways (epidermal growth factor [EGF]/fibroblast growth factor [FGF]/vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), which contribute to cancer progression, was also induced in response to CCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g002">Fig 2F–2I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s015">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s016">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s017">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s018">S8</xref> Tables).

<p>Importantly, the effect of CCD on molecular cycles and cell number did not depend on the use of dex, as similar data were obtained when forskolin was used as a synchronizing agent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). To determine whether CCD-induced increased cell number was mediated by the molecular clock, we depleted the core clock activator (BMAL1) or repressors (CRY1/CRY2) using transient RNA interference (RNAi) in CTL and JL cells 48 hours before CCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g003">Fig 3B–3G</xref>). Notably, the knockdown of either set of core clock genes significantly compromised the cellular response to CCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). Similarly, cell viability, as measured with a thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based cell viability assay, was increased following CCD in control cells stably expressing siRNA targetting green fluoresecent protein (si-GFP) cells but not in U2OS cells stably expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting BMAL1 (si-BMAL1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Consistent with these results, a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay during the first week following CCD revealed a significantly higher number of proliferating cells in JL samples relative to CTL samples in the presence of control siRNA (si-CTL), but the relative effect was reduced by knockdown of a core clock regulator (si-BMAL1, si-CRY1/2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g003">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>). Although BMAL1 can have non-circadian effects, the reduced effect of CCD on cell number with two different clock knockdowns that have opposing roles within the clock (BMAL1 and CRY) supports the idea that the core clockwork contributes to the effects of CCD on cell proliferation.</p>

<title>Circadian desynchrony targets RB phosphorylation and the G1/S transition to promote proliferation</title>
<p>To explore the distribution of the cell cycle following CCD, we utilized fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell-cycle indicator (FUCCI) imaging, which uses fluorescent probes to demarcate stages of the cell cycle (Cdt1-RFP for G1/S and Geminin-GFP for G2/M). We transduced these probes into the cells during the last day of the CCD schedule and found that both FUCCI sensor–positive cells were significantly increased by the CCD/JL protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). However, the number of Cdt1-RFP–expressing cells was significantly higher than that of Geminin-GFP–expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). Besides the CCD-induced changes in protein levels of the FUCCI probes, mRNA levels of <italic>CDT1</italic> were also higher in the JL cells, relative to CTL, across multiple circadian times, whereas mRNA levels of Geminin (<italic>GMMN</italic>), a posttranslational inhibitor of CDT1, showed little change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g003">Fig 3J</xref>). The proto-oncogenic effect of CDT1 involves its up-regulation and hyperactivity in DNA replication in malignant tumor cells or tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref033">33</xref>]. Thus, we speculated that activation of specific cell cycle genes contributed to the enhanced proliferation in response to CCD. Indeed, our transcriptomic analysis showed that genes involved in the G1/S phase transition (<italic>CDK3</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>CCND3</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, and <italic>CDT1</italic>) were highly induced upon CCD, more so than genes that function in other parts of the cell cycle (S, G2, M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g003">Fig 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s014">S4 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s019">S9 Table</xref>). These results together suggest that chronic disturbance of cellular rhythms influences the transcriptional network to preferentially activate G1/S phase progression and thereby enhance cell proliferation.</p>
<p>In addition to transcript levels, the G1 to S phase transition is tightly regulated by phosphorylation of a number of cell cycle regulatory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref011">11</xref>]. In fact, a key event for G1/S cell cycle progression is phosphorylation of RB by cyclin D-CDK4/6, which leads to activation of the G1/S transition-driving E2 transcription factor (E2F) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). Several phosphorylation site mapping studies have reported that RB undergoes extensive phosphorylation during the G1/S cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). We sought to examine how CCD affects the phosphorylation status of RB using available phosphorylation site-specific antibodies (pRB-S807/S811, pRB-S795, pRB-S780, pRB-S612; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Western blot analysis using phospho-RB antibodies revealed that CCD induced significantly higher phosphorylation levels at many sites (S807/S811, S795, S780) in RB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s005">S5C and S5D Fig</xref>). However, phosphorylation at S612 was not significantly increased. Interestingly, total RB protein levels were also significantly increased in JL cells compared with CTL cells despite similar levels of RB mRNA (<italic>RB1</italic>) in both cell samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s005">S5E Fig</xref>). Thus, the elevated RB protein level may result from increased protein stability mediated by CCD-induced phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation of specific residues of RB at the carboxy terminus by different G1 Cyclin-CDK complexes contributes to its differential function in cell cycle progression and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref036">36</xref>]. In this regard, we observed relatively higher phosphorylation at positions S807/S811, compared with the other phosphosites, in response to CCD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). To determine if the regulation of RB phosphosites in U2OS cells is consistent with previous reports in other systems, we used expression constructs encoding wild-type RB, non-phosphorylatable RB with 15 putative CDK sites converted to Ala residues (RB-ΔCDK), and single CDK site monophosphorylatable RB proteins (RB-ΔCDK+S612, RB-ΔCDK+S780, RB-ΔCDK+S807, RB-ΔCDK+S811) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). The expression of the wild-type and phosphosite–modified RB proteins was confirmed by western blot (WB) using phospho-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). FUCCI cell cycle analysis of cells expressing each of these RB constructs revealed that either or both of the S807 and S811-monophosphorylated RB proteins prominently increased G1/S phase cells relative to wild-type, non-phosphorylated, and other single CDK site RB proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s006">S6A and S6C Fig</xref>). Interestingly, RB lacking all phosphorylation sites (RB-ΔCDK) resulted in more G1/S phase cells than wild-type RB, suggesting that some phosphorylation sites inhibit this transition. In parallel, MTT cell viability analysis also showed significantly enhanced cell proliferation in cells expressing the S807 and S811 monophosphorylated RB proteins alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s006">S6D Fig</xref>). Indeed, phosphorylation of S807/S811, which alleviates the suppressor function of RB, has been proposed as a representative marker for G1 progression through S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref039">39</xref>]. Moreover, phosphorylation of RB at S807 protects against apoptotic cell death by regulating B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)-associated X (Bax) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>To directly assess whether phosphorylation of RB of S807/S811 contributes to cell proliferation upon circadian disturbance, we used C33A cervix carcinoma cells that express a truncated unstable RB protein and so are considered null for RB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref041">41</xref>]. We expressed wild-type RB or alanine mutants S807A and S811A of RB (RB-S807A, RB-S811A) in C33A cells and measured cell density with and without CCD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). As expected, when a tumor suppressor is removed, RB-null cells showed high cell numbers and a very robust response to CCD. C33A cells rescued with wild-type RB showed a smaller but still significant response, but effects of CCD were blunted in C33A cells expressing RB-S807A or RB-S811A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation at S807/S811 plays a unique role in enhancing cell proliferation upon CCD and so likely contributes to the cell proliferation phenotype caused by chronic circadian disturbance.</p>

<title>Cyclin D1 mediates effects of circadian desynchrony on RB phosphorylation</title>
<p>To understand the mechanism underlying the effects of CCD on RB phosphorylation, we examined the expression of cell cycle genes under CCD. Cyclin D1 (CCND1) protein expression displayed increased expression and a reversed cyclic pattern in response to CCD, while other cell cycle molecules (CDK4, cyclin B1 [CCNB1]) were relatively unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). mRNA expression of cyclin D1 was also persistently induced over most circadian time points in JL cells relative to CTL cells, but this was not seen for other RB pathway components (RB1, CDK4, CDK6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). These results point to a principal role of cyclin D1 in promoting CDK4/6 kinase activity to drive increased expression and oscillation of RB phosphorylation in response to CCD.</p>
<p>The cyclin D1 gene responds directly to and integrates multiple signaling pathways via its various enhancer elements during the G1/S transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref009">9</xref>]. To address the mechanism responsible for CCD-driven cyclin D1 gene activation, we examined the RNA-Seq data for differences between CTL and JL samples with respect to signaling pathways known to regulate cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s008">S8B–S8F Fig</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s020">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s021">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s022">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s023">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s024">S14</xref> Tables). Expression of a large number of key signaling molecules that activate cyclin D1 (wingless/integrated [Wnt], extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase [ERK/MAPK], phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase [PI13K/AKT], hippo signaling pathway [HIPPO], G protein-coupled receptor [GPCR]) was up-regulated, whereas most genes that inhibit cyclin D1 were relatively unaffected or down-regulated in response to CCD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s008">S8B–S8F Fig</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s020">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s021">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s022">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s023">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s024">S14</xref> Tables). Correspondingly, several transcriptional activators that respond to such upstream signals and directly target enhancer elements of the cyclin D1 promoter (activator protein 1 [AP-1], nuclear factor kappa B [NFKB], notch signaling pathway [NOTCH]) exhibited up-regulated gene expression relative to repressors, as a result of CCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s025">S15 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>To verify CCD-induced activation of cyclin D1 in vivo, we induced a fibrosarcoma in mice using methylcholanthrene (MCA), a potent chemical carcinogen, and exposed the mice to a chronic jet-lag schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref004">4</xref>]. As described below, tumor growth showed a notably higher rate in jet-lagged mice compared with controls. Western blot analysis revealed that cyclin D1 protein expression as well as RB phosphorylation were markedly increased at multiple time points in tumor tissue, but not in liver tissue, relative to control mice samples assayed in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports of the cyclin D1-CDK4/6 dependence of RB phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref044">44</xref>]. These data strongly suggest that chronic circadian disturbance promotes an intracellular signaling environment that stimulates cyclin D1 expression in tumors.</p>
<p>Around-the-clock assays of mouse liver extracts at 4-hour intervals showed constitutive expression of CDK4 and CCNB1. Diurnal variations were observed in cyclin D1 expression and RB 807/811 phosphorylation, but were not as robust as seen in cells, perhaps because the adult liver is a non-proliferating tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). We also asked if cyclin D1 is a direct target of the clock, and so sought to investigate if a canonical enhancer box (E-box) sequence, located at −588 in the upstream region of the human cyclin D1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), is relevant for clock-mediated expression. To address this, we conducted transcriptional analysis using a luciferase reporter (ph<italic>CCND1</italic>-Luc) in HEK293T cells that are typically used for such assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref022">22</xref>]. We found that cyclin D1 promoter activity was significantly up-regulated by CLOCK/BMAL1 and repressed by CRY1 when co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Thus, cyclin D1 is a direct target of the core clock machinery, supported by recent microarray analysis identifying cyclin D1 as a rhythmically expressed gene in most mouse tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref045">45</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that cyclin D1 is a critical component required for rhythmic RB phosphorylation by CDK4/6, mediating circadian coordination or alteration of G1/S phase progression.</p>

<p>This supports our prior hypothesis of phosphorylation-dependent stabilization of RB. Conversely, the phospho-RB inhibitor gradually increased protein abundance of cyclin D1 or CDK4/6 dose dependently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports showing that palbociclib can stabilize cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes by inducing adaptive responses in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase PI3K/AKT pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref049">49</xref>]. Considering the cyclic RB phosphorylation in our data above, we sought to examine circadian kinetics of the antiproliferative effect of palbociclib on dex-synchronized U2OS osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The time course of an MTT cell viability assay revealed that palbociclib exhibited significantly higher antiproliferative activity at 30 hours, relative to other time points, following dex synchronization in both 48-hour and 72-hour drug incubation protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s009">S9A and S9B Fig</xref>). Palbociclib did not show a substantial effect on circadian rhythmicity, as assayed by determining its effect on the <italic>Per2</italic> reporter in U2OS cells, although slightly prolonged rhythms were observed at higher doses, probably due to severe cell growth arrest by the drug (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s007">S7C, S7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s009">S9E and S9F</xref> Figs).</p>
<p>To determine whether rhythmic variations in drug efficacy were circadian clock dependent, we subjected U2OS cells stably expressing BMAL1 siRNA (si-BMAL1<sup>stable</sup>), or GFP siRNA as a control (si-GFP<sup>stable</sup>), to CCD and then followed up with the timed pharmacological experiments as above. MTT analysis showed a circadian pattern of drug sensitivity (<italic>p</italic><sup>MetaCycle</sup> &lt; 0.05) in control si-GFP<sup>stable</sup> cells, but the rhythm of drug response was phase reversed in JL GFP<sup>stable</sup> cells, reflecting altered cycling in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, left panels). Furthermore, rhythmic effects of the inhibitor were abrogated in CTL and JL si-BMAL1<sup>stable</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, right panels), although they were not totally eliminated—likely because siRNA does not produce complete knockdown. These results indicate that the antiproliferative effect of palbociclib, which targets CDK4/6 activity, is regulated by the circadian clock and can be severely altered by rhythm desynchrony.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, we sought to determine if a G1/S cell cycle–specific inhibitor shows time-of-day–specific effects in an in vivo mouse model. To this end, 30–60 days after subcutaneous injection of the MCA carcinogen, mice were subjected to a chronic jet-lag (CJL) protocol, the effects of which were verified by testing the mice for locomotor rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref004">4</xref>], jet-lagged mice (Jet-lag) formed tumors faster than controls (Control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). To investigate the time-dependent efficacy of palbociclib, we gave daily oral treatment to Control and Jet lag mice for 5 days at three hours after lights on (zeitgeber time [ZT3]) (morning) or three hours after lights off (ZT15) (night) following the chronic jet-lag schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). A significant reduction of tumor growth rate was observed in Control mice receiving the drug at ZT3, but not those treated at ZT15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g006">Fig 6E and 6G</xref>). Moreover, the time-dependent antitumor activity of palbociclib was compromised in Jet lag mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g006">Fig 6F and 6H</xref>). To explore time dependence of this drug with respect to other types of tumors, we induced tumors in mice through subcutaneous injection of B16 mouse melanoma cells, which possess intrinsic circadian function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref015">15</xref>]. Interestingly, similar to the results observed in MCA-induced tumors, the inoculated melanoma grew faster in Jet-lag mice than Control during the chronic jet-lag regime (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s010">S10A, S10B, S10C and S10D Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the melanoma tumors exhibited significantly higher drug sensitivity at ZT3 than ZT15 in Control mice when subjected to daily treatment with palbociclib at these respective time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s010">S10E and S10G Fig</xref>).

In conjunction with the cell-based data, our in vivo animal data indicate that circadian regulation of G1/S progression confers time-of-day sensitivity to antitumor agents that act at this step, but the rhythm of sensitivity is lost under conditions of circadian desynchrony.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of a cell-based assay to investigate the impact of circadian desynchrony on a cellular/molecular level. The use of this model allowed us to comprehensively assess impairments in cell physiology induced by a jet-lag protocol, and it revealed a molecular mechanism that is not only relevant for the role of circadian dysregulation in cancer but also provides a molecular target for chronotherapy. Importantly, we show that the mechanism as well as time-of-day effects of a drug targeting the mechanism are manifest in mouse tumor models.</p>
<p>The dex synchronization model is used largely to induce free-running circadian oscillations in mammalian cell lines. However, GCs such as dex are also relevant for circadian synchrony in the organism. Besides photic entrainment driven by the SCN, mammalian body clocks can be directly reset by multiple stimuli such as stress, exercise, and nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref050">50</xref>], of which GC hormones released from the adrenal cortex are among the most potent non-photic synchronizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref051">51</xref>]. GC levels exhibit robust daily oscillations, with peak expression in the morning and a trough at night, driven by circadian regulation of GC production by a local clock in the adrenal gland as well as by systemic innervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref052">52</xref>]. GCs mediate circadian responses to various psychosocial stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref053">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref055">55</xref>], and thus disruption of GC rhythms by shift work or jet lag could be relevant to pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref056">56</xref>]. Indeed, disruption of daily GC rhythms is even linked to cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref057">57</xref>], perhaps related to the inhibitory effects of GC on cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref059">59</xref>]. These critical roles of GC in normal circadian physiology provide an important rationale for the use of dex to impose CCD in a cell-based model.</p>
<p>Notably, in our circadian transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), a significant number of genes exhibited circadian cycling in the daily dex-synchronized U2OS cells (<italic>n</italic> = 44), compared with cycling genes estimated in the same cells after a single dex treatment in a previous report (<italic>n</italic> = 7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref060">60</xref>]. This could be primarily due to different experimental and rhythm assessment procedures, for instance, with respect to the measured time points and analysis criteria used in each of the studies. Another possibility for the discrepancy is that the regular rhythmic environment, with daily dex treatment, induced more robust cycling of responsive genes. This is reminiscent of previous circadian gene expression profiling data showing that a large number of genes exhibit diurnal cycling, but not all cycle in free run, nor are all directly clock controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref061">61</xref>]. Given the robust diurnal fluctuation of GC, it is tempting to speculate that our daily dex-synchronization regimen closely mimics physiological cycling in the presence of light–dark cycles.</p>
<p>Malignant cell proliferation and tumor growth is a major pathological consequence of chronic jet lag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref007">7</xref>]. Underscoring the link between disrupted clocks and cancer, our unbiased approach, which consisted of characterizing many different cellular functions as well as conducting genome-wide RNA-seq to determine how cell physiology is perturbed by circadian disruption, reveals that cell proliferation, along with concomitant changes in gene expression, is the most highly affected function. Our chronic jet-lag protocol results in a dramatic increase in the ratio of oncogenic genes to tumor suppressor genes. Given the tumor suppressive effect of enhanced circadian function in a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref015">15</xref>], we suggest that chronic circadian perturbation tips the transcriptional balance of tumor-progressive and -suppressive genes in favor of promoting tumor survival and proliferation. This explains in part why carcinogen-induced or -injected tumors grow faster under chronic jet lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s010">S10C and S10D Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref004">4</xref>]. We note that clock proteins may also directly regulate tumor suppressors and oncogenic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref063">63</xref>]. However, as our chronic jet-lag experiments reported here are performed with cancer cells and induced tumor tissues, we cannot speak to how a jet-lag paradigm would impact nontransformed cells. Also, because not all cancer cells have functional circadian clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref064">64</xref>], the proposed mechanism would likely only apply to the subsets of cancers that maintain a clock function.</p>
<p>On the other hand, recent studies have shown that circadian rhythms can be reprogrammed or otherwise affected by tumors or multiple tumor components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref065">65</xref>]. For example, lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer reprogram circadian rhythms in liver metabolism and transcription, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref067">67</xref>]. Furthermore, cell cycle–related oncogenes (MYC, RAS) were found to affect the circadian clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref069">69</xref>]. These findings indicate a dynamic bidirectional relationship between circadian disruption and cancer progression.</p>
<p>Several mitogenic and oncogenic pathways signal to the cell cycle machinery through D-type cyclins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref009">9</xref>]. Consistent with this, our transcriptomic analysis reveals extensive up-regulation of upstream signals and downstream transcriptional activators of the cyclin D1 gene in U2OS cells exposed to chronic jet lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). More interestingly, cyclin D1 expression was markedly elevated in tumors, but not in other tissue, in chronically jet-lagged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). These results suggest that the expression of cell cycle proteins is more sensitive to chronic jet lag in cancerous cells. We note that cyclin D3, another D-type G1 cyclin important for cancer cell survival and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref071">71</xref>], was also up-regulated by CCD in our transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g003">Fig 3K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Our findings regarding cyclin D corroborate the reported oncogenic role of cyclin D in triggering spontaneous tumors or inducing tumors in response to mitogenic and oncogenic signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref072">72</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that cyclin D mediates abnormal tumor proliferation in response to chronic jet lag.</p>
<p>Molecular links between the circadian clock and the cell cycle have been suggested in a few previous studies. For instance, in a murine hepatectomy model, circadian regulation of the G2-M transition was proposed to be driven by clock-controlled expression of Wee1 G2 checkpoint kinase (Wee1), a key cell cycle inhibitor that phosphorylates and thereby inactivates the CDK1–cyclinB1 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref073">73</xref>]. Timely coordination of the G1/S phase is suggested by circadian transcriptional regulation of p21 and p16, which encode inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases, including CDK4/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref075">75</xref>]. In addition, the myelocytomatosis oncogene cellular homolog (Myc) proto-oncogene is thought to be regulated by BMAL1/neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) (a CLOCK paralogue) action on its E-boxes, which may contribute to enhanced tumor growth in Per2 mutant mice in response to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref076">76</xref>]. Myc can act through p27(Kip1), another multifunctional CDK inhibitor, to facilitate the activation of CDK4/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref077">77</xref>]. Our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that CLOCK/BMAL1 directly regulate cyclin D1, which likely contributes to rhythmic CDK4/6 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g004">Fig 4</xref>), so multiple circadian mechanisms may converge on CDK4/6. We show also that chronic jet lag alters the phosphorylation of RB, which is the rate-limiting substrate of cyclin D1–CDK4/6 in the cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref035">35</xref>]. Importantly, RB phosphorylation is predominantly affected at S807/811, which is a known CDK4/6 site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref078">78</xref>]. S807/811 on RB serves as a priming site whose induced phosphorylation releases the tumor-suppressive effect of RB and promotes cell cycle entry, as well as cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref040">40</xref>]. In this regard, rescue of RB-null cells (C33A) with RB phospho mutants (S807/811A) significantly blunted but did not completely abrogate the enhanced cell proliferation upon CCD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000228.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). We speculate that RB-like protein 1 (RBL1, p107), which has structural and functional similarities to RB and is regulated by cyclin D–CDK4/6 to de-repress E2F activity during G1/S cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref079">79</xref>], could contribute to enhanced cell proliferation upon chronic circadian disturbance.</p>
<p>Emerging cancer therapeutic efforts target G1/S cell cycle progression, with a focus on the development of selective CDK 4/6 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref046">46</xref>]. For instance, palbociclib (PD0332991, Ibrance; Pfizer) is a potent oral inhibitor of CDK4/6 initially approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with endocrine therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref080">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref081">81</xref>]. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies show that palbociclib has antiproliferative activity in several types of RB-positive tumors, and it is becoming more widely used to treat multiple cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref082">82</xref>]. Despite the growing clinical use of palbociclib and other CDK4/6 inhibitors such as abemaciclib (Lilly) and ribociclib (Novartis), these drugs are typically prescribed without any time-of-day indications. Our in vitro and in vivo chronopharmacological studies demonstrate that the cyclin D1-CDK4/6–RB pathway is a target for chronotherapy, likely because of circadian regulation of the G1/S phase. This pathway could even be a circadian marker for cancer therapy targeting the G1/S phase (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000228.g006">6</xref>).</p>
<p>Pharmacodynamic variability among cancer patients remains a daunting challenge in cancer drug therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref083">83</xref>]. Our findings strongly suggest that environmental or physiological perturbation of circadian rhythms such as shift work, abnormal sleep timing, or irregular psychosociological stresses can underlie interindividual variability in both cancer growth and response to cancer drugs. Circadian disruption may also be relevant for the chronic sleep loss and depression suffered by many cancer patients following diagnosis and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref084">84</xref>]. Given this, it is reasonable to expect that resetting of the body clock by scheduled light exposure, mealtimes, or exercise, alongside a carefully timed chemotherapy regimen, would improve antitumor treatment. Taken together, our study provides a mechanism for tumor susceptibility conferred by circadian dysregulation and highlights the importance of judicious application of cancer chronotherapy.</p>

<title>Animal studies</title>
<p>C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed (≤5/cage) under 12-hour light–12-hour dark conditions with food and water available ad libitum. Male mice (2–3 months old) were used in all experiments. After acclimation with standard lighting conditions of LD 12:12, with lights on from 5 AM (Zeitgeber time 0) to 5 PM (Zeitgeber time 12) for 2 weeks, the mice were injected with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> B16-10 cells subcutaneously along the right flank and separated into control and chronic jet-lag groups. For MCA-induced tumors, mice were injected subcutaneously along the right flank with 400 μg of 3-MCA in peanut oil (213942, Sigma, Louis, MO). After 30–60 days of the injection, the mice were separated into control and chronic jet-lag groups. The chronic jet-lag mice underwent repeated 8-hour advances of the light–dark cycle every 2 days for 11 days, while the control mice further remained in the LD 12:12 lighting regimen. Their locomotor activity was monitored as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000228.ref089">89</xref>]. Tumor growth was measured with a digital caliper three times per week. Tumor weight was computed as follows: (length × width<sup>2</sup>)/2. In all animal experiments, mice were euthanized when the tumor exceeded 20 mm in diameter (approximately a volume of 3,500 mm<sup>3</sup>). Tumor and liver tissues were collected at ZT3, ZT9, ZT15 to measure circadian changes of RB phosphorylation and expression of cell cycle proteins with western blot analysis, as described.</p>
