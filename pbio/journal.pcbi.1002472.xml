        <p>The increasingly complex and rapid transmission dynamics of many infectious diseases necessitates the use of new, more advanced methods for surveillance, early detection, and decision-making. Here, we demonstrate that a new method for optimizing surveillance networks can improve the quality of epidemiological information produced by typical provider-based networks. Using past surveillance and Internet search data, it determines the precise locations where providers should be enrolled. When applied to redesigning the provider-based, influenza-like-illness surveillance network (ILINet) for the state of Texas, the method identifies networks that are expected to significantly outperform the existing network with far fewer providers. This optimized network avoids informational redundancies and is thereby more effective than networks designed by conventional methods and a recently published algorithm based on maximizing population coverage. We show further that Google Flu Trends data, when incorporated into a network as a virtual provider, can enhance but not replace traditional surveillance methods.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Public health agencies use surveillance systems to detect and monitor chronic and infectious diseases. These systems often rely on data sources that are chosen based on loose guidelines or out of convenience. In this paper, we introduce a new, data-driven method for designing and improving surveillance systems. Our approach is a geographic optimization of data sources designed to achieve specific surveillance goals. We tested our method by re-designing Texas' provider-based influenza surveillance system (ILINet). The resulting networks better predicted influenza associated hospitalizations and contained fewer providers than the existing ILINet. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that the integration of Internet source data, like Google Flu Trends, into surveillance systems can enhance traditional, provider-based networks.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Since the Spanish Flu Pandemic of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the global public health community has made great strides towards the effective surveillance of infectious diseases. However, modern travel patterns, heterogeneity in human population densities, proximity to wildlife populations, and variable immunity interact to drive increasingly complex patterns of disease transmission and emergence. As a result, there is an increasing need for effective, evidence-based surveillance, early detection, and decision-making methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Brownstein1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Mnatsakanyan1">[3]</xref>. This need was clearly articulated in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by a directive from the Department of Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop a nationwide, real-time public health surveillance network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Bush1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-US1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) gathers data from thousands of healthcare providers across all fifty states. Throughout influenza season (CDC mandating reporting during weeks <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is approximately October through mid-May), participating providers are asked to report weekly the number of cases of influenza-like illness treated and total number of patients seen, by age group. Cases qualify as ILI if they manifest fever in excess of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>F along with a cough and/or a sore throat, without another known cause. Although the CDC receives reports of approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> million patient visits per year, many of the reports may use a loose application of the ILI case definition and/or may simply be inaccurate. The data are used in conjunction with other sources of laboratory, hospitalization and mortality data to monitor regional and national influenza activity and associated mortality. Similar national surveillance networks are in place in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> EU countries and elsewhere around the globe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Clothier1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Ordobs1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Each US state is responsible for recruiting and managing ILINet providers. The CDC advises states to recruit one regularly reporting sentinel provider per <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> residents, with a state-wide minimum of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sentinel providers. Since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has enrolled a total of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> volunteer providers. Participating providers regularly drop out of the network; Texas DSHS aims to maintain approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> active participants through year-round recruitment of providers in heavily populated areas (cities with populations of at least <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). DSHS also permits other (non-targeted) providers of family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, university student health services, emergency medicine, infectious disease, OB/GYN and urgent care to participate in the network. During the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> influenza season, the Texas ILINet included <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> providers with approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reporting most weeks of the influenza season.</p>
      <p>A number of statistical studies have demonstrated that ILI surveillance data is adequate for characterizing past influenza epidemics, monitoring populations for abnormal influenza activity, and forecasting the onsets and peaks of local influenza epidemics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Viboud1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Jiang1">[16]</xref>. However, the surveillance networks are often limited by non-representative samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Polgreen1">[17]</xref>, inaccurate and variable reporting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Yang1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Qunel1">[14]</xref>, and low reporting rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Clothier1">[6]</xref>. Some of these studies have yielded specific recommendations for improving the performance of the surveillance network, for example, inclusion of particular categories of hospitals in China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Yang1">[12]</xref>, preference for general practitioners over pediatricians in Paris, France <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Qunel1">[14]</xref>, and a general guideline to target practices with high reporting rates and high numbers of patient visits (per capita) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Clothier1">[6]</xref>. Polgreen et al. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> recently described a computational method for selecting ILINet providers so as to maximize coverage, that is, the number of people living within a specified distance of a provider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Polgreen1">[17]</xref>. They applied the approach to optimizing the placement of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> providers in the Iowa ILINet. While their algorithm ensures maximum coverage, it is not clear that maximum coverage is, in general, the most appropriate criterion for building a statistically informative ILINet.</p>
      <p>In <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Google.org launched Google Flu Trends, a website that translates the daily number of Googles search terms associated with signs, symptoms, and treatment for acute respiratory infections into an estimate of the number of ILI patients per <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> people. It was shown that Google Flu Trends reliably estimates national influenza activity in the US <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Ginsberg1">[18]</xref>, the state of Utah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Ginsberg1">[18]</xref>, and in some European countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Valdivia1">[19]</xref>, but it provided imperfect data regarding the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> H1N1 pandemic in New Zealand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Wilson1">[20]</xref>. We assessed the correlation between Google Flu Trends for Texas and Texas' ILINet data and found a correlation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, similar to those presented in Ginsberg et al. 2009 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Ginsberg1">[18]</xref> (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002472.s006">Text S1</xref>). The Google Flu Trends website includes ILI-related search activity down to the level of cities (in beta version as of November <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Thus, Google Flu Trends may serve as a valuable resource for influenza detection and forecasting if effectively integrated with public health data such as those coming from state ILINets.</p>
      <p>Here, we present an evaluation of the Texas Influenza-Like-Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), in terms of its ability to forecast statewide hospitalizations due to influenza (ICD9 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and unspecified pneumonia (ICD9 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Although we henceforth refer to this subset of hospitalizations as <italic>influenza-like hospitalizations</italic>, we emphasize that these data do not perfectly reflect influenza-related hospitalizations: some unrelated pneumonias may be classified under ICD9 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and some influenza cases may not be correctly diagnosed and/or recorded as influenza. Nonetheless, this subset of hospitalizations likely includes a large fraction of hospitalized influenza cases and exhibits strong seasonal dynamics that mirror ILINet trends. The inclusion of all three ICD9 codes was suggested by health officials at Texas DSHS who seek to use ILINet to ascertain seasonal influenza-related hospitalization rates throughout the state (Texas DSHS contract numbers <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Hospitalizations associated with these three codes in Texas accounted for between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all hospitalizations due to infections and roughly <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> billion dollars of hospitalization payments in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002472.s006">Text S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Using almost a decade of state-level ILINet and hospitalization data, we find that the existing network performs reasonably well in its ability to predict <italic>influenza-like hospitalizations</italic>. However, smaller, more carefully chosen sets of providers should yield higher quality surveillance data, which can be further enhanced with the integration of state-level Google Flu Trends data. For this analysis, we adapted a new, computationally tractable, multilinear regression approach to solving complex subset selection problems. The details of this method are presented below and can be tailored to meet a broad range of surveillance objectives.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2">
      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Using a submodular ILINet optimization algorithm, we investigate two scenarios for improving the Texas ILINet: designing a network from scratch and augmenting the existing network. We then evaluate the utility of incorporating Google Flu Trends as a virtual provider into an existing ILINet.</p>
      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>Designing a New ILINet</title>
        <p>To construct new sentinel surveillance networks, we choose individual providers sequentially from a pool of approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mock providers, one for each zip code in Texas, until we reach <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> total providers. At each step, the provider that most improves the quality of the epidemiological information produced by the network is added to the network. We optimize and evaluate the networks in terms of the time-lagged statistical correlation between aggregated ILINet provider reports (simulated by the model) and actual statewide <italic>influenza-like hospitalizations</italic>. Specifically, for each candidate network, we perform a least squares multilinear regression from the simulated ILINet time series to the actual Texas hospitalization time series, and use the coefficient of determination, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as the indicator of ILINet performance. Henceforth, we will refer to these models as <italic>ILINet regression models</italic>.</p>
        <p>We compare the networks generated by this method to networks generated by two naive models and a published computational method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Polgreen1">[17]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002472-g001">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Random</italic> selection models an open call for providers and entails selecting providers randomly with probabilities proportional to their zip code's population; <italic>Greedy</italic> selection prioritizes providers strictly by the population density of their zip code. Submodular optimization significantly outperforms these naive methods, particularly for small networks, with <italic>Random</italic> selection producing slightly more informative networks than <italic>Greedy</italic> selection.

            <title>Comparing ILINet estimates to actual state-wide influenza hospitalizations.</title>
            <p>Statewide hospitalizations are estimated using data from three ILINets: the 2008 Texas ILINet (ILINet 2008), which consisted of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> providers, and ILINets of the same size that were designed using submodular optimization (Submodular) and maximum coverage optimization with a 20 mile coverage distance (Geographic). (a) The estimates from each network are compared to actual Texas state-wide influenza hospital discharges from 2001–2008 (Observed). (b) The submodular ILINet yields estimates that are consistently closer to observed values than the other two ILINets. For each of the three networks, the following procedure was repeated <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> times: randomly sample a set of reporting profiles, one for each provider in the network; simulate an ILI time series for each provider in the network; perform an ordinary least squares multilinear regression from the simulated provider reports to the actual Texas influenza hospitalization data; and apply resulting regression model to the simulated provider time series data to produce estimates of statewide hospitalizations. The figures are based on averages across the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> estimated hospitalization time series for each ILINet.</p>

        <p>The submodular optimization algorithm is not guaranteed to find the highest performing provider network, and an exhaustive search for the optimal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> provider network from the pool of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> providers is computationally intractable. However, the submodular property of the objective function allows us to compute an upper bound on the performance of the optimal network, without knowing its actual composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002472-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The performance gap between the theoretical upper bound and the optimized networks may indicate that the upper bound is loose (higher than the performance of the true optimal network) and/or the existence of better networks that might be found using more powerful optimization methods.</p>
        <p>The networks selected by submodular optimization reveal some unexpected design principles. Most of the Texas population resides in Houston and the “I-35 corridor” – a North-South transportation corridor spanning San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002472-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). The first ten provider locations selected by submodular optimization are spread throughout the eastern half of the state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002472-g004">Figure 4a</xref>, pink circles). While most of the providers are concentrated closer to Texas' population belt, only two are actually located within Texas' major population centers (in this case, College Station).</p>

        <p>The submodular networks are qualitatively different from the networks created by the other algorithms considered, which focus providers within the major population centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002472-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). The higher performance of the submodular ILINets suggest that over-concentration of providers in major population centers is unnecessary. Influenza levels in the major population centers are strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002472-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). Thus, ILINet information from San Antonio, for example, will also be indicative of influenza levels in Austin and Dallas. This synchrony probably arises, in part, from extensive travel between the major Texas population centers.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Since the mid twentieth century, influenza surveillance has been recognized as an increasingly complex problem of global concern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Langmuir1">[22]</xref>. However, the majority of statistical research has focused on the analysis of surveillance data rather than the data collection itself, with a few notable exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Yang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Polgreen1">[17]</xref>. High quality data is essential for effectively monitoring seasonal dynamics, detecting anomalies, such as emerging pandemic strains, and implementing effective time-sensitive control measures. Using a new method for optimizing provider-based surveillance systems, we have shown that the Texas state ILINet would benefit from the inclusion of a few strategically selected providers and the use of Internet data streams.</p>
      <p>Our method works by iteratively selecting providers that contribute the most information about <italic>influenza-like hospitalizations</italic>. We quantified the performance of various ILINets using the coefficient of determination <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> resulting from a multi-linear regression between each provider's time series and state-wide <italic>influenza-like hospitalizations</italic>. Importantly, these simulated providers have reporting rates and error distributions estimated from actual ILINet providers in Texas (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002472.s006">Text S1</xref>). The result is a prioritized list of zip codes for inclusion in an ILINet that can be used for future ILINet recruiting. Although this analysis was specifically motivated by the Texas DSHS interest in predicting hospitalizations with ICD9 codes <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, our method can be readily extended to design a network for any disease or influenza definition with the appropriate historical data. In general, the method requires both historical provider reports and historical time series of the prediction target. However, if one has reasonable estimates of provider reporting rates and informational noise from another source (e.g., estimates from a surveillance network in another region or for another disease), then historical provider reports are not necessary.</p>
      <p>ILINet provider reports do not necessarily reflect true influenza activity. Rather they are supposed to indicate the number of patients that meet the clinical ILI case definition, which results in a substantial number of false positives (reported non-influenza cases) and false negatives (missed cases of influenza) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Monto1">[23]</xref>. The case definition for ILI is often loosely applied, further confounding the relationship between these measures and true influenza. Similarly, the ICD9 codes used in our analysis do not correspond perfectly to influenza hospitalizations: some influenza cases will fail to be classified under those codes, and some non-influenza cases will be. Nonetheless, public health agencies are interested in monitoring and forecasting the large numbers of costly hospitalizations associated with these codes. We find that ILINet surveillance data correlates strongly with this set of <italic>influenza-like hospitalizations</italic>, and that the networks can be designed to be even more informative.</p>
      <p>Although we provide only a single example here, this optimization method can be readily applied to designing surveillance networks for a wide range of diseases on any geographic scale, provided historical data are available and the goals of the surveillance network can be quantified. For example, surveillance networks could be designed to detect emerging strains of influenza on a global scale, monitor influenza in countries without surveillance networks, or track other infectious diseases such as malaria, whooping cough, or tuberculosis or non-infectious diseases and chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, cancer or obesity that exhibit heterogeneity in space, time or by population subgroup. As we have shown with Google Flu Trends, our method can be leveraged to evaluate the potential utility of incorporating other Internet trend data mined from search, social media, and online commerce platforms into traditional surveillance systems.</p>
      <p>While optimized networks meet their specified goals, they may suffer from over optimization and be unable to provide valuable information for other diseases or even for the focal disease during atypical situations. For example, a surveillance network designed for detecting the early emergence of pandemic influenza may look very different from one optimized to monitor seasonal influenza. Furthermore, an ILINet optimized to predict <italic>influenza-like hospitalizations</italic> in a specific socio-economic group, geographic region, or race/ethnicity may look very different from an ILINet optimized to predict state-wide hospitalizations. When optimizing networks, it is thus important to carefully consider the full range of possible applications of the network and integrate diverse objectives into the optimization analysis.</p>
      <p>The optimized Texas ILINets described above exhibit much less redundancy (geographic overlap in providers) than the actual Texas ILINet. Whereas CDC guidelines have led Texas DSHS to focus the majority of recruitment on high population centers, the optimizer only sparsely covered the major urban areas because of their synchrony in influenza activity. This is an important distinction between submodular optimization and the other methods considered (<italic>Geographic</italic>, <italic>Random</italic> and <italic>Greedy</italic>). The submodular method does not track population density and instead adds providers who contribute the most marginal information to the network. Consequently, it places far more providers in rural areas than the other methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002472-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). There can be substantial year-to-year variation in spatial synchrony for seasonal influenza, driven by the predominant influenza strains and commuter traffic between population centers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Viboud2">[24]</xref>. As long as the historical data used during optimization reflect this stochasticity, the resulting networks will be robust. However, synchrony by geography and population density does not occur for all diseases including emerging pandemic influenza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Viboud2">[24]</xref>; thus the relatively sparse networks designed for forecasting seasonal influenza hospitalizations may not be appropriate for other surveillance objectives, like detecting emerging pandemic strains or other rare events. For example, a recent study of influenza surveillance in Beijing, PRC suggested that large hospitals provided the best surveillance information for seasonal influenza, while smaller provincial hospitals were more useful for monitoring H5N1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Yang1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although our method outperforms the <italic>Maximal Coverage Method</italic> (MCM), referred to as <italic>Geographic</italic>, proposed by Polgreen et al. (2009), there are several caveats. First, population densities and travel patterns within Texas are highly non-uniform. The two methods might perform similarly for regions with greater spatial uniformity. Second, our method is data intensive, requiring historical surveillance data that may not be available, for example, in developing nations, whereas the population density data required for MCM is widely available. However, the type of data used in this study is readily available to most state public health agencies in the United States. For example, the CDC's Influenza Hospitalization Network (FluSurv-NET) collects weekly reports on laboratory confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in fourteen states. In addition, alternative internet-based data sources like Google Flu Trends are becoming available. Third, as discussed above, our networks are optimized towards specific goals and may thus have no expected level of performance for alternate surveillance goals. Important future research should focus on designing networks able to perform well under a range of surveillance goals. Fourth, neither ILINet data nor <italic>influenza-like hospitalizations</italic> correspond perfectly to actual influenza activity. One could instead optimize ILINets using historical time series of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza. Although some provider locations and the estimated regression models may change, we conjecture that the general geospatial distribution of providers will not change significantly. Fourth, we followed Polgreen et al. (2009)'s use of Euclidean distances. However, travel distance is known to correlate more strongly with influenza transmission than Euclidean distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Viboud2">[24]</xref>, and thus alternative distance metrics might improve the performance of the MCM method. Finally, while submodular optimization generally outperforms the other design methods in out-of-sample prediction of <italic>influenza-like hospitalizations</italic>, it suffers from overfitting when the number of providers in the network approaches the number of data points in the historical time series.</p>
      <p>The impressive performance of Google Flu Trends leads us to question the role of traditional methods, such as provider-based surveillance networks, in next generation disease surveillance systems. While Texas Google Flu Trends alone providers almost as much information about state-wide influenza hospital discharges as the entire 2008 Texas ILINet, an optimized ILINet of the same size contains <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> more information than Google Flu Trends alone. Adding Google Flu Trends to this optimized network as a virtual provider increases its performance by an additional <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Internet driven data streams, like Google Flu Trends, may have age and socio-economic biases that over-represent certain groups, a possible explanation for the difference in providers selected when Google Flu Trends is included, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002472-g004">Figure 4a</xref>. Given the relatively low cost of voluntary provider surveillance networks, synergistic approaches that combine data from conventional and Internet sources offer a promising path forward for public health surveillance.</p>
      <p>This optimization method was conceived through a collaboration between The University of Texas at Austin and the Texas Department of State Health Services to evaluate and improve the Texas ILINet. The development and utility of quantitative methods to support public health decision making hinges on the continued partnership between researchers and public health agencies.</p>

        <title>Provider Reporting Model</title>
        <p>The first step in the ILINet optimization is to build a data-driven model reflecting actual provider reporting rates and informational noise, that is, inconsistencies between provider reports and true local influenza prevalence.</p>
        <p>We model reporting as a Markov process, where each provider is in a “reporting” or “non-reporting” state. A provider in the reporting state enters weekly reports, while a provider in the non-reporting state does not enter reports. At the end of each week, providers independently transition between the reporting and non-reporting states. Such a Markov process model allows for streaks of reporting and streaks of non-reporting for each provider, which is typical for ILINet providers. We estimate transition probabilities between states from actual ILINet provider report data. For each provider, the transition probability from reporting to non-reporting is estimated by dividing the number of times the transition occurred by the number of times any transition out of reporting is observed. The probabilities of remaining in the current reporting state and transitioning from non-reporting to reporting are estimated similarly.</p>
        <p>We model noise in reports using a standard regression noise model of the form<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e090" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>(<italic>i</italic>) denotes the number of ILI cases reported by the provider in week <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>(<italic>i</italic>) denotes the estimated prevalence of ILI in the provider's zip code in week <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are regression constants fixed for the provider; and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a normally distributed noise term with variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> also fixed for the provider. For existing providers, we use empirical time series (their past ILINet reporting data matched with local ILI prevalence, described below) to estimate the constants <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using least squares linear regression. This noise model has the intuitive interpretation that each provider's reports are a noisy reading of the percent of the population with ILI in the provider's zip code.</p>
        <p>We use the Texas hospital discharge data to estimate the local ILI prevalences (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>(<italic>i</italic>)) for each zip code. Given an estimate of the influenza hospitalization rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Thompson1">[27]</xref> and assuming that each individual with ILI is hospitalized independently, we can obtain a distribution for the number of influenza-related hospitalizations in a zip code, given the number of ILI cases in the zip code. Using Bayes rule, a uniform prior, and the real number of influenza-related hospitalizations (from the hospital discharge data), we derive distributions for the number of ILI cases for each zip code and each week. We then set <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>(i) for each zip code equal to the mean of the distribution of ILI cases in that zip code for week <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, divided by the population of the zip code.</p>

        <title>Generating Pools of Mock Providers</title>
        <p>The second step in the ILINet optimization is to generate a pool of mock providers. For each actual provider in the Texas ILINet, we estimate a reporting profile specified by [1)] transition probabilities between reporting and non-reporting (Markov) states, and the constants <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, modeling noise in the weekly ILI reports. To generate a mock provider in a specified zip code, we select a uniformly random reporting profile out of all reporting profiles estimated from existing providers. The generated mock providers are thereby given reporting characteristics typical of existing providers. We can then generate an ILI report time series for a mock provider, by 1) generating reports only during reporting weeks, and calculating reports using equation (1) with the constants given in the provider's reporting profile and estimates of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>(<italic>i</italic>) for the mock provider's zip code.</p>
        <p>We select providers from pools consisting of a single mock provider from each zip code. Zip codes offer a convenient spatial resolution, because they have geographic specificity and are recorded in both the Texas ILINet and hospital discharge data. The optimization algorithm is not aware of a mock provider's reporting profile when the provider is selected (discussed below).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s4d">
        <title>Provider Selection Optimization</title>
        <p>The final step in our ILINet design method is selecting an optimized subset of providers from the mock provider pool. We seek the subset that most effectively predicts a target time series (henceforth, goal), as measured by the coefficient of determination (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) from a least squares multilinear regression to the goal from the report time series for all providers in the subset. Specifically, the objective function is given by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the goal random variable; <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a subset of the mock provider pool; <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are provider reports for provider <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the best multilinear regression coefficients (values that minimize the second term in the numerator).</p>
        <p>There are several advantages to this objective function. First, it allows us to optimize an ILINet for predicting a particular random variable. Here, we set the goal to be state-wide influenza-related hospitalizations for Texas. This method can be applied similarly to design surveillance networks that predict, for example, morbidity and/or mortality within specific age groups or high risk groups.</p>
        <p>Second, the objective function is submodular in the set of providers, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Das1">[28]</xref>, implying generally that adding a new provider to a small network will improve performance more than adding the provider to a larger network. The submodular property enables computationally efficient searches for near optimal networks and guarantees a good level of performance from the resulting network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Nemhauser1">[29]</xref>. Without a submodular objective function, optimization of a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> provider ILINet may require an exhaustive search of all subsets of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> providers from the provider pool, which quickly becomes intractable. For example, an exhaustive search for the optimal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> provider Texas ILINet from our pool of approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mock providers would require roughly <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> regressions.</p>
        <p>Taking advantage of the submodular property, we rapidly build high performing networks (with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> providers) according to the following algorithm:</p>

Finally, even if implemented naively, the algorithm only requires approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> regressions to select <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> providers from a pool of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>When optimizing, it is important to consider potential noise (underreporting and discrepancies between provider reports and actual ILI activity in the zip code). However, we assume that one cannot predict the performance of a particular provider before the provider is recruited into the network. To address this issue, the optimization's objective function is an expectation over the possible provider reporting profiles. Specifically, we define <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a random variable describing the provider reporting profile for the entire pool of mock providers. If <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a specific reporting profile, then the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> objective function can be written as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>To design the ILINet, we solve the following optimization problem<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The objective function is a convex combination of submodular functions, and thus is also submodular.

        <title>Principal Component Analysis of Hospitalization Time Series across Texas Zip Codes</title>
        <p>To analyze similarities in ILI hospitalizations across different zip codes, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002472-Jolliffe1">[31]</xref>. Specifically, we perform PCA on the centered (mean zero), standardized (unit variance) hospitalization time series of all zip codes in Texas. We first compute a time series for the first principal component, and then compute an <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each zip code, based on a linear regression from the first principal component to the zip code's centered, standardized hospitalizations. Zip codes with high <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values have hospitalization patterns that exhibit high temporal synchronicity with the first principal component.</p>

        <title>Out-of-Sample Validation</title>
        <p>To validate our method, we first use submodular optimization to create a provider network of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> providers, using only data from 2001 to 2007, and then evaluate the performance of the network in predicting 2008 influenza-like hospitalizations. Specifically, after creating the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-provider network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), we use actual hospitalization data and mock provider reports for the 2001–2007 period to fit a multilinear regression model of the form <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is time series of state-wide influenza-like hospitalizations at week <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for weeks in 2001 to 2007, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the mock report time series of provider <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> during week <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for weeks in 2001 to 2007, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the best multilinear regression coefficient associated with provider <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>We then use the estimated multilinear regression function to forecast state-wide influenza-like hospitalization during 2008 from mock provider reports of 2008, and compare these forecasts to actual 2008 hospitalization data. This simulates a real-world prediction, where only historical data is available to create the provider network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and estimate the prediction function (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s), and then the most recent provider reports (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s) are used to make predictions. We evaluate the 2008 predictions using a variance reduction measure similar to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, except that the multilinear prediction model uses coefficients estimated from prior data, as given by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the hospitalization time series in 2008, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the provider noise profile, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the mock provider reports in 2008. Importantly, we first calculate an expected value for the provider reports, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, given the noise profiles <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, before calculating <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We also considered an alternative validation method in which we first calculate an <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each provider report and noise-profile combination, and then analyze the resulting distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002472.s006">Text S1</xref> for results).</p>

On average 500 million dollars of hospital charges were billed per month to patients associated with ICD9s 486, 487 and 488.

This represents nearly 1 percent of the yearly GDP in Texas, which is not much less than the year-to-year economic growth.</p>

          <p><bold>Out-of-Sample Model Validation -</bold> We used data from 2001–2007 to design ILINets and to fit multi-linear prediction functions, and then generated provider-report based forecasts of hospitalizations during 2008 (without using any data from 2008) and compared these predictions to actual 2008 hospitalization data (see text for details). The <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values reflect the predictive performance of the different ILINets. For each ILINet, we predicted 100 time series from simulated provider reports, each time drawing random deviates from the provider noise and reporting distributions, and then compared them to actual 2008 hospitalizations by calculating <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Negative values indicate that the predicted hospitalization time series are more variable than the actual time series. The increasingly poor performance and uncertainty with additional providers is a result of over-fitting of the prediction model to data from the 2001–2007 training period. The submodular method is the only one to yield ILINets with a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002472.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> greater than zero.</p>

When simulated providers had reporting probabilities and noise similar to actual providers the resulting network contained more geographic redundancy than one built from simulated providers with perfect information and reporting rates. All results presented in the manuscript were determined using simulated providers with patterns of imperfect and variable reporting derived from actual ILINet data.
