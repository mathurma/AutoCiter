        <title>Summary</title>
        <p>Modern infectious disease epidemiology builds on two independently developed fields: classical epidemiology and dynamical epidemiology. Over the past decade, integration of the two fields has increased in research practice, but training options within the fields remain distinct with few opportunities for integration in the classroom. The annual Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED) at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences has begun to address this gap. MMED offers participants exposure to a broad range of concepts and techniques from both epidemiological traditions. During MMED 2010 we developed a pedagogical approach that bridges the traditional distinction between classical and dynamical epidemiology and can be used at multiple educational levels, from high school to graduate level courses. The approach is hands-on, consisting of a real-time simulation of a stochastic outbreak in course participants, including realistic data reporting, followed by a variety of mathematical and statistical analyses, stemming from both epidemiological traditions. During the exercise, dynamical epidemiologists developed empirical skills such as study design and learned concepts of bias while classical epidemiologists were trained in systems thinking and began to understand epidemics as dynamic nonlinear processes. We believe this type of integrated educational tool will prove extremely valuable in the training of future infectious disease epidemiologists. We also believe that such interdisciplinary training will be critical for local capacity building in analytical epidemiology as Africa continues to produce new cohorts of well-trained mathematicians, statisticians, and scientists. And because the lessons draw on skills and concepts from many fields in biology—from pathogen biology, evolutionary dynamics of host–pathogen interactions, and the ecology of infectious disease to bioinformatics, computational biology, and statistics—this exercise can be incorporated into a broad array of life sciences courses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The goal of epidemiology is to identify the biological, behavioral, and environmental causes of health outcomes or diseases and apply this knowledge to the development of effective disease interventions to improve public health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Galea1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Susser1">[3]</xref>. Diseases are complex phenomena that arise from various interacting processes, challenging epidemiologists to extract important causal relationships from observational and experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Galea1">[1]</xref>. Infectious diseases add a level of complexity because infection occurs through (direct or indirect) interaction between susceptible and infectious individuals. The rate of new infections depends on the number or proportion of individuals who are susceptible and infectious. These quantities themselves evolve through time as new individuals become infected. In other words, infectious disease dynamics are nonlinear. The biological, behavioral, evolutionary, and environmental nuances of each disease–host system determine the dynamics of disease incidence and have important implications for designing and evaluating interventions. Patterns of disease do not only arise from individual-level characteristics (e.g., genetics, behavior, age, sex, health status), but also from the history of infection in the greater population. Thus, consideration of individual-level data independent of the population context may be misleading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Miller1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Koopman1">[5]</xref>. In fact, the number or proportion of susceptible, infected, and immune individuals in the population often plays a greater role in determining the current individual-level risk of infection than an individual's characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-King1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Stone1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Thus, population-level epidemiological patterns emerge from the complex, interacting processes governing pathogen biology, host biology, host behavior, the environment, and their interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Miller1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Grassly1">[8]</xref>. The field of epidemiology has taken two broad methodological approaches to understand these interacting processes. While various terms have been used to describe these two subfields, we call them classical epidemiology and dynamical epidemiology (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s016">Text S1</xref> for more details). Classical epidemiology builds on assumptions of independence between individuals (or clusters thereof) to identify correlations between risk (or protective) factors and disease, with the goal of establishing a causal relationship between them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Galea1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Susser1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Koopman2">[9]</xref>. Dynamical (mechanistic) epidemiology has largely developed from ecology and its subfield, population dynamics, along with other applications of mathematics to biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Anderson1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Heesterbeek1">[11]</xref>. In contrast to the correlational approach of classical epidemiology, dynamical epidemiology aims to understand disease dynamics with nonlinear transmission models that explicitly account for the interactions between individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Koopman1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Grassly1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Hethcote1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Firmly rooted in empirical research, classical epidemiology takes a phenomenalistic approach that focuses more on whether a causal relationship exists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Rothman1">[13]</xref> than the mechanistic nature of the relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Koopman1">[5]</xref>. While extremely practical, this reductionist approach frequently ignores the dependence between observations of infectious outcomes and can lead to spurious conclusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Koopman1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Cooper1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Eisenberg1">[15]</xref>. Dynamical epidemiology, in contrast, focuses on how mechanistic interactions between individuals lead to population-scale patterns and emphasizes understanding realistic dynamics. Ironically, this realism often comes at the expense of being partially or completely divorced from real data, because detailed data on mechanistic processes are rare. Further, dynamic models frequently ignore sources of bias or random error in the data, which can dramatically alter model results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-King1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-White1">[16]</xref>. For example, dynamic models often use parameters from the literature to describe mechanistic processes without careful attention to the original source of the parameter's estimation and associated bias or error therein. Model results are also often used to claim strong conclusions without comparing model outputs to real epidemiological time series data. Dynamic epidemiologists nevertheless attempt to make robust conclusions using sensitivity analyses that explore model behavior over a large set of viable hypothetical scenarios.</p>
      <p>Both approaches have played successful roles in public health <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Grassly1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Rohani1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Male1">[19]</xref>, though remaining rather distinct fields with studies using dynamical models often published in ecological, mathematical, or interdisciplinary journals but rarely in epidemiological journals. Fifteen years ago Susser and Susser (1996) advocated the more coherent discipline of eco-epidemiology, with classical epidemiology subsumed by a greater ecological framework that considers mechanistic processes at various physical, temporal, and demographic scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Susser1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-March1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Susser2">[21]</xref>. And though, in our experience, scientists at advanced stages in either field are often largely unaware of the other field's existence, projects integrating these approaches have increased in research practice, often yielding otherwise unattainable insight. For example, using a dynamic model Lietman et al. (1999) found that trachoma (the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide) elimination may be feasible by biannual treatment of children with a single dose of azithromycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Lietman1">[22]</xref>. They then formulated a cluster-randomized controlled trial that verified this finding empirically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-House1">[23]</xref>. Finally, after fitting a dynamic model to the empirical data collected during this trial they demonstrated that individual-level transmission efficiency decreases with decreasing disease prevalence, making elimination of the disease easier than expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Lietman2">[24]</xref>. As a second example, Eisenberg et al. (2011) found that individual-level antibiotic use proved insufficient to explain geographic variation in the prevalence of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> antibiotic resistance, but that this phenomenon could be explained by interactions between village-specific antibiotic use and transmission rates in a dynamic model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Eisenberg1">[15]</xref>. In both examples, a close alliance between methods in classical and dynamical epidemiology allowed systems mechanisms to inform study design and vice versa, yielding insight with a real potential to improve public health.</p>
      <p>Despite such successes, training options within the fields remain distinct. Furthermore, the very few scientists with training in both disciplines seldom receive formal instruction explaining how they complement each other. Reflecting the severity of this rift, a recent published symposium on the future of epidemiological education lacked any discussion of dynamical approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Buring1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Samet1">[28]</xref>. We do not believe that all dynamical epidemiologists must be able to design empirical studies nor that all classical epidemiologists must be able to construct dynamical models. However, understanding the utility of and fundamental concepts within each discipline will allow fruitful collaboration between the fields as demonstrated in the examples above. The ability to think from both perspectives allows researchers to choose the most suitable set of methods for a given question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Galea1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Susser1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Koopman2">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-March1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Susser2">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The annual Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED) at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Muizenberg, South Africa, is working to address this gap. African capacity in epidemiology is in short supply despite the continent's disproportionate burden of disease and burgeoning new cohorts of African students trained in biomathematics, biology, and public health. MMED offers participants (ranging from undergraduate students to professors) exposure to a broad range of concepts and techniques from both classical and dynamical epidemiology, while explicitly highlighting how the two approaches complement each other and fit into a larger context. Selected lecture material from MMED is provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s008">Figures S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s009">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s010">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s011">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s012">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s013">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s014">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s015">S8</xref>.</p>
      <p>During MMED we designed the following pedagogical tool to address the rift between classical and dynamical epidemiology in which participants not only design studies and collect data prior to analysis, but also observe pathogen transmission in a way that reveals how epidemics are inherently nonlinear stochastic (i.e., random) processes. The approach is hands-on, consisting of the real-time simulation of a stochastic outbreak among course participants, including realistic data reporting, followed by analyses from both epidemiological traditions. We believe this type of integrated educational tool can stimulate the training of a cohort of infectious disease epidemiologists who are well acquainted with both the dynamical systems nature of epidemiological processes as well as the empirical design and analytical issues associated with investigating causal relationships between risk factors and disease.</p>

      <title>The Emergence of an Infectious Disease: Muizenberg Mathematical Fever</title>
      <p>At the 2010 and 2011 MMED Clinics we instigated outbreaks of a novel infectious agent, Muizenberg Mathematical Fever (MMF), in our course participants. The infectious agent was a paper form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s017">Text S2</xref>). Index cases were initiated through surreptitious distribution of a small number of infection forms on the first day of the Clinic. The paper provided simple instructions for newly infected individuals. Following the instructions, individuals used random number generators in the free statistical programming language R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-R1">[29]</xref> to determine a Poisson random number (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pbio-1001295-box002">Box 1</xref>) of potentially infectious contacts they would generate. The infected individual would then print out new infection forms from a webpage and discreetly hand these to other participants without knowledge of who had already been infected, recording the time of those infectious contacts. A Bernoulli random number generator was similarly used to determine whether or not an infection was symptomatic. Only symptomatic individuals would report to our health care system (a specified faculty member) that they were sick. However, all new infections were reported to a second faculty member via email for tracking purposes. Recovery consisted of delivering the infecting paper to a third faculty member. Thus, each outbreak generated two datasets: (1) a realistic provider-based surveillance system that recorded symptomatic cases and time of symptom onset; and (2) an unrealistically accurate knowledge of the underlying transmission dynamics.</p>

      <p>The outbreaks percolated through participants before burning out, much like epidemics of biological pathogens. While we determined <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> (the number of susceptible individuals infected by an index case introduced into an entirely susceptible population; see glossary in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s016">Text S1</xref>) and the symptomatic proportion, participants' behavior (e.g., who they infected and when they did it) also affected disease dynamics. The unpredictable nature of these events added to the realism of our outbreak. During the 2011 outbreak, we dictated that repeat attendees would be immune to MMF, thereby seeding a protective (risk) factor for participants to find during the analytical stage of the exercise.</p>

      <title>Outbreak Investigation</title>
      <p>Initiation of the MMF outbreaks resulted in a complex epidemiological process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001295-g001">Figure 1</xref>) that produced several datasets. These data gave participants the opportunity to apply a variety of methods from both classical epidemiology and dynamical epidemiology to both characterize and understand the transmission process. Many participants were well trained in dynamical epidemiology, but lacked strong empirical skills. Thus, we placed an emphasis on understanding all the steps from data generation to analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001295-Buring1">[25]</xref>. Participants learned to clean raw datasets, putting them into analyzable form, formed small groups and chose one or more research goals, and then selected the appropriate methods to achieve those goals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001295-t001">Table 1</xref>), thereby learning concepts such as confounding, selection bias, information bias, and random error as they proceeded to identify risk factors for disease exposure (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pbio-1001295-box003">Box 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001295-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In order to collect data for a retrospective cohort study participants crafted surveys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001295.s020">Text S5</xref>), learning aspects of survey design. Participants conducting mathematical analyses learned the relationship between susceptible depletion and epidemic fadeout (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pbio-1001295-box003">Box 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001295-g001">Figure 1</xref>), simulated the effect of vaccination or immunity on outbreak dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001295-g003">Figure 3</xref>), and explored how heterogeneity in disease network structure affects transmission dynamics and, subsequently, disease incidence. Groups then presented their results, describing their goals, methods, results, an interpretation of these results, and any shortcomings. Importantly, these presentations revealed methods' assumptions and utilities, clarifying how the various risk factors and mathematical methods differ from and complement each other. After their presentations groups were asked various questions to assess their understandings of the various concepts and methods presented (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pbio-1001295-box004">Box 3</xref>).

          <p>Epidemic time series for the outbreaks at the 2010 (A) and 2011 (B) outbreaks. The former and latter outbreaks differ by their different basic reproductive numbers (defined as the average number of people an infectious individual infects if the rest of the population is susceptible; <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1.23 and 1.82, respectively), the initial number of infectious individuals in the population (2 and 4, respectively), and the number of individuals immune at the start of the outbreak (0 and 14, respectively). (C and D) demonstrate how the effective reproductive number (<italic>R</italic><sub>eff</sub>; average number of individuals each infected person infects) changes during the course of the outbreak as the number of susceptibles decreases and that the epidemic begins to burn out when <italic>R</italic><sub>eff</sub> decreases below 1 and infectious individuals no longer replace themselves with new infections.

          <title>Demonstration of information and confounding bias with simulated outbreak data.</title>
          <p>(A) Muizenberg Mathematical Fever 2011 outbreak data to illustrate how using a case definition with imperfect sensitivity (symptomatic disease) can cause nondifferential misclassification bias (the category of information bias where exposed and unexposed individuals are equally likely to be misclassified). Nondifferential misclassification biases the association between a risk factor and a disease outcome towards the null hypothesis of no association (odds ratio = 1). While attendance at the prior year's clinic was actually protective (black square and 95% CI), this bias was sufficient to cause the confidence interval for the odds ratio of this very protective variable to overlap (gray). (B) illustrates how a risk factor (arrival a day or more early to the clinic) that has no real association to a disease outcome can appear associated through confounding. Individuals who had attended the clinic in prior years were less likely to come to the clinic early and were also protected (i.e., A). Consequently, early attendance appeared associated with a higher risk of disease in a univariate analysis (gray) though the CI contains the null hypothesis of no association in a multivariate analysis that adjusts for prior attendance (black).

          <title>Utility of stochastic simulation to study the effect of vaccination on future outbreaks.</title>
          <p>(A) Five stochastic simulations of Muizenberg Mathematical Fever outbreaks using transmission parameters fit from the 2011 outbreak data but with only one infected individual initiating the outbreak (instead of four) but the same proportion initially immune (25%). In comparison to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001295-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, the outbreak would appear less likely to take off (with four simulated outbreaks burning out by Wednesday) if only one infected individual initiated the outbreak. (B) shows the distribution of outbreak size (total number infected before burnout) among simulated outbreaks in populations with different immune proportions at the outbreak initiation. The black line shows the median outbreak size among 1,000 stochastic simulations for each immune proportion and the gray regions show 10% quantiles of outbreak size. Only small levels of immunity are necessary to make outbreaks rare (with a fifth of the population immune 50% of simulated outbreaks never exceed more than two secondary cases), but just by chance larger outbreaks still occur.

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This educational approach provides a much-needed conceptual integration of risk factor and mathematical approaches in epidemiological training, illuminating their strengths, weaknesses, and how they complement each other. Further, this exercise is of interest and understandable to students in other fields. Much of the exercise is simple enough to be performed by adequately trained high school students and could therefore even serve as an early introduction to infectious disease epidemiology. The exercise is also perfectly suited to undergraduate or graduate courses in epidemiology, infectious diseases, public health, biomathematics, computational biology, statistics, and nonlinear dynamics. Such tools will stimulate training of epidemiologists able to think from both the classical and dynamical perspectives. Particularly in developing countries where training is only slowly becoming more interdisciplinary, exercises such as MMF teach participants how subfields of public health complement each other and produce professionals more able to collaborate across disciplines.</p>
