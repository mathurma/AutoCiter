        <p>The circadian clock is synchronized with the day-night cycle primarily by light. Fish represent fascinating models for deciphering the light input pathway to the vertebrate clock since fish cell clocks are regulated by direct light exposure.

Our results reveal that the cavefish retains a food-entrainable clock that oscillates with an infradian period. Importantly, however, this clock is not regulated by light. This comparative study pinpoints the two extra-retinal photoreceptors Melanopsin (Opn4m2) and TMT-opsin as essential upstream elements of the peripheral clock light input pathway.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The circadian clock is a physiological timing mechanism that allows organisms to anticipate and adapt to the day-night cycle. Since it ticks with a period that is not precisely 24 h, it is vital that it is reset on a daily basis by signals such as light to ensure that it remains synchronized with the day-night cycle. The molecular mechanisms whereby light regulates the clock remain incompletely understood. Here we have studied a cavefish that has evolved for millions of years in the perpetual darkness of subterranean caves in Somalia. Like many other cave animals, these fish display striking adaptations to their extreme environment, including complete eye degeneration. We show that despite evolving in a constant environment, this blind cavefish still retains a circadian clock. However, this clock ticks with an extremely long period (nearly 47 h), and importantly it does not respond to light. We reveal that eye loss does not account for this “blind” clock. Specifically, mutations of two widely expressed non-visual opsin photoreceptors (Melanopsin and TMT opsin) are responsible for the blind clock phenotype in the cavefish. Our work illustrates the great utility of cavefish for studying the evolution and regulation of the circadian clock.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The circadian clock is a highly conserved, physiological timing mechanism that allows organisms to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes and it is synchronized primarily by light. In mammals, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells serve as the principal circadian photoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Bailes1">[1]</xref>. In non-mammalian vertebrates, photoreceptors located outside of the retina (in the pineal complex and in the deep brain) have also been implicated in the regulation of the circadian timing system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Bertolucci1">[2]</xref>. At the core of the vertebrate circadian clock is a transcription translation feedback loop mechanism composed of activator and repressor clock proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-WagerSmith1">[3]</xref>. Light-induced expression of certain clock genes represents a key step in the relay of lighting information to the core clock machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Tamai1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Vatine1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) represents a fascinating model to study the mechanisms whereby light regulates the clock. The “peripheral” clocks in most zebrafish tissues and even cell lines are entrained by direct exposure to light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Whitmore1">[6]</xref>. However, fundamental questions concerning the identity of the widely expressed photoreceptor molecules and how they signal to peripheral clocks remain unanswered. To date, a set of widely expressed opsins, one cryptochrome homolog, and flavin-containing oxidases have all been implicated as candidate peripheral photoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Hirayama1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Moutsaki1">[9]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In certain extreme environments such as caves some fish species have remained completely isolated from the day-night cycle for millions of years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Colli1">[10]</xref>. They show convergent evolution, sharing a range of striking physical “troglomorphic” properties including notably degeneration of the eyes during early development. However, many aspects of cavefish biology still remain incompletely understood. Does evolution in constant darkness lead to loss of other aspects of photoreceptor function including regulation of peripheral circadian clocks by light? Furthermore, do these remarkable animals even retain normal circadian clocks?</p>
      <p>In this report we explore the circadian clock and its regulation by light in <italic>Phreatichthys andruzzii</italic>, a Somalian cavefish that shows an extreme troglomorphic phenotype. We compare the circadian clock mechanism of this cavefish with that of the zebrafish with the goal of identifying key components of the light input pathway. We reveal that <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> possesses a clock that is entrained by periodic food availability, displays a long infradian period, and lacks temperature compensation. However, importantly, this cavefish clock is no longer entrainable by light. Strikingly, in the cavefish we encounter mutations in the candidate non-visual photoreceptors Melanopsin (Opn4m2) and TMT (teleost multiple tissue)-opsin and we provide direct evidence for a light-sensing function of these non-visual opsins in the regulation of vertebrate peripheral clocks.</p>

(C,D) Representative actograms of zebrafish (C) and cavefish (D) maintained under LD conditions (each cycle: 12 h light, 12 h dark) and fed randomly. Records are double plotted on a 48 h time scale to aid interpretation; the <italic>y</italic>-axis progresses in single days with each day being plotted twice (day 1 on the right side is repeated on day 2 on the left side). The activity was binned every 10 min, the height of each point representing the number of interruptions of the infrared light beam.

        <p>As a first step we wished to explore the circadian clock and its regulation by light in this cavefish species. We initially measured locomotor activity in cavefish exposed to a 12∶12 light-dark (LD) cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g001">Figures 1D,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s001">S1B</xref>). We documented striking arrhythmic locomotor activity that contrasts with the clear rhythmic, diurnal pattern observed for zebrafish under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g001">Figures 1A,C,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s001">S1A</xref>). In order to explore at the molecular level this lack of behavioural rhythmicity in cavefish, we next subcloned a set of <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> clock gene homologs with the aim of examining their expression pattern under LD cycles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s011">Table S1</xref>). These genes were selected since their zebrafish counterparts are either clock- or light-regulated. Sequence analysis confirmed a close similarity between zebrafish and <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s012">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s002">Figure S2</xref>), consistent with both species belonging to the Cyprinidae family. We measured the expression of a subset of clock-regulated (<italic>Clk1a</italic>, <italic>Clk2</italic>, <italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per1b</italic>) and light-regulated genes (<italic>Per2</italic>, <italic>Cry1a</italic>, and <italic>Cry5</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Tamai1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Vatine1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Kobayashi1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Vallone1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Whitmore2">[14]</xref> <italic>in vivo</italic> in adult tissues and in whole larvae from both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g001">Figure 1G–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In the zebrafish, in agreement with previous reports, exposure to a LD cycle results in robust rhythmic expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g001">Figure 1G,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s003">Figure S3A</xref>,B,E) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Whitmore1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Whitmore2">[14]</xref>. Remarkably, arrhythmic gene expression was encountered in cavefish tissues and larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g001">Figure 1H,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s003">Figure S3C</xref>,D,F,G), even during the first day of life when eye rudiments still persist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Berti1">[12]</xref>. Importantly, these clock gene expression patterns are consistent with the behavioural activity profiles observed under LD cycles for both species. Circadian clocks are encountered in most vertebrate cell types and even in cell cultures <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, the persistence of circadian clocks <italic>in vitro</italic> has enabled many more detailed mechanistic studies. Therefore, we established cell lines from adult cavefish caudal fins (CF cells) to test whether <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> cells <italic>in vitro</italic> also lack rhythmic gene expression under LD conditions. Again we observed arrhythmic clock gene expression in <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>) that contrasts with the robust rhythms documented in zebrafish cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Whitmore1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Dickmeis1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Pando1">[16]</xref>. Thus, we failed to detect rhythmic clock gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> in <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> under LD cycles. So our data reveal that either <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> lacks the circadian clock itself or it has a clock lacking a functional light input pathway.</p>

        <p>To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we first assessed whether the cavefish circadian clock could be entrained by an alternative environmental time signal (<italic>zeitgeber</italic>), periodic food availability. Adult cavefish and zebrafish were fed once at the same time each day for one month under constant dark conditions, and during this period, locomotor activity was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g003">Figure 3</xref>). For both species we observed food anticipatory activity (FAA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-LopezOlmeda1">[17]</xref>), a characteristic increase in locomotor activity encountered a few hours prior to mealtime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g003">Figure 3A,B,D,E</xref>) and a strong entrainment of rhythmic locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g003">Figure 3C,F</xref>). FAA is indicative of regulation by a food entrainable oscillator (FEO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Stephan1">[18]</xref>); thus we tested circadian clock gene expression in various tissues of both species during the final day of food entrainment and then two days of fasting under constant conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-LopezOlmeda2">[19]</xref>, rhythmic clock gene expression (<italic>Clk1a</italic> and <italic>Per1b</italic>) was observed in zebrafish brain, heart, fin, and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g004">Figures 4B,D,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s004">S4A</xref>), with the only exception of <italic>Clk1a</italic> in the zebrafish brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, red trace).

        <p>We also tested the effect of alternative zeitgebers on clock gene expression in cavefish CF cells. Transient treatments with glucocorticoids are widely used to induce rhythmic gene expression in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Balsalobre1">[20]</xref>. CF cells transfected with a clock-regulated zebrafish reporter construct (<italic>zfPer1b-Luc</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Vallone1">[13]</xref> were treated transiently with 100 nM dexamethasone, an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s005">Figure S5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, green trace) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Balsalobre1">[20]</xref>. Surprisingly, this induced a bioluminescence rhythm in cavefish cells that persisted for almost three cycles with an extremely long period (τ = 43 h at 25°C). This contrasts with the circadian bioluminescence rhythm observed upon dexamethasone treatment of zebrafish cells (τ = 24.2 h at 25°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, green trace). These results reveal the existence of an abnormal circadian clock in <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> that displays an infradian period under constant conditions. We next wished to determine whether other circadian clock properties are abnormal in the cavefish. One highly conserved feature of the circadian clock is that its period remains relatively constant over a physiological range of temperatures (so-called temperature compensation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Pittendrigh1">[21]</xref>. Thus, we measured the period of rhythms induced by dexamethasone pulses in CF and zebrafish cells held at two additional constant temperatures 22°C and 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g005">Figure 5</xref>). With an increase in temperature the period length of the cavefish clock decreased significantly (τ = 47 (22°C), 43 (25°C), and 38 h (29°C)) revealing reduced temperature compensation with Q<sub>10</sub>≈1.35, while in zebrafish cells, as expected, a relatively constant period was observed (τ = 23.6 (22°C), 24.2 (25°C), and 24.6 (29°C)) h, respectively (Q<sub>10</sub>≈1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Lahiri1">[22]</xref>). Thus, together our results indicate that <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> possesses a circadian timing system with an aberrant core clock mechanism.</p>

        <p>Could the discrepancy between the striking infradian period of the <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> clock (τ&gt;30 h) and the period of the LD cycle (T = 24 h) have been the origin of the observed arrhythmicity under LD cycles? In such a scenario, the cavefish clock might still be entrainable by light. In zebrafish cell lines, exposure to brief light pulses results in advances or delays in pre-existing clock gene expression rhythms depending on the precise time when the cells are illuminated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Vallone1">[13]</xref>. Thus, we wished to test whether light is able to regulate the cavefish clock in a similar manner. We synchronized rhythmic clock gene expression in CF cells by dexamethasone treatment and then exposed the cells to a 15 min light pulse at five different time-points distributed throughout the 43 h cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001142.s006">Figure S6</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Vallone1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Carr1">[23]</xref>. None of the light pulses changed either the phase or levels of rhythmic clock gene expression. Hence, we conclude that <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> indeed possesses a truly blind clock. Thus, this cavefish represents a powerful complementary model for exploring the function of the light input pathway in vertebrates.</p>

        <p>Our systematic cloning and sequencing strategy failed to detect any mutations significantly affecting clock gene coding sequences (unpublished data).

We have previously defined an essential light responsive module (LRM) containing E- and D-box enhancer elements in the zebrafish <italic>per2</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Vatine1">[5]</xref>.

Furthermore, sequence alignment with other teleost homologs revealed strong conservation (unpublished data). Interestingly, however, premature stop-codons were encountered in the coding sequences of both TMT-opsin and Melanopsin (at the C-terminus of the 5<sup>th</sup> transmembrane domain and the N-terminus of the 6<sup>th</sup> transmembrane domain, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). These C-terminal truncations were the result of frame shift mutations in the two coding sequences (an insertion of one T in <italic>TMT-opsin</italic> at position +654 and deletion of one G in <italic>Melanopsin</italic> at position +842 relative to the ATG initiation codons of the zebrafish homolog sequences). Both opsin mutations would be predicted to eliminate binding of the essential chromophore, retinaldehyde, that normally occurs at the 7<sup>th</sup> transmembrane domain. Therefore, we decided to test whether ectopic expression of the zebrafish homologs of these two opsins would rescue light-inducibility of a <italic>zfPer2-Luc</italic> reporter in cavefish cells. Simply supplementing the culture medium with retinaldehyde failed to induce rhythmic expression of <italic>zfPer2-Luc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

Exposure of Melanopsin or TMT-opsin transfected cavefish cells to blue (468 nm) or green (530 nm) light is able to activate the <italic>zfper2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g008">Figure 8A–D</xref>). In contrast, no rescue was observed under red (657 nm) light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). However, exposure of zebrafish cells to these same monochromatic light sources revealed activation by all three light sources, with the strongest induction by blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). These results confirm the wavelength sensitivity of Melanopsin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Newman1">[28]</xref> and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that TMT-opsin can respond to blue and green but not red wavelengths of light. The differences in the red light response of the <italic>zfper2</italic> promoter between the zebrafish cells and the rescued cavefish cell system point to the existence of additional peripheral photoreceptors. Importantly, comparable results were obtained in all our rescue experiments when we substituted <italic>zfper2-Luc</italic> for the minimal light-responsive promoter fragment of the zebrafish <italic>per2</italic> gene −<italic>0.43per2:Luc</italic> (unpublished data) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Vatine1">[5]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In summary, during 1.4–2.6 million years of isolation from the day-night cycle, the evolution of the cavefish <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> has lead to an aberrant circadian clock. Contrary to the situation in most organisms, this clock is no longer entrained by light. Furthermore, upon exposure to alternative zeitgebers it cycles with a remarkably long infradian period and shows reduced temperature compensation. It is possible that this reflects progressive loss of a mechanism that provides no selective advantage for animals that live under constant darkness and temperature. In support of this hypothesis, one recent report has documented a severe attenuation of circadian clock rhythmicity in an arctic mammal naturally exposed to the extreme polar photic environment, the reindeer, <italic>Rangifer tarandus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Lu1">[29]</xref>. To further test this hypothesis, it will be fascinating to compare the circadian clock phenotype of <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> with that of other cavefish species representing the full range of troglomorphic phenotypes.</p>
      <p>Our study reveals that a regular daily feeding time does entrain the cavefish clock. Interestingly, a comparison of the clock gene expression rhythms encountered in various tissues of the regularly fed cavefish reveals many differences in phase and amplitude between tissues. This situation is strongly reminiscent of the different patterns of cycling gene expression observed in individual light entrained peripheral clocks of zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Kaneko1">[30]</xref> and may reflect differences in the molecular regulatory networks associated with each tissue. Several reports point to the general importance of feeding entrainment for the circadian timing system in fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-LopezOlmeda1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-LopezOlmeda2">[19]</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that food availability in the subterranean environment of this cavefish might indeed be periodic, and therefore a clock responding to and anticipating feeding time may confer a survival advantage. Interestingly, several lines of evidence point to the existence of a food-entrainable oscillator in vertebrates distinct from the light-entrainable oscillator, however the anatomical location and molecular mechanism remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Stephan1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-LopezOlmeda2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Escobar1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Storch1">[32]</xref>. In this regard, fish could emerge as powerful models for the investigation of food entrainment. A comparative study involving zebrafish that possess both light and food entrainable oscillators and <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> that retains only the food entrainable oscillator could provide important insight into the basis of the feeding entrainment mechanism in vertebrates.</p>
      <p>By employing a comparative functional analysis involving zebrafish and <italic>P. andruzzii</italic>, we have been able to provide direct evidence that TMT-opsin and Melanopsin serve as peripheral tissue photoreceptors in teleosts. Furthermore, our results strongly indicate that the two opsins activate gene expression via the LRM promoter element that mediates light-driven <italic>per2</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Vatine1">[5]</xref>. Previously, the identity of the widely expressed photoreceptors that mediate the direct entrainment of peripheral clocks was unclear. In addition to opsins, other candidates include Cry4, a member of the cryptochrome family in zebrafish, and flavin-containing oxidases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Hirayama1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Kobayashi1">[8]</xref>. It will now be important to re-evaluate the relative contribution of these other candidate photoreceptors to peripheral clock entrainment. Based on our study of the effects of different wavelengths of light on the induction of clock gene expression we predict that Melanopsin and TMT-opsin are not the only photoreceptors for peripheral clocks. This finding begs the question as to why several different photoreceptors might contribute to the photic entrainment properties of peripheral tissues. Changes in the photoperiod, intensity, as well as the spectral composition of sunlight represent reliable indicators of day-night as well as seasonal changes in the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001142-Roenneberg1">[33]</xref>. The presence of multiple photoreceptors, each one differentially extracting timing information from sunlight, could enable the circadian system to more reliably indicate the timing of dawn and dusk.</p>
      <p>Finally from a broader perspective, in addition to displaying a unique and fascinating collection of adaptations to its extreme environment, we have demonstrated that <italic>P. andruzzii</italic> serves as a powerful complementary model to dissect the molecular pathways that respond to light.</p>

Results are plotted as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001142-g001">Figure 1</xref>. In the case of cavefish, no rhythmic expression was detected either in the brain (C,D; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.1), 1-d-old larvae which still retain eye rudiments (F, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.07), or even in larvae exposed for 4 wk to LD cycles (G, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.1).</p>
