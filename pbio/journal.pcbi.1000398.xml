            <p>The BioLINK SIG meeting has been regularly held in association with the ISMB
                conference (Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology—the annual
                conference of the International Society for Computational Biology) since 2001,
                focusing on the development and application of resources and tools for biomedical
                text mining. The SIG (Special Interest Group) is interdisciplinary in nature, and
                brings together researchers applying natural language processing, text mining, and
                information extraction and retrieval in the biomedical domain with scientists from
                bioinformatics and biology. This year's meeting at the combined ISMB/ECCB
                (European Conference on Computational Biology) conference in Stockholm includes two
                new sessions, one dedicated to extraction of information from images, and one
                devoted to the future of scientific publishing. The publishing session, co-organized
                by BioLINK with the collaboration of the ISCB Publications Committee (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iscb.org/iscb-leadership-a-staff-/117" xlink:type="simple">http://www.iscb.org/iscb-leadership-a-staff-/117</ext-link>) and <italic>PLoS
                    Computational Biology</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ploscompbiol.org</ext-link>), has been added in response to the very
                favorable reviews of last year's Special Session on the same topic. The
                session format has been expanded to two two-hour segments, both of which will be
                open to ISMB conference registrants. The first segment will feature scientific
                presentations from David Shotton, Anita de Waard, Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann, and
                Philip E. Bourne. The second segment will include presentations from journal
                publishers and will finish with an open discussion.</p>

                Research Article”</title>

                <title>David Shotton (University of Oxford)</title>
                <p>Last summer, we undertook manual semantic enhancements to a biomedical research
                    article, providing enrichment to its content and increased access to datasets
                    within it, to provide a compelling existence proof of the possibilities of
                    semantic publication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000228.x001" xlink:type="simple">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000228.x001</ext-link>). These
                    semantic enhancements include provision of live DOIs and hyperlinks; semantic
                    markup of textual terms with links to relevant third-party information
                    resources; interactive figures; a reorderable reference list; a document summary
                    containing a study summary, a tag cloud, and a citation analysis; and two novel
                    types of semantic enrichment: the first a Supporting Claims Tooltip to permit
                    “Citations in Context”, and the second Tag Trees that bring
                    together semantically related terms. In addition, we published downloadable
                    spreadsheets containing data from within tables and figures, enriched these with
                    provenance information, and demonstrated various types of data fusion (mashups)
                    with results from other research articles and with Google Maps. We also
                    published machine-readable RDF metadata both about the article and about the
                    references it cites, for which we developed a Citation Typing Ontology, CiTO
                        (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.org/net/cito/" xlink:type="simple">http://purl.org/net/cito/</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>In my presentation, I will explain what we achieved by means of a live link to
                    the online enhanced paper, discuss the significance of this work in terms of
                    recent developments in automated text mining, and consider the future of
                    semantic publishing as part of mainstream research journal production workflows.
                    My aim is to excite the imaginations of researchers and publishers, stimulating
                    them to explore the possibilities of semantic publishing for their own research
                    articles, and thereby break down present barriers to the discovery and reuse of
                    information within traditional modes of scholarly communication.</p>

                <p>I will discuss a number of initiatives in which I am involved to improve and
                    enhance access to scientific knowledge from collections of research articles.
                    First, at Elsevier Labs, we added manually annotated Structured Digital
                    Abstracts in <italic>FEBS Letters</italic> articles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.febsletters.org/content/sda_summary" xlink:type="simple">http://www.febsletters.org/content/sda_summary</ext-link>) containing
                    curated data on protein–protein interactions. To help authors identify
                    these, within the OKKAM EU Project we are creating a Word plug-in using text
                    mining technologies connected by a Web Service to the authoring environment.
                    Second, I will discuss work at Utrecht University regarding scientific discourse
                    analysis, focusing on the identification of different cognitive realms
                    (experiments and conceptual models) in a full-text research publication, and the
                    linguistic methods by which authors identify the epistemic (“truth
                    value”) status of statements. I will then discuss some collaborative
                    efforts for the creation of a common framework to bootstrap efforts in this
                    area. Last, I will describe efforts at Elsevier Labs and the University of
                    Utrecht to stimulate and contribute to the discussion on changing models of
                    publishing. We organized the Elsevier Grand Challenge (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.elseviergrandchallenge.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.elseviergrandchallenge.com/</ext-link>) to help stimulate
                    collaboration with researchers interested in addressing the redefinition of
                    scientific communication, and I will discuss some future plans.</p>

                <p>Scientific literature is nowadays distributed in electronic form through online
                    Web portals. ELIXIR Work Package 8 (WP8; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.elixir-europe.org/page.php?page=wp8" xlink:type="simple">http://www.elixir-europe.org/page.php?page=wp8</ext-link>) analyzes the
                    academic and commercial stakeholders' needs for automatic exploitation
                    of the resources.</p>
                <p>Scientific literature is kept in national and international repositories that
                    currently still lack connectivity. The biomedical community is driven by the
                    idea of the integration of all data resources (including literature) from the
                    level of molecular biology to medicine, leading to multidisciplinary research.
                    The appropriate infrastructure and tools need to be in place to facilitate full
                    exploitation of the literature across scientific domains and at various levels
                    of end user expertise. Scientific literature is unstructured in contrast to the
                    scientific databases. This has led to (1) the development of text mining and
                    knowledge discovery solutions that recover facts from the scientific literature,
                    (2) curation efforts to include scientific facts into the main databases, and
                    (3) efforts around various wiki-like projects to produce annotations. The
                    exploitation of the scientific literature has to (1) fulfill multidisciplinary
                    needs, (2) exploit ontological resources (Semantic Web approaches), (3) deliver
                    enhanced digital content, and (4) follow standards for efficient
                integration.</p>

                <p>Scientists (at least their profiles) and their scholarly output exist in
                    cyberspace, but the relationship between the two is far from established.
                    Scientists may not be identified uniquely, and much of their output is not
                    easily referenced. The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) was a big step in
                    uniquely identifying a scientific journal publication, and has been embraced by
                    the majority of publishers. I would argue that the time is here for extending
                    this scheme to uniquely identify scientists (authors) with all their respective
                    scholarly output. This is much more than traditional journal publications, and
                    includes database depositions, reviews for grants and journals, blog postings:
                    in fact, anything they wish to have uniquely associated with their name. I will
                    discuss efforts in this direction and what I think it will take to really make
                    such a scheme work—a scheme that starts with the publishers.</p>
                <p>The publishers' panel will follow the scientific presentations. The
                    publishers will be free to comment on the presentations or to address other
                    topics, such as validation processes and quality measures (e.g., the future of
                    the peer review model, alternatives to impact factors), dissemination (e.g.,
                    open-access models), and discoverability (e.g., linking, applying new
                    technologies). Confirmed participants include Claire Bird (Oxford University
                    Press), Mark Patterson (Public Library of Science), Matt Day
