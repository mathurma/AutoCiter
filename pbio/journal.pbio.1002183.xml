<abstract>
<p>Netrin is a key axon guidance cue that orients axon growth during neural circuit formation. However, the mechanisms regulating netrin and its receptors in the extracellular milieu are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, LON-2/glypican, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, modulates UNC-6/netrin signaling and may do this through interactions with the UNC-40/DCC receptor. We show that developing axons misorient in the absence of LON-2/glypican when the SLT-1/slit guidance pathway is compromised and that LON-2/glypican functions in both the attractive and repulsive UNC-6/netrin pathways. We find that the core LON-2/glypican protein, lacking its heparan sulfate chains, and secreted forms of LON-2/glypican are functional in axon guidance. We also find that LON-2/glypican functions from the epidermal substrate cells to guide axons, and we provide evidence that LON-2/glypican associates with UNC-40/DCC receptor–expressing cells. We propose that LON-2/glypican acts as a modulator of UNC-40/DCC-mediated guidance to fine-tune axonal responses to UNC-6/netrin signals during migration.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During the development of the nervous system, migrating axons are guided as they navigate through complex environments to reach their target destinations. These directed migrations are essential to ensure the proper wiring and function of the nervous system and are instructed by guidance cues and receptors. There is a remarkably small set of guidance cues and receptors relative to the large number of neuronal migrations, suggesting that the actions of these guidance cues might be diversified by regulatory mechanisms. We have addressed this question in the genetically tractable nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. We identify that the response of migrating neurons to a key guidance cue, UNC-6/netrin, is modulated by a specific proteoglycan, LON-2/glypican. We show that LON-2/glypican may carry out this regulation by interacting with the UNC-40/DCC netrin receptor on the cell surface. We propose that LON-2/glypican acts as an extracellular modulator of UNC-40/DCC-mediated guidance to fine-tune axonal responses to UNC-6/netrin signals during migration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Directed migrations of developing axons are essential for the proper wiring of the nervous system. A host of guidance cues and their receptors instruct axon guidance decisions. However, how these cues and the growth cone’s responses to them are spatially and temporally regulated in vivo remains largely unknown. Answering this question is central to our understanding of how growing axons navigate in complex environments to reach their targets during development and regeneration.</p>
<p>UNC-6/netrin is a highly conserved secreted guidance cue with structural similarity to the extracellular matrix protein laminin [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. UNC-6/netrin directs attractive guidance through receptors of the UNC-40/DCC family and repulsive guidance through both UNC-40/DCC and UNC-5/UNC5 receptors [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Notably, whereas netrin receptors and downstream transduction pathways have been well characterized, how netrin signals are regulated extracellularly remains largely unknown. UNC-6/netrin was identified through genetic analysis in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and biochemically purified and cloned from vertebrate embryos [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A second biochemical component that synergized with netrin to elicit axon outgrowth was termed “netrin synergizing activity” (NSA) [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and remains unidentified. Vertebrate netrin-1 and its receptor DCC can bind heparin, a fully sulfated version of heparan sulfate (HS), in vitro [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and a general disruption of HS chain synthesis is detrimental to netrin-1-mediated axon outgrowth in vitro [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) might be intriguing candidates for NSA, it is not yet known whether a specific HSPG is required for netrin signaling or how interactions with HSPGs might regulate netrin signals to direct axons during nervous system development.</p>
<p>We addressed these questions using the nematode <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, which has been instrumental for discovering major conserved axon guidance pathways. During larval development, the axon of the mechanosensory neuron AVM migrates ventrally as its growth cone integrates signals from two complementary guidance cues (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]: (1) UNC-6/netrin is secreted at the ventral midline and attracts the growth cone ventrally via the receptor UNC-40/DCC [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and (2) SLT-1/Slit is secreted by the dorsal muscles and repels the growth cone away from the dorsal side via the receptor SAX-3/Robo [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Animals null for the guidance cues <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin or <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit exhibit partial AVM ventral axon guidance defects, and loss of both cues in <italic>unc-6 slt-1</italic> double mutants results in fully penetrant guidance defects (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>, [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). AVM axons defective in guidance fail to extend ventrally and instead migrate laterally in the anterior direction (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In this study, we use the AVM axon as a model to elucidate mechanisms that regulate UNC-6/netrin signaling.</p>

<p>Here we provide a missing link in understanding the modulation of UNC-6/netrin signaling in the extracellular milieu. We demonstrate that LON-2/glypican, a HSPG secreted from epidermal cells, acts as a modulator of the UNC-6/netrin signaling pathways to guide migrating cells and axons. We show that LON-2/glypican modulates UNC-6/netrin signaling in both attractive guidance mediated by the UNC-40/DCC receptor and repulsive guidance mediated by the UNC-40/DCC and UNC-5/UNC5 receptors. We provide evidence that LON-2/glypican associates with UNC-40/DCC-receptor-expressing cells. We show that the N-terminal globular region of LON-2/glypican, lacking the three HS chain attachment sites, is functional in UNC-6/netrin-mediated guidance. Our studies unravel a novel mechanism by which LON-2/glypican is produced by substrate epidermal cells and released from the membrane to likely associate with UNC-40/DCC-expressing neurons, enabling the modulation of their responses to UNC-6/netrin during axon migrations.</p>

<p>To address whether a specific HSPG interacts with the netrin signaling system to guide axons, we first examined axon guidance in mutants lacking core HSPGs. HSPGs are composed of a core protein with covalently attached long unbranched HS chains [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. HSPGs can be associated with the plasma membrane through either a transmembrane domain (e.g., syndecans) or a glycerophosphatidylinositide (GPI) anchor (e.g., glypicans) or be secreted into the extracellular milieu (e.g., perlecans and agrins). We examined the axon morphology of AVM in single, double, and triple mutants for several core HSPG proteins (see <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> for alleles). These included the sole <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> syndecan (<italic>sdn-1</italic>), the two glypicans (<italic>lon-2</italic> and <italic>gpn-1)</italic>, perlecan (<italic>unc-52)</italic>, and agrin (<italic>agr-1</italic>). We found that the mild AVM axon guidance defects of <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan mutants, including a null, [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] were enhanced by the complete loss of <italic>lon-</italic>2/glypican in double mutants <italic>lon-2 sdn-1</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), revealing a role for <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican in AVM axon guidance. Similarly, loss of <italic>lon-2/</italic>glypican enhances <italic>sdn-1/</italic>syndecan mutants in motorneuron guidance [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genome encodes two glypicans, loss of function of the second glypican, <italic>gpn-1</italic>, using two likely null mutant alleles (see <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>), did not enhance the defects of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican or <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan null mutants in double or triple mutants (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Moreover, we did not observe abnormal phenotypes in the single mutants for <italic>agr-1</italic>/agrin or <italic>unc-52/</italic>perlecan. These observations highlight the specificity of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican function in this axon guidance process and raise the possibility that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican might be a component of the pathways guiding the AVM axon towards the ventral midline.</p>

<title><italic>lon-2</italic>/Glypican Acts in the Attractive and Repulsive <italic>unc-6</italic>/Netrin Guidance Pathways</title>
<p>Considering that AVM axon guidance occurs via the <italic>unc-6/</italic>netrin and <italic>slt-1/</italic>Slit pathways, mutations in genes such as <italic>lon-2/</italic>glypican and <italic>sdn-1/</italic>syndecan that affect AVM axon guidance may point towards interactions with either of these two guidance systems. Since the AVM axon guidance defects in <italic>lon-2 sdn-1</italic> double mutants are qualitatively similar to those of mutants lacking <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin or <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit, we determined how <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican and <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan impact <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin and <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit signaling. In animals that completely lack <italic>slt-</italic>1/Slit function, the complete loss of a gene functioning independently of <italic>slt-</italic>1/Slit is expected to enhance the AVM guidance defects, such as in the double null mutants <italic>unc-6/</italic>netrin <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit (see <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). We tested the interactions of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican with the <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit pathway in AVM axon guidance and found that the complete loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican enhanced a presumptive null allele of <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit in <italic>lon-2 slt-1</italic> double mutants (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), suggesting that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in a pathway separate from <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit. Loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican also enhanced guidance defects when signaling through <italic>sax-3</italic>/Robo, the <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit receptor, was disrupted in <italic>lon-2 sax-3</italic> double null mutants, providing further evidence that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in a pathway separate from that of <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). As an additional method to investigate the impact of lacking <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican function when <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit signaling is perturbed, we used a transgene that ectopically expresses <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit from both ventral and dorsal body wall muscles (using P<italic>myo-3</italic>::<italic>slt-1</italic>) and misguides the axon of AVM [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican enhanced the defects caused by <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit misexpression (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), consistent with the above findings that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican mediates its axon guidance effects independently of <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit.</p>
<p>The <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin pathway functions independently of <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit to guide AVM. To address whether <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in the <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin axon guidance pathway, we examined the AVM axon in double mutants of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican and <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin. In animals that completely lack <italic>unc-6/</italic>netrin function, the complete loss of a gene functioning in the same <italic>unc-6/</italic>netrin pathway is expected to not enhance the AVM guidance defects, such as in the double null mutants <italic>unc-6</italic>; <italic>unc-40</italic> (see <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). We found that the complete loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican did not enhance the guidance defects displayed by <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin null mutants <italic>ev400</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Given that loss of <italic>lon-2</italic> enhances the defects of other guidance mutants (see doubles with <italic>sdn-1</italic>, <italic>slt-1</italic>, <italic>sax-3</italic>, and P<italic>myo-3</italic>::<italic>slt-1</italic> in <xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref> and <italic>sqv-5</italic> in <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>), the lack of enhancement when combined with the <italic>unc-6</italic> null mutation suggests that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in the same pathway as <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin. Consistent with this idea, we also found that complete loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican did not enhance the AVM guidance defects of two null mutant alleles of the netrin receptor <italic>unc-40</italic>/DCC in the double mutants <italic>unc-40; lon-2</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), suggesting that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in the same pathway as <italic>unc-40</italic>/DCC in AVM ventral guidance. These observations raise the interesting possibility that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican may be the HSPG dedicated to modulate <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin signaling through <italic>unc-40/</italic>DCC during axon guidance.</p>
<p>Since <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions independently of <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>) and partly separate from <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), we tested whether <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan and <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit function together to guide the axon of AVM. We found that defects in <italic>slt-1 sdn-1</italic> double null mutants were not enhanced compared to the single mutants (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>), consistent with findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We also found that double null mutants for <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan and the s<italic>lt-1</italic>/Slit receptor <italic>sax-3</italic>/Robo were not enhanced compared to the single mutants (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Our results support the notion that <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan acts in the same genetic pathway as <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit to guide AVM. Consistent with this, we found that the double null mutants for <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan and the netrin receptor <italic>unc-40</italic>/DCC were enhanced, indicating that <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan functions in a pathway separate from <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin. The analysis of axon guidance in double mutants of <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin and <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan was precluded by their lethality. Our results are consistent with the notion that <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin and <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan act in different pathways of axon guidance.</p>
<p>In addition to <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin acting as an attractive cue for cells expressing the <italic>unc-40</italic>/DCC receptor in ventral guidance, <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin also acts as a repulsive cue for cells expressing both the <italic>unc-5</italic>/UNC5 and <italic>unc-40</italic>/DCC receptors, which together mediate dorsal guidance away from <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To address whether <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin-mediated repulsive guidance as well, we examined the dorsal migration of the distal tip cells (DTCs) and of the GABAergic motorneuron axons [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We found that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican single null mutants are defective in dorsal DTC migrations (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>) and that the complete loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican did not enhance the dorsal DTC migration defects of <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin, <italic>unc-40</italic>/DCC, or <italic>unc-</italic>5/UNC5 null mutants (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), indicating that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in the <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin-repulsive guidance pathway as well. Similarly, complete loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican did not enhance the defects of <italic>unc-40</italic>/DCC mutants in the dorsal guidance of motorneuron axons (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Given that loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican enhances the motorneuron axon guidance defects of <italic>sdn-1</italic> mutants as shown in [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], <italic>lon-2/</italic>glypican plays a role in the dorsal guidance of motorneuron axons. The lack of enhancement of the defects in the dorsal guidance of motorneuron axons of <italic>unc-40</italic>/DCC mutants by loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican further supports that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in the <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin pathway mediating dorsal guidance.

<title><italic>unc-6</italic>/Netrin Signaling via the <italic>unc-5</italic>/UNC5 Receptor Requires <italic>lon-2</italic>/Glypican</title>
<p>To complement the above loss-of-function approach, we next used a gain-of-function strategy to test the model that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in the <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin signaling pathway. We focused on the axon of the PVM neuron instead of AVM, because it could reliably be identified (AVM cannot be distinguished from ALMR in these experiments). In wild-type animals, PVM, like AVM, expresses the receptor <italic>unc-40</italic>/DCC, and its axon grows ventrally towards <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).

The PVM axon normally does not express the receptor <italic>unc-5</italic>/UNC5 that mediates repulsive guidance away from ventral <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but misexpression of the receptor <italic>unc-5</italic>/UNC5 (using transgene P<italic>mec-7</italic>::<italic>unc-5</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) in PVM forces its axon to extend dorsally in an <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin- and <italic>unc-40/</italic>DCC-dependent manner (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). We used this <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin-dependent <italic>unc-5</italic>/UNC5-mediated abnormal dorsal migration to further investigate the function of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican in netrin signaling. By analyzing <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican mutants carrying P<italic>mec-7</italic>::<italic>unc-5</italic>, we found that compete loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican function significantly suppressed the <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin-dependent <italic>unc-5</italic>-mediated abnormal dorsal migration of the PVM axon, indicating that <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin signaling is <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican dependent (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).

<title>A secreted form of LON-2/glypican that lacks the heparan sulfate chain attachments is functional in axon guidance.</title>
<p>(A) The HSPG LON-2/glypican is composed of a core protein and three HS chains. The core protein is predicted to fold into a globular domain on its N-terminal region and to be GPI-anchored. (B) Schematics of the engineered forms of LON-2 that we used: LON-2ΔGAG, in which the HS chain attachment sites are mutated; LON-2ΔGPI, in which the GPI anchor is deleted; N-LON-2, in which the C-terminus is deleted; and C-LON-2, in which the N-terminal globular domain is deleted. Western blot analysis of protein extracts of worms expressing LON-2::GFP or LON-2ΔGAG::GFP confirms that deleting the HS attachment sites on LON-2 affects HS addition on LON-2. Protein extracts from wild type (N2) and an unrelated GFP strain (<italic>lqIs4</italic>) are negative controls. (C) A form of LON-2/glypican lacking HS chain attachment sites (LON-2ΔGAG) functions in axon guidance. LON-2ΔGAG rescues the AVM guidance defects of double mutants <italic>lon-2 slt-1</italic> back to the level of <italic>slt-1</italic> single mutants. Secreted globular LON-2/glypican is functional in axon guidance. LON-2/glypican was engineered to be secreted by deleting its GPI anchor (LON-2ΔGPI) or by deleting the C-terminus, thus lacking the GPI anchor and the HS attachment sites (N-LON-2). Both LON-2ΔGPI and N-LON-2 function in axon guidance, as assayed by their ability to rescue axon guidance defects of <italic>lon-2 slt-1</italic> back down to the level of <italic>slt-1</italic> single mutants. In contrast, a form of LON-2/glypican containing its C-terminus including the three HS attachment sites, but lacking its N-terminal globular domain (C-LON-2), is not functional (see <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Tables), indicating that the N-terminal globular domain of the core protein is key to the function of LON-2/glypican in axon guidance.

<p>To address the importance of the HS chains linked to LON-2/glypican during axon guidance, we tested whether a mutated form of LON-2/glypican lacking its HS chains could still function in axon guidance. For this experiment, the three Serine residues serving as HS chain attachment sites were mutated to Alanine residues, generating the mutant LON-2ΔGAG [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Western blot analysis confirmed that LON-2ΔGAG severely reduced HS chains associated with LON-2, in both worms and S2 cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>).

<title>LON-2/Glypican Associates with Cells Expressing UNC-40/DCC</title>
<p>Our above observations provide evidence that the HSPG <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in the same genetic pathway as <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin to guide migrating axons. It has been shown in several models that HSPGs play multifaceted roles across various signaling pathways, such as facilitating ligand-receptor interactions and transporting morphogens, as well as localizing and stabilizing ligands [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We asked if the LON-2/glypican molecules might interact with either UNC-6/netrin or its receptor UNC-40/DCC, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for LON-2/glypican in <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin-mediated guidance. To test these interactions, we generated epitope-tagged versions of LON-2/glypican, UNC-6/netrin, and UNC-40/DCC proteins, with human influenza hemagglutinin (HA), superfolder-GFP (SfGFP), and FLAG, respectively (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), and used cell-mixing experiments.

<title>LON-2/glypican associates with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells.</title>
<p>(A) Experimental design. Each construct was individually and transiently transfected in S2 cells. After 2 d, cells from independent single transfections were mixed and incubated overnight and then immunostained for the corresponding tags. HA::LON-2-conditioned medium was mixed with UNC-40::FLAG-expressing cells. (B) HA::LON-2 is released from cells that produce it and associates with UNC-40-expressing cells. HA::LON-2 fills the cytoplasm of the cells that produce it (indicated by an asterisk, see also <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). Notably, HA::LON-2 is observed decorating the outline of UNC-40::FLAG-expressing cells (experiments 1, 6, 7, and 8). HA::LON-2ΔGAG also associates with UNC-40::FLAG-expressing cells (experiment 2). Cells expressing UNC-40ΔNt::FLAG that lacks the extracellular domain do not have HA::LON-2 signal, indicating that the association of LON-2 with UNC-40-expressing cells requires the extracellular domain of UNC-40 (experiment 3). HA::LON-2-conditioned medium contains HA::LON-2 that associates with UNC-40::FLAG-expressing cells, indicating that HA::LON-2 is released from the cells that produce into a diffusible form that interacts with UNC-40::FLAG cells (experiment 8). HA::LON-2 does not associate with cells expressing SfGFP::UNC-6 (experiments 4, 6, and 7) or with untransfected cells. UNC-40-FLAG-expressing cells can simultaneously associate with HA::LON-2 and SfGFP::UNC-6 (experiment 6). HA::LON-2 associates with cells expressing a mutant form of UNC-40/DCC that is unable to bind SfGFP::UNC-6, as it lacks the Fn4/5 UNC-6 binding domains (UNC-40ΔFn4/5::FLAG; experiment 7). Scale bars, 10 μm. (C) Quantification of the association of HA::LON-2 (from expressing cells, from medium of expressing cells, or from cells expressing HA::LON-2ΔGAG) with cells expressing UNC-40::FLAG, UNC-40ΔNt::FLAG, SfGFP::UNC-6, or UNC-40ΔFn4/5::FLAG and untransfected cells. Ten different optical fields containing ~300 cells from three independent experiments were quantified and averaged. (D) Cells expressing UNC-40::FLAG can display irregular morphology, which is enhanced by the presence of HA::LON-2. Images of the different morphologies displayed by UNC-40::FLAG-expressing cells: with a smooth edge, with an irregular edge, or with membrane extensions. The morphology of S2 cells expressing mCherry alone or coexpressing UNC-40::FLAG and mCherry, which were mixed with control untransfected cells or with HA::LON-2-expressing cells, were quantified for irregular edges (grey bars) or membrane extensions (black bars). A higher percentage of UNC-40::FLAG-expressing cells show membrane extensions or irregular edges when mixed with HA::LON-2-expressing cells, as compared to when they are mixed with control mCherry cells. Error bars are standard error of the mean. Asterisks denote significant difference: *** <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001, * <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05. ns, not significant.

<p>We observed that the HA::LON-2 signal filled the cytoplasm of HA::LON-2 producing cells (indicated by white asterisks in <xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref> experiment 1 and <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). Notably, HA::LON-2 was also found decorating the outline of UNC-40::FLAG-expressing cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> experiments 1, 6, 7, and 8). This observation suggests that LON-2/glypican is released from the cells that produce it, diffuses in the extracellular medium, and associates with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells. In contrast, HA::LON-2/glypican did not bind to cells expressing SfGFP::UNC-6 (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> experiments 4, 6, and 7) or to cells expressing an unrelated type I transmembrane receptor, Evi (see <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>), or to untransfected cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> experiments 1–8). Furthermore, we found that another HSPG, SDN-1/syndecan, did not bind UNC-40-expressing cells (see <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>). These findings provide evidence for a specific interaction between LON-2/glypican and UNC-40-expressing cells.</p>
<p>We tested whether the HS chains of LON-2/glypican were necessary for its association with UNC-40-expressing cells. We used a mutated form of LON-2/glypican lacking its three HS chain attachment sites, HA::LON-2ΔGAG (see <xref rid="pbio.1002183.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>, [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Western blot analysis confirmed that LON-2ΔGAG severely reduced HS chains associated with LON-2/glypican (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). We found that LON-2ΔGAG associated with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> experiment 2), suggesting that the association of LON-2/glypican with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells is HS-chain independent.</p>
<p>The HA::LON-2 signal outlined the UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>, experiments 1, 6, 7, and 8) suggesting a potential interaction at the cell surface. To further support this idea, we asked whether LON-2/glypican would associate with cells expressing a mutated form of UNC-40/DCC that lacks the extracellular domain and contains only the intracellular and transmembrane domains (UNC-40ΔNt::FLAG). We found that HA::LON-2 did not associate with cells expressing the UNC-40ΔNt::FLAG (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> experiment 3), indicating that the extracellular domain of UNC-40/DCC is required for LON-2/glypican to associate, as would be predicted if LON-2/glypican and UNC-40/DCC interact, directly or indirectly, at the cell surface.</p>
<p>Interestingly, HA::LON-2 was absent from cells expressing SfGFP::UNC-6 (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> experiments 4, 6, and 7), indicating that while LON-2/glypican interacts with cells expressing UNC-40/DCC, it does not bind to UNC-6/netrin-expressing cells in this assay. Moreover, the presence of SfGFP::UNC-6 did not reduce the ability of HA::LON-2 to associate with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells in experiments in which the three singly transfected cell populations were mixed (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> experiment 6). These results suggest that if LON-2/glypican interacted directly or indirectly with UNC-40/DCC, then the interactions of LON-2/glypican and UNC-6/netrin would occur with different regions of UNC-40/DCC. Consistent with this possibility, we found that LON-2/glypican still associated with cells expressing UNC-40ΔFn4/5::FLAG, a mutated form of UNC-40/DCC that lacks the UNC-6/netrin-binding sites (FnIII domains 4 and 5) (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> experiment 7, [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). Our results indicate that for LON-2/glypican to associate with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells, the FnIII domains 4 and 5 of UNC-40/DCC are dispensable and UNC-6/netrin does not need to be bound to UNC-40/DCC.</p>

<title>LON-2/Glypican Increases Membrane Outgrowths Triggered by UNC-40/DCC</title>
<p>Previous work has suggested that overexpression of DCC in cells overactivates DCC downstream signaling pathways, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements that result in increased membrane extensions and cell surface area [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similarly, expression of UNC-40/DCC leads to changes in cellular morphology in our cell assays (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). To test whether the association of LON-2/glypican with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells results in an activation of signaling downstream of UNC-40/DCC, we examined the impact of LON-2/glypican on the morphology of UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells. For these experiments, we mixed mCherry-expressing cells with either untransfected control cells or LON-2/glypican-expressing cells, and we also mixed UNC-40/mCherry-expressing cells with either untransfected control cells or LON-2/glypican-expressing cells. Examination of the morphology of these cells 1 d after mixing revealed that UNC-40/mCherry-expressing cells mixed with LON-2/glypican exhibited an increased frequency of irregular shapes and membrane extensions, compared to UNC-40/mCherry cells mixed with control cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Thus, consistent with a model in which LON-2/glypican functions in the UNC-6/netrin signaling pathway to guide developing axons, the association of LON-2/glypican with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells leads to increased membrane extensions, suggestive of increased signaling downstream of the UNC-40/DCC receptor.</p>

<title>LON-2/Glypican Is Released Extracellularly and Its N-terminal Domain Is Functional</title>
<p>While LON-2/glypican possesses a signature GPI anchor that mediates its attachment to plasma membranes (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), our experiments indicate that LON-2/glypican is released into the extracellular milieu through cleavage where it can diffuse to associate with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells. This is consistent with prior work demonstrating that many glypicans are shed or cleaved into a soluble form [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To verify that LON-2/glypican is indeed released into the extracellular medium, we collected cell-free media from HA::LON-2 cultures (HA::LON-2-conditioned medium) and added it to cells expressing UNC-40::FLAG. We found that HA::LON-2-conditioned medium contained HA::LON-2 that associated with UNC-40::FLAG-expressing cells. As above, this interaction was specific, as no HA::LON-2 signal was found on adjacent untransfected cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref> experiment 8). This result provides compelling evidence that LON-2/glypican can be released from the membrane of LON-2/glypican-expressing cells, diffuses, and associates with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells. We propose that using a similar mechanism, LON-2/glypican may be shed from epidermal cells and may interact with migrating axons that express UNC-40/DCC. This is consistent with our finding that LON-2/glypican is produced by the hypodermis to function nonautonomously in <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin-mediated AVM axon guidance.</p>
<p>To provide evidence for the model that LON-2/glypican can function in axon guidance when detached from the plasma membrane, we used a form of LON-2/glypican lacking the GPI anchor, LON-2ΔGPI, which should be directly secreted into the extracellular milieu [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. LON-2ΔGPI rescued the AVM guidance defects of <italic>lon-2 slt-1</italic> double mutants back to the level of <italic>slt-1</italic> single mutants (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). We also used a truncated form of LON-2/glypican (N-LON-2) containing the N-terminal globular domain, but lacking the C-terminal region, thus removing the three HS attachment sites and the GPI membrane anchor. N-LON-2 also rescued the AVM guidance defects of <italic>lon-2 slt-1</italic> double mutants back to the level of <italic>slt-1</italic> single mutants (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). In contrast, a reciprocal construct containing only the C-terminus with the three HS attachment sites and the GPI anchor (C-LON-2) did not rescue the AVM axon guidance defects of <italic>lon-2 slt-1</italic>, consistent with the model that the N-terminal globular domain of LON-2/glypican is the key functional domain during guidance (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). A secreted form of LON-2/glypican is also functional in DTC guidance, as we found that DTC guidance defects of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican mutants could be rescued by expression of N-LON-2, containing only the N-terminal globular domain (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). These findings also support the hypothesis that LON-2/glypican may normally be released from the hypodermis to interact with the <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin pathway to direct the migrating growth cone during development (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<p>Growth cone responses to guidance cues require precise regulation as developing axons traverse complex extracellular environments in order to reach their targets.

<title><italic>lon-2</italic>/Glypican Is a Component of the <italic>unc-6</italic>/Netrin Signaling Pathways</title>
<p>Our studies identify the HSPG LON-2/glypican as a component of the <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin attractive and repulsive signaling pathways that guide axons during development. We show that LON-2/glypican specifically acts on <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin signaling independently of <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit. We demonstrate that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions from the hypodermis, the epidermal cells that secrete the substrate along which growth cones extend [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and that a secreted form of LON-2/glypican, containing only its N-terminal globular region and lacking its HS chains, guides cells and axons in vivo. In addition, we provide evidence that LON-2/glypican is released from cells producing it and associates with cells expressing UNC-40/DCC receptors. Taken together, our observations support a hypothetical model in which GPI-linked LON-2/glypican is produced by substrate epidermal cells, is released into the extracellular milieu, and binds growth cones expressing UNC-40/DCC receptors to regulate attractive and repulsive responses of the growth cone to UNC-6/netrin.</p>
<p>The impact of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican on the <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin signaling pathway is highly specific. First, loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican, but not of <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan, suppresses the guidance phenotypes elicited by the gain-of-function condition in which <italic>unc-5</italic>/UNC5 was misexpressed. Second, the complete loss of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican does not enhance the guidance defects observed in null mutants for <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin or its receptors <italic>unc-40</italic>/DCC and <italic>unc-5</italic>/UNC5, whereas it does enhance the defects of several other axon guidance mutants, including <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan, <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit, misexpressed <italic>slt-1</italic>/Slit (P<italic>myo-3</italic>::<italic>slt-1</italic>), <italic>sax-3</italic>/Robo, and <italic>sqv-5</italic>, suggesting that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions specifically in the <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin pathway. Third, <italic>sdn-1</italic>/syndecan, cannot replace <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican function, highlighting a requirement for <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican that cannot be achieved by any HSPG. Given that the core protein of LON-2/glypican, devoid of its HS chains, is fully functional in guidance, the specificity of action of LON-2/glypican in netrin-mediated guidance appears to reside in the core protein itself. As a note, whereas <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican mutants are defective in DTC migration, the <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican mutant by itself does not show drastic alterations in AVM axon guidance as is observed with other modulators [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is possible that in the absence of <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican, another HSPG may provide compensation or that our scoring of strong alterations in pathfinding did not include more subtle phenotypes, as could be expected from a modulator of the signal [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>

<title>The Core Protein of LON-2/Glypican Is Functional in UNC-6/Netrin-Mediated Guidance</title>
<p>We show that the LON-2/glypican core protein, devoid of HS attachment sites, is able to associate with UNC-40-expressing cells and is functional in <italic>unc-6</italic>/netrin-mediated guidance. Thus, the core protein is the critical region of LON-2/glypican for netrin-mediated axon guidance.

<title>LON-2/Glypican Is Released from the Cell Surface to Guide Axons</title>
<p>LON-2/glypican is predicted to localize at the cell surface via its GPI anchor [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, in our cell culture studies, we demonstrate that LON-2/glypican can be released as a soluble molecule from producing cells. We also show that two truncated forms of LON-2/glypican, LON-2ΔGPI and N-LON-2, which are no longer associated with the plasma membrane and are secreted into the extracellular milieu, can function to guide axons in vivo. This indicates that LON-2/glypican is likely released from the epidermal cells to reach the growth cone to modulate its guidance. This finding raises the question of how LON-2/glypican is released from the cell membrane and how this process might be regulated during development. The release of LON-2/glypican from the surface of cells could involve phospholipases that cleave the GPI anchor and/or proteases that cleave its extracellular domain, such as at a predicted furin-cleavage site (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]).</p>
<p>Glypican cleavage by lipases and proteases has been demonstrated to occur and to be functionally important in other contexts, such as in regulating fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Wnt signaling during morphogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For instance, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> glypican Dally-like protein is cleaved at the GPI anchor by the lipase Notum, to negatively regulate Wnts [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Similarly, several mammalian glypicans, including glypican-3, are cleaved by Notum [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The functional importance of glypican proteolytic cleavage is illustrated by the processing of glypican-3 by a furin-like convertase to modulate Wnt signaling in zebrafish [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition, glypican-1 and glypican-4 are proteolytically cleaved to stimulate long-range FGF signaling in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and increase the efficiency of myogenic differentiation in the presence of FGF in mammalian cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], respectively. Our studies show that glypican processing also functions during axon guidance.</p>

<title>LON-2/Glypican Associates with the Surface of UNC-40/DCC-Expressing Cells</title>
<p>We demonstrate that LON-2/glypican is secreted into the extracellular medium and decorates the outline of UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells. Deleting the extracellular domain of UNC-40 (UNC-40ΔNt) abrogated the association of LON-2/glypican with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells, indicating that LON-2/glypican may interact with UNC-40/DCC at the cell surface. The association of LON-2/glypican with UNC-40/DCC may be direct or indirect through interactions with other molecules (<xref rid="pbio.1002183.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Our experiments demonstrate that UNC-6/netrin binding to UNC-40/DCC was undisturbed by the association of UNC-40/DCC with LON-2/glypican, suggesting that the possible interaction of LON-2/glypican with UNC-40/DCC likely involves a region of UNC-40/DCC other that the netrin binding sites. Indeed, we found that LON-2/glypican associates with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells even when the UNC-40/DCC receptors lack the UNC-6/netrin binding domains.</p>
<p>We found that LON-2/glypican leads to increased irregular morphology of UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells. Ectopic expression of DCC in mammalian cells activates downstream signaling via Cdc42 and Rac1, producing cytoskeletal rearrangements that lead to filopodia outgrowth and cell surface extensions [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our finding that the presence of LON-2/glypican enhances the UNC-40/DCC-induced irregular cell morphology and filopodia-like extensions suggests that the association of LON-2/glypican with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells may increase signaling downstream of UNC-40/DCC. Consistent with this notion, we show that <italic>lon-2</italic>/glypican functions in the same signaling pathway as the UNC-40/DCC downstream mediator <italic>unc-34</italic>/enabled during axon guidance.</p>
<p>Our results suggest a possible regulatory mechanism in the extracellular space in which secreted LON-2/glypican modulates the activity of the receptor UNC-40/DCC. LON-2/glypican may directly bind UNC-40/DCC, or alternatively, LON-2/glypican may instead interact with other molecules to impact UNC-40/DCC to modulate its stability, distribution, or activity. Alternatively, LON-2/glypican could potentially function as a co-receptor for UNC-6/netrin, where it may facilitate the formation of UNC-6/netrin-UNC-40/DCC-LON-2/glypican signaling complexes, similar to the situation in FGF signaling [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is also conceivable that LON-2/glypican could bind UNC-6/netrin directly as well, even if undetected in our assays, as netrin has been found to bind heparin in vitro [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Previous studies have also documented the binding of DCC to heparin in vitro [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and while we have found that the core protein is the critical portion of LON-2/glypican in netrin-mediated axon guidance, it remains possible that the endogenous HS chains contribute to the function of LON-2/glypican in axon guidance.</p>
<p>In summary, our studies uncover a novel mechanism by which UNC-6/netrin signaling through its UNC-40/DCC receptor is modulated by the HSPG LON-2/glypican during axon pathfinding. Given the evolutionary conservation of the UNC-6/netrin pathway components (UNC-6/netrin and its receptors UNC-40/DCC and UNC-5/UNC5) and of glypicans (LON-2 is most similar to mammalian glypican-3) and that synthesis of HS chains is required for mammalian axons to respond to netrin-1 in vitro [<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002183.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], glypicans are likely to play a role in netrin-mediated axon pathfinding in mammals as well. Our findings provide a general mechanism for the extracellular regulation of growth cone responses to netrin during the development of nervous systems.</p>

<p>S2 cells were maintained in SFX Insect Media (HyClone) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (HyClone) and Penicillin-Streptomycin (50 units-50 μg/mL) (Sigma). 70%–90% confluent S2 cells were transfected with 500 ng of each construct using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 48 h after transfection, old culture medium was removed and new medium was added to resuspend the cells. Equal volumes of resuspended cells that had been transfected with individual constructs were plated onto coverslips and cocultured overnight. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained with rabbit anti-HA (Life Technologies #715500) and mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma #F3165) primary antibodies and Alexa594 donkey anti-rabbit (Life Technologies #R37119) and Alexa647 goat anti-mouse (Life Technologies #A21235) secondary antibodies.

<p>Independent populations of S2 cells were transfected with (1) 450 ng of pActin5.1::mCherry alone, (2) 50 ng of the UNC-40::FLAG construct plus 450 ng of the cotransfection marker pActin5.1::mCherry, or (3) 500 ng of HA::LON-2. The medium was changed and cells were mixed 48 h after transfection. Control mCherry-expressing cells were mixed with untransfected cells or with HA::LON-2-expressing cells. Similarly, UNC-40::FLAG/mCherry-expressing cells were mixed with untransfected cells or with HA::LON-2-expressing cells. To maintain the total number of cells constant in our different mixes, one volume of UNC-40::FLAG/mCherry cells was mixed with either (a) one volume of control/untransfected cells or (b) one volume of LON-2-transfected cells. Cell mixes were cocultured overnight. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and examined under a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal microscope. Control mCherry-expressing cells or UNC-40::FLAG/mCherry-expressing cells were identified by the cotransfection marker mCherry. 20 fields of ~300 cells each per mix per were photographed for each of three independent experiments. Cells were categorized as having the typical S2 cell round and smooth shape, irregular edges, and/or extensions protruding from the cell.</p>

<title>Detection of LON-2 and LON-2ΔGAG in the supernatant and cell extracts of S2 cell cultures by western blot analysis.</title>
<p>(A) Diagram of LON-2/glypican variants expressed in S2 cells, HA::LON-2::myc and HA::LON-2ΔGAG::myc, in which the three HS attachment sites were mutated from Serine to Alanine residues. The core protein of LON-2/glypican is red, and the heparan sulfate chains (HS) are yellow. (B) In the supernatant of cells expressing HA::LON-2::myc, high molecular weight species were detected with the anti-myc antibody, which likely corresponds to full-length HA::LON-2::myc with HS chains attached. In contrast, the species detected in the supernatant of HA::LON-2ΔGAG::myc-expressing cells are smaller and fainter, indicating that HA::LON-2ΔGAG::myc indeed affects the synthesis of HS chains onto the LON-2/glypican core protein. No signal was detected with the anti-HA antibody in the supernatants, likely due to technical limitations. In the cell extracts from HA::LON-2::myc-expressing cells, the main species runs at ~90 kDa, and it is detected with both the anti-myc and anti-HA antibodies, suggesting that it is full length. This signal likely corresponds to the LON-2/glypican core protein devoid of HS chains, as it runs as a tight band. The slight mobility shift in cell extracts of HA::LON-2ΔGAG::myc-expressing cells compared to HA::LON-2::myc might correspond to a difference of mass and isoelectric point between HA::LON-2::myc and HA::LON-2ΔGAG::myc. Anti-actin and anti-HSP90 antibodies were used as loading controls. Representative blots of more than four independent repeats.</p>

Experiment 3 shows that SDN-1::myc/syndecan, another HSPG, does not associate with UNC-40/DCC-expressing cells. This SDN-1::myc was engineered to be secreted, as it lacks its transmembrane and intracellular C-terminal domains.
