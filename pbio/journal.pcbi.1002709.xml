        <p>The effects of disease mutations on protein structure and function have been extensively investigated, and many predictors of the functional impact of single amino acid substitutions are publicly available. The majority of these predictors are based on protein structure and evolutionary conservation, following the assumption that disease mutations predominantly affect folded and conserved protein regions. However, the prevalence of the intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs) in the human proteome together with their lack of fixed structure and low sequence conservation raise a question about the impact of disease mutations in IDRs. Here, we investigate annotated missense disease mutations and show that 21.7% of them are located within such intrinsically disordered regions. We further demonstrate that 20% of disease mutations in IDRs cause local disorder-to-order transitions, which represents a 1.7–2.7 fold increase compared to annotated polymorphisms and neutral evolutionary substitutions, respectively. Secondary structure predictions show elevated rates of transition from helices and strands into loops and <italic>vice versa</italic> in the disease mutations dataset. Disease disorder-to-order mutations also influence predicted molecular recognition features (MoRFs) more often than the control mutations. The repertoire of disorder-to-order transition mutations is limited, with five most frequent mutations (R→W, R→C, E→K, R→H, R→Q) collectively accounting for 44% of all deleterious disorder-to-order transitions. As a proof of concept, we performed accelerated molecular dynamics simulations on a deleterious disorder-to-order transition mutation of tumor protein p63 and, in agreement with our predictions, observed an increased α-helical propensity of the region harboring the mutation. Our findings highlight the importance of mutations in IDRs and refine the traditional structure-centric view of disease mutations. The results of this study offer a new perspective on the role of mutations in disease, with implications for improving predictors of the functional impact of missense mutations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Intrinsically unstructured or disordered proteins have been implicated in the etiology of a wide spectrum of diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms that relate mutations in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) to disease pathogenesis have not been investigated. Disordered proteins do not conform to the prevailing view of deleterious mutations which equates function, structure and evolutionary conservation – intrinsically disordered regions are functional, but lack a fixed three-dimensional structure and in general have low sequence conservation. Here we demonstrate that &gt;20% of disease-associated missense mutations affect IDRs and interfere with their functions. We further show that 20% of deleterious mutations in IDRs induce predicted disorder-to-order transitions. Our predictions are supported by accelerated molecular dynamics simulations that show an increase in helical propensity of the region harboring a disease disorder-to-order transition mutation of tumor protein p63. Our results refine the traditional structure-centric view of disease mutations and offer a new perspective on the role of non-synonymous mutations in disease. Our findings have broad implications for improving predictors of the functional impact of missense mutations, and for interpretation of novel variants identified in large genome sequencing projects that aim to provide a better understanding of human genetic variation and its relevance to common diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Recent years have seen significant advancements in cataloging the genetic variation in humans and relating it to disease susceptibility. In particular, missense mutations, which introduce changes in the amino acid sequence of proteins, have been the subject of considerable attention due to the large number of ongoing exome sequencing studies. As a result, numerous computational models that classify amino acid substitutions as damaging or benign are currently available (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Cooper1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Jordan1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Mooney1">[3]</xref>). The majority of these methods rely on the information from solved or modeled protein structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Yue1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Ramensky1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Chasman1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Sunyaev1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Cavallo1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Bao1">[9]</xref> and/or are based on evolutionary conservation, following the assumption that functionally important residues of proteins are conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Kumar1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Yue2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Ng1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Saunders1">[13]</xref>. This choice of features limits the usefulness of current methods for classifying mutations in proteins that lack a fixed structure or have low sequence conservation, both of which are hallmarks of the intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Underestimating the impact of missense mutations in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) leads to a decrease in overall sensitivity of the existing methods. For example, it has recently been observed that SIFT predictions have more false negatives on annotated disease mutations in disordered, solvent accessible and non-conserved regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Mort1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Intrinsically disordered proteins were first identified as a distinct class of proteins more than a decade ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Wright1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Dunker1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Tompa1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Uversky1">[18]</xref>. It has since been clearly demonstrated that IDPs are prevalent in eukaryotic proteomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Ward1">[19]</xref>, are involved in signaling and regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Iakoucheva1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Uversky2">[21]</xref>, carry sites of posttranslational modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Iakoucheva2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Radivojac1">[23]</xref>, and serve as hubs in protein interaction networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Haynes1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Ekman1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Dunker2">[26]</xref>. Despite their important functional roles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Uversky3">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Dunker3">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Xie1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Vucetic1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Xie2">[31]</xref>, IDRs generally have low sequence conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Brown1">[32]</xref>, with the exception of IDRs involved in chaperone activity and RNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Bellay1">[33]</xref>. IDPs have been implicated in many human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Iakoucheva1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Uversky4">[34]</xref>. Due to their signaling and regulatory roles, IDPs tend to be tightly regulated, and disruptions in regulation of IDPs have been linked to disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Babu1">[35]</xref>. Despite the functional importance and disease relevance of IDPs, the prevalence of disease-associated missense mutations in disordered regions and their impact on disordered conformations have not been investigated so far.</p>
      <p>Here, we offer a new perspective on disease mutations that accounts for mutations in disordered regions. We investigate disease-associated mutations located in ordered and disordered regions, and compare them to missense mutations from two control datasets, single amino acid polymorphisms and neutral evolutionary substitutions. We demonstrate that deleterious missense mutations may affect disordered regions, thereby disrupting the disorder-based type of structure. Our results suggest that disease mutations in ordered regions (ORs) and IDRs differ substantially in frequency, properties, and functional impact. We find that disease mutations in disordered regions more frequently cause predicted disorder-to-order transitions and influence predicted disordered binding regions (MoRFs) compared to mutations from the control datasets. IDR mutations are also enriched in DNA-binding and transmembrane domains, and in sites of posttranslational modifications. Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations performed on a deleterious disorder-to-order transition mutation that affects the DNA-binding domain of tumor protein p63 support our disorder predictions. We further show that two widely used predictors of functional impact of single nucleotide variants, PolyPhen-2 and SIFT, exhibit a &gt;10% decrease in sensitivity when predicting the effect of annotated disease mutations located in IDRs compared to ORs mutations. Our findings have broad implications for improving predictors of the functional impact of missense mutations and therefore may significantly influence the interpretation of novel variants identified in large genome sequencing projects.</p>

        <title>Mutation frequencies in ordered and disordered regions</title>
        <p>We examined the frequency of annotated disease mutations (DM) from the UniProt database in predicted ordered and disordered regions and compared them to the distributions of putatively functionally neutral mutations from two control datasets, annotated polymorphisms from UniProt (Poly) and neutral evolutionary substitutions (NES) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Materials and Methods</bold></xref>). We observed that disease mutations preferentially affect ordered regions, with 78.3% of them mapped to the predicted ordered regions and 21.7% mapped to the predicted disordered regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002709-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).

The annotated polymorphisms show somewhat intermediate distribution, with 59.6% in ORs and 40.4% in IDRs.

        <p>The enrichment of disease mutations in ORs cannot be explained by the overall lower disorder content of the proteins containing these mutations. Although proteins that carry disease-associated mutations are on average slightly less disordered than proteins from the Poly dataset (mean±SD 32.7±17.9% <italic>vs</italic> 35.3±19.5%, respectively; also see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), this difference is not sufficient to explain the 3.6 fold enrichment of disease mutations in ORs. Furthermore, despite the fact that the NES dataset was constructed from the same set of proteins as DM (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Materials and Methods</bold></xref>), only a 1.2 fold enrichment of mutations in ORs compared to IDRs is observed in this dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002709-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>), which lends further support to enrichment of disease mutations in ORs. Finally, we compared mutation rates (number of amino acid changes per ordered and per disordered residue) in ORs and IDRs in all three datasets, and only in the DM dataset the mutation rate in ORs was higher than the mutation rate in IDRs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002709-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>

        <p>Despite the prevalence of disease mutations in ordered regions, 21.7% of DMs are mapped to the predicted disordered regions. We have investigated these mutations in greater detail, as discussed below, and mutations in IDRs form the main focus of the remainder of this study.</p>

        <title>Disorder-to-order (D→O) and order-to-disorder (O→D) transition mutations</title>
        <p>Based on the predicted disorder probability score, a residue can be classified as ordered or disordered depending on whether its score is below or above a threshold of 0.5. When analyzed from an order/disorder perspective, any missense mutation can have two different outcomes: (i) it can change the prediction score sufficiently to cross the 0.5 threshold, which would result in a conversion of the prediction from disorder to order, or from order to disorder; or (ii) it can preserve the order/disorder assignment. Thus, the effect of missense mutations can be classified as D<bold><italic>→</italic></bold>D (disorder-to-disorder) or O<bold><italic>→</italic></bold>O (order-to-order) when disorder and order assignments do not change; and as D<bold><italic>→</italic></bold>O (disorder-to-order) or O<bold><italic>→</italic></bold>D (order-to-disorder) transitions when predicted disorder and order classes switch.</p>
        <p>Disease mutations mapped to disordered regions cause D<bold><italic>→</italic></bold>O transitions significantly more frequently than neutral evolutionary substitutions or polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002709-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). We observed that 20% of the disease mutations in disordered regions result in a D<bold><italic>→</italic></bold>O transition, compared to only 11.5% and 7.3% in the Poly and NES control sets (Fisher's exact <italic>P</italic> = 1.06·10<sup>−32</sup> and 5.47·10<sup>−105</sup>, respectively). In contrast, the rates of O<bold><italic>→</italic></bold>D transition show no change or a slight depletion in DM compared to Poly and NES, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002709-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Similar results were obtained using three different disorder predictors (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s011">Table S3</xref></bold>). These observations suggest that disease mutations in disordered regions are more likely to cause a significant structural perturbation, and possibly disrupt functions that necessitate protein disorder.

        <title>Secondary structure predictions and mutations</title>
        <p>To better understand how disease mutations influence protein secondary structure, we applied the secondary structure predictor PHD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Rost1">[39]</xref> to both the disease and control datasets. In each dataset, we calculated the frequencies of secondary structure elements (helices, strands and loops) and transitions between them upon a mutation. Overall, we observed that disease mutations affect helices and strands more frequently than control mutations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s012">Table S4</xref></bold>). We also observed that although most mutations do not cause a change in the assignment to a predicted helix, strand or loop, there is nevertheless a statistically significant increase in transitions between secondary structure elements caused by disease mutations compared to the control datasets (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s013">Table S5</xref></bold>). This increase was most pronounced for transitions from helices and strands into loops, and to a lesser extent for transitions from loops into helices and strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).

        <title>Disease mutations in predicted α-MoRF regions</title>
        <p>Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are short order-prone segments within longer disordered regions that fold upon binding to their interaction partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Mohan1">[47]</xref>. α-MoRFs specifically form α-helices upon binding. We predicted the presence of α-MoRFs at the position of the residue both before and after it was mutated, and classified the mutation as falling into one of the three categories: (i) “predicted MoRF lost” - an α-MoRF was predicted to overlap the position of the mutated residue in the wild-type sequence but not in the mutant sequence; (ii) “predicted MoRF gained” - an α-MoRF was predicted not to overlap the position of the mutated residues in the wild-type sequence but was predicted to overlap the position of the mutated residue in the mutant sequence; (iii) “MoRF present, no change” - an α-MoRF was predicted to overlap the mutated position in both the wild-type and the mutant sequences. Mutations where an α-MoRF was absent from both wild-type and mutant sequences were not taken into account. Amino acid substitutions were placed into IDR and OR categories based on the wild-type disorder score. Details of MoRF predictions are provided in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><bold>Materials and Methods</bold></xref> and in the <bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s021">Text S1</xref></bold>.</p>

        <p>The heat plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref> point to specific mutations that are highly enriched in disease. The most frequent disease mutation that causes a disorder-to-order transition is R→W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>). Other D<bold><italic>→</italic></bold>O transition mutations significantly enriched in the DM dataset include most notably R→C, R→H, E→K, R→Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g004"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>, left section). Several other types of disorder-to-order transition mutations, such as R→K, E→D, L→F, S→T, are significantly depleted in the DM dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g004"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>, right section), which demonstrates that distinct types of mutations preferentially occur within disease and control categories.</p>
        <p>To verify that this result is not an artifact of our analysis, for example due to general enrichment of R→W mutations in disordered regions, or the choice of control datasets, we have compared the frequencies of R→W substitutions from this study to the matrices constructed based on the alignments of completely disordered sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Brown2">[53]</xref>. This comparison showed that in general R→W substitutions occur extremely rarely in disordered regions (with 0.11% in D85 matrix and 0.03% in D40 matrix), whereas we find R→W substitution with much higher frequency in our datasets (11.69% in DM, 6.52% in Poly, and 0.95% in NES). This result suggests that the R→W mutation is truly enriched among disease mutations.</p>
        <p>Another category of amino-acid substitutions in DM, albeit not significantly enriched as a group, involve order-to-disorder mutations, such as L→P, C→R, G→R, W→R and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g004"><bold>Figure 4F</bold></xref>). Some of the enriched order-to-disorder mutations are inverses of the enriched disorder-to-order mutations, such as W→R, C→R, L→R, whereas some are shared between D→O and O→D, such as G→E. This shared category points to the fact that there is no strong preference for glycine and glutamic acid to be located in either ordered or disordered regions, as reflected by the presence of both residues in the middle of the TOP-IDP scale of residue disorder propensities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Campen1">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In summary, our analysis shows that a limited set of mutations accounts for a large fraction of all D→O and O→D transitions in the DM dataset. The top five disorder-to-order transition mutations (R→W, R→C, E→K, R→H and R→Q) collectively account for 44.0% of all D→O disease mutations, and the top five order-to-disorder transition mutations (L→P, C→R, G→R, W→R and F→S) collectively account for 32.2% of all O→D disease mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g004"><bold>Figure 4C and 4F</bold></xref>). Specific knowledge of the mutations responsible for such transitions may help the development of new classifiers to better predict the effects of mutations in IDRs.</p>

        <title>Arginine is the most frequently mutated residue in DM</title>

Mutations of arginine and glycine are most dominant in DM and account for 28.5% of all disease mutations, 18.6% of all Poly and only 11.1% of NES mutations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s003">Figure S3B</xref></bold>). After normalizing by the baseline residue frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Vacic1">[55]</xref> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s003">Figure S3A</xref></bold>), mutations of cysteine and tryptophane stood out, reflecting that in DM these two resides are mutated significantly above what is expected based on their frequency of occurrence in the human proteome. Interestingly, tryptophane and cysteine, and to a lesser degree histidine, are the residues into which other residues most frequently mutate, with a more pronounced effect in IDRs than in ORs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>).</p>
        <p>High mutability of arginine, also observed in earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Steward1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Vitkup1">[57]</xref>, together with the <bold>high propensity of arginine mutations to cause disorder-to-order transitions</bold> suggest an underlying mechanism which predisposes arginine to be a frequent target for disease mutations. Arginine is encoded by 6 distinct codons, 4 of which contain the CG dinucleotide (CGG, CGT, CGC and CGA). DNA methylation often involves CpG dinucleotides and due to spontaneous deamination 5-methylcytosine is more prone to mutating into T. Upon a C-to-T transition, the first three arginine codons would become codons for W (TGG) or C (TGT, TGC), and the last one would create a stop codon (TGA). The observed high frequency of R→W and R→C in DM and low frequency in control datasets (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>) argues in favor of negative selection against these amino acid substitutions, which frequently cause predicted disorder-to-order transitions in proteins.</p>

Upon closer examination, we determined that among DM mutations, the D→D transition category was the most difficult to predict correctly for both predictors, while the D→O category was most often correctly predicted as deleterious. However, in the case of D→O mutations, higher sensitivity comes at the expense of lower specificity, and significantly more mutations from Poly and NES are predicted as deleterious in D→O transitions than in any other category (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s017">Table S9</xref></bold>).

        <p>Tumor protein p63 (TP63) is a transcription factor involved in development and morphogenesis of epithelial tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Yang1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Osada1">[61]</xref>. The sequence, structure and domain organization of p63 are highly similar to tumor suppressor protein p53, with the exception of two additional domains at p63 C-terminus, which are alternatively spliced in some p63 isoforms. More than 30 distinct missense mutations have been identified in p63 and associated with several malformation genetic syndromes such as ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia-cleft syndrome 3 (EEC3, MIM: 604292), split hand/foot malformation-4 (SHFM4, MIM: 605289), and nonsyndromic cleft lip (NSCL, MIM: 129400). Most of the mutations that cause EEC3 occur within the DNA-binding domain of p63 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Celli1">[62]</xref>. One of these mutations, R243W, is predicted to cause a D→O transition, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref> as a sharp drop in disorder score of the 235–245 region (red dotted line) after R243 has been <italic>in silico</italic> mutated to W. Since R243 is not directly involved in binding to DNA, the mutations affecting this residue are predicted to destabilize the protein as a result of hydrogen bond loss and overpacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Chen1">[63]</xref>.</p>
        <p>DNA-binding domains of transcription factors tend to be predicted as fully or partially disordered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Liu2">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Guo1">[65]</xref>, and binding to DNA typically induces a D→O transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Hyre1">[66]</xref>. In agreement with these observations, only a single NMR structure of p63 DBD without DNA (PBD: 2RMN) is available, while all X-ray structures of p63 DBD found in PDB (PDB: 3US0, 3US1, 3US2, 3QYM and 3QYN) have been crystallized in complex with DNA. Residue R243 is located in the modeled turn region of the NMR structure, adjacent to a short α-helix. We investigated the effects of the R243W mutation on p63 DBD conformation using an extensive set of accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD) simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Hamelberg1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Markwick1">[68]</xref> on both the wild-type p63 (wt-p63) and its R243W mutant.</p>
        <p>AMD is an efficient and versatile enhanced conformational space sampling algorithm that has previously been successfully applied to the study of the conformational behavior of IDPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Mukrasch1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Markwick2">[70]</xref>. A comparative analysis of a series of AMD trajectories for wt-p63 and its R243W mutant revealed no significant differences in the global structural dynamics of the p63 DBD. However, marked differences in the conformational behavior of residues adjacent to R243W were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>). The introduction of R243W mutation caused a significant increase in the free energy weighted φ/ψ propensity of the α-helical/frustrated α-helical conformation of these residues, resulting α-helical population statistics of 70–90% and 30%–50% in the R243W mutant for residues 236–240 and 241–243 respectively, compared to 20%–60% and 20–25% in the wild-type system (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s020">Table S12</xref></bold>). The formation of an ostensibly exclusive (frustrated) α-helical coil in this region in the presence of the R243W mutation is fully consistent with the predicted D→O transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>).</p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that in both the experimental NMR structure and the AMD simulations for wt-p63 the side-chain of R243 forms a strong salt-bridge with E252. One may postulate that in the wild-type system the strong electrostatic interaction between R243 and E252 introduces tensile stress in the extended loop region K232-R243, which exhibits conformational exchange on slow time-scales between local extended β-sheet/PPII and α-helical constructs. By contrast, the introduction of the R243W mutation removes the tensile strain from the loop facilitating the formation of a stable α-helix.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The widely accepted structure-centric view of deleterious mutations asserts that a disease may be caused by mutations disrupting protein activity, stability, oligomerization and other structure-based properties. Here, we further extend this concept by introducing a disorder-centric view of disease mutations, according to which a disease may arise due to a disruption of the disorder-based protein properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Vacic2">[59]</xref>. We have demonstrated that <bold>a substantial fraction of disease-associated mutations are located within the intrinsically disordered protein regions, and that disease mutations in IDRs have a significant functional impact</bold> despite the fact that IDRs lack fixed structure and have fewer evolutionary constraints than ORs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Brown1">[32]</xref>. The analysis of mutations in IDRs shows that disorder-to-order transition mutations may be especially relevant to disease due to their enrichment compared to control datasets. In addition, our analysis suggests that several types of disease mutations may have particularly critical impact on disordered structure.</p>
      <p>There are many ways in which mutations in IDR may increase disease risk or cause a disease. For example, D→O mutations have a potential to alter interactions with DNA, RNA, proteins or ligands. Both, our results and those of a recent study by Dan <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Dan1">[71]</xref>, which examined transitions between disorder and secondary structure in proteins with solved 3D structures, converged on the observation that disorder-to-order (i.e. disorder-to-secondary structure in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Dan1">[71]</xref>) transitions are significantly enriched in DNA binding proteins. In addition, mutations in IDR could influence posttranslational modifications, assembly of macromolecular complexes, as well as signaling and regulatory processes that depend on disorder. Adding support to this hypothesis is an observation that disease mutations often disrupt anchoring of flexible loops of the catalytic domains in protein kinases, and that mutated residues are frequently involved in substrate binding and regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Torkamani1">[72]</xref>. This also suggests a potential downstream effect of mutations in IDR via dysregulation of cellular pathways which could lead to disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Vacic2">[59]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results show that across all three datasets, mutations in IDR are more likely to cause a predicted D→O transition than mutations in ORs are to cause a predicted O→D transition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002709-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). This is in agreement with a recent study by Schaefer <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Schaefer1">[73]</xref>, which showed that disordered regions are more sensitive to mutations than protein regions with defined secondary structure, with a caveat that “order” and “helix or strand” cannot be fully equated. Despite a significant enrichment of D→O mutations in disease, the majority of disease mutations in IDR do not result in a disorder-to-order transition (as defined in this paper) but they nonetheless sufficiently disrupt the disordered conformation to affect disorder-mediated functions. It is likely however that many other mutations that do not reach the disorder-to-order transition threshold may still disrupt the structure and consequently function of the disordered regions.</p>
      <p>Our findings have wide implications for large genome sequencing projects that aim to provide a better understanding of human genetic variation and its relevance to complex diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Cooper1">[1]</xref>. Because the sheer volume of the observed variants precludes systematic functional follow-up studies on each one individually, newly identified SNVs are short-listed and prioritized using predictors of the functional impact of SNVs, such as SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Jordan1">[2]</xref>. The majority of the currently used predictors are structure- and/or conservation-based, and therefore less accurate on variants in unstructured and non-conserved protein regions. Disorder predictions could be either integrated into current approaches, or new approaches, which analyze the features of mutations in ORs and IDRs separately, could be developed. In addition, in this study we demonstrate that specific types of mutations (such as R→W, R→C, etc.) account for almost one half of all D→O transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). This additional information may be important to include as a training feature when developing new predictors for the effects of D→O SNVs.</p>
      <p>A broader issue raised by our results is that caution should be exercised when interpreting the relationship between structure, function and conservation. A study by Yue and Moult found that human disease-relevant mutations in some cases could correspond to the wild-type variants in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Yue2">[11]</xref>. Compensatory mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Kondrashov1">[74]</xref> illustrate that function cannot be fully equated with the “first order conservation”, and that sometimes co-evolution of amino acids constrained by protein structure necessitates looking into the “second order conservation” between pairs of residues. Our results are consistent with the fact that IDRs are less conserved at any individual position, but rather show a conservation of disorder propensity within a region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Chen2">[75]</xref>, with D<bold><italic>→</italic></bold>O transition mutations – detrimental to conservation of disorder – being particularly enriched in disease.</p>
      <p>Choosing an appropriate control for the analysis of disease mutations is an issue which deserves close attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Care1">[76]</xref>. One of our control datasets, polymorphisms from UniProt (Poly), is likely to contain a fraction of as yet unannotated disease mutations, because it was assembled by translating missense single nucleotide variants (currently without any disease associations) into single amino acid changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Care1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Yip1">[77]</xref>. This is further supported by the predictive result that between 20% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Sunyaev1">[7]</xref> and 25% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Yue2">[11]</xref> of non-synonymous SNPs are likely to be associated with diseases. Nonetheless, Poly controls for an important previously identified confounder: because disease missense mutations are translations of a single nucleotide variation within a DNA codon, a genetically appropriate control has to be analogously constrained by the genetic code, that is, assembled from amino acid changes which are translations of functionally neutral SNVs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Vitkup1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Care1">[76]</xref>. In the protein space, another concern is that length distribution and amino acid compositions of proteins from DM and Poly datasets differ, which may influence their baseline biochemical properties, including disorder content (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). In order to address this potential confounder, the second control (NES) was generated starting with the sequences of proteins from the DM dataset. The downside of this approach is that the set of disease mutations spans within-population differences, while changes in the orthologs span larger, inter-species distances. In practice, this means that in DM and Poly the mutation probability matrix is dominated by the effects of the genetic code, while in DM and NES it is dominated by effects of physico-chemical similarity between amino acids. Nonetheless, variants fixed between species are likely to be non-deleterious (even though about 9% of interspecies substitutions have been estimated to be damaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Sunyaev1">[7]</xref>), and therefore they provide a useful additional control that takes into account sequence conservation. In the light of advantages and shortcomings of different control datasets, it is reassuring to see that when using either Poly or NES, protein disorder-related properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002709-t001"><bold>Tables 1</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002709-t002"><bold>2</bold></xref>) and WT-to-mutant amino acid changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002709-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>) are consistent and independent of the control dataset used. In addition, the preponderance of annotated mutations within OR might show some degree of ascertainment bias since some disease mutations were annotated as “disease” because they were mapped to protein structured domains. We hypothesize that an unbiased sample would contain a higher proportion of disease mutations that map to IDRs.</p>
      <p>In summary, our results refine the traditional structure-centric view of disease mutations, and suggest new avenues for research in the area of protein disorder. With the recent explosion of exome and whole genome sequencing efforts, interpretation of the identified variants will require highly accurate predictors for the functional impact of SNVs in order to make reliable conclusions about their health risks. Our results offer help in narrowing down the gamut of disease mutations that dramatically influence protein structure and disorder. We hope that it will also facilitate predictions of the influence of mutations on protein function, which is currently a formidable task. The importance of mutations in disordered regions should not be overlooked in an attempt to construct better predictors.</p>

        <p>A list of single amino acid substitutions annotated with the keyword “disease” was extracted from the UniProt/SwissProt database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Yip1">[77]</xref>. This manually curated catalog contains missense mutations associated with both Mendelian and complex diseases, but no nonsense nor frame shift mutations, and no products of alternative splicing.</p>
        <p>The initial set of mutations was filtered as follows: proteins that carry disease mutations and have ≥40% pairwise sequence identity were clustered using hierarchical clustering with single linkage, and one representative protein was selected at random from each cluster. We further removed four proteins with an unusually high number of annotated disease mutations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s008">Figure S8A</xref></bold>): tumor suppressor p53 (P04637), coagulation factor VIII (P00451), androgen receptor (P10275), and Stargardt disease protein (P78363). Taken together, these four proteins account for a total of 12.4% of all disease mutations found in the non-redundant set of proteins. All mutations from the removed proteins were discarded.</p>
        <p>We assembled two control datasets: (1) annotated single amino acid polymorphisms from UniProt (Poly) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002709-Yip1">[77]</xref> and (2) a set of pseudo-mutations based on amino acid variation in mammalian orthologous proteins (neutral evolutionary substitutions, NES).

Disorder predictions were carried out on full length wild-type (WT) and mutated protein sequences, generated by changing only one residue at a time. Disorder score &lt;0.5 signified predicted order and ≥0.5 signified predicted disorder. We defined the effect of a mutation as a disorder-to-order (D→O) transition if the prediction score for a residue to be mutated was ≥0.5 in the WT protein, and &lt;0.5 after the mutation. Order-to-disorder (O→D) transitions were analogously defined. The enrichment/depletion trends for D→O and O→D transitions are consistent across all three predictors (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s009">Tables S1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002709.s011">S3</xref></bold>).</p>
        <p>As a second comparison of disorder predictors, we examined the distributions of the difference between disorder prediction scores on WT and mutated sequences, defined as Δps = ps(WT residue)−ps(mutated). The three predictors have different observed dynamic ranges for Δps: [−0.91, 0.85] for VLXT, [−0.34, 0.39] for VSL2B and [−0.28, 0.27] for IUPRED, consistent with the fact that VLXT is more sensitive to small changes in amino acid sequence. Distribution of Δps is more platykurtic in DM compared to Poly and NES for all three predictors (higher % of disease-associated mutations in the tails), indicating that disease mutations tend to cause stronger differences in prediction scores.</p>
