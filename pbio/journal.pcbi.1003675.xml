<abstract>
<p>The chaperone BiP participates in several regulatory processes within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER): translocation, protein folding, and ER-associated degradation. To facilitate protein folding, a cooperative mechanism known as entropic pulling has been proposed to demonstrate the molecular-level understanding of how multiple BiP molecules bind to nascent and unfolded proteins. Recently, experimental evidence revealed the spatial heterogeneity of BiP within the nuclear and peripheral ER of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (commonly referred to as ‘clusters’). Here, we developed a model to evaluate the potential advantages of accounting for multiple BiP molecules binding to peptides, while proposing that BiP's spatial heterogeneity may enhance protein folding and maturation. Scenarios were simulated to gauge the effectiveness of binding multiple chaperone molecules to peptides. Using two metrics: folding efficiency and chaperone cost, we determined that the single binding site model achieves a higher efficiency than models characterized by multiple binding sites, in the absence of cooperativity. Due to entropic pulling, however, multiple chaperones perform in concert to facilitate the resolubilization and ultimate yield of folded proteins. As a result of cooperativity, multiple binding site models used fewer BiP molecules and maintained a higher folding efficiency than the single binding site model. These <italic>insilico</italic> investigations reveal that clusters of BiP molecules bound to unfolded proteins may enhance folding efficiency through cooperative action via entropic pulling.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The misfolding of proteins carries important implications for diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer, and diabetes. Once misfolded, proteins tend to associate into aggregates that pose a toxic threat to the cell. Chaperones are proteins that rescue the cell from an accumulation of these maladjusted proteins through dissociation of toxic oligomers and proper (re)folding. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that serves as the staging ground for the chaperone activities of protein transport, folding, and maturation in the early secretory pathway. We have developed a computational model to investigate potential mechanisms that enable multiple ER-resident molecules working in concert to effectively fold peptides and transport nascent proteins across the ER membrane. Although previous models focused on chaperone interactions with peptides, we have explored the influence of cooperativity among chaperone molecules to assist in protein folding and maturation. We found that chaperone cooperation led to a higher yield of folded molecules compared to when chaperones bound to peptides in a 1∶1 stoichiometry. We have concluded that the clustering or multiple binding of chaperones may facilitate protein folding <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is characterized by the integration of biological pathways that modulate protein biogenesis, maturation, transport, and degradation. As a critical element to cell survival, networks of molecular chaperones, foldases, and quality control components minimize the effects of cell stress in order to revert to a homeostatic environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Hartl1">[1]</xref>. Proteostasis occurs in distinct subcellular environments and is constantly monitored by stress-signaling pathways. In eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the first membrane-enclosed organelle of the secretory pathway, which ascertains the fidelity of protein folding, maturation, biogenesis (<italic>i.e.</italic> translation and ER translocation), and ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, multiple ER quality control mechanisms have been identified to modulate these critical ER processes, including associated chaperone/co-chaperone interactions. Specifically, molecular chaperones dissociate aggregates, self-associating conglomerations of unfolded and misfolded proteins, which would otherwise interfere with the cell homeostasis leading to cell dysfunction and death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Soto1">[2]</xref>. Despite the ubiquitous nature of molecular chaperones, a variety of insults can overwhelm the ER's processing capacity including nutrient deprivation, pathogenic infection, cell differentiation, or alterations in calcium concentration or redox status. As a consequence of ER stress, aberrant proteins accumulate within this organelle, triggering intracellular pathways collectively referred to as the unfolded protein response (UPR). In eukaryotes, the UPR transcriptionally up-regulates genes encoding molecular chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Kozutsumi1">[3]</xref>, ERAD machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Biederer1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Hiller1">[7]</xref>, key enzymes of lipid biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Cox1">[8]</xref>, and other components of the secretory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Ng1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Urano1">[11]</xref>. Notably, several key features of the UPR are conserved across eukaryotes; although expanded in scope, the mammalian UPR has similar attributes to that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, particularly with respect to the Ire1p-dependent regulation of unfolded proteins and BiP modulation of the response (reviewed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Mori1">[12]</xref>). The elucidation of these pathways – specifically the interplay between UPR and ERAD – has become of growing importance in therapeutics as loss of proteostasis has been suggested to lead to a number of human diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Disease and Type II Diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Marciniak1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the early secretory pathway, protein fidelity is attributed to select chaperone/co-chaperone interactions (Hsp70 and Hsp40 proteins, respectively) conserved via evolution from yeast to humans. As one of two distinct Hsp70 molecular chaperones in the ER, BiP/Kar2p binds preferentially to hydrophobic residues of nascent or unfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Flynn1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-BlondElguindi1">[15]</xref>. BiP, the yeast homolog of binding protein immunoglobulin (referred to as Kar2/Grp78 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Rose1">[16]</xref>), has been identified as an essential component of ER translocation, protein folding and maturation, karyogamy, and ERAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Latterich1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Tsai1">[20]</xref>. To facilitate protein folding, co-chaperones stimulate the binding of BiP to substrates whereas nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) assist in BiP's stochastic release via cycles dependent upon adenosine triphosphate (ATP). For example, co-chaperone Sec63 directly interacts with BiP, increasing its affinity for nascent proteins as they advance through the translocation pore in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Lyman1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Young1">[23]</xref>. In yeast, the posttranslational translocation of nascent peptides is mediated by a heptameric Sec complex, composed of Sec63, Sec62, as well as the heterotrimer Sec61, which serves as the protein-conducting channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Deshaies1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Panzner1">[25]</xref>. Photo-cross-linking experiments have shown that nascent peptides are in continuous contact with Sec61 during protein translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Mothes1">[26]</xref>. More recently, cryo-electron microscopy established that a single Sec61 heterotrimer enables the progress of nascent proteins across the ER membrane, a conserved feature manifested in both yeast and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Becker1">[27]</xref>. In addition to ER translocation, BiP's interaction with co-chaperone Scj1 has been implicated in protein folding and maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Schlenstedt1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Silberstein1">[29]</xref>, and degradation of aberrant proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Nishikawa2">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>ER translocation, protein folding and maturation, as well as ERAD are conserved mechanisms across eukaryotes. As such, the model eukaryotic organism, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, provides an effective experimental platform to elucidate an improved mechanistic-understanding of proteostasis, specifically with regards to ER chaperone/co-chaperone interactions. Proteomic studies have identified absolute levels of protein expression and verified the location of ER-resident proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Huh1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Ghaemmaghami1">[32]</xref>. These data suggest that the ER-resident chaperone BiP exceeds the level of all co-chaperones in the ER by at least an order of magnitude at conditions of normal growth, and is significantly up-regulated during the UPR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Travers1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Mager1">[33]</xref> indicating a significant increase in BiP's total abundance. Furthermore, BiP binds to substrates with varying affinities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Flynn1">[14]</xref>, suggesting BiP responds to the protein's folding requirements. Interestingly, from an experimental perspective, the spatial localization of ER-resident chaperones or co-chaperones has been evaluated for only Sec63 during the process of translocation. In yeast, membrane protein Sec63 must by necessity be localized at the ER membrane in order for nascent proteins to translocate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Corsi1">[34]</xref>. Collectively, this evidence suggests that BiP's spatiotemporal profile may be a contributing factor to its diversity and functionality in the ER. This hypothesis was previously posited and computationally explored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Griesemer1">[35]</xref>. Those results were in agreement with Sec63 experimental results, and further suggested that BiP clusters may exist in order to facilitate the efficient translocation of nascent proteins.</p>
<p>That BiP performs disparate functions owes to its tendency to bind many different types of proteins. Binding of multiple chaperones to unfolded proteins has been established and determined to be kinetically favorable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Laufen1">[36]</xref>. The transport of nascent proteins into the ER involves many BiP molecules working in concert. Algorithms to predict binding sites have been developed, and there are many examples of proteins that have repeated hydrophobic stretches of amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-BlondElguindi1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Gething1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Davis1">[38]</xref>, which predict the presence of multiple binding sites. Aggregates have also been found to have the analogous binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-SanchezdeGroot1">[39]</xref>, while their large size implies that multiple BiP molecules could engage them at individual sites simultaneously. Here, we refer to clustering as the process by which multiple BiP molecules bind to individual binding sites that can be predicted from hydrophobic residues along the length of the protein. This is in contrast to aggregation, where self-associating conglomerations of unfolded and misfolded proteins combine into larger toxic structures.</p>
<p>Experimental evidence has revealed that the refolding of misfolded proteins and aggregates occurs in the presence of a molar excess of chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-BenZvi1">[40]</xref>, which led investigators to propose that multiple chaperones apply a cooperative stretching force known as entropic pulling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-DeLosRios1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Goloubinoff1">[42]</xref>. The random motion of several bound individual chaperones on a peptide can sum up to an effective unfolding enabling re-initialization of the folding process. The additional molecules provide an inertial brace that stabilizes the interaction between chaperone and protein. In the case of chaperone-mediated disaggregation, the brace is the aggregate itself. A similar mechanism enables chaperones to assist nascent peptides during ER translocation.</p>
<p>Cooperative action underlies many cellular processes including signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Bialek1">[43]</xref>, protein transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Dmitreiff1">[44]</xref>, and chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Sourjik1">[45]</xref>. In the chaperone system, binding is not cooperatively enhanced. Rather, the rate of solubilization and renaturing of proteins increases with the number of chaperone molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-BenZvi1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we created a computational model to investigate the extent that an ER-resident chaperone, BiP — spatially localized to “clusters” — may influence the extent of protein folding. Our model includes BiP, the co-chaperones Scj1 and Sec63, and multiple states corresponding to unfolded proteins and complexes. This work implements ER-resident chaperone/co-chaperone interactions, experimental insights <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Lyman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Misselwitz1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Mayer1">[48]</xref>, estimates of species concentrations determined for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Ghaemmaghami1">[32]</xref>, and binding affinities between BiP, Sec63, and synthetic peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Misselwitz1">[46]</xref>, . When experimental data were not available, established estimates from the mammalian literature for these highly conserved mechanisms and proteins were used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003675.s002">Text S1</xref>, Table S1, Supporting Information). To assess the potential advantages of clusters, this model was used to evaluate the extent to which gradients of BiP molecules may facilitate its activities in protein folding and aggregate disassembly. Previous models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Powers1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Robinson1">[59]</xref> have included varying aspects of chaperone activities and interactions, yet only accounted for a single binding site scenario; in contrast, our model focuses on multiple binding as the mechanism to facilitate BiP's roles in the ER.</p>
<p>This study provides a detailed analysis of (i) the quantitative impact of chaperone clustering activity in the ER and contributing factors leading to efficient protein folding; and (ii) the potential mechanisms and interplay among components of ER quality control. Together, this framework provides an improved mechanistic understanding of chaperone/co-chaperone interactions, as well as possible strategies to minimize the accumulation of misfolded proteins.</p>

<title>Model Description</title>
<p>We created an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to study the efficiency of protein folding due to the molecular heterogeneity of ER-resident chaperone, BiP. Four sub-models were created that differ by the stoichiometry of binding sites to the protein species: one, two, three, and four (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To evaluate model performance two metrics were accounted for: (i) folding efficiency (<italic>i.e.</italic>, fraction of proteins folded); and (ii) chaperone cost (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the molecular resources needed to achieve a specified level of efficiency). A schematic of the ER, as well as prominent protein-protein interactions, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g002">Figure 2</xref>. A total of 60 species and 125 reactions are evident in the largest model. Within a model, numerous states have been depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g003">Figure 3</xref>.

<p>Our model monitored the fate of soluble proteins within the ER lumen by investigating the composition of six modules, as follows:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p>Protein Synthesis and Translocation</p>
<p>A nascent protein (N) is synthesized by a ribosome localized on the ER membrane (cytosolic interface) near the translocon, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g002">Figure 2a</xref>. Sec61 channels, referred to as translocation pores, are activated by the binding of co-chaperone Sec63, and nascent proteins can then start the process of translocation through the ER membrane. In this study, we modeled the movement of nascent proteins across the ER membrane as post-translational translocation, which directly involves the Sec complex of eukaryotes. The nascent protein progresses forward into the pore channel (Pore-Sec63-N→Pore-Sec63-N<italic>x</italic>), exposing a binding site (<italic>x</italic>) within the lumen where a BiP molecule may bind. We assume that a BiP molecule preferentially binds at a site closest to the membrane, consisting of hydrophobic residues, as the co-chaperone/chaperone interaction facilitates this binding (Pore-Sec63-N<italic>x</italic>+BiP→Pore-Sec63-N-BiP). Subsequently, a nascent protein can irreversibly proceed into the lumen, thus exposing a second binding site to BiP at the channel; however, it cannot assume the first configuration that consisted of the initial BiP at the membrane, since BiP acts as a “stopper” to prevent this motion. This cycle continues until the nascent protein has completely exited the channel. The nascent protein then dissociates from the Pore-Sec63 complex and is now classified as an unfolded protein (U), with bound BiP molecules spaced intermittently along the length of the peptide. In this model, the Pore-Sec63 complex disassociates into its constituent proteins, yet whether Sec61 pores are involved in successive rounds of ER translocation is unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Liebermeister1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Elston2">[63]</xref>.</p>

<p>Misfolding, Unfolding, and Productive Folding</p><p>This multifaceted pathway is detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g002">Figure 2b</xref>. In this scenario, the default initial protein state is unfolded, but may terminally misfold, a circumstance dependent on the ratio of unfolded proteins to chaperones. Misfolded proteins cannot spontaneously progress towards an unfolded state since a key role of chaperone/co-chaperone systems is to bind to misfolded proteins and unfold them, thereby resulting in an opportunity to fold to its proper confirmation. In this model, the mechanism of the chaperone system begins with unfolded or misfolded proteins binding to the J-type co-chaperone Scj1 (analogous to Erj3 in humans) or with BiP forming binary complexes (Scj1∶U/M or BiP∶U/M, where the “/” indicates “either-or”). BiP binds weakly to substrates while Scj1 accelerates ATP hydrolysis to facilitate BiP's conformational change, thus an increased affinity between BiP and the unfolded protein. Consequently, BiP and Scj1 may act synergistically. BiP molecules bound to U/M passively prevent misfolding and aggregation (or in the case of aggregates, further oligomerization). Unfolded proteins fold either spontaneously or by chaperone assistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Kinjo1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Hartl2">[67]</xref>.</p>

Our model describes aggregation as a process in which non-native proteins associate and evolve by the addition of unfolded or misfolded proteins. Aggregation by this process could lead to large masses of hundreds of monomers, which as a model would be intractable computationally. Thus, we limited the size of aggregates to four. Notably, larger aggregates require the assistance of additional ERQC components other than BiP and Scj1 alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Diamant1">[68]</xref>, limiting applicability here. Each aggregate maintains a number of binding sites up to the size of the aggregate and/or the number of binding sites of the model, whichever is less. Thus, the single binding site model has only one binding site even for a size four aggregate (A4), while the four site model has four binding sites on A4. The rate of accumulation of proteins into aggregates is assumed to be equal for all sizes of aggregates (10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), except the first step (nucleation) which was constrained as one-tenth of all sequential steps, thus rate-limiting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Kiefhaber1">[69]</xref>. We assume that the aggregation is irreversible except through the action of chaperones. To substantiate this assumption, Diamant <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Diamant1">[68]</xref> demonstrated that Hsp70 chaperones have a diminished ability to re-solubilize very large aggregates by themselves.</p>

<p>Disaggregation</p><p>Disaggregation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g002">Figure 2d</xref>. Disaggregation is critical for the recovery of ER homeostasis following the accumulation of protein aggregates due to classical cell stress responses, such the heat shock response or UPR. Successful disaggregation leads to a misfolded monomer bound to a single chaperone, while the remaining chaperones and aggregate exist in a complex [A<sub>j-1</sub>-iBiP where j-1 is the new aggregate size and i is the number of BiPs still bound to the aggregate. We have assumed that aggregates do not dissociate freely, in the absence of chaperone interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Sharma1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-BenZvi2">[71]</xref>. However, chaperones can extract a constituent misfolded protein from the aggregate, reducing the aggregate size. In an iterative manner, this process yields total disaggregation. Scj1 facilitates BiP's function by binding initially to the aggregate before ATP hydrolysis, thus securing the ER-resident chaperone, BiP, to the substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Acebrn1">[72]</xref>. Chaperone/co-chaperone interactions stabilize the aggregate at its current size. As with the folding or triage reactions, BiP can perform disaggregation independent of Scj1, but at a lower binding rate. We set the disaggregation rate to 1 s<sup>−1</sup> for BiP-only mediated reactions.</p>

<title>Model Results</title>
<p>Steady-state solutions for the four model cases (corresponding to 1, 2, 3 or 4 binding sites) were completed for different values of BiP association to unfolded proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g004">Figure 4</xref> compares the models in terms of folding efficiency (<italic>i.e.</italic>, total folded as a percentage of total protein) and association rate. In the absence of cooperativity, the single binding site model (Model 1) yields increased levels of folded protein, as unfolded protein binding sites are more easily saturated, providing more BiP coverage of the unfolded protein population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g005">Figure 5</xref>). When one examines the time of interaction between BiP and unfolded proteins, BiP covers more proteins, each for a longer period of time (in protein per second) as compared to the alternative models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This effect occurs at low ratios of BiP∶U, hence the chaperone is classified as a ‘holdase’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Slepenkov1">[73]</xref>. However, the simpler non-cooperative models are incomplete in describing the entropic pulling data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-BenZvi1">[40]</xref>, hinting that multiple BiPs must also act as a cooperative ‘unfoldase’, in line with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Slepenkov1">[73]</xref>.</p>

<p>In comparison to other models herein, the degree of folding in the single binding site model is more highly dependent on the association rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Multiple BiP binding events minimize the potential of an unfolded protein towards either misfolding or aggregation pathways, as a consequence of redundant binding events. We have not accounted for ATP molecules in our simulations, since this aspect would only be of concern in a depleted ATP environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Sharma1">[70]</xref>.</p>
<p>In line with the entropic pulling contributing to BiP function, we increased the rates of folding, unfolding, and disaggregation by a factor of C, to reflect the cooperativity of multiple chaperones participating in these select intracellular activities. With C = 10 (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the lower end of the range (1–100) reported in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-DeLosRios1">[41]</xref>, Model 2 resulted in the highest level of folded protein. Less folding was observed in Models 3 and 4 as compared to Model 2 since coverage competes with cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g007">Figure 7</xref>). When cooperativity is implemented, the folding efficiency for Models 2, 3, and 4 increases; Model 2 performs optimally for C&gt;5, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g008">Figure 8</xref>.</p>

<p>We then varied the concentrations of total BiP and unfolded protein to examine the effect on the two metrics described previously. As expected, increased concentrations of BiP led to higher levels of folding and less aggregation. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the ratio of BiP∶U is a more important factor than the concentrations of either species alone. In the noncooperative scenario, Model 1 produced the most folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g009">Figure 9</xref>); however, when cooperativity was added, Models 2–4 attained higher folding efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g010">Figure 10</xref>). These results suggest that when the BiP∶U ratio is low (<italic>e.g.</italic>, conditions of ER stress), cooperativity provides an advantage for multiple binding. At higher BiP concentrations (<italic>i.e.</italic>, relative to the concentration of U), cooperativity became a factor of less importance since the majority of unfolded proteins were protected from aggregation. As a result, more binding sites were occupied, leading to an equalization in the total amount of folding among the four models, <italic>i.e.</italic> the cooperativity effect was less pronounced.</p>

In general, it is better to maintain a lower cost metric resulting in fewer chaperones bound per second. Due to the faster rates of disaggregation, unfolding, and folding in the cooperative scenario for Models 2, 3 and 4, chaperones maintained a shorter interaction with proteins. More chaperones were engaged with a single protein in Models 2–4, yet this result was counteracted by decreased time that chaperones were bound to the protein.</p>

Thus, although the folding efficiencies are different for the four models and cooperativity scenarios, the increases in efficiency are proportional to each other.

<p>The <underline>BiP-U disassociation rate</underline> is highly anti-correlated with the folding efficiency (∼−0.99). When the disassociation rate is low, BiP remains bound to the protein (or aggregate), thus allowing for additional time for triage and ultimately folding.</p>

<p>The <underline>misfolding rate</underline> is uncorrelated with all folding efficiencies across models and cooperativity scenarios equal in folding yield.

<p>In addition to the single parameter study, we performed a variance-based global sensitivity analysis, in which we varied seven parameters (the BiP association rate, the BiP disassociation rate, the aggregation rate, the unfolding rate, the misfolding rate, the folding rate, and the sequestration rate) over two orders of magnitude simultaneously, and produced 100,000 parameter sets as input to the seven models (four non-cooperative and three cooperative models). We ran each simulation to steady state and recorded the metrics of folding efficiency and chaperone cost. From the variance-based global sensitivity analysis we learned that the sequestration rate and the aggregation rate were the dominant contributors to the variance of the output. However the variance was quite small. Our graphs then revealed for all seven parameters that the output mean across regions of parameter space was essentially constant within a model. This remarkable result indicates that the model output is rather invariant to changes in parameters. Instead our results show that model structure (the number of binding sites) and the cooperativity factor play a critical role in the behavior of the models. In addition, we also varied the concentrations of BiP and unfolded protein (U).

<title>Translocation</title>
<p>Finally, a translocation scenario was implemented to evaluate the impact of BiP clustering in a dynamic environment. In five different scenarios, a protein flux of 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000 molecules per second was added to the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Schnell1">[74]</xref> over a period of 100 seconds. Thus, many more molecules transverse the membrane to enter the ER lumen, with 10<sup>6</sup> molecules initially localized in the lumen as in the steady-state case.

We determined that the translocation flux is highly negatively correlated (−0.96 to −0.99) with folding efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g013">Figure 13</xref>). This result was expected; as the protein flux increases, nascent proteins accumulate at the cytosol/ER membrane interface due to the limited number of pore complexes while BiP preferentially localized to ER the membrane as compared to the lumen. In the non-cooperative model, Model 1 has the highest efficiency due to the coverage effect. When cooperativity is accounted for, the multiple binding models yield a higher folding efficiency.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The chaperone BiP participates in many critical ER processes, including translocation, protein folding, disaggregation, and degradation. To elucidate an improved mechanistic understanding of ER proteostasis, we constructed a computational model to evaluate ER-resident chaperone/co-chaperone interactions in which multiple BiP molecules interact with nascent and unfolded proteins to facilitate protein folding and maturation. In contrast to established models that focused only on a single site for chaperone binding events, we modeled the mechanism of entropic pulling, in which several chaperones operate in concert to unfold and disaggregate peptides by incorporating a stretching force caused by random motions of the individual chaperones. In order to investigate the acceleration of nascent proteins across an organelle membrane, entropic pulling unifies aspects of both the Brownian ratchet model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Liebermeister1">[61]</xref> and power stroke model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Chauwin1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Kepler1">[76]</xref> exceedingly well. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, entropic pulling was implemented successfully to track chaperone interactions during mitochondria translocation and to assess nascent proteins and aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-DeLosRios1">[41]</xref>. Our model that incorporates this synergy represents a progress towards a mechanistic understanding of chaperone interactions.</p>
<p>Protein aggregation was modeled as a separate module to monitor protein fate during simulations. Results indicated that most unfolded and aggregated proteins carried out a transient interaction with chaperone molecules. Despite the stochastic binding events between BiP and unfolded proteins, the sequestration of aggregates can entrap chaperone molecules leading to decreased chaperone levels. The comparison of BiP-protein interactions, in terms of folding efficiency and levels of chaperone cost, was quantified for models containing divergent numbers of binding sites. Our results indicate that for a given concentration of BiP and proteins (<italic>i.e.</italic>, nascent, unfolded, or misfolded), single binding site models provided the highest degree of BiP coverage. However, experimental evidence previously showed that multiple chaperone molecules can work in concert to increase protein refolding and remove aggregates <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, our model revealed that the BiP-protein interaction provides additional advantages, such that multiple bound BiP molecules <italic>prevent</italic> misfolding of U.</p>
<p>Given the parameter uncertainty, we conducted a study that varied seven parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003675-g012">Figure 12</xref>) in order to examine the effects of folding efficiency in the system. Initially, each parameter was individually altered, as a global search required many sets and covered only a fraction of the parameter space. We observed that some parameters were positively correlated with folding efficiency and others were negatively correlated. The strongest effect came from the disassociation rate of BiP from unfolded proteins, because the longer the BiP could stay bound, the greater chance that folding could occur. Note: this analysis varied one parameter at a time, while keeping the others constant. Global sensitivity analysis, where all parameters were varied simultaneously, is found in the <italic>Global Sensitivity Analysis Supplement</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003675.s003">Text S2</xref>.</p>
<p>Due to the highly conserved features between the model eukaryote, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and mammalian protein-folding machinery, it is extremely likely that these findings for ER translocation and protein-folding events will translate to higher eukaryotes including humans. In fact, mammalian BiP (Grp78) appears to have two functions in protein translocation: (i) it is involved in the insertion of nascent proteins into the Sec61 complex or opening of the pore itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Klappa1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Dierks1">[78]</xref>, and (ii) it binds to the nascent protein that laterally advances through the channel, in a manner similar to a molecular ratchet that facilitates translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Nicchitta1">[79]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Shaffer1">[81]</xref>. Recently, experimental studies of the mammalian homolog of the Sec complex – co-chaperone Sec63 in yeast – has been shown to recruit BiP to the translocon (<italic>i.e.</italic> Sec61) and activates BiP for interaction with its substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Tyedmers2">[82]</xref>, analogous to the BiP's recruitment to the translocon in yeast, as described previously. The function of many subunits of the Sec complex in mammalian cells has remained elusive due to limited experimental assessments; however, recent progress has begun to elucidate translocation efficiency, gating kinetics and functional profiling, and transport effects of subunits that comprise the mammalian Sec complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Trueman1">[83]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Lang1">[85]</xref>.</p>
<p>Developing spatially-relevant computational models is important as <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, such as single particle tracking (SPT) and super-resolution fluorescence imaging techniques used to capture spatial effects at nanometer resolution, are relatively new technologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Levi1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Han1">[87]</xref>. Interestingly, under conditions of cell homeostasis BiP has been found to distribute heterogeneously throughout the yeast ER, as depicted by live cell imaging and immunofluorescence techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Young1">[23]</xref>. In a similar manner, we conducted fluorescence spectroscopy experiments to quantify the extent that BiP gradients exist within the ER lumen (unpublished data). Under conditions of ER stress, a greater degree of BiP clustering was observed. The spatial heterogeneity of BiP is displayed via live cell imaging; in contrast, the translocation pore composed of Sec61 is distributed homogenously within the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003675.s001">Figure S1</xref>, Supporting Information). Via computationally intensive efforts, and only through providing cooperative action do the advantages of clustering become evident, providing a mechanistic context for the observed differences.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the chaperone BiP plays several roles in the ER, namely translocation, protein folding, ER-associated degradation, and modulation of the UPR. All of these functions require that BiP perform multiple tasks to complete the process. In translocation, the accepted model is that of a Brownian ratchet, in which multiple BiP molecules bind to nascent proteins to transport them into the lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Elston1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Elston2">[63]</xref>. BiP's attempt to correctly fold aberrant proteins often takes multiple cycles of binding and release. We show that multiple binding facilitates aggregate dismantling through more coverage on the structures' large surfaces. In addition, our model suggests that the clustering of BiP molecules would be beneficial in terms of efficiency and chaperone cost during protein-folding processes in the ER.</p>

<p>Spatial effects of BiP and Sec61 identified by live-cell imaging. Fluorescent protein variants (<italic>i.e.</italic> mCherry and yEmCitrine, respectively) were fused in-frame to the C-termini of BiP and Sec61. These recombinant proteins were expressed simultaneously in haploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells under the control of their endogenous promoters, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Young1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003675-Young2">[88]</xref>. (A) ER-resident molecular chaperone, BiP, is localized to the nuclear and peripheral ER subcompartments. Arrows depict the heterogeneity of BiP distributed throughout the lumen, specifically within the nuclear ER. (B) In contrast, Sec61 appears to be homogeneously localized within the nuclear ER membrane, when assessed in identical cells. (C) DIC image and scale bar of 5 microns. Image was acquired by confocal microscopy (Zeiss 780 confocal microscopy, 100×/NA 1.46).</p>
