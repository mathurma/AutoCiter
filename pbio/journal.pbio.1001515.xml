        <p>The protein kinase activity of PI3K phosphorylates specific serine residues in growth factor receptors to promote cell survival; these events are constitutively activated in some leukemias.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>The dual specificity protein/lipid kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), promotes growth factor-mediated cell survival and is frequently deregulated in cancer. However, in contrast to canonical lipid-kinase functions, the role of PI3K protein kinase activity in regulating cell survival is unknown. We have employed a novel approach to purify and pharmacologically profile protein kinases from primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells that phosphorylate serine residues in the cytoplasmic portion of cytokine receptors to promote hemopoietic cell survival. We have isolated a kinase activity that is able to directly phosphorylate Ser585 in the cytoplasmic domain of the interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors and shown it to be PI3K. Physiological concentrations of cytokine in the picomolar range were sufficient for activating the protein kinase activity of PI3K leading to Ser585 phosphorylation and hemopoietic cell survival but did not activate PI3K lipid kinase signaling or promote proliferation. Blockade of PI3K lipid signaling by expression of the pleckstrin homology of Akt1 had no significant impact on the ability of picomolar concentrations of cytokine to promote hemopoietic cell survival. Furthermore, inducible expression of a mutant form of PI3K that is defective in lipid kinase activity but retains protein kinase activity was able to promote Ser585 phosphorylation and hemopoietic cell survival in the absence of cytokine. Blockade of p110α by RNA interference or multiple independent PI3K inhibitors not only blocked Ser585 phosphorylation in cytokine-dependent cells and primary human AML blasts, but also resulted in a block in survival signaling and cell death. Our findings demonstrate a new role for the protein kinase activity of PI3K in phosphorylating the cytoplasmic tail of the GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors to selectively regulate cell survival highlighting the importance of targeting such pathways in cancer.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The ability of cells to survive in the absence of proliferation (cell division), differentiation (cell maturation) or activation allows tissues to maintain cell populations that are poised for rapid responses to damage, infections, or other physiological demands. While this “survival-only” response is fundamental to all physiological processes, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Many growth factors are potent regulators of cell survival through their ability to bind specific cell surface receptors, which in turn activate specialized enzymes called kinases. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a dual specificity kinase that is known to be involved in cell survival and malignant transformation, and it is able to phosphorylate both lipid and protein substrates. While the PI3K lipid kinase activity has been extensively studied, the functional significance of its protein kinase activity remains unclear. Here we show that PI3K protein kinase activity can directly phosphorylate growth factor receptors on human hematopoietic (blood) cells to promote a “survival-only” response. We further show that the protein kinase activity of PI3K can be hijacked to result in uncontrolled growth factor receptor phosphorylation and the deregulated survival of leukemic cells. Our studies provide the first evidence that the protein kinase activity of PI3K can control cell survival and that this activity may be deregulated in cancer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A key mechanism by which growth factors and cytokines promote cell survival is via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and constitutive PI3K signaling is known to promote autonomous cell survival and transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Cantley1">[1]</xref>. The recruitment and activation of class 1A isoforms of PI3K (p110α, p110β, p110δ) by cytokine and growth factor receptors leads to the phosphorylation of phosphatidyl inositol phosphates (PIPs) and the subsequent docking of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain proteins such as Akt that activate downstream signaling cascades and biological responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Cantley1">[1]</xref>. However, in addition to their lipid kinase activity, all members of the class 1 PI3K family also possess intrinsic protein kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Dhand1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Foukas1">[4]</xref>. While much is known regarding the targets and biological functions of PI3K lipid signaling, little is known of the substrates and functional roles of its protein kinase activity.</p>
      <p>We and others have shown that the phosphorylation of specific serine residues in the cytoplasmic tails of growth factor and cytokine receptors is critical for initiating intracellular signaling pathways that selectively control cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Guthridge1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Peruzzi1">[9]</xref>. In non-transformed cells, physiological picomolar (pM) concentrations of GM-CSF and IL-3 are able to promote Ser585 phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic domain of the βc receptor subunit to regulate cell survival in the absence of other biological responses such as proliferation (the “survival-only” response) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Guthridge3">[7]</xref>. Importantly, this “survival-only” pathway is deregulated in leukemia with constitutive Ser585 phosphorylation clearly detectable in &gt;85% of primary AML samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Powell1">[10]</xref>. Such findings suggest that the kinase responsible for cytokine receptor serine phosphorylation and cell survival becomes constitutively activated in leukemia and may therefore represent a potential therapeutic target.</p>
      <p>We therefore sought to identify the kinases that promote cellular transformation through their ability to constitutively phosphorylate serine residues in cytokine receptors. Using primary human AML patient samples, we have isolated a kinase that phosphorylates Ser585 in the cytoplasmic tail of the GM-CSF/IL-3 βc receptor. We have identified this Ser585 kinase as the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K and show that physiological picomolar concentrations of cytokine activate the protein kinase activity of PI3K leading to Ser585 phosphorylation and cell survival. Inhibition of p110α using pharmacological and RNA interference approaches reduced Ser585 phosphorylation in multiple cell types including primary human AML blasts whereas expression of a mutant form of p110α that was lipid kinase-defective but protein kinase-active restored Ser585 phosphorylation. Our findings identify a new role for the protein kinase activity of PI3K in promoting cytokine-mediated cell survival and provide a novel functional link between the deregulated PI3K protein kinase activity and phosphotyrosine-independent survival programs in leukemia.</p>

        <p>GM-CSF and IL-3 receptor signaling regulate both proliferation and survival of normal myeloid cells and play an important role in myeloid leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Guthridge4">[11]</xref>. However, while GM-CSF promotes cell proliferation in both AML blasts and K562 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner, we observed that cell survival was autonomous, growth factor-independent, and resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Powell1">[10]</xref>, Ser585 phosphorylation of the GM-CSF/IL-3 βc receptor was constitutive in primary AML blasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and K562 CML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) and was not affected by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Furthermore examination of a panel of primary AML patient samples demonstrated that neither Ser585 phosphorylation nor cell survival was affected by JAK (JAKI) or FLT3 (AG1296, CEP-701) TKIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001515.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001515.s001">S1E</xref>).

        <p>In order to identify the kinases responsible for phosphorylating Ser585 and promoting cell survival we performed chromatographic fractionation of an AML patient sample exhibiting constitutive Ser585 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Eluted fractions were tested for Ser585-kinase activity in vitro using a βc peptide encompassing Ser585 and a single peak of activity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Pharmacological profiling of the eluted Ser585-kinase activity (peak activity, fraction 8) revealed that only the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, significantly reduced Ser585 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Western blotting of eluted fractions confirmed that the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K co-eluted with the peak of Ser585 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, immunoblots). Further analysis using a panel of four independent PI3K inhibitors indicated that each was able to inhibit the Ser585-kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Although little is known of the protein substrates of PI3K, our results suggested the possibility that the serine kinase activity of PI3K could phosphorylate Ser585.</p>

        <p>To determine whether immuno-purified PI3K could phosphorylate βc within the context of a full-length protein, we performed in vitro kinase assays using the purified recombinant intra-cytoplasmic portion of βc (βic) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Guthridge1">[5]</xref>. PI3K was able to phosphorylate the p85 subunit (as has been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Dhand1">[2]</xref>) as well as purified recombinant βic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001515.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). We then examined whether a mutant form of p110α in which 4 lysine residues (K941-944) in the lipid-binding pocket were substituted for alanine (p110α-4KA) that has been previously described as being defective in its lipid kinase activity but retains full protein kinase activity was able to phosphorylate βic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-NagaPrasad1">[12]</xref>. Although the p110α-4KA mutant was defective in phosphorylating PIPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001515.s002">Figure S2C</xref>), it was not only able to phosphorylate p85, but also βic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).

        <title>The Protein Kinase Activity but Not the Lipid Kinase Activity of PI3K Promotes Cytokine-Mediated Cell Survival</title>
        <p>While the ability of PI3K to promote cell survival has almost exclusively been attributed to its lipid kinase activity, the potential biological roles of PI3K protein kinase activity remain unknown. Our previous studies have shown that very low cytokine concentrations in the picomolar range can promote the phosphorylation of Ser585 within the GM-CSF and IL-3 βc receptor to promote cell survival in the absence of both phosphotyrosine pathways and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Guthridge3">[7]</xref>. Our current studies indicate that PI3K protein kinase activity can phosphorylate Ser585. Thus, if PI3K was able to phosphorylate Ser585 in cells, then picomolar concentrations of cytokine that induce Ser585 phosphorylation should also activate PI3K protein kinase activity. We therefore examined the regulation of both the protein kinase and lipid kinase activities of PI3K in response to increasing concentrations of cytokine. In order to examine the regulation of PI3K protein kinase activity, we analysed p85-Ser608 phosphorylation which has been shown to be a direct substrate of p110 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Dhand1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Foukas2">[14]</xref>. Low picomolar concentrations of GM-CSF that were able to promote Ser585 phosphorylation (0.1–1 pM) were also able to activate the protein kinase activity of PI3K as evidenced by increased p85-Ser608 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, such low picomolar concentrations did not detectably activate PI3K lipid signaling as evidenced by the lack of both Akt and GSK-3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), p85 tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), or activation of PI3K lipid kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, PI3K demonstrates two distinct modes of signaling with PI3K protein kinase signaling being regulated by low picomolar cytokine concentrations and PI3K lipid kinase signaling being regulated by higher nanomolar concentrations.</p>

        <p>We then examined whether PI3K lipid kinase activity was essential for regulating cell survival by examining the role of the key downstream lipid signaling target of PI3K, Akt. Our results show that there was no significant defect in the ability of 1 pM murine GM-CSF to promote the survival of primary mouse bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells derived from either Akt1−/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, left) or in BM progenitor cells derived from wild-type (wt) mice and treated with an Akt1 inhibitor (AKTI-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, right). Further, inducible-expression of a constitutively active form of Akt (myr-Akt-1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001515.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) was not sufficient to support the long-term viability of factor-dependent myeloid (FDM) cells in the absence of cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the PI3K lipid signaling target, Akt, was not required for promoting the survival-only response in the presence of low picomolar cytokine concentrations.</p>
        <p>We next examined the ability of low picomolar cytokine concentrations to promote cell survival under conditions where the protein kinase activity of PI3K was blocked (using the YM024 or PIK-75 p110α-selective PI3K inhibitors) while downstream PI3K lipid signaling was enforced by expression of myr-Akt-1. Blockade of PI3K protein kinase activity induced by 1 pM GM-CSF using either YM024 or PIK-75 resulted in cell death despite constitutive signaling by myr-Akt-1 suggesting that the protein kinase activity of PI3K was required for cell survival and could not be rescued by enforced Akt1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001515.s003">S3B</xref>). We also performed an inverse experiment and examined the effect of selectively blocking PI3K lipid signaling while allowing PI3K protein kinase signaling. For these experiments we over-expressed the PH domain of Akt1 fused to GFP (Akt1-PH-GFP) in order to block the binding of endogenous PH-domain proteins (such as Akt) to PIPs in the plasma membrane thereby abrogating PI3K lipid signaling but permitting PI3K protein kinase signaling. Using this approach, we examined the regulation of cell survival in response to either 1 pM cytokine (that was able to promote PI3K protein kinase activity) or 1,000 pM cytokine (that was able to promote PI3K lipid kinase activity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref>). While expression of Akt1-PH-GFP was able to block lipid signaling as evidenced by the lack of detectable Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001515.s003">Figure S3C</xref>) and reduce cell viability under conditions where PI3K lipid kinase signaling is activated by high cytokine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4G</xref>, 1,000 pM), it had no significant effect on cell survival under conditions where only the protein kinase activity of PI3K is induced by low cytokine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4G</xref>, 1 pM).</p>
        <p>We then examined whether constitutive activation of the protein kinase activity of PI3K was able to promote Ser585 phosphorylation of the endogenous βc subunit of the GM-CSF receptor and cytokine-independent cell survival. For these experiments we utilized a doxycycline-inducible system for the expression of a cytokine-independent membrane-localized form of p110α with both lipid and protein kinase activity (p110α-CAAX) or only protein kinase activity (p110α-4KA-CAAX). Induction of p110α-CAAX using doxycycline in the absence of cytokine resulted in increased Ser585 phosphorylation as well as downstream Akt phosphorylation, both of which were blocked by the YM024 PI3K inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Importantly, induction of p110α-4KA-CAAX, which is lipid kinase defective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001515.s002">Figure S2C</xref>) and was unable to promote Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4H</xref>, lower panels), also resulted in increased Ser585 phosphorylation in a cytokine-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4H</xref>, upper panels). In line with its ability to promote increased Ser585 phosphorylation, p110α-4KA-CAAX was able to significantly increase cell survival to levels approaching that observed in the presence of 1 pM GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4I</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that the protein kinase activity of PI3K can phosphorylate Ser585 of the GM-CSF receptor to regulate cell survival.</p>

        <title>Inhibition of p110α Down-Regulates Ser585 Phosphorylation and Induces Apoptosis</title>
        <p>We next examined the impact of inhibiting PI3K on Ser585 phosphorylation and cell survival. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, TF-1 cytokine-dependent cells rapidly lose viability in the absence of GM-CSF (0 pM) and are able to proliferate in response to higher concentrations of cytokine (1,000 pM). Importantly, lower concentrations of cytokine (1 pM) that were able to promote PI3K protein kinase signaling but not lipid signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref>) were also able to maintain the viability of TF-1 cells for up to 2 wk in the absence of detectable proliferation (“survival-only” response) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). To test whether Ser585 of βc was a substrate for p110 under these “survival-only” conditions, cells were pretreated with both pan-specific (LY294002 and Wortmannin) and isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001515.s006">Table S1</xref>) and then stimulated with 1 pM cytokine. Our results show that both LY294002 and Wortmannin inhibited Ser585 phosphorylation induced by 1 pM GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g005">Figure 5C and 5G</xref>). Furthermore, two different p110α-selective inhibitors (YM024 and PIK-75) and a p110α-selective and mTOR dual inhibitor (PI-103) were able to down-regulate Ser585 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g005">Figure 5D–5G</xref>). In contrast, p110β-selective (TGX-221) and p110γ-selective (AS252424) inhibitors had no detectable effect on Ser585 phosphorylation while p110δ-selective (IC87114) and the protein kinase A inhibitor, H89, had modest effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of DNA-PK and the related PI3K family member ATM had no effect on either Ser585 phosphorylation or the survival of AML blasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001515.s004">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>). Consistent with their ability to block Ser585 phosphorylation, both YM024 and PIK-75 were also able to significantly block the survival-only response in both TF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g005">Figure 5H</xref>) and lineage-negative primary mouse BM progenitors in the presence of 1 pM cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g005">Figure 5I</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>While many cytokines and growth factors are able to regulate PI3K lipid signaling, little is known of their ability to regulate PI3K protein kinase signaling or whether the protein kinase activity of PI3K is also important in promoting cellular responses in certain contexts. Previously, we and others have identified key serine residues in the cytoplasmic tails of cytokine and growth factor receptors that selectively control cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Guthridge1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Peruzzi1">[9]</xref>. In the case of the GM-CSF and IL-3 βc receptor, constitutive Ser585 phosphorylation is associated with deregulated cell survival programs in AML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Powell1">[10]</xref>. Importantly, constitutive Ser585 phosphorylation in leukemic cells is refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and thus may provide a receptor-dependent mechanism by which transformed cells are able to survive in the presence of TKIs. We have now isolated a kinase activity from primary AML samples that is able to phosphorylate Ser585 in vitro and shown that this activity is uniquely sensitive to PI 3-kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We have further shown that purified recombinant p110α can directly phosphorylate Ser585 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and that inhibition of p110α using either RNA interference or p110α-selective inhibitors down-regulated Ser585 phosphorylation of endogenous βc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g006">6</xref>). Furthermore, inducible expression of a p110α-4KA-CAAX mutant of PI3K that is defective in lipid-kinase activity but retains protein kinase activity not only promotes Ser585 phosphorylation but also cell survival in the absence of cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These results reveal Ser585 in βc as a direct substrate of the protein kinase activity of PI3K and show that p110α (rather than p110β, p110δ, or p110γ) is the predominant isoform responsible for this activity at least in the myeloid context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g007">Figure 7</xref>, model)</p>

      <p>While the lipid kinase activity of PI3K is clearly pivotal in regulating a wide array of cellular responses including cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Cantley1">[1]</xref>, little is known regarding the protein substrates of PI3K and their functional significance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Dhand1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Foukas1">[4]</xref>. Initial reports identified several autophosphorylation sites in either the p85 regulatory subunit, or the p110 catalytic subunits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001515-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Dhand1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Czupalla1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Vanhaesebroeck1">[16]</xref>. Additionally, a number of other protein substrates of PI3K have been reported including p101, insulin receptor substrate 1, PDE3B phosphodiesterase, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and H-Ras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Bondev1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Foukas3">[21]</xref>. However, these earlier studies did not determine the specific residues phosphorylated by PI3K nor their functional significance. To our knowledge, only one other specific phosphorylation site has been identified for the protein kinase activity of PI3K for which a functional role has been ascribed. Prasad et al. have shown that p110γ can phosphorylate Ser61 of non-muscle tropomyosin, which is required for agonist-dependent β-adrenergic receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001515-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-NagaPrasad1">[12]</xref>. From the limited protein substrates so far identified for PI3K, no clear consensus motif is apparent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001515-t001">Table 1</xref>); however, the known auto-phosphorylation sites are located within disordered flexible regions either at the C-terminus of p110 isoforms or between the inter-SH2 and C-terminal SH2 domains of p85 suggesting that primary and/or secondary structures may be more important for substrate recognition than tertiary structures.</p>

      <p>The activation of canonical Type 1A PI3K lipid signaling requires the recruitment of p85 SH2 domains to pYXXM (where pY is phosphotyrosine) phosphotyrosine docking sites, either in the cytoplasmic tails of cell surface receptors or their associated signaling proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Pawson1">[22]</xref>. This mode of signaling is triggered by higher concentrations of ligand in the nanomolar range that induce receptor dimerization/oligomerization and the trans-activation of tyrosine kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Schlessinger1">[23]</xref>. However, several lines of evidence indicate that low picomolar concentrations of ligand promote Ser585 signaling and cellular survival in the absence of phosphotyrosine pathways, PI3K lipid signaling, and proliferation. Firstly, while high concentrations of cytokine clearly activate the lipid kinase activity of PI3K, we were unable to observe any detectable activation of lipid kinase activity in response to 1 pM cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4</xref>) despite the ability of these concentrations of cytokine to promote long-term cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Secondly, genetic or pharmacological blockade of the key downstream target of PI3K lipid signaling, Akt, had no effect on hemopoietic cell survival in response to 1 pM cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Thirdly, while key downstream targets of PI3K lipid signaling such as Akt or GSK were clearly phosphorylated in response to high nanomolar doses of cytokine, phosphorylation was not detected in response to 1 pM cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Fourthly, although we found no evidence of PI3K lipid signaling in response to 1 pM cytokine, we were clearly able to detect cytokine-regulated PI3K protein kinase activity as evidenced by the induction of p85-Ser608 and βc-Ser585 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Fifthly, enforcing downstream lipid kinase signaling by targeting Akt1 to the plasma membrane while blocking the protein kinase activity of PI3K in response to 1 pM cytokine with YM024 was able to block cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Sixthly, selectively blocking the lipid kinase activity of PI3K by over-expression of an Akt1 PH domain that dominant-negatively blocks PIP docking sites in the plasma membrane but allowing PI3K protein kinase activity in the presence of 1 pM cytokine permitted cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, inducible expression of a p110α mutant that is defective in lipid kinase activity but retains protein kinase activity (p110α-4KA-CAAX) was able to restore Ser585 phosphorylation and promote cell survival in myeloid cells in the absence of cytokine and detectable Akt activation. Thus, our results highlight an important distinction between the regulation of PI3K lipid kinase and protein kinase signaling. On the one hand, higher concentrations of cytokine can regulate phosphotyrosine pathways, PI3K lipid signaling, and the phosphorylation of downstream lipid signaling targets to promote both cell proliferation and survival. On the other, lower concentrations of cytokine promote the activation of PI3K protein kinase activity, Ser585 phosphorylation, and cell survival in the absence of other biological responses such as proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g007">Figure 7</xref>, model).</p>
      <p>Others have also suggested that PI3K can provide multiple independent signaling outputs with p110γ regulating Akt signaling via its lipid kinase activity and regulating ERK signaling via its protein kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Bondeva1">[24]</xref>. While the functional significance of this signal bifurcation remains unclear, it is intriguing that the insulin and IFNα receptors have been reported to activate the protein kinase activity of PI3K in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Rondinone1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Uddin1">[25]</xref>. In the case of the βc subunit, the mechanism by which PI3K is recruited and activated leading to Ser585 phosphorylation is not clear. It is possible that in addition to recruitment to phosphotyrosine docking sites, class 1A PI3Ks such as p110α can also be recruited via phosphotyrosine-independent mechanisms similar to those employed for the recruitment of p110γ to G-protein coupled receptors or p110β and p110δ to ErbB3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Curnock1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Jiang1">[27]</xref>. Consistent with this notion, our previous studies have shown that a βc receptor mutant in which all eight cytoplasmic tyrosine residues were substituted for phenylalanine (βcF8) is not only phosphorylated in Ser585 in response to cytokine but is also able to promote cell survival in the absence of proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Guthridge2">[6]</xref> indicating that βc tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for regulating the Ser585-survival pathway. One possible mechanism by which PI3K is recruited may involve the binding of the p85 SH3-domain to a conserved PXXP motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the α-subunit of the GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors as proposed by Perugini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Perugini1">[28]</xref>. While the mechanisms by which PI3K is recruited to protein targets to phosphorylate substrates such as Ser585 in the GM-CSF/IL-3 receptors (identified in these studies) or Ser61 in tropomyosin (identified by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-NagaPrasad1">[12]</xref>) requires further study, it is interesting that significant levels of PI3K can be found at the plasma membrane under basal conditions in at least some transformed cell types and that this translocation may be enhanced by the 14-3-3 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Neal1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that siRNA-mediated knockdown of p110α or pharmacological inhibition inhibits both the protein and lipid kinase activity of PI3K. Thus, the induction of apoptosis following PI3K inhibition may not only result from inhibition of PI3K protein kinase targets (such as Ser585), but also lipid kinase targets (such as Akt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g007">Figure 7</xref>, model). Deregulated PI3K lipid signaling has been widely observed in many cancers and activating mutations in p110α are frequently observed in solid tumors. However, p110α mutations are rare in AML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Muller1">[30]</xref>. Nevertheless, constitutive PI3K lipid signaling is prevalent in AML with elevated Akt phosphorylation being observed in most patient samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Muller1">[30]</xref>. Our previous studies suggest that the protein kinase activity of PI3K is also deregulated with high prevalence in AML with constitutive Ser585 phosphorylation observed in &gt;85% of primary AML patient samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Powell1">[10]</xref>. While kinases other than PI3K may be responsible for constitutive Ser585 phosphorylation in at least some AMLs, siRNA targeting of p110α significantly reduced Ser585 phosphorylation in 6/6 primary AML samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Additionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p110α or inhibition of p110α using YM024 in two AML samples analysed resulted in increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g006">Figure 6</xref>) consistent with a role for p110α in regulating AML cell survival. Most importantly, this pathway appears refractory to FLT3 and JAK kinase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Others have shown that targeting p110δ with IC87114 prevents the proliferation of AML blasts, but the effect on the cell survival has not been determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001515-Sujobert1">[31]</xref>. In our studies, IC87114 as well as p110β-selective (TGX-221) and p110γ-selective (AS252424) inhibitors were not effective in down-regulating either Ser585 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g005">Figure 5</xref>) or promoting apoptosis in AML blasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001515-g006">Figure 6</xref>) suggesting that p110α is likely to be the primary isoform promoting Ser585-survival signaling in AML. Thus, our results identify a new role for PI3K in which its protein kinase activity phosphorylates cytokine receptors to initiate downstream signaling leading to cell survival. The ability of PI3K to switch between protein kinase and lipid kinase activities would thus allow two independent modes of signaling each functionally linked to a distinct cellular outcome. How these two distinct arms of enzymatic activity are perturbed and hijacked in cancer remains to be elucidated. Discovery of other protein kinase substrates of PI3K that are constitutively phosphorylated in cancer may reveal useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PI3K-pathway drug development.</p>

Briefly, after 5 d, non-adherent cells were cultured in soft agar and then a further 10–14 d later, compact colonies were individually selected and put back into liquid culture containing murine IL-3. Lines were tested for murine IL-3 dependence as indicated by inhibition of proliferation in the absence of murine IL-3. FDM cells were then transduced with GEVP16-myr-Akt1-HA (encoding a constitutively active myristolated form of Akt under the control of a 4-hydroxytamoxifen-inducible promoter) and pF5xUAS-SV40-eGFP. Pools of GFP+ FDM cells resistant to both hygromycin and puromycin were isolated and maintained in DMEM/10% FCS with 0.25 ng/ml murine IL-3. Induction of myr-Akt-HA was achieved by treating FDM cells with 1 µM 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4HT) and protein expression and phosphorylation was confirmed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. (B) TF-1 cells were co-transfected with constructs for the expression of myr-Akt1 and GFP and plated in 1 pM GM-CSF and either DMSO (vehicle) or 100 nM PIK-75.

Expression of Akt1-PH-GFP blocked PI3K lipid signaling in response to 1,000 pM GM-CSF as evidenced by the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation.
