<abstract>
<p>The asparagine hydroxylase, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), confers oxygen-dependence upon the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a master regulator of the cellular adaptive response to hypoxia. Studies investigating whether asparagine hydroxylation is a general regulatory oxygen-dependent modification have identified multiple non-HIF targets for FIH. However, the functional consequences of this outside of the HIF pathway remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the deubiquitinase ovarian tumor domain containing ubiquitin aldehyde binding protein 1 (OTUB1) is a substrate for hydroxylation by FIH on N22. Mutation of N22 leads to a profound change in the interaction of OTUB1 with proteins important in cellular metabolism. Furthermore, in cultured cells, overexpression of N22A mutant OTUB1 impairs cellular metabolic processes when compared to wild type. Based on these data, we hypothesize that OTUB1 is a target for functional hydroxylation by FIH. Additionally, we propose that our results provide new insight into the regulation of cellular energy metabolism during hypoxic stress and the potential for targeting hydroxylases for therapeutic benefit.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Hypoxia is a commonly encountered physiologic and pathophysiologic stress to which mammalian cells have evolved an effective adaptive response. This response is governed by a transcription factor termed the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). The mechanisms linking the cellular sensing of oxygen levels to HIF activation have been elucidated and involve oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of HIF on proline and asparagine residues by a family of hydroxylases. A key question that remains unclear is the extent to which oxygen-dependent hydroxylation occurs as a functional post-translational modification outside of the HIF pathway. This is key to developing our understanding of whether hydroxylation is a general regulatory modification or one which has specifically evolved for the regulation of HIF. Here, we demonstrate that the deubiquitinase ovarian tumor domain containing ubiquitin aldehyde binding protein 1 (OTUB1) is a target for functional hydroxylation by the FIH hydroxylase. Hydroxylation of OTUB1 by FIH on asparagine residue N22 results in a restriction in its interactome, leading us to hypothesize a possible role for hydroxylation in substrate targeting. Of interest, interactions of OTUB1 with a number of proteins involved in metabolism are altered upon removal of the hydroxylation site—implicating OTUB1 as a possible link between oxygen sensing and the regulation of metabolism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hypoxia is a common feature of the microenvironment in a number of pathophysiologic conditions and represents a significant threat to cellular metabolic homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref001">1</xref>]. Eukaryotic cells have evolved the capacity to rapidly sense changes in intracellular oxygen levels through a family of hydroxylases that confer oxygen-dependence upon the key transcriptional regulator of the adaptive response to hypoxia, termed the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Hydroxylases were first identified as oxygen sensors in the HIF pathway and belong to the Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref004">4</xref>]. These enzymes catalyze the hydroxylation of proteins, in a manner that is dependent on the availability of molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). Therefore, hydroxylase activity is decreased when O<sub>2</sub> is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref005">5</xref>]. Four discrete HIF-hydroxylase isoforms have been identified to date, three of which are prolyl-4-hydroxylases (PHD1–3) (Uniprot accession numbers: Q96KS0, Q9GZT9, Q9H6Z9), which regulate the stability of HIFα subunits. In normoxia, the PHDs hydroxylate specific proline residues (P402 and P564 on HIF-1α), which promotes binding of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) (Uniprot accession number: P40337) protein followed by formation of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, HIFα ubiquitination and subsequent degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref002">2</xref>]. In parallel with this, a second oxygen-dependent repression of HIF transcriptional activity is regulated by asparaginyl hydroxylation. The asparagine hydroxylase, termed factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) (Uniprot accession number: Q9NWT6), hydroxylates an asparagine residue within HIFα subunits (N803 on HIF-1α), resulting in steric inhibition of its interaction with the transcriptional co-activator p300/CBP, thereby inhibiting HIF-dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref002">2</xref>]. In hypoxia, when HIFα hydroxylation is reduced, HIFα subunits escape degradation, translocate into the nucleus, bind to the subunit HIF-1β, form a transcriptional complex with p300/CBP and activate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>A number of proteins other than HIF are also sensitive to regulation by hypoxia. However, the mechanism governing their oxygen-sensitivity is less clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref007">7</xref>]. A key question that remains is whether functional hydroxylation is specific for the regulation of HIFα or if other oxygen-sensitive proteins are also regulated by this post-translational modification. While the number of proteins identified as being targets for proline hydroxylation is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref010">10</xref>], FIH-dependent asparagine hydroxylation has been demonstrated for a larger group of non-HIF substrates, including ankyrin-repeat domain (ARD)-containing proteins such as tankyrase, notch-1, ASPP2, and IκBα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref014">14</xref>]. However, the functional consequences of asparagine hydroxylation in general remain less clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref016">16</xref>]. Notably, a functional hydroxylation of the ion channel TRPV3 by FIH has recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>FIH homozygous knockout mice demonstrate a metabolic phenotype leading to the proposal that FIH is a key regulator of cellular metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref018">18</xref>]. However, a change of HIF activity alone due to FIH knockout could not explain all of the observed metabolic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref018">18</xref>], indicating HIF-independent mechanisms. Because of this, a key question remaining is whether other FIH target proteins are involved in the observed metabolic phenotype in FIH-deficient mice.</p>
<p>In a previous study, we identified a number of putative hydroxylation substrates in the IL-1β signaling pathway that could account for the inhibition of IL-1β-induced inflammation observed in cells treated with pharmacologic hydroxylase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref019">19</xref>]. One identified candidate for asparagine hydroxylation was the deubiquitinase (DUB) ovarian tumor domain containing ubiquitin aldehyde binding protein 1 (OTUB1) (Uniprot accession number: Q96FW1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref019">19</xref>]. Interestingly, in a global proteomic analysis, OTUB1 was identified to interact with metabolic regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref020">20</xref>]. Furthermore, mice deficient in OTUB1 demonstrate a lean body mass phenotype that is reflective of altered metabolic function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:2147616" xlink:type="simple">http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:2147616</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In the current study, we provide evidence that N22 of OTUB1 is a bona fide target for enzymatic hydroxylation by FIH as demonstrated by a combination of mass spectrometric techniques and in vitro peptide hydroxylation. Furthermore, site-directed point mutagenesis of N22 enhanced the OTUB1 interactome, particularly with respect to proteins involved in metabolism. Finally, overexpression of mutant OTUB1 resulted in cellular bio-energetic stress (as reflected by enhanced AMP kinase activation) when compared to wild-type (WT) OTUB1, thus indicating a functional role for N22 hydroxylation in terms of regulating cellular metabolism. These data provide a mechanistic link between FIH-dependent hydroxylation of OTUB1 and alterations in cellular metabolism and contribute a further level of understanding to the vital link between cellular oxygen-sensing mechanisms and the control of cellular metabolism.</p>

<title>Regulation of Cellular Metabolism by FIH and OTUB1</title>
<p>Previous studies have linked homozygous FIH deficiency in mice with a phenotype of disrupted energy metabolism. This is in part reflected by altered phosphorylation of AMPKα, which reflects a change in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and therefore can be used as a surrogate marker of cellular metabolic stress. The molecular mechanisms underpinning this alteration in AMPKα phosphorylation remain unknown, but appear to be independent of the prototypic FIH substrate HIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref018">18</xref>]. In order to test whether FIH regulates energy metabolism at the cellular level, HEK293 cells were transfected with FIH-V5 for 24 h and cell extracts were generated either prior to the addition of fresh medium or 8–24 h later. Overexpression of FIH led to an increase in phosphorylation of AMPKα compared to cells transfected with an empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). This effect was most prominent prior to the addition of fresh medium. Overexpression of the catalytically dead mutant FIH H199A did not change AMPKα phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s003">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). These data support previous work linking FIH hydroxylase activity to the regulation of metabolic processes in cells.</p>

<p>In a previous global screen, we identified the DUB OTUB1 as a putative new substrate for asparagine hydroxylation by FIH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref019">19</xref>]. Furthermore, mice deficient in OTUB1 demonstrate a phenotype that is consistent with altered metabolism (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:2147616" xlink:type="simple">http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:2147616</ext-link>). Also, OTUB1 was shown to interact with proteins involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref020">20</xref>]. In support of this, we found that overexpression of OTUB1 in HEK293 cells was associated with an increase in phosphorylation of AMPKα 24 h following the addition of fresh media (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g001">1C, 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s004">S2A</xref>). This indicates that the cells were experiencing metabolic stress as reflected by an imbalance in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio (and subsequent AMPK activation) when OTUB1 activity is increased. Furthermore, overexpression of FIH together with simultaneous knockdown of OTUB1 prevented the FIH-dependent increase in AMPKα phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s003">S1C, S1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s004">S2B</xref> Figs). Overall, these data led us to hypothesize that OTUB1 hydroxylation by FIH may be a link in the association of FIH with an alteration in cellular metabolism.</p>

<p>In order to determine whether OTUB1 is a bona fide FIH substrate, initially we used mass-spectrometry–based approaches. First, we tested whether OTUB1 is enzymatically hydroxylated (as opposed to this being a spurious chemical oxidation event). To do this, in one set of cells we maximized the asparagine hydroxylation capacity by overexpressing FIH along with OTUB1. A second set of cells also overexpressing OTUB1 (but not FIH) were treated with the pan-hydroxylase inhibitor DMOG to minimize hydroxylation capacity. Successful overexpression of OTUB1 is demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and quantitative mass spectrometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We next investigated the hydroxylation status of immunoprecipitated OTUB1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g002">Fig 2B</xref> shows an extracted ion chromatogram of an OTUB1 peptide containing the N22 residue. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the peptides with the shorter retention time corresponded with the hydroxylated form of this peptide. Decreased retention time has previously been demonstrated to be associated with FIH-dependent hydroxylation of peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref011">11</xref>]. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of immunoprecipitated OTUB1 peptide demonstrated N22 hydroxylation in the sample where FIH was also overexpressed but not in the cells treated with DMOG (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g002">2B, 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s005">S3</xref>). Importantly, the oxidation/hydroxylation of M31 (reflecting a nearby spurious oxidation event) in the same samples was independent of enzymatic hydroxylase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Methionine residues are highly susceptible to spurious oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref021">21</xref>].</p>

<p>In order to investigate if the observed OTUB1 N22 hydroxylation was regulated by physiologically relevant changes in the cellular microenvironment, we incubated HEK293 cells overexpressing both OTUB1 and FIH in 0.2% oxygen for 8 h with and without subsequent re-oxygenation at 21% oxygen for one additional hour. The analysis of the OTUB1 N22 hydroxylation levels by mass spectrometry showed a significant reduction of OTUB1 N22 hydroxylation in hypoxia which was significantly reversed by re-oxygenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>). DMOG-dependent inhibition of hydroxylases led to a similarly reduced OTUB1 N22 hydroxylation level as hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Of note, the DMOG-dependent inhibition of OTUB1 hydroxylation was partly reversed by FIH overexpression when compared to the effect of DMOG without FIH overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g002">Fig 2C and 2F</xref>). Nutrient starvation for 8 h with and without re-introduction of nutrients following for one additional hour also down-regulated OTUB1 N22 hydroxylation, although to a lesser degree than hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s006">S4A Fig</xref>). Overall, these data strongly support the contention that N22 of OTUB1 is a bona fide substrate for enzymatic hydroxylation by FIH and that this is regulated by changes in the cellular microenvironment such as hypoxia.</p>
<p>We next investigated whether OTUB1 hydroxylation on N22 is FIH-dependent. Alignment of the amino acid sequence around N22 of OTUB1 with known FIH substrates and a recently published consensus sequence for FIH target proteins revealed that N22 of OTUB1 lies within a motif highly similar to the consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref022">22</xref>]. Protein sequence alignments indicated that the OTUB1 consensus sequence is evolutionary conserved within mammals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s006">S4B Fig</xref>). We next overexpressed FLAG-HA-OTUB1 in HEK293 cells and either treated these cells with non-targeting siRNA (siNT) or siRNA targeting endogenous FIH (siFIH) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g003">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s004">S2C</xref>). OTUB1 was immunoprecipitated and the hydroxylation status of N22 was analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. The hydroxylation of N22 was decreased in cells treated with FIH siRNA supporting the concept that N22 of OTUB1 is a target for endogenous enzymatic FIH-dependent hydroxylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Furthermore, to demonstrate that N22 is directly hydroxylated by FIH, FIH activity was measured in an in vitro CO<sub>2</sub> capture assay using purified FIH and either wild-type OTUB1 peptides containing N22 or OTUB1 peptides in which N22 was replaced by an alanine residue (N22A). Using this assay, which measures the turnover of 2-oxoglutarate into succinate and CO<sub>2</sub> by FIH, we found a significant increase in FIH activity in the presence of wild-type but not mutant OTUB1 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that N22 of OTUB1 is a bona fide substrate for enzymatic hydroxylation by FIH.</p>

<title>Mutation of the OTUB1 Hydroxylation Site Regulates its Interactome</title>
<p>We next investigated possible functional consequences of OTUB1 hydroxylation on N22. To do this, we used the N22A mutant in order to prevent FIH-dependent hydroxylation at this site. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with either FLAG-OTUB1 WT or FLAG-OTUB1 N22A, along with FIH (in order to maximize hydroxylation capacity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Following immunoprecipitation of OTUB1 (demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) we identified the OTUB1 WT and the OTUB1 N22A interactomes by mass spectrometry. Initially, we confirmed the interaction of both OTUB1 WT and OTUB1 N22A with six previously described OTUB1 interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s007">S5 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref027">27</xref>]. We next used the interaction of FIH with OTUB1 as additional positive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref019">19</xref>] and confirmed this interaction in the case of OTUB1 WT in the interactome experiment and also subsequently by western blot analysis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g004">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s007">S5G</xref>). Interestingly, this interaction was greatly reduced with OTUB1 N22A, indicating a key role for this residue in the interaction between FIH and OTUB1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g004">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s007">S5G</xref>).</p>

<p>Qualitative analysis revealed that 147 proteins were associated with OTUB1 WT, while 318 proteins were associated with OTUB1 N22A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Of the OTUB1 interacting proteins, 127 were associated with both OTUB1 WT and OTUB1 N22A, indicating that the core interactome is not affected by mutation of N22. However, when we compared the OTUB1 WT and the OTUB1 N22A interactomes, we found that while just 13 proteins were enriched in their association with OTUB1 WT over OTUB1 N22A, 147 proteins were enriched in their association with OTUB1 N22A over OTUB1 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). There were 86 proteins that had equivalent levels of interaction with both OTUB1 WT and N22A. This indicates that loss of hydroxylation on N22 leads to more than a doubling of the number of proteins in the OTUB1 interactome through the recruitment of new binding partners. Of note, the N22A point mutation of OTUB1 did not change its deubiquitinase activity, which indicates that this mutation does not significantly alter protein structure (as catalytic activity is retained) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s008">S6 Fig</xref>). Based on these data, we hypothesize that hydroxylation of N22 on OTUB1 profoundly alters its interaction with other proteins and is therefore likely of functional consequence.</p>
<p>Ontological analysis of the proteins differentially associated with OTUB1 WT and OTUB1 N22A using the Panther database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org" xlink:type="simple">www.pantherdb.org</ext-link>) revealed proteins associated with multiple biological processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s009">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). However, metabolism-associated proteins were most highly represented, which is in agreement with previously published data for wild-type OTUB1 by Sowa et al., demonstrating that OTUB1 interacts with metabolic regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref020">20</xref>]. Furthermore, OTUB1 N22A had increased numbers of metabolism-associated proteins when compared to OTUB1 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g004">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s011">S1 Table</xref>) indicating that loss of N22 hydroxylation may impact upon interaction between OTUB1 and multiple proteins important in the regulation of metabolism. In summary, we demonstrate that N22A mutation of OTUB1 profoundly alters its physical interactome. Of note, proteins associated with metabolic processes are heavily represented in this cohort.</p>

<title>OTUB1 Wild Type and OTUB1 N22A Differentially Regulate Phosphorylation of AMPKα during Nutrient Starvation</title>
<p>We next investigated the impact of N22A mutation of OTUB1 on FIH-dependent regulation of cellular metabolism under conditions of energy starvation in cultured cells. Simultaneous glucose, glutamine, and pyruvate deprivation caused an increase in the phosphorylation of AMPKα likely as a result of ATP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Cells overexpressing both wild type OTUB1 and FIH (to maximize OTUB1 hydroxylation) showed similar levels of AMPKα activity as control cells, however, cells overexpressing both FIH and N22A mutated OTUB1 (to minimize OTUB1 hydroxylation) demonstrated robustly increased phosphorylation of AMPKα. These data are consistent with our hypothesis that FIH-dependent N22 hydroxylation of OTUB1 contributes to the regulation of cellular metabolism by FIH.</p>

<title>OTUB1 N22 Hydroxylation Does Not Affect its Protein Stability</title>
<p>We next investigated the impact of the hydroxylation of N22 on the OTUB1 protein. We considered a potential change of OTUB1 protein levels and its half-life due to the hydroxylation of N22 similar to the described regulation of the HIF-1α protein by prolyl hydroxylation. We therefore established HEK293 cells stably overexpressing FLAG-OTUB1 WT or N22A, which, at the same time, also carried a stably integrated shRNA targeting the 3′UTR of OTUB1 to diminish endogenous OTUB1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s010">S8 Fig</xref>). We transiently transfected these cells with FIH-V5 to maximize FLAG-OTUB1 WT hydroxylation and analyzed OTUB1 WT and N22A protein levels for up to 48 h by western blot. No significant change between the protein levels of OTUB1 WT and OTUB1 N22A was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). We next investigated if endogenous OTUB1 protein levels change in response to an alteration of N22 hydroxylation levels. We transiently transfected HEK293 cells with either empty vector (control) or FIH-V5 and treated the control cells with DMOG and the FIH overexpressing cells with DMSO. This experimental set up was similar to the experiment performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g002">Fig 2A–2D</xref>, which lead to maximally hydroxylated N22 of OTUB1 in the FIH overexpressing sample and to diminished hydroxylation of N22 in the DMOG-treated sample. We then analyzed endogenous OTUB1 protein levels in a time course for up to 48 h by western blot. No difference was observed between maximally hydroxylated OTUB1 and minimally hydroxylated OTUB1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hypoxia is a common feature of a number of diseases in which metabolism is significantly altered, including chronic inflammation and cancer. The mechanisms by which hypoxia-dependent alterations in metabolism occur in such disease states have important implications for disease development and potential targets for future therapeutic intervention. In this study, we provide new insight into the regulation of metabolism by hypoxia, which is mediated through the DUB OTUB1.</p>
<p>The identification of HIF as a ubiquitous master regulator of the cellular adaptive response to hypoxia and its oxygen-dependent regulation by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases were key discoveries in our developing understanding of the oxygen-sensing mechanisms which operate in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref033">33</xref>]. Because several pathways apart from HIF also demonstrate sensitivity to hypoxia, it was initially anticipated that post-translational hydroxylation would be a common modification resulting in the conferral of oxygen sensitivity on multiple targets. However, while it appears that hydroxylation is indeed a common protein modification, understanding the functional role of this outside of the HIF pathway has remained elusive.</p>
<p>Functional proline-hydroxylation of non-HIF proteins by the HIF prolyl hydroxylases has been proposed for a limited number of proteins, including FOXO3a, CyclinD1, ATF-4, and IKKβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref035">35</xref>]. However, asparagine hydroxylation by FIH appears to be a more commonly observed modification and has been clearly demonstrated for multiple non-HIF proteins, including several ARD-containing proteins such as tankyrase, notch-1, and IκBα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref013">13</xref>]. However, the functional impact of this on cellular signaling pathways (if any) remains unclear. Therefore, the identification of new functional hydroxylation events is of key importance in developing our understanding of this oxygen-sensitive, post-translational modification.</p>
<p>It has recently been demonstrated that mice that are homozygously deficient in FIH demonstrate a metabolic phenotype characterized by (for example) reduced body weight, elevated metabolic rate, and hyperventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref018">18</xref>]. In these studies, the cellular bioenergetic status was assessed by measurement of the activation of AMPK, a key gauge of cellular metabolic stress which becomes activated when ATP is depleted and the AMP:ATP ratio increases. Because these mice do not display a phenotype consistent with activated HIF, it appears that the mechanisms underpinning the metabolic phenotype are at least in part independent of the HIF pathway and depend upon other FIH-dependent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref018">18</xref>]. In this study, we identified OTUB1 to be a new FIH substrate that may be important in the regulation of cell metabolism (as also reflected by altered AMPK activation) and, as such, may provide mechanistic insight into the metabolic phenotype observed in the FIH knockout mouse. Of note, wild-type OTUB1 has been reported to interact with metabolic regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref020">20</xref>]. Furthermore, while homozygous deletion of OTUB1 results in early lethality, mice heterozygously deficient in OTUB1 were reported to display a metabolic phenotype characterized by decreased lean body mass (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:2147616" xlink:type="simple">http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:2147616</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref040">40</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest the possibility that OTUB1 hydroxylation may at least in part provide a molecular explanation for some aspects of the observed phenotype in FIH-deficient mice.</p>
<p>Previous work has demonstrated a profoundly anti-inflammatory effect of pan-hydroxylase inhibitors (which have inhibitory activity against both PHDs and FIH) in multiple models of intestinal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref041">41</xref>]; however, the full mechanism underpinning this remains unclear. Altered metabolism has recently been demonstrated to be a key regulator of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref042">42</xref>]. Therefore, a possible contributory mechanism for the anti-inflammatory activity of hydroxylase inhibitors is through altered FIH-dependent hydroxylation of OTUB1, leading to differential metabolism at inflamed sites.</p>
<p>In our study, we found that N22, the site of OTUB1 hydroxylation by FIH, is located in a region of the protein that may be key to determining its activity. OTUB1 is unusual in that it hydrolyzes specifically K48 ubiquitin bonds but also inhibits the formation of K63 and K48 ubiquitin chains via a non-canonical, non-catalytic function through inhibition of E2 ubiquitin ligase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref045">45</xref>]. In the OTUB1 apoenzyme, the residues N-terminal to the OTU catalytic domain are disordered (approximately amino acids 1 to 45), whereas upon binding of both distal ubiquitin and an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, for example UBCH5B, the folding of a significant portion of the tail becomes stabilized as a structured alpha helix (amino acids 23 to 44) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g007">Fig 7</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref043">43</xref>]. N22 is located at the junction of the α-helix and the remaining unstructured region (amino acids 1 to 22). This is similar to the C-terminal transactivation domain (CAD) of HIF-1α, which is disordered when it is unbound but forms three distinct α-helices upon binding to CBP/p300, of which one helix includes N803, the HIF-1α asparagine residue targeted for hydroxylation by FIH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002347.ref047">47</xref>]. In an attempt to investigate the implications of the hydroxylation of OTUB1 at this key hinge region, we found no impact of OTUB1 hydroxylation on OTUB1 protein levels or half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002347.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Also, OTUB1 enzymatic activity was unaffected by the N22A point mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002347.s008">S6 Fig</xref>). Therefore, a direct regulation of the OTUB1 interactome by the N22 hydroxylation resulting in differential substrate targeting seems likely. Consistent with this concept, protein:protein interactions have previously been demonstrated to be directly modified by asparagine hydroxylation in the HIF pathway. FIH-dependent hydroxylation of N803 disrupts HIF-1α interaction with the transcriptional co-activators p300/CBP regulating HIF-1α-dependent trans-activation of gene expression. Ongoing studies are investigating whether hydroxylation of wild-type OTUB1 at N22 impacts on its (non-)canonical activity.</p>

<p>In summary, in this study we provide evidence that OTUB1 is a target for functional hydroxylation by FIH. We propose that this modification may have important implications for the regulation of cellular metabolism by changing OTUB1 substrate targeting under conditions of hypoxia, such as those that occur during ischemia, chronic inflammation, and tumor growth.</p>
