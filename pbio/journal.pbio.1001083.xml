        <p>Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis through the GPCR-like protein Smoothened (Smo), but how vertebrate Smo is activated remains poorly understood. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Hh dependent phosphorylation activates Smo. Whether this is also the case in vertebrates is unclear, owing to the marked sequence divergence between vertebrate and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo (dSmo) and the involvement of primary cilia in vertebrate Hh signaling. Here we demonstrate that mammalian Smo (mSmo) is activated through multi-site phosphorylation of its carboxyl-terminal tail by CK1α and GRK2. Phosphorylation of mSmo induces its active conformation and simultaneously promotes its ciliary accumulation. We demonstrate that graded Hh signals induce increasing levels of mSmo phosphorylation that fine-tune its ciliary localization, conformation, and activity. We show that mSmo phosphorylation is induced by its agonists and oncogenic mutations but is blocked by its antagonist cyclopamine, and efficient mSmo phosphorylation depends on the kinesin-II ciliary motor. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Hh signaling recruits CK1α to initiate mSmo phosphorylation, and phosphorylation further increases the binding of CK1α and GRK2 to mSmo, forming a positive feedback loop that amplifies and/or sustains mSmo phosphorylation. Hence, despite divergence in their primary sequences and their subcellular trafficking, mSmo and dSmo employ analogous mechanisms for their activation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Hedgehog (Hh) signaling governs embryonic development and adult homeostasis in species ranging from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to human, and its malfunction has been implicated in a wide range of human disorders. Hh signal is received by the twelve-transmembrane receptor Patched and transmitted intracellularly by the seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo). How vertebrate Smo is activated in order to transmit the Hh signal remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism of mammalian Smo (mSmo) activation and find it is similar to that described for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo despite the marked sequence divergence between them. We show that mSmo is activated via phosphorylation at multiple sites by the serine/threonine kinases CK1α and GRK2. We provide evidence that Sonic hedgehog (Shh; the best studied of the three mammalian pathway ligands) can regulate the accessibility of mSmo to these kinases and that phosphorylation promotes the ciliary accumulation of this transmembrane protein in its active conformation. Moreover, increasing concentrations of Shh induce a progressive increase in mSmo phosphorylation that fine-tunes mSmo activity. Thus, our results provide novel insights into the biochemical mechanism of vertebrate Hh signal transduction and reveal a conserved mode of Smo activation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Hh family of secreted proteins plays pivotal roles during embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Ingham1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Varjosalo1">[3]</xref>. Aberrant Hh signaling contributes to numerous human disorders including congenital diseases and cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Villavicencio1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Taipale1">[5]</xref>. In a number of developmental contexts, Hh functions as a morphogen that specifies distinct cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Ingham1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Jiang1">[2]</xref>. For example, in vertebrate neural tube patterning, Shh secreted by the notochord and floor pate forms a ventral to dorsal concentration gradient that specifies distinct pools of neural progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Dessaud1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Hh exerts its biological function through a signaling cascade that ultimately controls a balance between activator and repressor forms of the Gli family of transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Jiang1">[2]</xref>. In the absence of Hh, Gli2 and Gli3 are processed into truncated repressor forms (Gli<sup>R</sup>). Hh signaling blocks Gli processing and converts full-length Gli2/3 into activator forms (Gli<sup>A</sup>). The reception system for the Hh signal consists of a twelve-transmembrane protein Patched (Ptc) as the Hh receptor and a seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) as the obligatory Hh signal transducer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Jiang1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Varjosalo1">[3]</xref>. Ptc inhibits Smo substoichiometrically through a poorly defined mechanism in the absence of Hh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Taipale2">[7]</xref>. Binding of Hh to Ptc and the Ihog/Cdo family of proteins alleviates Ptc inhibition of Smo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Stone1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhang1">[14]</xref>, leading to Smo activation and signal transduction. How Smo is activated and how it transduces the Hh signal to regulate Gli<sup>R</sup> and Gli<sup>A</sup> are still poorly understood.</p>
      <p>In mammals, Hh signaling depends on the primary cilium, a microtubule-based membrane protrusion found in almost all mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Goetz1">[15]</xref>. Key components in the Hh pathway are found in cilia and exhibit dynamic patterns depending on the Hh signaling state. For example, in the absence of Hh, Ptc localizes to cilia and prevents Smo from accumulating in the cilia; binding of Hh to Ptc triggers reciprocal trafficking of Ptc and Smo, with Ptc moving out of and Smo accumulating in the cilia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Corbit1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Rohatgi1">[17]</xref>. Ciliary accumulation of Smo correlates but is not sufficient for Hh pathway activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Corbit1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Wang1">[19]</xref>. Additional mechanisms, including conformational change in Smo, are likely to be responsible for Smo activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Taipale3">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>. Indeed, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis indicates that both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian Smo proteins exist as constitutive dimers/oligomers, but in the absence of Hh, Smo C-tails adopt a closed conformation that prevents their association. Hh induces a conformational switch in Smo, leading to dimerization/oligomerization of the C-tails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>. The mechanisms underlying mammalian Smo ciliary accumulation, conformational change, and activation are largely unknown.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Hh and Ptc reciprocally control Smo cell surface accumulation and conformation through regulating Smo phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Jia1">[25]</xref>. In response to Hh, Smo is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) and casein kinase 1 (CK1) at multiple sites in its C-tail, and these phosphorylation events activate Smo by promoting its cell surface accumulation and active conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Jia1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Apionishev1">[27]</xref>. However, vertebrate Smo C-tails diverge significantly from that of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo and do not contain the PKA/CK1 phosphorylation clusters found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo C-tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>. In addition, a systematic mutagenesis study did not reveal any Ser/Thr residues as essential for mammalian Smo activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Varjosalo2">[28]</xref>. These and other observations led to a proposal that mammalian Smo and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo are regulated by fundamentally distinct mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Varjosalo2">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Huangfu1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Several studies suggested that G protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) positively regulates Shh signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Chen3">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Philipp1">[32]</xref>. Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that GRK2 is required for the basal phosphorylation of an exogenously expressed Smo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Chen3">[30]</xref>. However, it is not clear whether GRK2 directly phosphorylates Smo and how GRK2 activates Shh signaling. In addition, direct evidence for Hh-induced mammalian Smo phosphorylation is lacking. A recent kinome siRNA screen identified CK1α as a positive regulator for Shh signaling, but its mechanism of action remains unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Evangelista1">[33]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigate the activation mechanism of mammalian Smo (henceforth referred to simply as Smo). We demonstrate that Smo is activated via multiple phosphorylation events mediated by CK1α and GRK2 that induce its ciliary accumulation and active conformation. We provide evidence that graded Shh signals induce increasing levels of Smo phosphorylation that fine-tune Smo ciliary localization, conformation, and activity. In addition, we provide evidence that Shh promotes Smo phosphorylation by regulating the accessibility of Smo to its kinases.</p>

        <title>CK1α and GRK2 Promote Smo Phosphorylation and Conformational Switch</title>
        <p>A previous study revealed that CK1α siRNA blocked Shh pathway activation in C3H10T1/2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Evangelista1">[33]</xref>. To determine how CK1α positively regulates Shh signaling, we tested whether CK1α activates Smo. Coexpression of CK1α with Smo in NIH3T3 cells activated a <italic>Gli-luciferase</italic> (<italic>Gli-luc</italic>) reporter gene, although the fold of activation was less dramatic compared with Shh stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In line with a previous finding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Meloni1">[31]</xref>, coexpression of GRK2 with Smo also activated <italic>Gli-luc</italic> in NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Coexpression of CK1α and GRK2 with Smo had a slightly stronger effect on <italic>Gli-luc</italic> expression than overexpression of each kinase alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Overexpression of another GRK family member (GRK5) with Smo activated the <italic>Gli-luc</italic> reporter gene similarly to GRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that overexpressed GRK5 and GRK2 have a similar activity in the Shh pathway.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We also examined the effect of CK1α/GRK2 overexpression on <italic>Gli-luc</italic> expression in the absence of exogenously expressed Smo. Consistent with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Meloni1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Evangelista1">[33]</xref>, overexpression of CK1α, GRK2, or both only slightly increased the expression of <italic>Gli-luc</italic> reporter gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s001">Figure S1G</xref>). Thus, CK1α/GRK2 overexpression synergized with Smo overexpression to drive Shh pathway activation.</p>
        <p>Our previous FRET analysis indicated that Shh induces a conformational change in Smo from a closed to an open conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>. In the closed conformation, Smo exists as a dimer/oligomer through an N-terminal interaction(s), which results in high basal FRET between CFP and YFP fused to the N-termini of two Smo molecules (FRET<sup>N</sup>); however, Smo C-tail folds back and is in close proximity to the intracellular loops, resulting in high intramolecular FRET between CFP inserted in the second intracellular loop (L2) and YFP fused to the C-terminus (FRET<sup>L2C</sup>) and low intermolecular FRET between CFP and YFP fused to the C-termini of two Smo molecules (FRET<sup>C</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1B–D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>. Shh induced a marked decrease in FRET<sup>L2C</sup> and a concomitant increase in FRET<sup>C</sup> without affecting FRET<sup>N</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1B–D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>, suggesting that Smo C-tails move away from the intracellular loops and form dimers/oligomers. To determine whether CK1α and GRK regulate Smo conformation, we carried out FRET analysis using the Smo biosensors indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1B–D</xref>. We found that overexpression of CK1α, GRK2, or GRK5 resulted in a significant increase in FRET<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and a marked decrease in FRET<sup>L2C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of these kinases did not cause a significant change in FRET<sup>N</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that excessive CK1α and GRK2/5 kinase activities induce a conformational change in Smo similar to that induced by Shh stimulation.</p>
        <p>Having established that CK1α and GRK2 act upstream of Smo, we then determined whether CK1α and GRK2 could promote Smo phosphorylation using a Phos-tag gel that specifically retards phosphorylated proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Kinoshita1">[34]</xref>. We found that coexpression of CK1α, GRK2, or both with a Myc-tagged Smo (Smo-Myc) resulted in a clear mobility shift of Smo-Myc on Phos-tag PAGE that was abolished by phosphatase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 5–10), suggesting that CK1α and GRK2 can promote Smo phosphorylation.</p>

Treating Smo-Myc transfected cells with a Shh-conditioned medium but not a control medium induced a marked mobility shift of Smo-Myc that was abolished by phosphatase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 3–4). Importantly, Shh-induced Smo-Myc mobility shift was greatly reduced by treating cells with a CK1 inhibitor CKI-7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Chijiwa1">[35]</xref> and/or a GRK inhibitor heparin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Lohse1">[36]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that Shh induces Smo phosphorylation through CK1 and GRK kinase activities.</p>
        <p>To establish that CK1α and GRK2 are required for Shh-induced Smo phosphorylation, we generated cell lines stably expressing shRNA targeting CK1α, GRK2, or GRK5. Two independent shRNA constructs that effectively and selectively knocked down the targeted kinase were employed in our assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–B). In line with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Meloni1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Evangelista1">[33]</xref>, CK1α or GRK2 shRNA inhibited Shh pathway activity in the <italic>Gli-luc</italic> reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s001">Figure S1C</xref>–D, H).

We note that Shh-induced Smo mobility shift was not completely abolished by silencing CK1α and GRK2, likely due to an incomplete elimination of these kinase activities by the RNAi approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). However, it is also possible that the residual Smo-Myc phosphorylation in the presence of CK1α and GRK2 shRNA could be due to the involvement of another kinase(s).</p>

In addition, we found that aa 581–612 was phosphorylated by CK1 but not by GRK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 18; unpublished data). This region contains a sequence matching CK1 consensus sites: ELS<sub>592</sub>FS<sub>594</sub>MHT<sub>597</sub>VS<sub>599</sub>. Indeed, mutating S<sub>592</sub>, S<sub>594</sub>, T<sub>597</sub>, and S<sub>599</sub> to Ala (aa 581–612SA0) abolished CK1 phosphorylation of aa 581–612 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, lane 19).</p>
        <p>For simplicity, we referred to S<sub>592</sub>, S<sub>594</sub>, T<sub>597</sub>, and S<sub>599</sub> collectively as S0; S<sub>615</sub>, S<sub>619</sub>, and S<sub>620</sub> as S1; S<sub>642</sub> as S2; S<sub>666</sub> as S3; S<sub>774</sub> and S<sub>777</sub> as S4; and S<sub>791</sub> as S5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, S1 and S5 are phosphorylation sites for both CK1 and GRK, whereas S0/S4 and S2/S3 are selectively phosphorylated by CK1 and GRK, respectively. Sequence alignment indicates that these phosphorylation sites are conserved among vertebrate Smo proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>To determine if the CK1/GRK sites identified in vitro mediate Shh-induced Smo phosphorylation in vivo, we mutated S0–S5 to Ala in Smo-Myc (SA0–5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We found that the SA0–5 mutation abolished Shh, CK1α, or GRK2-induced Smo mobility shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, lanes 5–12). Furthermore, CK1α and GRK2 neither activated SA0–5 nor induced its conformational change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s002">Figure S2D</xref>–E).</p>
        <p>To further characterize Smo phosphorylation in vivo, we attempted to generate phospho-specific antibodies against phosphorylated CK1/GRK sites and succeeded in obtaining an antibody (PS1) that specifically recognizes phosphorylated S1 (pS<sub>615</sub>, pS<sub>619</sub>, and pS<sub>620</sub>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s002">Figure S2F</xref>). To monitor phosphorylation at S1, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with Smo-Myc and stimulated with or without Shh-conditioned medium. In the absence of Shh, Smo-Myc exhibited a weak PS1 signal likely due to basal phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, lane 1). Shh induced a clear increase in the intensity of the PS1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, lane 3). Coexpression of CK1α, GRK2, or both also increased the PS1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, lanes 5, 7, and 9). On the other hand, Shh-stimulated S1 phosphorylation was diminished by treating cells with the CK1 and/or GRK2 kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, lanes 11–13). Furthermore, CK1α or GRK2 shRNA reduced whereas combined CK1α/GRK2 shRNA nearly abolished S1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, lanes 4, 6, and 8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s002">Figure S2G</xref>).

        <title>CK1/GRK Phosphorylation Sites Are Essential for Smo Activation</title>
        <p>To determine the functional significance of Smo phosphorylation, CK1/GRK sites were mutated to Ala individually or in different combinations (referred to as SA mutation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), and the effect of SA mutations on Smo activity was determined by the <italic>Gli-luc</italic> reporter assay in <italic>smo</italic>−/− MEFs.

While mutating S2 to S5 either individually (SA2, SA3, SA5) or in combinations (SA23, SA45) had little if any effect on Smo activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), combined mutations of these sites with S1/S0 (SA12, SA13, SA123, SA0–3, SA1–5, SA0–5) resulted in a progressive decrease in Shh-induced Smo activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Finally, simultaneously mutating all CK1/GRK sites (SA0–5) completely abolished Shh-induced Smo activation. These results suggest: 1) phosphorylation at CK1/GRK sites is essential for Smo activation; 2) S0 and S1 are the major sites while S2 to S5 may play a fine-tuning role; and 3) the level of Smo activity correlates with its level of phosphorylation.</p>

Mutating multiple CK1/GRK sites in SmoA1 (A1SA1–5) diminished its constitutive activity. SmoSD123 also exhibited constitutive activity, resulting in a reduction of Pax7 expression and expansion of Islet1/2, Olig2, and Nkx2.2, albeit less dramatic than SmoA1.

        <p>To determine whether phosphorylation renders constitutive Smo activity, we converted individual or different combinations of CK1/GRK sites to Asp (referred to as SD mutations) to mimic different levels of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). SD mutations of individual sites (SD0, SD1, SD2, SD3) or several combinations (SD23, SD12, SD13) caused little if any increase in the basal activity of Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g003">Figure 3B</xref>); however, other combinations (SD01, SD123, SD0–3, SD1–5, SD0–5) resulted in a clear elevation of Smo basal activity and the level of basal activity correlates with the number of altered sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Nevertheless, the constitutive activities of SmoSD variants are lower compared with that of SmoA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, the SD variants were further stimulated by Shh, whereas SmoA1 was no longer regulated by Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation at CK1/GRK sites increases Smo activity in a dose dependent manner but does not confer full activation.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the oncogenic mutation activates Smo through its phosphorylation, we mutated several CK1/GRK sites to Ala in SmoA1. Mutating S2/3 (A1SA2, A1SA3, A1SA23) had little if any effect on SmoA1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, S1 mutation (A1SA1) or combined mutations of S1 with other sites (A1SA12, A1SA13, A1SA123, A1SA1–5) greatly reduced or nearly abolished SmoA1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that S1 phosphorylation is critical for the oncogenic mutation to activate Smo. Of note, the SA1 mutation had a more profound effect on the activity of SmoA1 than that of wild type Smo in the presence of Shh (compare SmoA1SA1 with SmoSA1+Shh). The reason for this difference is unclear, but it is possible that the oncogenic mutation may not fully mimic Shh stimulation so that SmoA1 relies on S1 phosphorylation for its activation more than wild type Smo.</p>
        <p>We also found that mutating SA0–5 abrogated SAG-induced Smo activation, whereas SD0–5 exhibited resistance to cyclopamine inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s002">Figure S2I</xref>), suggesting that SAG and cyclopamine regulate Smo activity by influencing its phosphorylation.</p>

Electroporation of SmoWT or Smo variants that mimic low-level phosphorylation (SD1, SD12) did not significantly alter the expression of the marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s003">Figure S3A</xref>); however, electroporation of Smo variants that mimic high-level phosphorylation (SD123, SD1–5, SD0–5) resulted in a dorsal expansion of several ventral markers, including Nkx2.2, Olig2, Nkx6.1, and Islet1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s003">Figure S3D</xref>).

        <title>Phosphorylation of Smo Promotes Its Ciliary Accumulation</title>
        <p>Shh induces ciliary accumulation of Smo that correlates with pathway activation, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Corbit1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Rohatgi1">[17]</xref>. We determined whether Shh promotes Smo ciliary localization by inducing its phosphorylation at CK1/GRK sites by examining ciliary localization of CFP-tagged wild type or phosphorylation site mutant forms of Smo in MEF cells treated with or without Shh-conditioned medium. As overexpression by transient transfection caused high basal ciliary localization of Smo, we used retroviral infection to express low levels of exogenous Smo. In these conditions, SmoWT was found in less than 5% of cilia in the absence of Shh but accumulated in ∼70% of cilia in response to Shh treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g004">Figure 4A–B</xref>). We found that SA mutations inhibited Shh-induced whereas SD mutations promoted basal ciliary accumulation of Smo in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g004">Figure 4A–B</xref>). In addition, constitutive ciliary localization of SmoA1 was inhibited by the SA1–5 mutation (A1SA1–5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g004">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation at CK1/GRK sites is both necessary and sufficient for the ciliary localization of Smo.</p>

        <p>A recent study suggested that β-arrestins mediate Smo ciliary localization by binding to Smo and facilitating its interaction with the kinesin-II motor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Kovacs1">[43]</xref>. We hypothesized that Shh-induced Smo phosphorylation promotes its ciliary localization by recruiting β-arrestins. To test this possibility, we transfected NIH 3T3 cells with a YFP-tagged β-arrestin2 (β-arr2-YFP) together with Myc-tagged wild type or mutant forms of Smo. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g004">Figure 4</xref>, both Shh and the A1 mutation increased the amount of β-arr2 coimmunoprecipitated with Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 2, 7). The SA mutations nearly abolished Shh- or A1-stimulated interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, lanes 4,10), whereas SD0–5 promoted Smo/β-arr2 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 5).</p>
        <p>We also confirmed that phosphorylation regulates Smo/β-arr2 association using FRET assay. We found that Shh and A1 increased the FRET between Smo-CFP and β-arr2-YFP, and this increase was abolished by the SA0–5 mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Conversely, SD0–5 increased the basal FRET between Smo-CFP and β-arr2-YFP. Thus, Shh-induced phosphorylation at CK1/GRK sites increases the association between Smo and β-arr2, which may account for the increased ciliary localization of Smo.</p>

        <title>Smo Phosphorylation at the Primary Cilium</title>
        <p>To examine the spatial and temporal regulation of Smo phosphorylation, we carried out immunohistochemistry experiments using the PS1 antibody that recognizes phosphorylated S1. Because PS1 failed to detect endogenous Smo, we generated NIH3T3 cells stably expressing low levels of Smo-CFP (NIH3T3<sup>Smo-CFP</sup>). NIH3T3<sup>Smo-CFP</sup> did not exhibit significant basal ciliary localization of Smo-CFP or ciliary PS1 signal but accumulated both signals in the cilia upon stimulation with Shh, SAG, or 20-OHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s004">Figure S4A</xref>).

The difference in the sensitivity of SAG and 20-OHC to cyclopamine could be due to different mechanisms of action employed by these small molecules to regulate Smo.</p>

        <p>To examine the dynamics of Smo phosphorylation, we treated NIH3T3<sup>SmoCFP</sup> cells with Shh-conditioned medium or SAG for different periods of time (1, 2, 4, and 24 h). In line with a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Rohatgi1">[17]</xref>, both Shh and SAG induced a rapid ciliary accumulation of Smo-CFP, and the percentage of Smo-CFP positive cilia as well as the mean intensity of SmoCFP signal increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g006">Figure 6B–D</xref>). Importantly, we observed a similar kinetics for PS1 accumulation in the primary cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g006">Figure 6B–D</xref>). Furthermore, the ratio of PS1 versus Smo-CFP signal intensity in primary cilia remained relatively constant over time.</p>
        <p>We also monitored Smo phosphorylation in whole cells by western blot using the PS1 and GFP antibodies. We found that the ratio of PS1 versus Smo-CFP signal intensity was lower at early time points and gradually increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, Smo phosphorylation exhibited faster kinetics in primary cilia than in whole cells, implying that Smo could be preferentially phosphorylated near or in the primary cilia in response to Shh or SAG, leading to its rapid accumulation in the cilia.</p>

        <title>Efficient Smo Phosphorylation Depends on the Kinesin-II Ciliary Motor</title>

        <p>To further explore the interactions between Smo and CK1α/GRK2 and their regulation, we generated several N- or C-terminally truncated forms of Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7E</xref>, CK1α and GRK2 coimmunoprecipitated with HA-tagged Smo C-tail from aa 544 to aa 793 (SmoCT). Deletion of aa 544–565 from the Smo C-tail (SmoCT2) did not affect CK1α/GRK2 binding; however, further deletion of aa 565–588 (SmoCT3) abolished CK1α binding but did not affect GRK2 binding, suggesting that the membrane proximal region of Smo C-tail between aa 565 and 588 mediates CK1α binding, whereas the distal region between aa 588 and 793 binds GRK2. Consistent with this, we found that SmoΔC588 but not SmoΔC565 pulled down CK1α and neither SmoΔC565 nor SmoΔC588 pulled down GRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7G</xref>, lanes 3–6). Thus, the CK1α binding pocket is located N-terminal to the phosphorylation sites.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, SmoΔC588 exhibited increased basal binding to CK1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7G</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 5), suggesting that the distal region of Smo C-tail inhibits CK1α binding in the absence of Shh. We hypothesized that unphosphorylated Smo C-tail adopts a closed conformation that could mask the membrane proximal CK1α binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7J</xref>). Indeed, the SA0–5 mutation, which locked Smo C-tail in its closed conformation, diminished Shh-stimulated CK1α binding, whereas the SD0–5 mutation, which locked the Smo C-tail in its open conformation, increased the basal CK1α binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lanes 3–6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). However, the SA0–5 and SD0–5 mutations in the context of Smo C-tail (SmoCT-SA and SmoCT-SD) did not significantly alter CK1α binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7F</xref>), unlike their effect in the context of full-length Smo. Thus, instead of directly altering the CK1α binding site, phosphorylation may regulate CK1α binding by influencing the conformation of Smo C-tail and thus controlling the accessibility of the CK1α binding pocket. In contrast, the SD0–5 mutation dramatically increased GRK2 binding in the context of both SmoCT and full-length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7B and 7F</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation may increase the affinity of a GRK2 binding site(s) in the Smo C-tail.</p>
        <p>Although kinase binding to Smo is influenced by phosphorylation, we found that Shh still enhanced the binding of CK1α to SmoSA0–5 and SmoSD0–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lanes 3–6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, CK1α binding to SmoΔC588, which lacks all the CK1/GRK phosphorylate sites, was also upregulated by Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7G</xref>, compare lanes 5 and 6; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s005">Figure S5</xref>). These results demonstrate that Shh can stimulate CK1α binding through a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. In contrast, GRK2 binding to SmoSD0–5 or SmoSA0–5 was no longer regulated by Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, lanes 3–6), suggesting that Shh promotes GRK2 binding mainly through the phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. Taken together, these data suggest that Shh may regulate CK1α/GRK2 binding in two steps: 1) Shh stimulates CK1α binding to Smo prior to its phosphorylation, which may provide a mechanism to initiate Smo phosphorylation, and 2) phosphorylation of Smo C-tail releases its inhibition on CK1α binding and at the same time increases its binding affinity for GRK2, leading to amplification of Smo phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7J</xref>).</p>

Another loss-of-function mutation, I573A, which mainly affected Smo stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Varjosalo2">[28]</xref>, slightly reduced Shh-stimulated CK1α binding and Smo phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7H</xref>, lanes 11–12; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>If L430A and S570A affect Smo phosphorylation because they interfere with the accessibility of Smo to its kinases, one would expect that increasing the levels of Smo kinases might rescue the phosphorylation defect. Indeed, cotransfection of CK1α with SmoL430A or SmoS570A resulted in their efficient phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7I</xref>).</p>
        <p>Finally, we found that A1 mimicked Shh stimulation to enhanced CK1α binding to SmoΔ588 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7G</xref>, compare lanes 7–8 with 5–6; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s005">Figure S5</xref>), whereas L430A blocked both the basal and Shh-stimulated binding of CK1α to SmoΔ588 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7G</xref>, lanes 11–12, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s005">Figure S5</xref>), suggesting that these mutations affect the phosphorylation-independent mechanism that regulates CK1α binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7J</xref>). It is possible that the third intracellular loop may also contribute to CK1α binding and this is disrupted by L430A.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the M1 and S570 mutations did not affect either the basal or Shh-stimulated binding of CK1α to SmoΔ588 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7G</xref>, lanes 9–10 and 13–14; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001083.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Thus, M1 and S570 affect CK1α binding only in the context of full-length Smo and may act mainly by regulating the release of C-tail inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7J</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Smo is a central component of the Hh signal transduction cascade and an important cancer drug target, but the molecular mechanism by which Smo is activated has remained poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that Smo is activated by multi-site phosphorylation mediated by CK1α and GRK2, and phosphorylation promotes both ciliary localization and active conformation of Smo. We provide evidence that graded Shh signals induce increasing levels of Smo phosphorylation that fine-tune Smo activity. In addition, we demonstrate that oncogenic mutations and small molecule Hh pathway modulators including SAG, oxysterols, and cyclopamine regulate Smo through CK1α/GRK2-mediated phosphorylation. We provide evidence that Shh promotes Smo phosphorylation by regulating its accessibility to CK1α/GRK2 and effective Smo phosphorylation depends on the primary cilium. The CK1α/GRK2 sites we identified are conserved among vertebrate Smo proteins; thus, the mechanism we uncover here is likely to be conserved in other vertebrate species.</p>

        <title>CK1α and GRK2 Regulate Smo Through Multi-Site Phosphorylation</title>
        <p>It has been well established that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo is hyperphosphorylated by multiple kinases in response to Hh stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Denef1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Jia1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Apionishev1">[27]</xref>; however, sequence divergence between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate Smo proteins makes it unclear whether vertebrate Smo proteins are similarly phosphorylated in response to Hh. Using the phospho-tag gel and a phospho-specific antibody, we provide the first evidence that Shh induces hyperphosphorylation of Smo, which is mediated by CK1α and GRK2. Several lines of evidence suggest that CK1α and GRK2 are bona fide Smo kinases. First, our in vitro kinase assay with purified Smo fragments and recombinant kinases demonstrated that both CK1 and GRK phosphorylate multiple sites in Smo C-tail. Second, mutating the CK1/GRK sites in the Smo C-tail abolished Shh-stimulated Smo phosphorylation in vivo. Third, using a phospho-specific antibody that recognized an overlapping CK1/GRK site (S1), we demonstrated that Shh induced phosphorylation at this site through CK1α and GRK2.</p>
        <p>We identified a total of six CK1α/GRK2 phosphorylation regions, which we named S0 to S5. S0 and S1 contain multiple phospho-acceptor Ser/Thr residues. Our functional study suggests that S0 and S1 play a major role while other sites play a fine-tuning role in Smo regulation. The employment of multi-site phosphorylation may allow graded Hh morphogens to induce different levels of Smo activity through differential phosphorylation. Indeed, we found that increasing levels of Shh induced a progressive increase in the level of Smo phosphorylation. Furthermore, increasing the number of SA mutations gradually decreased the level of Shh-induced Smo activity, whereas increasing the number of phospho-mimetic mutations progressively increased the level of basal Smo activity.</p>
        <p>Although phospho-mimetic mutations increase the basal activity of Smo both in vitro and in vivo, they do not confer full activation of Smo, which is in contrast to the A1/M2 oncogenic mutation. One possibility is that the SD mutations may not fully mimic phosphorylation and may even lock Smo in a less optimal conformation for activation. However, we think this is unlikely because the SmoSD variants can be further stimulated by Shh to reach their full activity. In addition, phospho-mimetic mutations did not affect SmoA1 activity (unpublished data). These observations suggest that Shh and A1/M2 may stimulate an additional mechanism(s) that acts in conjunction with CK1α/GRK2-mediated phosphorylation to fully activate Smo. The proposed paralleled mechanisms could be phosphorylation-independent and/or could involve additional kinase(s). Furthermore, although our in vitro and in vivo assays suggest that phosphorylation at S0–S5 is mediated by CK1α/GRK2, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of these sites might also be phosphorylated by other kinases.</p>

        <title>Smo Phosphorylation, Conformational Switch, and Ciliary Localization</title>
        <p>A prevalent view regarding Smo activation is that Hh activates Smo by inducing its ciliary localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Corbit1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Rohatgi1">[17]</xref>. However, this view has been challenged by more recent studies showing that the Smo inhibitor cyclopamine promotes instead of blocks ciliary localization of Smo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Rohatgi2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Wang1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Wilson1">[45]</xref>, suggesting that ciliary localization of Smo is insufficient for its activation. Our previous and current studies demonstrate that Shh induces a conformational switch in Smo that is also induced by the A1 mutation and SAG but is blocked by Smo inhibitors including cyclopamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Yang1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Hyman1">[47]</xref>, suggesting that Hh-induced Smo conformational switch may represent an additional step for Smo activation. How Smo conformational switch and ciliary localization are regulated remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that both events are governed by CK1α/GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Smo C-tail. CK1α/GRK2 phosphorylation-deficient forms of Smo are locked in a closed conformation and fail to accumulate in primary cilia in response to Shh stimulation, whereas phospho-mimetic forms adopt an open conformation and accumulate in the primary cilia independent of Shh.</p>
        <p>In the absence of Hh, Smo may move in and out of the primary cilium with the exit rate far exceeding the entry rate, resulting in a low steady state level of Smo in the primary cilium. However, Hh-induced Smo phosphorylation and conformational change could tilt the balance by increasing the entry rate and/or decreasing the exit rate. In support of this model, we found that Hh-induced phosphorylation promoted the binding of β-arr2 to Smo. A recent study demonstrated that β-arrestins mediate the interaction between Smo and the anterior-grade trafficking motor kinesin-II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Kovacs1">[43]</xref>. Thus, Hh-induced phosphorylation may promote Smo ciliary accumulation by facilitating its anterior grade trafficking through recruiting β-arr2. It is also possible that phosphorylation may impede the retrograde trafficking of Smo or may stabilize Smo protein in the primary cilium.</p>

        <title>Regulation of Smo Phosphorylation</title>
        <p>Our data suggested that Shh stimulates Smo phosphorylation, at least in part by regulating the accessibility of Smo to its kinases. Our deletion analyses revealed that CK1α and GRK2 bind Smo through the membrane proximal and distal regions of Smo C-tail, respectively. We provided evidence that Smo C-tail in its closed conformation inhibits CK1α binding likely by masking the membrane proximal CK1α binding pocket through steric hindrance, and this inhibition is released by phosphorylation that promotes the open conformation of Smo C-tail. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Shh stimulates the binding of CK1α to the membrane proximal region of Smo C-tail through a mechanism that parallels with the phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. We propose a two-step mechanism for Shh-regulated kinase association and Smo phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7J</xref>). In the first step (referred to as the initiation step), Shh stimulates CK1α binding to Smo prior to its phosphorylation, likely by inducing a local conformational change near the membrane proximal region that either optimizes the CK1α binding pocket or makes it more accessible to CK1α. This step may contribute to the initiation of Smo phosphorylation and is promoted by the A1 mutation but is blocked by the L430A mutation. In the second step (referred to as the amplification step), CK1α-initiated phosphorylation further increases CK1α binding by promoting the open conformation of Smo C-tail. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Smo C-tail increases its binding affinity for GKR2. Increased binding of CK1α/GRK2 forms a feedback loop to further increase the level of Smo phosphorylation.</p>
        <p>There could be a basal association of CK1α/GRK2 with Smo in quiescent cells, and Shh could induce a change in Smo that makes the CK1/GRK sites more accessible to the bound kinases, which may also contribute to the initiation of Smo phosphorylation. Finally, Smo phosphorylation is likely to be counteracted by a phosphatase(s), which could be essential for keeping basal Smo phosphorylation low. Therefore, Shh could regulate the activity or accessibility of a Smo phosphatase(s) in addition to regulating the Smo kinases.</p>
        <p>Our time course study revealed that phosphorylation of Smo occurred more rapidly in the primary cilia compared with the whole cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, expression of a dominant negative form of Kif3b, which blocks ciliogenesis, attenuated Shh- or A1-induced Smo phosphorylation. These observations suggest that Smo phosphorylation occurs more efficiently in the primary cilia. Interestingly, we found that CK1α is accumulated in primary cilia in response to Shh stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). The increase in the local concentration of CK1α may explain, at least in part, why phosphorylation of Smo is more effective in the primary cilium. It is also possible that Shh-mediated inhibition of Ptc is more effective in the primary cilium.</p>

        <title>Parallels Between Mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Smo Activation</title>
        <p>Despite the profound difference in the primary sequence between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate Smo, our study suggests that their activation mechanisms are remarkably similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001083-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In both cases, Hh induces Smo phosphorylation at multiple sites (although by distinct sets of kinases) that fine-tune Smo activity, and phosphorylation activates Smo by inducing its active conformation and regulating its subcellular localization (cell surface accumulation for dSmo and ciliary accumulation for mSmo). Hh-stimulated phosphorylation induces dSmo conformation change by antagonizing multiple Arg clusters in its C-tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>. As the inactive conformation of mSmo is also maintained by a long stretch of basic cluster in its C-tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Zhao1">[22]</xref>, multisite phosphorylation may promote mSmo conformational change through a similar mechanism. A recent study has demonstrated that GRK2 regulates dSmo by both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001083-Chen6">[48]</xref>. The observation that Shh induces mSmo/GRK2 complex formation raises an interesting possibility that GRK2 may also function as a molecular scaffold to promote mSmo activation.</p>

(D) <italic>Gli-luc</italic> assay in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with Smo or SmoSA0–5 with or without the indicated kinase expressing constructs and treated with or without Shh-conditioned medium. (E) FRET analysis in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with Smo-CFP<sup>C</sup>/YFP<sup>C</sup> or SmoSA0–5-CFP<sup>C</sup>/YFP<sup>C</sup> with or without the indicated kinase expressing constructs and treated with or without Shh-conditioned medium (mean ± s.d., <italic>n</italic>≥10). (F) Evaluation of the specificity of the PS1 antibody. (Top) A schematic drawing of full-length Smo with the antigen peptide sequence for generating the PS1 antibody indicated. (Bottom) Western blot analysis using the PS1 antibody or antibodies against the non-phosphorylated peptide (S1). The PS1 antibody recognized GST-Smo608–670 but not GST-Smo608–670SA phosphorylated by GRK or CK1. In addition, the PS1 antibody did not recognize the unphosphorylated GST-Smo608–670. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were loaded as indicated by western blot with the S1 antibody. (G) Knockdown of CK1α or GRK2 affected Shh-induced Smo phosphorylation. Cell extracts from indicated stable NIH 3T3/shRNA lines transfected with Smo-Myc and treated with or without Shh-conditioned medium were separated on SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with PS1 and Myc antibodies. Knockdown of CK1α or GRK2 but not GRK5 reduced Shh-induced Smo phosphorylation at S1 site. (H–I) The effect of mutating CK1/GRK sites on A1-induced Smo phosphorylation and Smo activity in response to Shh and small molecules. (H) Cell extracts from NIH 3T3 cells transfected with Smo-Myc, SmoA1-Myc, or SmoA1SA1–5-Myc and treated with or without Shh-conditioned medium were separated on Phos tag-conjugated SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with a Myc antibody. Mutating multiple CK1/GRK sites abolished Shh- or A1-induced mobility shift of the Myc-tagged Smo. (I) <italic>Gli-luc</italic> assay in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with Smo, SmoSA0–5, or SmoSD0–5 and treated with or without the indicated reagents. The activity of SmoSA0–5 was no longer induced by Shh or SAG, whereas SmoSD0–5 exhibited elevated basal activity and was more resistant to cyclopamine (CYC) inhibition.</p>

          <p>Mutating CK1/GRK sites affect Smo activity in chick neural tube. (A) Activity of Smo SD variants in chick neural tube. SmoWT, SmoSD1, SmoSD12, SmoSD123, SmoSD1–5, or SmoSD0–5 were transfected by in ovo electroporation into the thoracic region of HH st11–12 chick neural tube and the expression patterns of the indicated markers analyzed 48 h later. In embryos transfected with SmoSD123, SmoSD1–5, or SmoSD0–5, the expression of Pax7 was repressed and expression of Isl1, Olig2, and Nkx2.2 expanded dorsally (arrows). By contrast, the expression patterns of the neural tube markers in SmoSD1 or SmoSD12 electroporated embryos were similar to those in embryos transfected with SmoWT. (B) Mutating S1 affects SmoA1 activity in chick neural tube. SmoA1 or SmoA1 with different combination of SA mutations (A1SA1, A1SA12, A1SA13, A1SA23, and A1SA123) were transfected by in ovo electroporation into the thoracic region of the neural tube of HH st11–12 chick embryos and the expression patterns of the indicated markers analyzed 48 h later. SmoA1 exhibited constitutive signaling activity, resulting in the dorsal expansion of ventral markers, including Islet1, Nkx6.1, Olig2, and Nkx2.2 and the repression of Pax7 (Brackets). Mutating S1 alone (A1SA1) or in combination with other sites (A1SA12, A1SA13, or A1SA123) markedly reduced the signaling activity of SmoA1 and these constructs only induced mild ectopic expression of ventral markers (arrows). By contrast, mutating S2 and S3 (A1SA23) did not significantly affect SmoA1 activity.</p>
