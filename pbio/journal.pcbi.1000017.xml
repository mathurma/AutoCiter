Their existence and functioning may be explained if IDPs are preferentially associated with chaperones in the cell, which may offer protection against degradation by proteases. To test this inference, we took pairwise interaction data from high-throughput interaction studies and analyzed to see if predicted disorder correlates with the tendency of chaperone binding by proteins. Our major finding is that disorder predicted by the IUPred algorithm actually shows negative correlation with chaperone binding in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and metazoa species. Since predicted disorder positively correlates with the tendency of partner binding in the interactome, the difference between the disorder of chaperone-binding and non-binding proteins is even more pronounced if normalized to their overall tendency to be involved in pairwise protein–protein interactions. We argue that chaperone binding is primarily required for folding of globular proteins, as reflected in an increased preference for chaperones of proteins in which at least one Pfam domain exists. In terms of the functional consequences of chaperone binding of mostly disordered proteins, we suggest that its primary reason is not the assistance of folding, but promotion of assembly with partners. In support of this conclusion, we show that IDPs that bind chaperones also tend to bind other proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Intrinsically disordered/unstructured proteins (IDPs) defy the classical structure–function paradigm because they exist and function without a well-defined 3-D structure. These proteins are extremely sensitive to degradation in the test tube, but show no enhanced degradation rates in the cell. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we tested whether IDPs are protected by interaction with accessory proteins, chaperones, often implicated in guarding other proteins in the cell. Our major finding is that disorder predicted by the IUPred algorithm actually shows negative correlation with chaperone binding in various species. To explain this finding, we argue that IDPs are protected in the cell from proteases by their special amino acid composition, and also by the tight regulation of intracellular proteases. Thus, the primary reason for their chaperone binding is not protection from degradation, but promotion of assembly with partners.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the following grants: OTKA K60694 from the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund, ETT 245/2006 from the Hungarian Ministry of Health, International Senior Research Fellowship ISRF 067595 from the Wellcome Trust to P.T., and a Marie Curie reintegration grant IRG-046572 from the European Commission to H.H.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intrinsically disordered/unstructured proteins or protein domains (IDPs) are prevalent in proteomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Dunker1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa1">[3]</xref> due to the inherent functional advantages structural disorder imparts on proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Dunker1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa2">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Dyson1">[6]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, IDPs have been noted for an increased speed of interaction, specificity without excessive binding strength, adaptability to multiple partners and ease of regulation by post-translational modification. These and other functional features explain a particularly high level of disorder in important regulatory proteins involved in signaling, and regulation of transcription, such as p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Bell1">[7]</xref>, p27<sup>Kip1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Sivakolundu1">[8]</xref>, CREB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Radhakrishnan1">[9]</xref> or BRCA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Mark1">[10]</xref>. Whereas these features elucidate the prevalence of protein disorder in proteomes underlying the recent heightened interest in the subject, the phenomenon of structural disorder poses further serious questions. Due to their open and flexible conformational state, IDPs are exceptionally sensitive to proteolysis <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Galea1">[11]</xref>, which raises concerns in terms of their <italic>in vivo</italic> existence and functioning. The question most often asked is how IDPs function when they are supposedly rapidly degraded by proteases <italic>in vivo</italic>. That this is not the case, is shown by our recent observations that the physiological half-lives of IDPs determined in a high-throughput study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Belle1">[12]</xref> show very weak correlation with their disorder content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa4">[13]</xref>. This suggests the involvement of additional factors and/or special mechanisms in the physiological function of IDPs, specifically addressed in this work. One particularly intriguing point is the possibility of the involvement of chaperones, which may offer direct protection by binding in the cell. Since chaperone action has already been implicated with some IDPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Dou1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Rekas1">[16]</xref>, we have decided to analyze recent high-throughput interaction data to provide a systematic and coherent answer to this question.</p><p>Chaperones are energy-dependent protein machines that function to prevent their clients from misfolding and aggregation, or to assist their assembly and transport in the crowded intracellular milieu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Korcsmaros1">[17]</xref>. Recently, it has been recognized that some IDPs also display chaperone activity, probably enabled by a more primitive mechanism that relies on “entropy transfer” from the chaperone to the misfolded partner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa5">[18]</xref>. Although in the original formulations chaperone models have been described as assisting folding of misfolded globular proteins and RNA molecules, in some cases it has been described that a chaperone may also have an IDP client. For example, it has been shown that molecular chaperones α(s)- and β-casein prevent amyloid fibril formation by κ-casein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Thorn1">[15]</xref>. In another study, it was shown that chaperones promote the association of a microtubule-associated protein, tau, with microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Dou1">[14]</xref>. The suppression of α-synuclein toxicity and aggregation in a Drosophila model for Parkinson's disease may also point towards the involvement of a chaperone in the action of an IDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Auluck1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Klucken1">[20]</xref>. α-synuclein aggregation is also affected by another chaperone, αB-crystallin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Rekas1">[16]</xref>. These examples show that some IDPs may require the involvement of chaperones for function, which could also explain the observed <italic>in vivo</italic> stability of these proteins. Whether this interdependence is general among IDPs, has been the subject of this study.</p><p>In recent high-throughput interaction studies large segments of the interactome, i.e. network of protein-protein interactions, have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Gavin1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Arifuzzaman1">[23]</xref>. We have approached the above question by analyzing whether structural disorder correlates with the tendency of proteins to be binding partners of chaperones. We found that on the contrary, partners of chaperones tend to be ordered proteins, which apparently need more assistance for folding than IDPs. IDPs, on the other hand, need no help for folding, also suggested by many <italic>in vitro</italic> data on their functional efficacy, and probably use chaperone assistance for protection from aggregation and assembly into complexes.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Data</title><p>We used the data about pairwise interactions published in the IntAct database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/site/index.jsf" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/site/index.jsf</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Kerrien1">[24]</xref>.

Thus, to make sure our analysis focuses on the direct interaction of a protein with its partners, we selected complexes of exactly two components, regardless of the detection method, ensuring an actual physical interaction between the partners.</p><p>We grouped the interaction data in IntAct into three phylogenetic subgroups, handling the bacterial (mostly <italic>E. coli</italic>), unicellular eukaryotic (mostly yeast) and metazoa protein interaction data separately.

However, all the other proteins with a 50% or higher similarity (but not fulfilling the ‘almost full-length’ similarity) were excluded from both the chaperone and the non-chaperone class because of their perceived ambiguity regarding a chaperone function. To avoid false chaperone assignments among the short putative chaperones, we removed all the predicted chaperones with a length of less than 100 amino acids.</p><p>We excluded protein interactions with these ambiguous proteins. We also excluded those proteins that appear in pairwise interactions with both chaperones and non-chaperones.

We have selected IUPred for predictions because it has not been trained on potentially error-ridden data of disordered proteins. Rather, this algorithm estimates the total pair-wise interresidue interaction energy of sequences by applying low-resolution force-fields deduced from folded proteins. It has been observed that below a certain threshold the estimated energy is insufficient to overcome the large entropic penalty of folding, and (segment of) the protein cannot fold, but remains disordered. In this sense, IUPred score represents an assessment of the structural status of disordered proteins independent of prior rather heterogeneous data on IDPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Distribution of the percentage disorder in the three taxonomic groups</title><p>For all the interacting proteins in the three taxonomic groups we determined the distribution of the percentage disorder of both the chaperone-binding and non-chaperone-binding proteins, by counting the number of proteins in each disorder range, with increments of 5% disorder.

The lack of significance is most certainly due to the small number (72 altogether) of the chaperone-binding proteins in this category.

Percentage disorder within a protein, however, does not adequately distinguish between proteins with or without globular domains, which are potential chaperone binding sites of a protein. To clarify on this point, we decided to select and observe the chaperone binding of those proteins, which have at least one globular domain. As the Pfam domain collection contains mostly globular proteins (85% of them contains 10% disorder at the maximum (unpublished results)), the presence of a Pfam domain should represent the feature decisive for the need of chaperone-binding. To confirm this, we analyzed all the proteins in pair-wise interaction by Blastp against all Pfam domains. We found that for chaperone-binding proteins in unicellular eukaryotes the ratio of Pfam-lacking (i.e. those proteins where no Pfam-domain match was found) and Pfam-containing proteins was 0.380±0.10 (65 over 176 proteins) but for non-chaperone-binding proteins this ratio was 0.504±0.05 (1174 over 2356 proteins). In metazoa proteins the ratio of Pfam-lacking and Pfam-containing proteins for chaperone-binding proteins was 0.271±0.09 (16 over 59 proteins), whereas for non-chaperone-binding the same ratio was 0.45±0.01 (4387 over 9734 proteins). (By a chi-square test to compare the different proportions for both taxonomic groups, we found that these differences in ratios did not achieve statistical significances, but suggested clear tendencies. The lack of strict statistical significance is due mostly to the large differences in the number of chaperone-binding and non- chaperone binding proteins.) Thus, these observations were in line with our expectation that chaperone-binding proteins tend to have more often globular part(s), such as a Pfam domain, which require chaperone binding to help fold. Probably due to limitations in the number of known chaperone-binding proteins, we could not observe such a favorable difference between the ratios in bacteria (chaperone-binding proteins: 0.107 [14 over 131 proteins]; non-chaperone-binding proteins: 0,063 [40 over 636 proteins]) However, the disorder for all the 14 chaperone-binding bacterial proteins without a Pfam domain is below 31% therefore they can easily contain a globular domain. This is further supported by the observation that the name of 13 of the 14 Swissprot proteins in question starts with a ‘y’, indicating a largely uncharacterized bacterial protein in SwissProt.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Ratio of exclusively chaperone-binding and non-exclusively chaperone-binding proteins</title><p>Our explanation for all previous data is that ordered proteins/domains require chaperones as binding partners to assist their folding, whereas disordered proteins/regions either do not need chaperones or they need them for some other aspect of their function. From the limited information of relevance in the literature, we expect it might be rather for helping to integrate into larger complexes. The corollary of this suggestion is that IDPs that bind a chaperone are more likely also to bind another partner, than ordered proteins. As there is considerable overlap between the chaperone-binding and non-chaperone binding proteins, we thought to address this issue by determining if there is any difference in the disorder of those proteins that bind only chaperones and those that bind both chaperones and other types of proteins. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000017-g004">Figure 4</xref>.

In the case of metazoa, none of the proteins with more than 80% disorder are exclusively chaperone-binding. There is a similar tendency for yeast proteins, too, with somewhat lesser R-value.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000017-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000017.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Intrinsic disorder of exclusively chaperone-binding and non-exclusively chaperone-binding yeast and metazoa proteins.</title><p>The ratio of proteins which only bind chaperone to those which also bind non-chaperone partner(s).

This statement applies to a prokaryote, <italic>E. coli</italic>, a unicellular eukaryote, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and also to metazoa. The effect may be correlated with the presence of ordered domains, as observed with Pfam domains, although due to scarcity of data in two systems we could not draw a general conclusion. Further, binding of chaperones to disordered proteins is frequently accompanied by binding to other proteins, which suggests that IDPs use chaperones not for folding, but for assistance with association with other proteins. Even in cases where statistical significance is low, our data strongly discredit the original hypothesis that IDPs would be preferentially bound and protected by chaperones. These observations have numerous ramifications, as discussed next.</p><p>The first implication is that the very week correlation of protein disorder with intracellular degradation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa4">[13]</xref>, is apparently not a general consequence of protection of IDPs by chaperones. Because IDPs <italic>in vitro</italic> are orders of magnitude more sensitive to proteolysis than globular proteins, this observation demands some other, general explanation, such as protection by protein-protein interaction or tight control of proteolytic systems. In fact, many functions of IDPs directly invoke their involvement in protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Ward1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Iakoucheva1">[30]</xref>, and hub proteins with multiple interacting partners have an elevated level of disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Ekman1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Dosztanyi2">[33]</xref>. As a matter of fact, this may suggest that many interacting partners of proteins may also act in a compensatory or assisting fashion, given their potentially very high intracellular concentrations. Although this is not in the focus of the current work, our results might promote the idea of the extension and generalization of the chaperone concept. An additional point is that many intracellular proteases are known to be regulated and thus not to discriminately degrade their substrates. The mechanisms involve pro-enzyme activation (e.g. caspases), intracellular localization (e.g. lysosomal proteases) or ubiquitination (e.g. proteasome), among others. This might actually relieve chaperones from the duty of guarding IDPs, which might have been a key factor in the spread and functional success of IDPs.</p><p>Another pertinent issue is the structural ramifications of the noted preference of ordered proteins for chaperone partners. It is a commonplace that the 3D structure of a protein is determined by its amino acid sequence, but folding, in particular in the crowded intracellular environment of the cell, occasionally requires guidance by chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Korcsmaros1">[17]</xref>. This, however, should be reflected in their need of chaperones during folding, not in the fully folded state, studied in the high-throughput interaction studies referred to. Thus, their preference for chaperones must reflect their tendency to transiently unfold and recruit a chaperone to assist refolding. In the case of IDPs, current <italic>in vitro</italic> observations suggest that they need no assistance for folding, i.e. they can reach the native-state ensemble from a highly denatured state spontaneously. The observation that IDPs are often heat resistant, and remain fully functional after treatment by boiling temperatures, bear witness to this point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Galea1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Kim1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Csizmok1">[35]</xref>. This holds true also for IDPs that are not fully disordered, but have short-range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa3">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Fuxreiter1">[36]</xref> and/or long-range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Csizmok2">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Vise1">[39]</xref> organization. As a first approximation, we may take this as an indication that a similar situation applies <italic>in vivo</italic>, i.e. IDPs spontaneously acquire their native ensemble of structures after synthesis. A key point here, however, is that chaperones might not only be needed for assisting proper folding, but also for preventing aggregation from a partially folded/misfolded state. It is thought the open and exposed character of IDPs makes them particularly vulnerable to aggregation, but their special amino acid composition itself counters the threat. In fact, IDPs are usually highly charged, they contain a high percentage of the structure-breaking Pro residue, and are low in hydrophobic residues, which all act against aggregation and subsequent amyloid formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa2">[4]</xref>. Further, they have special sequence features built in to prevent aggregation, as noted in the case of the polyGln region of huntingtin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Bhattacharyya1">[40]</xref>. Since IDPs do show some tendency to interact with chaperones, it seems appropriate to suggest that one prime reason for these interactions is to prevent amyloid formation. This has been explicitly stated in the case of the yeast prion Ure2 interacting with Hsp40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Lian1">[41]</xref>, α-synuclein interacting with Hsp70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Klucken1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Dedmon2">[42]</xref> and expanded polyQ regions interacting with both Hsp40 and Hsp70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Wacker1">[43]</xref>. Interestingly, in one case it has been suggested that the chaperone in fact does not interact with the IDP, but rather a prefibrillar intermediate, which may be a general phenomenon among other IDPs as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Dedmon2">[42]</xref>.</p><p>The final point that deserves closer inspection is the possible functional implications of chaperone binding of IDPs, given their lack of need of assistance for folding to a functional state. Two conceivable requirements are transport through physiological membranes and assistance for partner binding, i.e. assembly of complexes. In the case of transport through membranes, globular proteins partially unfold to a molten-globule state competent with translocation through the membrane and refold at the other side by the help of other chaperones. IDPs in principle do not need such help as they are already in a translocation-competent structural state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Dunker2">[44]</xref>. As to their binding to other partners, and the subsequent assembly of complexes, IDPs in fact often carry out their functions by protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa3">[5]</xref>, also shown by that the average disorder increases with increasing size of complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Hegyi1">[45]</xref>. However, IDPs have been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> to be very effective in binding, primarily manifested in binding to the partner at an increased speed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Tompa2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000017-Dafforn1">[46]</xref>. Their avoidance of chaperones, in general, may be related to this. When they do bind chaperones, however, the reason might be that <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly of large complexes may be slowed by non-specific interactions, in the case of which chaperone assistance may be of help.</p><p>In conclusion, we report here that IDPs in general require less assistance from chaperones than ordered, globular proteins. The explanation of this negative preference probably stems from the fact that IDPs are rather autonomous in folding, and require little assistance in function. Their liability for amyloid-type aggregation, and involvement in the assembly of large complexes, however, do explain their occasional binding to chaperones. Further studies may address at the level of individual proteins if this is in fact the case.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
