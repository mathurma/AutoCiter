<abstract>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is centrally involved in a wide range of cognitive functions and their impairment in psychiatric disorders. Yet, the computational principles that govern the dynamics of prefrontal neural networks, and link their physiological, biochemical and anatomical properties to cognitive functions, are not well understood. Computational models can help to bridge the gap between these different levels of description, provided they are sufficiently constrained by experimental data and capable of predicting key properties of the intact cortex. Here, we present a detailed network model of the prefrontal cortex, based on a simple computationally efficient single neuron model (simpAdEx), with all parameters derived from <italic>in vitro</italic> electrophysiological and anatomical data. Without additional tuning, this model could be shown to <italic>quantitatively</italic> reproduce a wide range of measures from <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings, to a degree where simulated and experimentally observed activities were statistically indistinguishable. These measures include spike train statistics, membrane potential fluctuations, local field potentials, and the transmission of transient stimulus information across layers. We further demonstrate that model predictions are robust against moderate changes in key parameters, and that synaptic heterogeneity is a crucial ingredient to the quantitative reproduction of <italic>in vivo</italic>-like electrophysiological behavior. Thus, we have produced a physiologically highly valid, in a quantitative sense, yet computationally efficient PFC network model, which helped to identify key properties underlying spike time dynamics as observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and can be harvested for in-depth investigation of the links between physiology and cognition.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Computational network models are an important tool for linking physiological and neuro-dynamical processes to cognition. However, harvesting network models for this purpose may less depend on how much biophysical detail is included, but more on how well the model can capture the <italic>functional</italic> network physiology. Here, we present the first network model of the prefrontal cortex which has not only its single neuron properties and anatomical layout tightly constrained by experimental data, but is also able to <italic>quantitatively</italic> reproduce a large range of spiking, field potential, and membrane voltage statistics obtained from <italic>in vivo</italic> data, without need of specific parameter tuning. It thus represents a novel computational tool for addressing questions about the neuro-dynamics of cognition in health and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key structure in higher-level cognitive functions, including working memory, rule and concept representation and behavioral flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref006">6</xref>], and has been linked to impairments of these functions in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref010">10</xref>] or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref011">11</xref>]. Our understanding of the computational and dynamic mechanisms underlying these cognitive functions, their neuromodulation, and their aberrations in psychiatric disorders, is still very limited, however.</p>
<p>Computational network models are a highly valuable tool for driving forward such an understanding, as data from many different levels of experimental analysis can be integrated into a coherent picture. With respect to psychiatric conditions, it is of particular importance that models incorporate sufficient biological detail and exhibit physiological validity in order to serve as explanatory tools. Psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia are characterized by a multitude of abnormalities in diverse cellular and synaptic properties, transmitter systems, and neuromodulatory input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref010">10</xref>]. Moreover, pharmacological treatment options target the neurochemical and physiological level, yet they are supposed to change functionality at the behavioral and cognitive level. It is thus crucial to gain insight into the explanatory links between behavioral functions and the underlying neurobiological “hardware”, a task that requires sufficient physiological detail in the model specification, in particular realistic assumptions about anatomical structure and cell type diversity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the physiological validity of a computational model ought to be reflected in the degree to which it can reproduce and predict detailed aspects of the neural activity observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. That is, from a statistical perspective, one may define a good, physiologically valid model as one that accurately (i.e., quantitatively) captures distributions compiled from the electrophysiological activity (spiking, field potentials, membrane voltages) produced by networks <italic>in vivo</italic>, but not necessarily as one that captures every detail of membrane biophysics or receptor kinetics. In our perception, such requirements are currently not met even by sophisticated cortical network models which do include a lot of biophysical detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref014">14</xref>], as these are often only loosely compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> data or test only specific aspects of those.</p>
<p>In this work, we present a computational network model of the PFC which has high physiological validity and predictivity both at the single-neuron- (<italic>in vitro</italic>) and at the network- (<italic>in vivo</italic>) level, yet is still simple enough to be computationally tractable. Its anatomical structure, neural, and synaptic properties are completely derived from the experimental literature and our own experimental data. The activity of the network is compared with a range of statistics derived from <italic>in vivo</italic> data, including spike trains, local field potentials, and membrane potential fluctuations. The model turns out to reproduce these data <italic>quantitatively</italic>, and also exhibits robustness with respect to moderate changes in parameters.</p>

<title>Key features of the prefrontal cortex model</title>
<p>The network model introduced in Materials and Methods aims to combine computational tractability with physiological validity. This balance is achieved by embedding a simple, reduced two-dimensional single neuron model into a realistic network architecture that is derived from the experimental literature. All model parameters were directly estimated from our own <italic>in vitro</italic> data and the experimental literature (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and Methods</xref> for details), and no specific parameter tuning was necessary to bring the network model closer to <italic>in vivo</italic>-like behavior.</p>
<p>At the single-cell level, the network is based on an approximation (simpAdEx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref015">15</xref>]) to the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model (AdEx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref016">16</xref>]) which yields closed-form expressions for instantaneous and steady-state firing rates, thus allowing for fast and fully automatized fitting to f-I and V-I curves from physiologically recorded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We had shown previously that this cell model is able to accurately predict spike times of recorded neurons driven by <italic>in vivo</italic>-like fluctuating currents not used for model fitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref015">15</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and, like the full AdEx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref017">17</xref>], can generate a wide range of spike patterns. <italic>In vitro</italic> recordings from ∼200 L2/3 and L5 pyramidal cells, fast-spiking and bitufted interneurons from the medial PFC of adult rodents were used to generate a distribution of model cells that reflects the diversity of neurons in the real PFC (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). The resulting model parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004930.t001">Table 1</xref>) follow broad distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), mostly of Gaussian shape, with the exception of Δ<sub><italic>T</italic></sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>w</italic></sub> which are best described by a Gamma distribution, and <italic>b</italic> which follows an exponential distribution (red curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g001">Fig 1C</xref> indicate distributions from which model parameters were drawn).</p>

<title>Reproduction of <italic>in vivo</italic> activity</title>
<p>To assess whether the network model can reproduce the dynamics of real prefrontal neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared measures computed from the model with those from electrophysiological data, as well as with a number of findings from the literature. Unless otherwise stated, we simulate a single column with 1000 neurons and apply a constant DC current of 250 pA to all pyramidal cells and 200 pA to all interneurons. These currents are the only parameters that are not directly obtained from experimental data. As discussed below, appropriate values for these currents were derived by inferring from lumped-population input simulations the amount of current produced by a network of realistic size, set up with the very same structure as the explicitly modeled network.</p>
<p><bold>Spike-train statistics.</bold> All experimentally recorded spike trains (kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Lapish, Indiana University Purdue University, Indianapolis, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref040">40</xref>] for details) were first segregated into statistically stationary segments to yield estimates of spike train statistics that reflect <italic>in vivo</italic> baseline activity, free from task-related responses (not modeled here) or other potential confounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref041">41</xref>]. For consistency, the same procedure was applied to the simulated spike trains, although, strictly, these were stationary by simulation setup. From all jointly stationary segments, the mean 〈ISI〉, coefficient of variation C<sub><italic>V</italic></sub>, and autocorrelation function of the inter-spike intervals (ISIs) were computed for each individual spike train, as well as the zero-lag cross-correlation CC(0) between pairs of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> data show very low zero-lag cross-correlations between neuron pairs (2.4 ⋅ 10<sup>−4</sup> ± 2.5, mean ± SD) and C<sub><italic>V</italic></sub> s near one (1.04 ± 0.33), consistent with the proposal of an “asynchronous-irregular” (AI) state of cortical dynamics (although the correlations theoretically proposed for the AI state are usually even at least one order of magnitude larger than obtained here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref042">42</xref>]). The average single-cell ISIs follow a monotonically decreasing distribution with a mean comparable in size to the standard deviation (570 ± 610 ms), but with a heavy tail that is better described by a log-normal or beta-2 distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref043">43</xref>] rather than an exponential distribution. The autocorrelation function shows a rapid decay with small negative flanks (half-width at half maximum: 10.1 ± 1.1 ms, minimum: 64.6 ± 69.9 ms, mean ± SD).</p>
<p>Without further tuning of network parameters beyond their derivation from slice-physiological and anatomical data, all these <italic>in vivo</italic> statistics are well reproduced by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests did not find notable differences between experimental and simulated distributions in any of the statistics (C<sub><italic>V</italic></sub> : p = 0.26, KS(29) = 0.28; mean ISI: p = 0.4, KS(29) = 0.23; CC: p = 0.4, KS(29) = 0.24), indicating that simulated distributions were not statistically distinguishable from the experimental ones. The asynchronous- irregular firing with low rates is also seen in the raster plot of spike times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Low fraction of spiking neurons and layer-dependent firing rates.</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g003">Fig 3B</xref> reveals a relatively low fraction of spiking pyramidal cells in both layers—only 22% of the cells emitted more than 10 spikes during the 30s of simulated time, which will be used as the definition of “spiking neurons” throughout the paper, in line with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref046">46</xref>]. Comparing the neural and synaptic parameters of those neurons which fire at a sufficiently high rate (&gt; 0.33 Hz) and those which do not (≤ 0.33 Hz), we find that only the rheobase (and the cell parameters that contribute to it) differs between the two populations: Spiking neurons have rheobases at the lower end of the distribution (42.9 ± 2.1 pA), compared to 69.0 ± 1.6 pA for non-spiking neurons (mean ± SEM; p = 3.5 ⋅ 10<sup>−20</sup>, t(997) = 9.4, two-sided t-test), some of them even firing spontaneously (called “generator neurons” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref047">47</xref>]).</p>
<p>While neurons firing at very low rates may go undetected using extracellular single-unit recordings, recording techniques that are less biased toward spiking neurons, such as calcium imaging or <italic>in vivo</italic> patch-clamp, often reveal a large fraction of neurons that are mostly silent (“dark matter theory” of neuroscience, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref046">46</xref>]). Consistent with these results, the fraction of neurons with more than 10 spikes rarely exceeded 40% in simulations with <italic>in vivo</italic>-like firing patterns (see section “Admissible and realistic range of input currents” below). This can be explained by the way the neurons are activated: While most neurons receive a background current above their rheobase, the high firing rates of the interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) lead to an average membrane potential in the pyramidal cells below the firing threshold (mean difference: -17.3mV, range: -37.2 to -2.2mV for the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g003">Fig 3</xref>) that is occasionally kicked above threshold by random fluctuations. This means that the firing rate is mostly determined by the amplitude of the fluctuations of the membrane potential (see below for statistics). These results are qualitatively conserved across the range of input currents for which the overlap between experimental and simulated distributions is reasonably high.</p>
<p><bold>Membrane potential and local field potential statistics.</bold> In addition to the spike data, we also compared the membrane potential statistics and LFP signals between simulation and experiments. For the simulated network, we observed a broad range of membrane potential fluctuations (after removing spike events; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; 3.28 ± 0.72 mV, mean ± SD; range between 0.72 mV and 11.23 mV). We compared this distribution of standard deviations with those from <italic>in vivo</italic> patch-clamp recordings from 10 putative pyramidal cells during up-states in anesthetized adult rodent PFC (kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Hahn, Central Institute of Mental Health and BCCN Heidelberg-Mannheim). The simulated distribution is less than one SEM away from the average of the experimental distribution (pooled over all data sets) for most bins, and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and Methods</xref>) does not show a significant difference (p = 0.45, KS(29) = 0.23).

<p>The local field potential (LFP) in the model was estimated as the sum of all synaptic currents (allowing excitatory and inhibitory currents to partially cancel). This is a reasonable approximation to the standard model of the LFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref050">50</xref>] under the assumption that all neurons are confined in a small volume of cortical space. We computed the power spectral density of this model-derived signal and of the LFP signals obtained from the <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Up to a constant offset (that has been removed in the figure), the spectrum of the simulated LFP is less than one SEM away from the average estimated from the experimental recordings (from awake, behaving animals, also provided by Dr. Christopher Lapish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref040">40</xref>]) at most of the frequencies. Both spectra follow a 1/<italic>f</italic> power law for frequencies below 60 Hz and change their scaling behavior for higher frequencies, consistent with LFP spectra described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref053">53</xref>] (the fluctuations in the simulated curve are stochastic in nature, i.e. there is no systematic deviation from the 1/<italic>f</italic> behavior across different simulations). For frequencies beyond 60 Hz, the experimental spectrum is well described by a 1/<italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup> power law, while the simulated one rather follows a 1/<italic>f</italic><sup>3</sup> relation. Both scaling behaviors have been reported in the literature (1/<italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref054">54</xref>], 1/<italic>f</italic><sup>3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref051">51</xref>]), and the difference may result from the simplifications made in the computation of the simulated LFP, e.g. neglecting the spatial integration of currents in extracellular space or the contribution of active currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p><bold>Transient information transfer and the role of neuronal heterogeneity.</bold> We next examined how neurons in L2/3 and L5 would respond to a simple stimulus simulated by a brief series of spikes at high rate (250 spikes within 5 ms) from a virtual (not explicitly simulated) “input population” connected to 10% of the pyramidal cells in L2/3 (cf. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004930.t003">Table 3</xref>). The stimulus induces a number of spikes in L2/3, and with a short delay also in L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The delays (L2/3: 8.9 ± 1.1 ms; L5: 17.7 ± 1.2 ms, mean ± SD) are similar to values that have been reported in the literature (e.g. 3.4 ± 0.5 ms in L2/3 and 16.6 ± 1.2 ms in L5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref055">55</xref>]). Note that these delays are significantly longer than the fixed synaptic delays (below 2 ms, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and Methods</xref>) and arise from the dynamics of the neurons and the kinetics of the synapses (c.f. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref056">56</xref>]). For a sufficiently strong stimulus (e.g. 500 spikes within 5 ms), the neurons in L2/3 show a brief period (100–150 ms) of persistent activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>The transmission of transient stimuli between layers crucially depends on the heterogeneity of the neuronal parameters. With a 80% reduction in the variance of all parameter distributions (but no change in the means), the stimulus only elicits a response in L2/3, but is not transmitted to the output layer L5 anymore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Indeed, L2/3 activity is almost independent of neuronal variability, whereas the number of spikes in L5 systematically decreases as the standard deviation of neuronal parameters is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>To further examine the transmission dynamics, we reproduced an <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment with suppressed inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref057">57</xref>] which showed that input in L2/3 resulted in an epileptiform spread of activation across the whole network under this condition, whereas the same input in L5 did not. We mimicked this setup by reducing the inhibitory synaptic weights in the network to 30% of their original values and inducing a strong stimulus (see above) in each of the two layers, while varying the peak conductance <italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub> of the synaptic connection between the mimicked Poisson input population and the network. For moderate connection strengths (<italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub> = 2), only a fraction of the network responds, and the number of spikes elicited by the network is much larger if the stimulus is injected in L2/3 (404 ± 116, mean ± SD) compared to a stimulus in L5 (118 ± 33). Higher connection strengths (<italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub> = 20) reliably drive the network into an “epileptic state” (transient high-rate response from all neurons in the network) for a stimulus in L2/3. In contrast, this state was never reached for an input in L5, consistent with the experimental results in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref057">57</xref>].</p>

This condition is fulfilled in our model as long as L2/3 receives less or the same input as L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>To estimate which range of <italic>I</italic> values could be realistically assumed, we tested whether a substantially larger network than the 1000-neuron-network simulated here would produce mean synaptic currents that are large enough to self-sustain <italic>in vivo</italic>-like activity (i.e. within the blackly circumscribed regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In this case, the activity in the large network and the small network (the latter driven by the currents from the larger one) would be indistinguishable, and the <italic>in vivo</italic>-like activity would be supported by the larger network. We increased the size of the network either by changing the density of neurons or by adding input from nearby columns (see “Estimation of background currents” in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows the mean synaptic current into pyramidal cells and interneurons in L2/3 and L5 that would result from the reduced equivalent-population input models described in Materials and Methods if the network size was varied through the number of columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) or the density of neurons within columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, both figures showing currents averaged over the values of the other independent variable, i.e. neural density or number of columns, respectively).

Note that it is sufficient that one of the two layers receives a current above the lower bound, as it will push the other layer into the right regime by cross-layer synaptic connections. The upper bound, on the other hand, may not be exceeded by either of the two layers, as this would push the other layer beyond its upper bound as well. It is apparent that these conditions are fulfilled already for (spatially) relatively small networks (∼ 5 columns), and currents saturate as network size grows further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). By increasing the neuron density, on the other hand, the input currents increase monotonically over a wide range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, averaged over all column numbers ≥ 5).

<p>Apart from the mean, we also analyzed how the distribution of the synaptic peak conductances affected <italic>in vivo</italic>-like behavior by either reducing the variability or drawing them from a normal rather than a log-normal distribution (conserving mean and standard deviation). Reducing the variability of the synaptic weights increased the mismatch between empirical and simulated distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, gray line). Surprisingly, just changing the form of the underlying distribution from log-normal to normal, without changing its mean or standard deviation, had a similarly strong effect as a pronounced reduction in standard deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, black line), so both the variability as well as the functional form of the synaptic conductance distribution are crucial for reproducing spiking dynamics as observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Without the long tail of the log-normal distribution, the network activity becomes much more synchronized (CC(0): 0.017 ± 0.006, mean ± SD) and exhibits strong bursts (C<sub><italic>V</italic></sub> : 1.81 ± 0.09, mean ± SD), while mean firing rates are not much affected (〈ISI〉: 420 ± 558 ms, mean ± SD).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We presented a model of the prefrontal cortex which is entirely defined by electrophysiological and anatomical data, and is capable of reproducing a wide range of <italic>in vivo</italic> statistics, including properties of single spike trains and pairwise correlations, the power spectrum of the local field potential and the variability of the membrane potential. Importantly, this reproduction did not require specific tuning of model parameters towards <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior. In fact, variation of the synaptic parameters shows that the ability of the network to show <italic>in vivo</italic>-like behavior is robust against considerable changes. In particular, it is possible to increase or decrease the synaptic weights by up to 50% of their original value without significant changes in the prediction performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). This keeps the model flexible to synaptic plasticity, i.e. the weights can be modified by task-related learning rules without changing the global activity of the network. The only variable that was not tightly constrained by <italic>in vitro</italic> data, the external input currents, showed a wide range of admissible values, within a range that would be produced by a network supposedly large enough to self-sustain activity. Despite the high biological validity, the model remains simple enough to allow for efficient simulation, due to the combination of a simple, but versatile neuron model and a complex network structure. To our knowledge, no other biophysical model currently exists that is as tightly constrained by the specific neuronal and synaptic properties of the prefrontal cortex and systematically compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> data as the one presented here.</p>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Relation to other network models</title>
<p>The current model has a strong focus on its tight connection to data. Many existing network models of the neocortex are based on neurobiological findings as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref063">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref065">65</xref>], but the present model differs from them in two respects: The strict way in which the <italic>in vitro</italic> data is used to fix or systematically infer every detail of the model, and, more importantly, the quantitative test of the model’s validity on a wide range of <italic>in vivo</italic> findings. Recently, a few studies have also moved in this direction. Fisher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref066">66</xref>] proposed a model for the short-term memory circuit in the oculo-motor system of the adult goldfish. They fitted the model simultaneously to a range of anatomical, physiological and behavioral data. This approach gives a coherent picture of this particularly well-defined non-cortical system. Furthermore, Potjans and Diesmann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref027">27</xref>] proposed a model of a sensory cortex network where the connection probabilities are thoroughly derived from in vitro studies. While the neuron parameters are generic and homogeneous, their focus is on the precise laminar and horizontal organization of the synaptic connections. They compare the results of their simulations with the baseline firing rates and flow of transient information through the different layers <italic>in vivo</italic>. These comparisons to experimental data are qualitative in character, as it is the case for most existing large-scale models of cortical networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref067">67</xref>]. However, a few recent studies also made statistical comparisons on partial aspects of physiological data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref068">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref069">69</xref>]. It would be interesting to assess these models on a wider range of <italic>in vivo</italic> data as we proposed here, to see which degree of biological detail is sufficient to predict their key properties.</p>
<p>An important simplification made in the present model is the reduction to two laminar components, leaving out layer 4 and 6 as well as the long-range fiber bundles and interneurons in layer 1. While layer 4 is missing in rodent PFC, layer 6 is only weakly connected to the other layers in our reference connectivity maps, which are based on the motor cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref070">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref071">71</xref>]. Thus, its inclusion in the network should not have a major impact on the results shown here. This is probably different in sensory networks, where layer 6 strongly interacts with both pyramidal cells and interneurons in layer 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref072">72</xref>].</p>

<title>The relevance of synaptic and cellular heterogeneity</title>
<p>The model exhibits a low fraction of spiking neurons, consistent with results from recording methods such as calcium imaging, which are not biased towards high firing rates (“dark matter theory” of neuroscience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref046">46</xref>]). As described above, this may partly result from the variance-driven firing of the neurons: The membrane potential is on average well below the spiking threshold, but large fluctuations still lead to occasional spiking. The size of the fluctuations and the low-rate, Poisson-like firing (C<sub><italic>V</italic></sub> ≈ 1) of the neurons is consistent with the high-conductance state theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref048">48</xref>] and balanced-state theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref073">73</xref>]. We note that the irregular and highly asynchronous firing of the neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref074">74</xref>] observed here is a generic property of the network that simply emerged from its parametrization through <italic>in vitro</italic> and anatomical findings.</p>
<p>There are two main determinants of the high-fluctuation regime of the model: First, variability in the membrane potential requires variability in the synaptic parameters and in particular, the fat tail of the log-normal distribution of the synaptic weights. Second, the range between the firing threshold <italic>V</italic><sub>up</sub> and the GABA<sub>A</sub> reversal potential <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004930.e010"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004930.e010g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004930.e010" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M10"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>E</mml:mi> <mml:mtext>rev</mml:mtext> <mml:mtext>GABA</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> must be sufficiently large, because below <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004930.e011"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004930.e011g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004930.e011" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M11"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>E</mml:mi> <mml:mtext>rev</mml:mtext> <mml:mtext>GABA</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, all synaptic currents depolarize the cell, so the dynamical range for a balanced, variance-driven state is constrained between these two values.</p>
<p>Using the multivariate distributions of neuron parameters obtained from our <italic>in vitro</italic> recordings, we also observed that decreased cellular heterogeneity has a profound effect on the processing of transient stimuli. It prevents the transmission of stimulus-induced activity from L2/3 to L5. This phenomenon can be understood if one considers the rheobase distribution: Reduced heterogeneity removes those neurons that originally had a very low or even negative rheobase. These are the ones which are highly susceptible to even small inputs and form a small but significant fraction of L5 neurons that were activated by the transient synaptic input from the L2/3 cells. Given that L5 provides the majority of output to other brain areas, impaired transfer of stimuli to this layer may lead to major impairments in information processing.</p>
<p>Thus, apparently quite subtle changes in the distributional properties of synaptic and cellular parameters (not affecting their means) may lead to major changes in network dynamics and functional connectivity among columns or areas, effects that have been proposed to underlie major psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref009">9</xref>].</p>

<title>Self-sustained activity of the PFC</title>
<p>By varying the total input from a virtual population designed according to the same principles as the actually simulated network, we provided evidence that a larger network than the one actually simulated with anatomically realistic neuron densities should be capable of self-sustaining <italic>in vivo</italic>-like spiking modes. Although we did not demonstrate self-consistency in a strict sense, we have shown that the background currents into the smaller, simulated network needed to yield <italic>in vivo</italic>-like behavior are consistent with the range produced by a much larger network of anatomically reasonable size. For currents within the blackly delimited region of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, the spike train distributions are statistically indistinguishable from the <italic>in vivo</italic> statistics, and the background currents that would result from scaling up the simulated network to anatomically realistic size lie exactly within this regime. This analysis implies that <italic>in vivo</italic>-like activity can be self-sustained in a larger network with the same anatomical layout as explicitly simulated here, as it has been observed for instance in deafferented cortical slabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref075">75</xref>], while e.g. the thalamus or other sub-cortical structures may provide transient, stimulus-related input or modulate the overall activity of the network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref076">76</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, the currents produced by this procedure are much higher in L5 compared to L2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g007">Fig 7</xref>), as required for the much higher firing rates observed <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref027">27</xref>]. At first glance, this seems counterintuitive, as L2/3 neurons receive input from neighboring columns, while L5 neurons do not (see “Estimation of background currents” in Materials and Methods). However, L5 also receives strong inputs from L2/3, while the inverse projections are much weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Thus, once L2/3 neurons receive enough input from other columns to spike, they drive L5 much stronger than themselves.</p>
<p>In terms of space, input from just a few columns is sufficient to drive the network, as connectivity rapidly decays over the cortical extent. Nevertheless, a single column is not sufficient for driving the network because of the higher fraction of excitatory synapses in long-range connections and the more local connectivity of interneurons. This is consistent with recent experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref077">77</xref>] and earlier results from deafferented cortical slabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref075">75</xref>] (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref078">78</xref>]).</p>

<title>Possible applications</title>
<p>In this study, we have focused on the resting state of the network. However, it may also be used as a foundation for more functional investigations of cognition. For instance, the clusters of increased synaptic connectivity may serve as building blocks for cell assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref029">29</xref>] which can be used to represent behavioral rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref040">40</xref>] or transient stimuli that need to be kept in working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref064">64</xref>]. Moreover, the fast and fully automatized framework for fitting the neuron model to <italic>in vitro</italic> data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref015">15</xref>] opens a convenient way to test the network effects of genetic or pharmacological manipulations: Recordings from neurons that underwent such a manipulation can be used by the very same fitting procedure as employed for wildtype or control cells, resulting in different parameter sets that can be plugged into the network to assess their implications for network behavior. Likewise, this could be done for the synaptic parameters using paired recordings and recent methods to fit the parameters of short-term synaptic plasticity models to these data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref079">79</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, we have provided a prefrontal cortex network model here with single cells and synapses strictly parametrized through in vitro electrophysiological findings (no specific tuning or adjustment of synaptic currents to compensate for simulated network size), with realistic cellular and synaptic heterogeneity, and with a structural layout derived from anatomical data. We have then systematically compared the full network activity to a number of spiking and correlation statistics from <italic>in vivo</italic> multiple single cell recordings in awake rodents, as well as LFP data from these animals, and estimates of membrane potential fluctuations from in vivo patch-clamping. Our model is therefore highly validated at the <italic>in vivo</italic> physiological level, yet it is computationally efficient by virtue of its computationally comparatively simple single unit design. We therefore hope that this network model can serve as a valuable tool in the further study of how physiological and anatomical properties relate to cortical network dynamics, and ultimately cognition, and how alterations of these properties may give rise to symptoms observed in various psychiatric conditions.</p>

A spike is recorded whenever V crosses <italic>V</italic><sub>up</sub>, at which point the voltage is reset to <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> and spike-triggered adaptation is simulated by increasing <italic>w</italic> by a fixed amount <italic>b</italic>. The simpAdEx was derived from the full AdEx based on phase-plane considerations, effectively dissecting the dynamics into three different regimes (defined through their distance from the V-nullcline, see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1004930.e013">Eq 2</xref>), each of them approximated in a way that allows for closed-form expressions for the instantaneous and steady-state firing rates. This enables fast and efficient fitting of the model to f-I and I-V curves as commonly used to characterize the electrophysiological behavior of cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref015">15</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>We had shown previously that this model, although estimated from f-I and I-V curves only, can predict spike times under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like conditions with high accuracy from physiological recordings not used for model fitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref015">15</xref>]. Different from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref015">15</xref>], the upper voltage limit <italic>V</italic><sub>up</sub> was initially estimated from the inflection point of the voltage traces. This makes <italic>V</italic><sub>up</sub> an absolute firing threshold (as in the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron) and leaves <italic>V</italic><sub>th</sub> as a free parameter for the subthreshold dynamics, resulting in a shallower exponential rise to the spike, more akin to what would be expected from the action of persistent sodium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref081">81</xref>] or L-type calcium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref082">82</xref>].</p>
<p>We estimated neuron models for a large number of <italic>in vitro</italic> recordings from different cell types from the prefrontal cortex of rats and mice, namely layer 3 (n = 34) and layer 5 pyramidal cells (n = 108), fast-spiking (n = 32), and bitufted (n = 22) interneurons. Additionally, we extracted statistics (means and variances) about f-I curves and subthreshold dynamics of Martinotti cells from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref083">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref088">88</xref>], and used these to construct 100 sets of f-I and I-V curves drawn from Gaussian distributions instantiated by the empirically estimated parameters. For each data set drawn from these distributions, Martinotti cell models were estimated. The pool of estimated models for each cell type defines a multivariate parameter distribution for each type of neuron, from which the final parameter sets for the 1000 neurons used in the network simulations were drawn. This joint parameter distribution for each cell type was initially modeled as a multivariate Gaussian, where marginal distributions not of Gaussian shape (as estimated from the empirical data) were first Box-Cox-transformed to adhere with the Gaussian assumptions. In a second step, the Box-Cox transform was inverted to regain the non-Gaussian shape of the marginal distributions (red curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The mean values and standard deviations of all model parameters for the different cell types are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004930.t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p><bold>Network anatomy and connectivity.</bold> The network is divided into two laminar components, representing the superficial layers L2/3 and the deep layer L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004930.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The network also includes a horizontal organization into distinct columns which are typically about 300<italic>μm</italic> wide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref089">89</xref>], so the model is in principle suited to study information transfer between columns. For most part, however, the present analyses focuses on a single column which was found to be sufficient to reproduce <italic>in vivo</italic>-like resting-state activity, provided a source of constant external input (see below). The relative numbers of pyramidal cells and interneurons in each layer were taken from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref058">58</xref>] who studied the rat motor cortex, as such data are not available for the PFC. Following [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref058">58</xref>], 47% of all cells were modeled as L2/3 pyramidal cells (L2/3-E), 10.4% as L2/3 interneurons (L2/3-I), 38% as L5 pyramidal cells, and 4.6% as L5 interneurons. With regards to the specific types of interneurons and their distribution across layers, we followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref090">90</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref091">91</xref>] and defined local interneurons (IN-L) with projections within the same layer and column as fast-spiking cells, cross-layer interneurons (IN-CL) as bitufted cells, and far-reaching interneurons (IN-F) with projections both outside of their column and layer of origin as Martinotti cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref090">90</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004930.t001">Table 1</xref>). The cross-column cells (IN-CC) have been classified as large basket cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref090">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref092">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref093">93</xref>], with electrophysiological properties resembling those of pyramidal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref094">94</xref>]. Therefore, we used the same parameter distributions as for the pyramidal cells in the respective layer for this cell class. Markram et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref090">90</xref>] also estimated the relative numbers of different types of interneurons within each cortical layer. Together with the classification above, these data result in the full distribution of cell types summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004930.t002">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Neurons were randomly connected with distinct connection probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub>con</sub> for each pair of cell types as derived from a survey of about 40 studies, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref095">95</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref099">99</xref>], most of which are reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref022">22</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref027">27</xref>], except [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref025">25</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref026">26</xref>]. Most of them performed whole cell or dual sharp electrode recordings <italic>in vitro</italic> in various neocortical regions of rats and mice. We also included a few studies using monkeys, ferrets and cats, as there are more studies from PFC in these species and some parameters were not available in rodents. Connection probabilities were further adjusted jointly with the connection weights to match data from photostimulation experiments as explained in detail below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref070">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref101">101</xref>]. Pyramidal cells within the same layer form clusters of increased connection probability as defined by the “common neighbor rule” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref029">29</xref>] which states that the connection probability of two neurons increases linearly with the number of neurons they are both connected to. Furthermore, a fraction of 47% of the connections was specified as reciprocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref032">32</xref>], since the proportion of reciprocal connections was experimentally observed to be significantly higher than chance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref037">37</xref>]. For cross-column projections, connection probabilities exponentially decay with the distance from the column of origin. Data from rodent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref077">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref103">103</xref>] suggest a wide range of spatial decay constants. We use the median from these studies, which is 114<italic>μm</italic> for pyramidal cells and 95<italic>μm</italic> for interneurons.</p>
<p>Apart from the recurrent synaptic connections within the network, we also introduced <italic>constant</italic> background currents that are fed into all neurons and which differ in strength for pyramidal cells and interneurons in layer 2/3 and 5. Appropriate values for these four streams of background inputs were determined using reduced equivalent-population input models (see below). It is emphasized that there was no source of external noise fed into the network, i.e. the external inputs consisted of just constant (DC) currents. Thus, all variability observed in the network arises from its internal dynamics.</p>

<p>Distributions of peak conductances (“synaptic weights”) <italic>g</italic><sub>max</sub> for each cell population were derived in two steps. As the first step, initial estimates were obtained from the anatomical and electrophysiological literature (see above). Generally, peak conductances were adjusted such that they reproduced log-normal distributions of postsynaptic potential (PSP) amplitudes as reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref037">37</xref>] (means and standard deviations given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1004930.t003">Table 3</xref>). For excitatory synapses, only the AMPA conductances are specified this way, while NMDA conductances are given by 1.09 times the respective AMPA peak conductance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref039">39</xref>], with both AMPA and NMDA synapses activating after the same delay. For synaptic connections where peak conductances were not directly available from the surveyed literature, estimates were obtained in one of the following ways: 1) Missing estimates for specific interneuron types were replaced by estimates from other interneuron types where possible. 2) Missing estimates for inhibitory connections within one layer were replaced by those from another layer, rescaled such that they followed the same between-layer ratio as the excitatory inputs. 3) If only means but no standard deviations for the distribution of synaptic parameters were available, we used standard deviations from another layer scaled according to the ratio of the means between layers (missing values of connection probabilities or synaptic delays were estimated in the same way). Finally, for cross-column projections, synaptic weights were assumed to decay with the same exponential course (space constant of 114<italic>μm</italic> for pyramidal cells and 95<italic>μm</italic> for interneurons) as taken for the connection probabilities themselves (see above).</p>
<p>In a second step, since by far most of the studies cited above have been performed in sensory areas, data from laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref070">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref101">101</xref>] and genetically targeted photostimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref071">71</xref>] studies from motor cortex were used to obtain values closer to PFC. Specifically, all connection probabilities and synaptic weights were scaled such that the total input to each cell type would match the one observed experimentally in these studies.

<title>Estimation of background currents</title>
<p>The constant background currents <italic>I</italic> used in the simulations are assumed to replace missing synaptic input from the surrounding network not explicitly simulated. A network of sufficient size should be able to produce these amounts of current inherently (with physiologically realistic synaptic efficacies as used here) and thus self-sustain its <italic>in vivo</italic>-like activity. To test this idea, we computed the amount of current that is produced by a larger network <italic>N</italic> that is set up and connected exactly the same way as the actually simulated network <italic>n</italic> and compared it to the range of background currents that are required for <italic>in vivo</italic>-like activity. The currents <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> were modeled as the time-averaged synaptic currents that are elicited in a single neuron for each cell type (with the averaged cellular and synaptic parameters of all neurons of that type) in response to a bombardment of spikes drawn from a Poisson distribution that mimics a large number of input neurons, reflecting its input connectivity. For a Poisson input spike train with the same firing rate as in the original network, this yields the same synaptic current <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> as in the full simulation. Larger networks <italic>N</italic> are simulated by using a higher number of inputs, resulting in higher overall input spike rates. Because connection probabilities decay with distance between neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref089">89</xref>], we independently tested two ways to increase the number of input neurons in the network: By increasing its spatial size <italic>L</italic> (measured in number of columns <italic>N</italic><sub>C</sub>, each <italic>L</italic><sub>C</sub> = 300<italic>μm</italic> in diameter) or its within-column neuron density <italic>D</italic>. For cross-column input, we assumed a radial distribution of inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref089">89</xref>] and an exponential decay of connection probabilities with distance (<italic>l</italic><sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = 114<italic>μm</italic>, <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> = 95<italic>μm</italic>, see above). Only pyramidal cells in L2/3 as well as cross-column (IN-CC) and far-reaching (IN-F) interneurons project across columns. Specifically, the number of input neurons <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004930.e024"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004930.e024g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004930.e024" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M24"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi> <mml:mtext>syn</mml:mtext> <mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> projecting onto a neuron of cell type <italic>i</italic> is given by

The resulting background currents <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> are then computed independently for the four main cell types—pyramidal cells and interneurons in layer 2/3 and 5.</p>

<title>Analysis of simulated and <italic>in vivo</italic> data</title>
<p>Two <italic>in vivo</italic> data sets were used for comparison with simulation results (kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Lapish, Indiana University Purdue University, Indianapolis and Dr. Thomas Hahn, Central Institute of Mental Health and BCCN Heidelberg-Mannheim). For spike trains and local field potentials, extracellular multiple single-unit recordings were obtained from the rat’s anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) while they were performing an eight-arm radial maze task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref040">40</xref>]. Stationary periods (largely free from motor or sensory responses) were obtained from 381 units using a previously described stationarity-segmentation method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref041">41</xref>]. For the voltage traces, we used patch-clamp recordings from anaesthetized rodents (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref109">109</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref110">110</xref>] for details).</p>
<p>Spike trains, voltage traces and local field potentials from the network simulation and the <italic>in vivo</italic> data were analyzed the same way. For each model cell or recorded unit, mean and coefficient of variation (C<sub><italic>V</italic></sub>) of the interspike interval (ISI) distributions were computed. Autocorrelations of ISI series and the zero-lag cross-correlation CC(0) between ISIs from pairs of spike trains were computed as well according to the procedures described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref041">41</xref>] to correct for non-stationarities. All analyses were restricted to spike trains of at least 10 spikes to yield sensible estimates of single-cell statistics without cutting off too much of the low-rate tail from the distributions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Results</xref> section for a more empirical justification).</p>
<p>Similarity among simulated and experimentally obtained distributions was assessed by two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests, where test statistic <italic>D</italic><sub>KS</sub> is bounded between zero (complete overlap) and one (maximally dissimilar distributions). Underlying distributions were inferred through kernel-density estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004930.ref111">111</xref>] (implemented by the function “ksdensity” in MATLAB’s statistics toolbox). As KS test statistics may depend on sample size but different simulations vary in number of spikes, we limited the number of data points to a sufficiently low, common value (30), repeated KS tests with 100 random drawings, and report averages across obtained p values and KS statistics. The overall similarity of a simulation data set with the experimental spike data is quantified by conducting the test for the mean ISI, the C<sub><italic>V</italic></sub> and the CC(0) distributions, and reporting the minimal p or the maximal <italic>D</italic><sub>KS</sub> value of those three (i.e., the value associated with the largest difference between the compared distributions).</p>
<p>Finally, we visualize the statistical overlap of distributions by plotting shaded areas representing the SEM around the mean at each value of the experimental distributions, which are computed from the 100 bootstrap samples as indicated above.</p>
