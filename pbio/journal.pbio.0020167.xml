				<article-title>A Protein's Role in Progressive Renal Disease</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common pattern of renal injury, seen as both a primary disorder and as a consequence of underlying insults such as diabetes, HIV infection, and hypertension. Point mutations in theα-actinin-4 gene <italic>ACTN4</italic> cause an autosomal dominant form of human FSGS. We characterized the biological effect of these mutations by biochemical assays, cell-based studies, and the development of a new mouse model. We found that a fraction of the mutant protein forms large aggregates with a high sedimentation coefficient. Localization of mutant α-actinin-4 in transfected and injected cells, as well as in situ glomeruli, showed aggregates of the mutant protein. Video microscopy showed the mutant α-actinin-4 to be markedly less dynamic than the wild-type protein. We developed a “knockin” mouse model by replacing <italic>Actn4</italic> with a copy of the gene bearing an FSGS-associated point mutation. We used cells from these mice to show increased degradation of mutant α-actinin-4, mediated, at least in part, by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. We correlate these findings with studies of α-actinin-4 expression in human samples. “Knockin” mice with a disease-associated <italic>Actn4</italic> mutation develop a phenotype similar to that observed in humans. Comparison of the phenotype in wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous <italic>Actn4</italic> “knockin” and “knockout” mice, together with our in vitro data, suggests that the phenotypes in mice and humans involve both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mechanisms.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In humans, <italic>ACTN4</italic> mutations cause a form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kaplan1">Kaplan et al. 2000</xref>). This lesion, which describes a pattern of injury characterized by regions of sclerosis in some renal glomeruli, is a common finding in kidney disease from a wide range of primary disorders, including HIV infection, diabetes, and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Ichikawa1">Ichikawa and Fogo 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Somlo1">Somlo and Mundel 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>The four α-actinin genes encode highly homologous proteins that normally form approximately 100 kDa head-to-tail homodimers. While the best-defined function of α-actinin-4 is to cross-link and bundle actin filaments, α-actinins have been found to interact with a large and diverse set of other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Honda1">Honda et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Takada1">Takada and Beggs 2002</xref>). α-Actinin-2 and α-actinin-3 are located predominantly in the sarcomere, while α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 are widely expressed. In the human kidney, only α-actinin-4 expression is detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kaplan1">Kaplan et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Human <italic>ACTN4</italic>-associated FSGS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. By contrast, mice homozoygous for <italic>Actn4</italic> null alleles have glomerular disease, while heterozygous <italic>Actn4</italic> null mice have no readily apparent phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kos1">Kos et al. 2003</xref>). Transgenic mice harboring a mutant <italic>Actn4</italic> targeted to the glomerular podocyte have an FSGS-like lesion, although it is not clear whether this is due to the dominant effect of the mutant <italic>Actn4</italic> per se or to dysregulated <italic>Actn4</italic> expression in this cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Michaud1">Michaud et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>We previously showed that FSGS-associated <italic>ACTN4</italic> mutations increase the binding of α-actinin-4 to F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kaplan1">Kaplan et al. 2000</xref>). This was confirmed independently by different methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Michaud1">Michaud et al. 2003</xref>). However, the relationship between altered actin binding and disease is unclear. Of particular interest is whether the human disease is due to a gain-of-function effect of mutations on protein function or due to a partial loss of normal function. We therefore performed a series of experiments to help us understand the biological consequences of mutations in <italic>ACTN4</italic>. We demonstrate here that mutant α-actinins exhibit altered structural characteristics, localize abnormally, and have significantly diminished half-life. By developing a mouse model harboring a disease-associated point mutation, we confirm the pathologic effect of this mutation on glomerular function. Our results suggest that the major effects of <italic>Actn4</italic> mutations are protein misfolding and accelerated degradation, leading to loss of normal α-actinin-4 function, α-actinin-4 aggregation, and progressive kidney disease.</p>

        <title>Mutant α-Actinin-4 Conformation</title>
        <p>In overlay assays (performed as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Chan1">Chan et al. 1998</xref>; data not shown), mutant α-actinin-4 is able to bind both mutant and wild-type α-actinin-4. Since mutant α-actinin-4 polypeptides are able to interact, we used sucrose gradient assays to examine whether the mutant α-actinin-4 dimerizes normally. We produced radiolabeled in vitro translated wild-type and mutant α-actinin-4 (K228E, T232I, R235P) and subjected these proteins to centrifugation in 5%–20% sucrose gradients. We found that all of the wild-type α-actinin-4 eluted as a single peak, as expected. By contrast, approximately 80% mutant α-actinin-4 eluted at the same peak as in wild-type, while about 20% of the mutant protein eluted much more quickly and peaked in the first fraction. We then used a 10%–40% sucrose gradient in an attempt to better characterize this small peak. Again, in multiple experiments, about 20% of the mutant α-actinins eluted in the first fractions. α-Actinin has a sedimentation coefficient of 6.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Feramisco1">Feramisco and Burridge 1980</xref>), and both wild-type and the majority (approximately 80%) of mutant actinins migrated in this position. However, a significant fraction of mutant α-actinin-4 had a sedimentation coefficient equal to or greater than 11.3, the sedimentation coefficient of catalase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This extremely high sedimentation rate suggests either the presence of large α-actinin-4 multimers or the existence of large (and perhaps insoluble) aggregates. When these experiments were performed in the presence of a large excess of cold α-actinin, this rapidly sedimenting fraction of mutant α-actinin was unchanged, showing that the abnormally conformed mutant α-actinin-4 could not be shifted back into normally sedimenting mutant/wild-type heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

Results shown are for wild-type α-actinin-4, K228E α-actinin-4, and K228E α-actinin-4 after addition of excess cold (wild-type) α-actinin. A fraction of the mutant α-actinin-4 sedimented at least as quickly than the highest molecular weight marker, catalase, which has a sedimentation coefficient of 11.3. This was observed with all of the other mutants tested as well (data not shown), but never with labeled wild-type α-actinin-4. Addition of cold α-actinin did not alter the sedimentation pattern seen with the mutant form of α-actinin-4.</p>

        <title>α-Actinin-4 Behavior in Cells</title>
        <p>We performed both transfection and nuclear injection studies in a conditionally immortalized podocyte cell line to look at the effect of disease-associated mutations on α-actinin-4 localization. Irrespective of the method used to express the mutant α-actinins in cells, we found altered localization of the mutants. Consistent with the altered sedimentation observed in vitro, mutant α-actinin-4 formed localized aggregates when expressed in cells. We used video microscopy to view the fate of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)–α-actinin-4 after nuclear injection of the cDNA. Similar results were observed in three independent sets of experiments. In each experiment, 15–35 cells were microinjected in the nucleus with plasmid DNA; of these, five to ten cells showed signal at 4–6 h after injection. Consistently, the mutants behaved abnormally, were unevenly distributed in the cell cytoplasm, and were much less dynamic compared with the wild-type proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g002">Figure 2</xref>A; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Videos S1–S3</xref>). These findings were consistent with the indirect immunofluorescence (IF) studies performed in <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228/K228</sup> mice (see below).</p>

            <p>(A) Mutant and wild-type α-actinin-4 show different localization and dynamics when expressed in a conditionally immortalized differentiated mouse podocyte cell line. Differentiated podocytes were injected in the nucleus with equal concentrations of expression plasmid for GFP fusions of mutant and wild-type actinins. At 2–4 h after injections, cells were imaged and both phase and fluorescence images recorded as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4a1">Materials and Methods</xref>. To illustrate changes in distribution of the fluorescence signal, three fluorescence images each 1 min apart were overlaid as red, green, and blue panes. Areas of fluorescence that were the same in all panes show as white, while dynamic areas are indicated by the color. The top panel indicates the initial phase and overlain dynamic fluorescence images of wild-type α-actinin-4, while the bottom two panels illustrate characteristic results for mutants K228E and T232I at 3 min time intervals. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">See Videos S1–S3</xref>.)</p>
            <p>(B) Transfections in podocytes derived from mutant and wild-type mice. When transfected into conditionally immortalized podocytes of all three α-actinin-4 genotypes (+/+, K228E/+, or K228E/K228E), wild-type GFP–α-actinin-4 shows diffuse cytoskeletal localization. Mutant GFP–α-actinin-4 shows a similar alteration in localization when expressed in these three cells types.</p>

        <p>We transfected conditionally immortalized podocytes derived from <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/+</sup>, and <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/K228E</sup> mice with either wild-type GFP–α-actinin-4 or K228E mutant GFP–α-actinin-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The wild-type GFP–α-actinin-4 showed diffuse cytoplasmic localization in podocytes of all three genotypes. By contrast, mutant α-actinin-4 showed a similar aggregated appearance in all three cell types. This suggests the absence of a strong dominant effect of the mutant protein on the wild-type, as the endogenous K228E actinin does not alter the localization of the wild-type GFP-tagged protein.</p>
        <p>We developed α-actinin-4 “knockin” mice using the methods of homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Previously we developed an <italic>Actn4</italic> “knockout” mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kos1">Kos et al. 2003</xref>). As indicated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, mating these mice with germline <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mice produced offspring in which an intronic <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked neomycin resistance cassette had been excised. We bred these heterozygous mice (<italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/+</sup>) to generate litters with wild-type, heterozygous, and <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/K228E</sup> mice. We genotyped mice by testing for the presence or absence of an engineered silent EarI site as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kos1">Kos et al. 2003</xref>). The homozygous K228E mice, in contrast to the <italic>Actn4</italic>-deficient model, demonstrated normal levels of <italic>Actn4</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). RT-PCR and sequencing of the transcript confirmed that the K228E allele was in fact expressed in the homozoygous mice. However, in multiple tissues tested (kidney, lung, leukocytes, brain), as well as in fibroblasts derived from these mice, α-actinin-4 protein expression was markedly reduced, with an approximately 90% reduction in protein expression in <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/K228E</sup> homozygotes and an approximately 50% reduction in <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/+</sup> heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Lymphocytes from a human subject heterozygous for one <italic>ACTN4</italic> K2228E mutation similarly had an approximately 50% reduction in the amount of α-actinin-4 compared with related and unrelated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g003">Figure 3</xref>E).</p>

            <p>(A) Targeting construct. As we have described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kos1">Kos et al. 2003</xref>), targeting initially resulted in a “knockout” allele, due to disruption of normal transcription, presumably by the intronic <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked neomycin resistance cassette. After breeding to <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic mice, this neomycin cassette was excised, as illustrated.</p>

        <title>α-Actinin-4 Degradation</title>
        <p>We observed decreased mutant α-actinin expression in an immortalized knockin mouse fibroblast homozygous for the <italic>Actn4</italic> K228E mutation, compared with the wild-type fibroblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). To help determine the fate of the mutant α-actinin, we performed pulse and pulse–chase studies. We labeled <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/K228E</sup> fibroblasts, <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/+</sup> fibroblasts, and wild-type fibroblasts with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine for different timepoints (pulse) following incubation in methionine-deficient medium. In order to trace the newly synthesized <sup>35</sup>S-labeled α-actinins, we used an α-actinin-4-specific antibody to immunoprecipitate α-actinin-4 from the cell lysates. (We detected no α-actinin-4 in the cell pellets.) As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, we found that at any timepoint, there was less mutant than wild-type α-actinin-4 synthesized. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, the rates of increase in labeled α-actinin-4 were similar, suggesting that the low expression level of mutant α-actinin-4 is not due to a defect in synthesis. We then labeled the mutant and wild-type fibroblasts with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine for 3 hours (pulse), following incubation in methionine-deficient media, and then incubated the cells in media containing excess cold methionine (chase) for different timepoints to follow the degradation of the newly synthesized α-actinin-4. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g004">4</xref>D, mutant α-actinin-4 degraded at a much faster rate than did the wild-type protein. The estimated half-life of mutant α-actinin-4 is about 15 h, while the half-life of the wild-type α-actinin-4 is much greater than 30 h. Three replicate experiments gave the same results. The rapid degradation of the K228E mutant α-actinin-4 is reversed by treatment with lactacystin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g004">Figure 4</xref>E), indicating that this mutant form of α-actinin-4 is degraded through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have previously shown that dominantly inherited point mutations in the α-actinin-4 gene <italic>ACTN4</italic> cause a form of human glomerular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kaplan1">Kaplan et al. 2000</xref>). We have also shown that mice lacking α-actinin-4 expression develop a severe glomerular lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kos1">Kos et al. 2003</xref>). Here we have further explored the biochemical and cell biologic alterations caused by disease-associated α-actinin-4 mutations.</p>
      <p>Human α-actinin-4-associated FSGS is characterized by a dominant pattern of inheritance. Affected individuals typically develop disease in adulthood. Some individuals develop progressive renal failure, others develop moderate proteinuria, while a few show no evidence of kidney dysfunction well into adulthood. This contrasts with other recently elucidated inherited disorders of the podocyte caused by mutations in the slit-diaphragm proteins nephrin and podocin, where disease typically presents in the neonatal period or in childhood and follows a recessive pattern of inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kestila1">Kestila et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Boute1">Boute et al. 2000</xref>). Mice lacking slit-diaphragm proteins CD2AP and Neph-1 similarly present with very early-onset nephrosis (Shih et al. 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Donoviel1">Donoviel et al. 2001</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to the typically diffuse podocyte foot process effacement observed in kidney biopsies from individuals with these recessive forms of disease, individuals with <italic>ACTN4</italic>-associated FSGS have focal podocyte abnormalities, nonnephrotic levels of proteinuria, and slowly progressive adult-onset disease leading to significant (and often end-stage) renal failure in adulthood.</p>
      <p>These phenotypic differences themselves suggest a different mechanism of disease from what is observed with slit-diaphragm protein defects. Our earlier experiments suggested that mutant α-actinin-4 binds actin filaments more strongly than wild-type α-actinin-4 in vitro. However, this may reflect a propensity toward oligomerization rather than increased F-actin binding per se. The finding that the mutant α-actinin-4 forms aggregates with greatly decreased half-life suggests two possible models to explain the human (and mouse) disease. One model would explain the development of podocyte damage as a direct effect of protein aggregation and the toxic effects of such aggregation, as is observed in several degenerative neurologic conditions such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Horwich1">Horwich 2002</xref>). The second model explains the disease as a loss-of-function disease, reflecting the increased rate of mutant α-actinin-4 degradation.</p>
      <p>We do not regard these models as mutually exclusive. In fact, we believe it likely that the development of disease may involve both of these mechanisms. It is interesting to note that α-actinin-4-mediated kidney disease bears some similarities to the adult-onset neurodegenerative condition Huntington disease. In Huntington disease, dominant mutations that lead to expanded polyglutamine tracts cause neurodegeneration. The mutant huntingtin protein is misfolded and forms aggregates that are thought to have dominant, toxic effects on neuron function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Bucciantini1">Bucciantini et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Bates1">Bates 2003</xref>). These proteins also play critical and nonredundant roles in the relevant organs: analogous to what we have observed in α-actinin-4-deficient mice, mice with reduced huntingtin expression show abnormal brain development and perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-White1">White et al. 1997</xref>).</p>
      <p>In contrast to humans, mice heterozygous for α-actinin-4 mutations do not have overt disease. We suspect that in humans, over a timespan of several decades, the combination of decreased α-actinin-4 expression and the formation of aggregates ultimately proves toxic. We suggest that the relatively short life of mice compared with that of humans may be the major explanation of this difference. Not all humans carrying disease-associated mutations develop clinical disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kaplan1">Kaplan et al. 2000</xref>). Disease, in both human and murine heterozygotes, likely requires a “second hit,” either in the strict genetic sense of a second mutation in the relevant cell type or a “physiologic hit,” such as elevated blood pressure, renal toxin exposure, or vascular disease, to name three examples. We suspect that renal stresses will uncover deleterious renal phenotypes in heterozygous mice, similar to the disease observed in humans. With aging and gradual accumulation of aggregates in the terminally differentiated podocyte, we believe that humans with <italic>ACTN4</italic> mutations become increasingly susceptible to minor insults. We note also that mice, unlike humans, express α-actinin-1 in podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kos1">Kos et al. 2003</xref>). This may help stabilize mutant α-actinin-4 or may produce more redundancy, giving the mouse glomerulus greater protection to perturbations in this pathway.</p>
      <p>We note that, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020167-g007">Figure 7</xref>, the appearance of α-actinin-4 is more punctate in the kidney from a K228E heterozygous individual than a control, consistent with the existence of aggregates in heterozygous humans. This effect, however, is subtle, and is consistent with the lack of any detectable renal phenotype in several humans who carry disease-associated <italic>ACTN4</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kaplan1">Kaplan et al. 2000</xref>). Although the number of <italic>ACTN4</italic> mutations we have found is small, we have not detected any human disease-associated <italic>ACTN4</italic> mutations to date that lead to premature termination, suggesting that simple haploinsufficiency may not by itself cause disease (our unpublished data).</p>

Even at more advanced ages, the <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/+</sup> mice appear normal. By contrast, we observe clear glomerular phenotypes in both <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>–/–</sup> and <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/K228E</sup> mice. Our genetic observations are consistent with our biochemical observations. Specifically, we believe that α-actinin-4 mutations lead to a reduction in normal α-actinin-4 activity and to protein aggregation and that glomerular phenotypes reflect both loss of normal α-actinin-4 function and toxic effects of aggregated α-actinin-4. While the disease observed in homozygous <italic>Actn4</italic><sup>K228E/K228E</sup> mice may primarily reflect loss of function resulting from rapid α-actinin-4 degradation, heterozygous humans may show slow development of podocyte damage from the effects of α-actinin-4 aggregation.</p>
      <p>Is alteration of α-actinin-4 expression or conformation a cause or a mediator of secondary forms of kidney disease? These seem plausible hypotheses given the data presented here, together with results from other investigators showing alterations in α-actinin-4 levels in association with proteinuria in certain animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Shirato1">Shirato et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Smoyer1">Smoyer et al. 1997</xref>). This suggests that physiologic processes that alter the expression, conformation, or both of this (and other) cytoskeletal proteins, either at the protein or the transcript level, might be amenable to interventions that restore normal patterns of protein expression.</p>

Cells were maintained at 37°C using a modified Harvard Apparatus (Hopkinton, Massachusetts, United States) microscope incubator mounted on a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) Diaphot 300 inverted microscope. Images were collected using a Princeton Instruments MicroMax 1300Y cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, Arizona, United States). Excitation and emission wavelengths were controlled using dichroic and bandbass filters from Omega Optical (Brattleboro, Vermont, United States) and a Sutter Instrument (Novato, California, United States) Lambda 10–2 filter wheel image acquisition. Device control and postacquisition processing were done with Isee Imaging Software (Inovision Corporation Raleigh, North Carolina, United States).</p>

          <title>Actinin dynamics display</title>
          <p>To display the changes in GFP–actinin distribution over time, images collected at 1 min intervals were used sequentially as red, green, and blue channels of a RGB composite image. Areas of signal that did not change have equal representation in each of the channels and generate a white signal in the final image. Areas of signal that did change on a minute-to-minute basis are indicated by either a red, green, or blue hue. For example, a region rich in red would indicate an signal present in the first image, but absent in the two sequential images, indicative of a withdraw or loss of signal in that region.</p>

          <title>Generation of K228E mutant mice</title>
          <p>Previously, we described the development of a mouse model lacking detectable <italic>Actn4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kos1">Kos et al. 2003</xref>). These mice harbor a germline mutation in exon 8 of <italic>Actn4</italic> encoding a K228E substitution, as well as an intronic <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked neomycin resistance cassette. We bred these mice to transgenic mice with germline expression of <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase (129-TgN(Prm-Cre)58Og; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, United States). We verified excision of the neomycin resistance cassette by PCR. Heterozygous mice were crossed to obtain mice homozygous for the K228E substitution. Mice were genotyped for the K228E as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kos1">Kos et al. 2003</xref>). We used Trizol reagent to extract RNA from kidneys for RT-PCR and for Northern blot analysis.</p>

          <p>Freshly harvested kidneys were fixed in Bouin's solution. H &amp; E and PAS staining were performed using standard methodology. Electron microscopy was performed after fixation in Karnovsky's media using standard diagnostic protocols. For the electron micrographs, all of the glomeruli imaged were from as deep into the renal cortex as possible. Indirect IF studies were performed using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020167-Kos1">Kos et al. 2003</xref>). Urine microalbumin was assessed by a reader blinded to mouse genotype using albumin dipsticks (Albustix, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). BUN and creatinine measurements were performed at the clinical chemistry laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital.</p>
