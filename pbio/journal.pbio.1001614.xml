<p>Analysis of a transcriptional regulatory network in a fungal pathogen reveals that four interdependent transcription factors respond to human body temperature to trigger changes in cell shape and virulence gene expression.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Survival at host temperature is a critical trait for pathogenic microbes of humans. Thermally dimorphic fungal pathogens, including <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, are soil fungi that undergo dramatic changes in cell shape and virulence gene expression in response to host temperature. How these organisms link changes in temperature to both morphologic development and expression of virulence traits is unknown. Here we elucidate a temperature-responsive transcriptional network in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>, which switches from a filamentous form in the environment to a pathogenic yeast form at body temperature. The circuit is driven by three highly conserved factors, Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3, that are required for yeast-phase growth at 37°C. Ryp factors belong to distinct families of proteins that control developmental transitions in fungi: Ryp1 is a member of the WOPR family of transcription factors, and Ryp2 and Ryp3 are both members of the Velvet family of proteins whose molecular function is unknown. Here we provide the first evidence that these WOPR and Velvet proteins interact, and that Velvet proteins associate with DNA to drive gene expression. Using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, we determine that Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 associate with a large common set of genomic loci that includes known virulence genes, indicating that the Ryp factors directly control genes required for pathogenicity in addition to their role in regulating cell morphology. We further dissect the Ryp regulatory circuit by determining that a fourth transcription factor, which we name Ryp4, is required for yeast-phase growth and gene expression, associates with DNA, and displays interdependent regulation with Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3. Finally, we define <italic>cis</italic>-acting motifs that recruit the Ryp factors to their interwoven network of temperature-responsive target genes. Taken together, our results reveal a positive feedback circuit that directs a broad transcriptional switch between environmental and pathogenic states in response to temperature.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Microbial pathogens of humans display the ability to thrive at host temperature. So-called “thermally dimorphic” fungal pathogens, which include <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, are a class of soil fungi that upon being inhaled into the human lung, undergo dramatic changes in cell shape and virulence gene expression in response to host temperature. The ability of these pathogens to cause disease is exquisitely coupled to temperature response. Here we elucidate the regulatory network that governs the ability of <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> to switch from a filamentous form in the soil environment to a pathogenic yeast form at body temperature. The circuit is driven by three transcription regulators (Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3) that control yeast-phase growth. We show that these factors, which include two highly conserved proteins of the Velvet family of unknown function, bind to specific regulatory DNA elements and directly regulate expression of virulence genes. We identify and characterize Ryp4, a fourth regulator of this pathway, and define DNA motifs that recruit these transcription factors to their temperature-responsive target genes. Our results provide a molecular understanding of how changes in cell shape are linked to expression of virulence genes in thermally dimorphic fungi.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells adapt to their environment by responding to specific environmental stimuli such as light, temperature, and nutrients. For microbial pathogens, mammalian body temperature can signal the induction of pathways required for host colonization and pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Konkel1">[1]</xref>. One such group of organisms is the thermally dimorphic fungal pathogens, which include <italic>Coccidioides</italic>, <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic>, <italic>Blastomyces</italic>, and <italic>Histoplasma</italic> species. These evolutionarily related fungi are notable among fungal pathogens in that they all cause disease in healthy individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Brown1">[2]</xref>. Each of these organisms grows in a mold form in the soil, forming long, connected filaments that produce vegetative spores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Klein1">[3]</xref>. When the soil is aerosolized, filamentous cells and spores can be inhaled by mammalian hosts and converted into a parasitic form within the host lung. Conversion entails a dramatic change in cell shape to a budding yeast form for the majority of these pathogens, as well as the transcriptional induction of virulence genes required to cause disease in the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Klein1">[3]</xref>. For all thermally dimorphic fungi, host temperature is the key signal that triggers this developmental switch, but little is known about the coordinated induction of morphologic changes and virulence gene expression by temperature.</p>
<p><italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, which is endemic to the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys of the United States, can cause life-threatening respiratory and/or systemic disease (histoplasmosis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Brown1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Kauffman1">[4]</xref>. It is estimated that up to 25,000 people develop life-threatening infections in endemic regions each year, with at least 10-fold more mild or asymptomatic infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Brown1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Kauffman1">[4]</xref>. Although the pathogen propagates as spores and in a filamentous form in the environment, <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> is found almost exclusively in the yeast form within mammalian hosts. Despite the prevalence of <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> and its threat to human health, we have a limited understanding of the transcriptional regulatory network that governs pathogenic yeast-phase growth. Previously, we identified three regulators, Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3, and showed that they are required for yeast-phase growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Webster1">[6]</xref>. Whereas wild-type cells grow in the yeast form at 37°C, <italic>ryp1</italic>, <italic>ryp2</italic>, and <italic>ryp3</italic> mutants grow constitutively in the filamentous form independent of temperature. In wild-type cells, <italic>RYP1</italic>, <italic>RYP2</italic>, and <italic>RYP3</italic> transcripts and proteins accumulate preferentially at 37°C and each Ryp protein is required for the wild-type expression levels of the others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Webster1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>RYP1</italic> encodes a fungal-specific transcriptional regulator that is required for modifying the transcriptional program of <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> in response to temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>. Ryp1 belongs to a conserved family of fungal proteins that regulate cellular differentiation in response to environmental signals. The best-studied member of this family of proteins is Wor1, which was identified as a master transcriptional regulator that controls a morphological switch required for mating in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Huang1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Zordan1">[9]</xref>. In the model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the Ryp1 ortholog, Mit1, is required for a morphologic switch that occurs under nutrient limitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Cain1">[10]</xref>. Ryp1 orthologs in the plant pathogens <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (Sge1), <italic>Fusarium graminerium</italic> (Fgp1), and <italic>Botrytis cinerae</italic> (Reg1) are required for full pathogenicity and conidiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Jonkers1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Michielse2">[13]</xref>. All of these observations signify the importance of Ryp1 orthologs for transduction of environmental cues to regulate cell morphology and virulence. Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that Wor1 contains a DNA-binding domain that is conserved throughout the WOPR (<underline>Wo</underline>r1, <underline>P</underline>ac2, <underline>R</underline>yp1) family of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Lohse1">[14]</xref>, suggesting that these regulators respond to specific signals by triggering a transcriptional program.</p>
<p>In contrast, Ryp2 and Ryp3 belong to the Velvet family of regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Webster1">[6]</xref>, whose molecular function is unknown. This family is typified by Velvet A (VeA), which was initially characterized as a regulator of sexual spore production in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Kim1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Kafer1">[16]</xref>, but is now known to also regulate secondary metabolism and development in many fungi including <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, <italic>Fusarium</italic> species, <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, and <italic>Acremonium chrysogenum</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Bayram1">[17]</xref>). In <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>, the VeA ortholog Vea1 has a role in sexual development but is dispensable for yeast-phase growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-LaskowskiPeak1">[18]</xref>. Additionally, many fungi have multiple Velvet family proteins that collaborate to serve regulatory functions. For example, in <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, three Velvet family proteins (the Ryp2 ortholog VosA, the Ryp3 ortholog VelB, and VeA itself) act together to regulate asexual and sexual development and secondary metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Bayram2">[19]</xref>. Notably, since Velvet family proteins do not contain canonical DNA binding domains or other domains of known function, their mechanistic role in regulation of developmental processes is unclear.</p>
<p>As noted above, both WOPR and Velvet family proteins are widely distributed among fungi, although the Hemiascomycetes, including <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic> species, lack Velvet family proteins. Since both families of proteins are required for yeast-phase growth in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>, we explored if and how these two distinct classes of fungal regulators work together to govern temperature-responsive traits by dissecting the Ryp regulatory network in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>. To this end, we performed whole-genome transcriptional profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to determine the shared and unique roles of Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 in regulating yeast-phase growth. We show that 96% of yeast-phase enriched transcripts are dependent on Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 for their enhanced expression in response to temperature, whereas 66% of filamentous-phase enriched transcripts require Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 to prevent their inappropriate expression at 37°C. We demonstrate that all three Ryp factors physically interact and associate with the upstream regions of a core set of target genes, including those required for yeast-phase growth and virulence. Additionally, we identify a fourth transcriptional regulator, Ryp4, to be a component of the Ryp regulatory network required for temperature-responsive yeast-phase growth. Finally, the identification of two distinct <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory sequences that are bound and utilized by Ryp proteins provides the first evidence that highly conserved Velvet family proteins can directly bind to DNA and activate gene expression using a unique <italic>cis</italic>-acting element. Overall, our results provide a molecular understanding of how regulation of cell morphology and virulence gene expression is coordinated in response to temperature in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>.</p>

<title>Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 Are Required for the Expression of Genes Associated With Growth in the Pathogenic Yeast Form</title>
<p>Our previous studies showed that there are marked differences in the transcriptional profiles of wild-type yeast-form cells grown at 37°C and filamentous cells grown at room temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Hwang1">[20]</xref>. Cells lacking <italic>RYP1</italic>, <italic>RYP2</italic>, or <italic>RYP3</italic> grow constitutively as filaments independent of temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Webster1">[6]</xref>, and Ryp1 is required for the expression of the majority of the transcripts enriched during yeast-phase growth at 37°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Nguyen1">[5]</xref>. Here we sought to understand whether Ryp2 and Ryp3 are also involved in regulating expression of genes required for yeast-phase growth. To this end, we performed whole-genome expression profiling experiments comparing the transcriptional profiles of multiple biological replicates of <italic>ryp1</italic>, <italic>ryp2</italic>, <italic>ryp3</italic> mutants and wild-type strains grown at room temperature (RT) and 37°C. We identified 388 genes with significantly increased transcript levels and 376 genes with significantly decreased transcript levels in wild-type yeast cells grown at 37°C compared to wild-type filaments grown at RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s008">Table S1</xref>). These gene sets were referred to as yeast-phase–specific (YPS) and filamentous-phase–specific (FPS) genes, respectively.</p>

<p>Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that YPS genes were enriched in terms such as cell cycle regulation, chromosome segregation, and DNA recombination, all of which are characteristics of metabolically active, budding yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, FPS genes were enriched in terms such as cell wall, extracellular region, response to oxidative stress, hydrolase, and lipase activity, consistent with the idea that filamentous cells have a distinct cell wall structure and produce enzymes related to saprophytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, YPS genes included the previously identified virulence genes of <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>: Genes encoding for calcium-binding protein 1 (<italic>CBP1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Sebghati1">[21]</xref>, yeast-phase specific protein 3 (<italic>YPS3</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Bohse1">[22]</xref>, super-oxide dismutase 3 (<italic>SOD3</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Youseff1">[23]</xref>, alpha-(1,4)-amylase (<italic>AMY1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Marion1">[24]</xref>, and heat-shock protein 90 (<italic>HSP82</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Edwards1">[25]</xref> were among the most differentially regulated YPS genes. Furthermore, YPS genes included M antigen/catalase B (<italic>CATB</italic>), which has been shown to display yeast-specific expression in the <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> strain used here and encodes a secreted catalase that may help cope with oxidative stress in the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Holbrook1">[26]</xref>. Transcript levels of these virulence genes were significantly down-regulated in <italic>ryp</italic> mutants, showing that Ryp factors are important for expression of virulence genes in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> in response to temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Global comparison of the gene expression profile of wild-type cells to that of each <italic>ryp</italic> mutant revealed that the <italic>ryp</italic> mutants had a strongly diminished transcriptional response to temperature. The transcriptome of each <italic>ryp</italic> mutant grown at 37°C strongly resembled the transcriptome of wild-type cells grown at RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Additionally, transcriptional profiles of the individual <italic>ryp</italic> mutants were strikingly similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that they may act in the same temperature-responsive pathway. Transcript levels of the overwhelming majority of the YPS genes (96%) were decreased (&gt;1.5-fold) in <italic>ryp</italic> mutants at 37°C, indicating that Ryp proteins were required for their wild-type expression level. Similarly, the Ryp proteins were required to prevent inappropriate expression of the majority of the FPS genes at host temperature: Transcript levels of 66% of the FPS genes were increased (&gt;1.5-fold) in <italic>ryp</italic> mutants compared to the wild-type strain at 37°C. These results showed that Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 are master regulators required for the appropriate temperature-responsive transcriptional program in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>.</p>
<p>As observed previously, our set of YPS genes included <italic>RYP1</italic>, <italic>RYP2</italic>, and <italic>RYP3</italic>, and each of the <italic>RYPs</italic> depended on the other two for its temperature-regulated expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Webster1">[6]</xref>. Since <italic>RYP</italic> transcript levels are low at RT under laboratory conditions, we expected that the Ryp proteins might play only a minor role in regulation of gene expression at RT. Consistent with this idea, the Ryp factors are not required for the normal transcriptional profile of filaments grown at RT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). In sum, our transcriptional profiling experiments revealed that Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 are major regulators of yeast-phase growth at 37°C; are dispensable for filamentous-phase growth at RT; can either facilitate or repress transcript accumulation; and may act in the same pathway to regulate gene expression.</p>

<title>Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 Associate with DNA Throughout the Genome</title>
<p>Previous studies reported that Wor1, an ortholog of Ryp1, associates with DNA at hundreds of intergenic regions to regulate gene expression in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Lohse1">[14]</xref>. However, genome-wide DNA associations of Ryp1 have not been investigated in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>. Additionally, Velvet family proteins do not contain a known DNA-binding domain and the ability of Ryp2 and Ryp3 orthologs to associate with DNA has not been explored. To establish the genome-wide association of Ryp factors with DNA and to distinguish between direct and indirect targets in the Ryp regulons, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-chip) using antibodies raised against Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3. Experiments were performed in either wild-type yeast cells grown at 37°C, or in the respective <italic>ryp</italic> mutant control grown at 37°C. We observed 361 ChIP events throughout the genome of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s002">Figure S2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s009">Table S2</xref>). Most notably, there were a large number of targets (182 loci) that associated with at least two Ryp factors, and 94 loci associated with all three Ryp factors, suggesting that Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 can act together to regulate gene expression. Interestingly, only Ryp1 had a large number of events (161 loci) that were not shared with other Ryp factors, indicating that Ryp1 has a broader regulon than Ryp2 and Ryp3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Further characterization of the ChIP events revealed that intergenic lengths corresponding to Ryp association events were significantly longer than the average intergenic length in the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). A similar trend was noted previously for Wor1 association events in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, but its biological significance is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Tuch1">[27]</xref>.

<p>A network view of ChIP targets was generated using Cytoscape. Each large circle is composed of individual closed circles, each of which represents an individual target gene. YPS genes are colored in yellow, and FPS genes are colored in blue. The distribution of YPS and FPS genes in each category of ChIP targets (e.g., shared targets of Ryp1, 2, and 3) was compared to the whole genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s005">Figure S5</xref>) using the Wilcoxon test. The <italic>p</italic> values obtained in this analysis are shown.

<p>To map the genomic regions defined by ChIP-chip events to specific genes, we used a validated gene set that was defined previously based on gene expression and sequence conservation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Voorhies1">[28]</xref> and identified genes that lie downstream of each ChIP event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s009">Table S2</xref>). Our first notable observation was that Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 showed interdependent regulation. All three Ryp factors associated upstream of <italic>RYP1</italic> and <italic>RYP2</italic>, although none of the three factors associated upstream of <italic>RYP3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s009">Table S2</xref>). To further explore the relationship between DNA association and gene expression, we overlaid gene expression data onto all ChIP-chip target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Targets that associated only with Ryp1 were not significantly enriched in YPS genes compared to the whole genome. In contrast, we observed significant enrichment of YPS genes for DNA-association events that were shared by Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3, as well as events that were shared only by Ryp1 and Ryp3. This analysis revealed a correlation between shared association events and genes whose enhanced expression was induced by growth at host temperature. Strikingly, many of the known virulence genes (<italic>CBP1</italic>, <italic>SOD3</italic>, and <italic>YPS3</italic>) were shared Ryp targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s009">Table S2</xref>). These results indicate that the known core virulence genes are direct targets of the Ryp factors, and suggest that the remaining shared Ryp targets are interesting candidates for potential virulence factors. Notably, shared Ryp targets and all Ryp targets were enriched for predicted signal peptides (<italic>p</italic> = 1.4e-06 and <italic>p</italic> = 2.0e-06, respectively) compared to the whole genome, which is of interest since secreted proteins produced by intracellular pathogens are often involved in virulence.</p>

<title>Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 Regulate a Fourth Transcriptional Regulator, Ryp4, Which Is Required for Growth in the Pathogenic Yeast Form</title>
<p>In addition to virulence factors, the shared Ryp targets included a single transcription factor with a known DNA-binding domain and yeast-phase–specific expression. The corresponding gene, designated HISTO_DM.Contig933.eannot.1650.final_new, encodes a Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> zinc binuclear cluster domain protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). As shown by microarray and qRT-PCR experiments, transcript levels of this gene were 6.5- to 35-fold higher at 37°C compared to RT, indicating that it displays enhanced expression in wild-type yeast-phase cells as compared to filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s008">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 were required for expression of this gene at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s008">Table S1</xref>). We investigated the possibility that, similar to the <italic>RYP</italic> factors, HISTO_DM.Contig933.eannot.1650.final_new is essential for growth in the pathogenic yeast form. Since targeted gene disruption in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> is inefficient, we generated knockdown strains using RNA interference (RNAi). We were able to deplete mRNA levels of HISTO_DM.Contig933.eannot.1650.final_new by 72%–88% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Additionally, these RNAi strains were unable to grow in the yeast form and instead exhibited robust filamentous growth at 37°C, similar to the <italic>ryp</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Loss of RNAi plasmids resulted in reversion to yeast-phase growth at 37°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), indicating that the phenotype was dependent on the RNAi plasmids. Thus, we renamed this gene <italic>RYP4</italic> (<underline>R</underline>equired for <underline>Y</underline>east-<underline>P</underline>hase Growth). Although these morphologic studies revealed that <italic>ryp4</italic> knockdown strains appeared drastically different from wild-type cells grown at 37°C, they were indistinguishable from wild-type filaments in appearance when grown at RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>BLASTP analysis indicated that the closest homolog of Ryp4 is FacB of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (E-value &lt;1e-180), and phylogenetic analysis (see Materials and Methods) revealed that Ryp4 is an ortholog of FacB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s003">Figure S3B and S3C</xref>).

<title>Ryp4 Is a Regulator of Genes Involved in Morphology and Virulence</title>
<p>To assess whether Ryp4 is required for normal yeast-phase–specific gene expression in response to temperature, we performed whole-genome expression profiling experiments using wild-type cells carrying control vectors (hereafter referred to as wild-type) and <italic>ryp1</italic>, <italic>ryp2</italic>, <italic>ryp3</italic>, and <italic>ryp4</italic> knockdown strains grown either at RT or at 37°C. In contrast to the gene expression studies performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g001">Figure 1</xref> using insertion mutants, here we used <italic>ryp1</italic>, <italic>ryp2</italic>, and <italic>ryp3</italic> knockdown strains to match the <italic>ryp4</italic> knockdown strain (hereafter referred to as “mutant”). Statistical analyses revealed 441 YPS genes and 362 FPS genes in this dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s010">Table S3</xref>). Similar to the aforementioned microarray dataset, regulation of the expression of the majority of YPS and FPS genes was dependent on Ryp1, Ryp2, Ryp3, and Ryp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s010">Table S3</xref>). Notably, the transcriptional profile of the <italic>ryp4</italic> mutant was very similar to that of <italic>ryp1</italic>, <italic>ryp2</italic>, and <italic>ryp3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). The transcriptional profile of <italic>ryp4</italic> mutants grown at 37°C was similar to that of wild-type filamentous cells grown at RT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Additionally, both microarray analysis and qRT-PCR experiments showed that Ryp4 was required for the expression of <italic>RYP1</italic>, <italic>RYP2</italic>, and <italic>RYP3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s003">Figure S3D</xref>).

Overall, these results indicate that Ryp4, like Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3, is critical for temperature-regulated gene expression at 37°C.</p>
<p>To further explore the Ryp4 regulon, we performed ChIP-chip experiments in wild-type cells using antibodies raised against Ryp4. We identified 61 Ryp4 association events that occur in cells grown at 37°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s009">Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, the majority (74%) of these events were shared with other Ryp factors, indicating that Ryp4 acts in concert with other Ryp factors to regulate gene expression. Next, we identified genes downstream of each Ryp4 ChIP event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s009">Table S2</xref>), and visualized these data together with Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s005">Figure S5</xref>). We found that about a quarter (26%) of Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 shared targets were also occupied by Ryp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Furthermore, these common Ryp targets were even more significantly enriched for YPS genes than targets that were shared by Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3, but not Ryp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). These YPS genes included core regulators of morphology (<italic>RYP1</italic>, <italic>RYP2</italic>, and <italic>RYP4</italic>) and genes required for virulence (<italic>CBP1</italic> and <italic>SOD3</italic>), further emphasizing the role of Ryp4 as a fundamental regulator of yeast-phase growth and an essential component of the temperature-responsive Ryp regulatory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g003">Figures 3A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g004">4A</xref>).</p>

To test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments in wild-type cells grown at 37°C using each of the Ryp antibodies. Of all possible co-IP combinations, we were able to reliably and reproducibly detect Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 in Ryp2 and Ryp3 IPs, indicating that at least these three Ryp proteins physically interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>In addition to these biochemical experiments, we used yeast two-hybrid experiments to assess Ryp1–Ryp2–Ryp3–Ryp4 interactions. We observed a reciprocal interaction between Ryp2 and Ryp3, confirming the co-IP results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Our results also revealed that the Ryp2 N-terminus (which contains the Velvet domain), but not the Ryp2 C-terminus, is required for interaction with Ryp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). On the other hand, the Ryp2 C-terminus mediates Ryp2–Ryp2 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). No interactions were observed for Ryp4 (unpublished data). Despite numerous attempts at transformation and analysis of multiple clones, we were unable to express Ryp1 bait or prey fusion proteins in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used for yeast-two-hybrid analysis.

<title>Ryp ChIP Events Are Enriched for Distinct <italic>cis</italic>-Acting Regulatory Sequences</title>
<p>To further explore the Ryp regulatory network, we analyzed each Ryp ChIP event set for the nonrandom occurrence of conserved <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory sequences (hereafter referred to as DNA motifs). This <italic>de novo</italic> motif analysis was especially interesting for Ryp2 and Ryp3, since there has been no prior evidence that Velvet family proteins associate with DNA, and thus, no DNA motifs have been identified for Velvet family proteins. Through the analysis of Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 ChIP events, we identified two distinct DNA motifs, which we named Motif A and Motif B. Specifically, different variants of Motifs A and B were identified through the analysis of Ryp ChIP events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s011">Table S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s006">Figure S6A and S6B</xref>), and motifs that had the best predictive characteristics using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-MacIsaac1">[34]</xref>) were selected as Motif A and Motif B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Motif A is very similar to the Wor1 motif, which was previously identified using biochemical approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Lohse1">[14]</xref>. Identification of Motif A by a completely independent approach validates our ChIP-chip data and our motif analysis pipeline.

ROC plots using all ChIP events from each of the regulators demonstrated that Motif A and B were enriched in the entire ChIP set. Shuffled versions of each motif resulted in loss of specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Of note, motif-finding algorithms did not yield a meaningful result for Ryp4, which is not surprising as the complex binding sites of zinc binuclear cluster transcriptional regulators can be difficult to predict <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-MacPherson1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Todd3">[36]</xref>.</p>

<p>Further analysis revealed that Motif A was associated with Ryp1 ChIP events, whereas Motif B was associated with Ryp2 and Ryp3 ChIP events: Motif A specificity was dependent only on the inclusion of Ryp1 ChIP events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s006">Figure S6C</xref>), whereas Motif B specificity was dependent only on the inclusion of Ryp2 and Ryp3 events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s006">Figure S6D</xref>). Furthermore, Motif A enrichment was similar in all Ryp1 targets regardless of whether they were shared targets with the other Ryp factors or whether they associated only with Ryp1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s006">Figure S6E</xref>).

<title>Ryp Factors Bind to Distinct DNA Sequences</title>
<p>Our motif analyses suggested that Ryp1 associates with DNA via Motif A, whereas Velvet family proteins (Ryp2 and Ryp3) associate with DNA via Motif B. To test whether Ryp1, Ryp2, or Ryp3 can directly bind to Motif A or Motif B, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The promoter region of the <italic>CBP1</italic> gene, which associates with the Ryp proteins by ChIP-chip and contains both Motif A and Motif B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), was used to design two distinct 60 bp probes encompassing either Motif A or Motif B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). His-tagged versions of Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 were synthesized in coupled <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and translation reactions and then subjected to purification. Additionally, it was already known that the N-terminus of <italic>C. albicans</italic> Wor1, which is highly homologous to the N-terminus of Ryp1, contains two globular domains that are sufficient to bind the Wor1 motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Lohse1">[14]</xref>. Therefore, we also synthesized and purified a His-tagged version of the N-terminus of Ryp1 (Ryp1(N), 1–267 aa) that harbors only the globular domains.</p>
<p>EMSA revealed that full-length Ryp1 binds directly to Motif A, whereas control extracts contained no binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). In analogy to Wor1, we also observed that Ryp1(N) binds directly to Motif A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). To explore the ability of Ryp2 and Ryp3 to bind Motif B, we performed mobility shift assays with either Velvet protein alone or with a combination of Ryp2 and Ryp3. Whereas mobility shift assays performed with either Ryp2 or Ryp3 showed no binding activity, addition of both of these Velvet proteins resulted in binding of the Motif B probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). All observed band shifts were diminished upon addition of unlabeled competitor probe into the binding reactions. Notably, these experiments provide the first evidence that Velvet family proteins bind DNA directly.</p>

<title>Ryp Factors Are Necessary and Sufficient to Drive Gene Expression Via Motifs A and B</title>
<p>Since Ryp1 is sufficient to bind Motif A and Ryp2–Ryp3 is sufficient to bind Motif B, we next used an <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptional activation assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Lohse1">[14]</xref> to explore whether each motif was sufficient to drive gene expression in a heterologous system when the appropriate Ryp proteins were expressed. We cloned a single copy of Motif A or B upstream of the UAS-less <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter fused to the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene. We introduced these reporter plasmids along with constructs expressing the Ryp proteins, either individually or in combination, into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and monitored β-galactosidase activity. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> provides an ideal heterologous expression system for our experiments, since the reporter strain we used lacks Ryp1 orthologs, and Velvet family proteins are not present in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>
<p>In the strains that contained the Motif A reporter construct, β-galactosidase activity was detected only when Ryp1 was heterologously expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This activity was severely diminished when the conserved residues of Motif A were mutated. Co-expression of Ryp2, Ryp3, or Ryp4 individually with Ryp1, or Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 together, did not lead to an increase in β-galactosidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). These results indicate that Ryp1 is necessary and sufficient to drive gene expression via Motif A. In contrast, in strains containing Motif B, β-galactosidase activity was detected only when Ryp2 and Ryp3 were expressed together, but not when Ryp2 or Ryp3 were expressed singly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This activity was also dependent on the conserved nucleotides of Motif B. Co-expression of Ryp1 or Ryp4 along with Ryp2 and Ryp3 did not enhance Ryp2-Ryp3–dependent β-galactosidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Additionally, even though the Ryp2 N-terminus (Ryp2(N)), which contains the Velvet domain, is sufficient to interact with Ryp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), co-expression of Ryp2(N) and Ryp3 was not sufficient to drive gene expression using Motif B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). For all these experiments, β-galactosidase activity was dependent on the presence of the appropriate motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s007">Figure S7A</xref>), but independent of motif orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001614.s007">Figure S7B and S7C</xref>). These results indicate that Ryp2 and Ryp3 together are necessary and sufficient to drive gene expression via Motif B and, taken together with the EMSA studies, provide the first evidence that Velvet proteins bind DNA via a conserved motif to direct transcriptional activation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cells have derived complex regulatory networks to reprogram their transcriptional response upon changes in the environment. In thermally dimorphic fungi, regulation of cell morphology and virulence traits is coupled: they respond to host temperature by altering their cell shape and inducing virulence gene expression. This study is the first elucidation of the transcriptional circuitry underlying this dramatic change in any of these organisms. In this article, we have shown that an interlocking network of transcription factors regulate each other and common target genes to trigger a transcriptional program that is required for cell shape changes and virulence gene expression in response to host temperature in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>.</p>
<p>Each of the Ryp transcription factors described here, including the newly discovered Ryp4, is absolutely required for the normal transcriptional profile of cells grown at 37°C. The structure of the corresponding transcription factor network is diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g008">Figure 8</xref>, which illustrates the connectivity between the four proteins required to program the switch from filamentous to yeast-form growth in response to temperature. Each Ryp factor is required for the expression of the others, and each associates upstream of the <italic>RYP1</italic>, <italic>RYP2</italic>, and <italic>RYP4</italic> genes—but none of the factors, including Ryp3 itself, associates upstream of the <italic>RYP3</italic> gene. Thus we propose that at 37°C, each of the factors acts in a positive-feedback loop to regulate itself and each of the others. The exception is Ryp3, which regulates the other factors but is only indirectly regulated by them and does not directly regulate itself. Perhaps the interlocking nature of the network promotes a robust response by amplifying and stabilizing the signal generated by increased temperature. Additionally, the absolute requirement for activation of all four Ryp factors may provide specificity by requiring a sustained increase in temperature (as experienced within a mammalian host) to trigger the appropriate developmental program. Moreover, the requirement for multiple factors may allow unknown host signals other than temperature to influence the transition from filaments to yeast-form cells. The nature of the molecular signal that induces an initial increase in Ryp expression in response to temperature is unknown, but others have identified a histidine kinase, <italic>DRK1</italic>, that is required for yeast-phase growth in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> and the related thermal dimorph <italic>Blastomyces dermatitidis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Nemecek1">[37]</xref>. A possible relationship between <italic>DRK1</italic> and regulation of Ryp factors has not been explored.</p>

<title>Ryp proteins are involved in a temperature-responsive complex transcriptional network.</title>
<p>A model for the temperature-responsive Ryp network is shown. ChIP-chip interactions are depicted by solid arrows and indirect regulation is depicted by a dashed arrow. All four Ryp proteins are expressed at increased levels at 37°C, require each of the others for their expression, and associate with the promoter regions of <italic>RYP1</italic>, <italic>RYP2</italic>, and <italic>RYP4</italic>. Even though none of the Ryp proteins associate with <italic>RYP3</italic> promoter, <italic>RYP3</italic> expression levels depend on the other Ryp proteins. <italic>De novo</italic> motif finding approaches and <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptional activation assays reveal that Ryp1 is necessary and sufficient to drive gene expression using Motif A, and Ryp2-Ryp3 co-expression is necessary and sufficient to drive gene expression using Motif B. We hypothesize that YPS gene expression in response to growth at host temperature can be achieved through many possible combinations of motifs and Ryp factor association. Three such scenarios are shown.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001614.g008" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Ryp factors are required both to promote transcription of genes with enhanced expression at 37°C and to prevent the inappropriate expression of filament-associated genes at this temperature. Transcriptional profiling of wild-type cells grown either at 37°C (in the yeast form) or at room temperature (in the filamentous form) yielded 764 genes (about 8.5% of the genome) that passed our criteria for differential expression in one of the two growth phases. Remarkably, 96% of YPS genes required each of the four Ryp proteins to achieve differential expression in response to temperature. The majority of this regulon is a consequence of indirect regulation by the Ryp factors, since only a fraction of YPS genes are downstream of Ryp association events. The most significant enrichment for YPS genes was observed for shared targets of multiple Ryp factors: about 21% of shared targets were YPS genes as opposed to 4% of the whole genome. Interestingly, Ryp association events that are unique to an individual Ryp factor, such as the large cohort of ChIP-chip events that associate only with Ryp1 and not the other three Ryp factors, showed no enrichment for YPS genes. Additionally, Ryp targets that were not YPS genes did not depend on Ryp factors for their expression under standard laboratory conditions. It is possible that Ryp factors are poised upstream of these genes to regulate their expression in response to environmental signals other than temperature, such as light intensity, nutrient availability or exposure to reactive radicals in the host.</p>
<p>Recruitment of the Ryp transcription factors to their direct targets is driven, at least in part, by DNA sequence motifs that are sufficient to recruit either Ryp1 (Motif A) or the Ryp2–Ryp3 complex (Motif B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Motif A, which is highly similar to the DNA motif that was defined for the Ryp1 ortholog Wor1, is enriched in Ryp1 targets, whereas Motif B is enriched in Ryp2 and Ryp3 targets. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g008">Figure 8</xref> illustrates the major categories of motif distribution for YPS gene regulatory regions that associate with Ryp factors. Interestingly, some YPS genes that contain only Motif A or only Motif B show association with Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3. Although there are several models that could explain this multifactorial association, we favor the idea that there are different subcomplexes of Ryp proteins in the cell. For example, we propose that Ryp1 associates with DNA directly via Motif A in the absence of Ryp2 and Ryp3, thereby accounting for the many Ryp1 ChIP-chip events that are not shared by the other Ryp factors. Supporting this model is the finding that Ryp1 is sufficient to drive gene expression via Motif A in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and the biochemical experiments that show that the Ryp1 ortholog Wor1 associates directly with DNA via a motif that is highly similar to Motif A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Lohse1">[14]</xref>. Alternatively, Ryp1 can be present in a complex with Ryp2 and Ryp3, and then could be recruited to the DNA either directly, via Motif A, or indirectly, via interaction of Ryp2–Ryp3 with Motif B. This model also predicts that Ryp2–Ryp3 can be recruited to the DNA either directly or via interaction with Ryp1. Interestingly, the existence of ChIP-chip targets that contain Motif A but associate only with Ryp1 and not with Ryp2–Ryp3 suggests that there is a genomic feature, such as chromosomal context for Motif A, that distinguishes the set of Ryp1-only targets from the shared targets. For example, perhaps chromosomal context causes the association of Ryp1 with Motif A in the shared targets to require nonspecific interactions of Ryp2–Ryp3 with the DNA. Interestingly, we identified a number of ChIP-chip targets that associate only with Ryp3, and found that these targets are enriched for Motif B. Since binding of Ryp3 to Motif B, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, requires the presence of Ryp2, it is possible that these orphan events are actually shared with Ryp2 but fall below our level of detection for Ryp2 association. Alternatively, Ryp3 might be recruited to these targets via association with one of the other two Velvet domain proteins in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>. Finally, the newly identified yeast-phase regulator Ryp4 seems to play no role in recognition of Motif A or Motif B, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, and is incapable of driving gene expression via these motifs in a heterologous transcriptional activation assay. Additionally, we did not observe any physical interactions between Ryp4 and other Ryp factors. Taken together, these observations suggest that a third <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element might recruit Ryp4 to its targets.</p>
<p>In this study, we provide the first evidence that Velvet family proteins such as Ryp2 and Ryp3 can bind DNA directly. This family of proteins is well studied in environmental fungi, fungal plant pathogens, and an opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans; however, although physical interactions between multiple Velvet family proteins have been defined, the molecular mechanism of Velvet family proteins in general is unknown. In addition to showing binding of Ryp2 and Ryp3 to the DNA via mobility shift assays, we show that Motif B is sufficient to drive gene expression in the model yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> when Ryp2 and Ryp3 are co-expressed. The N-terminus of Ryp2, which contains the Velvet domain, is required for Ryp2–Ryp3 interaction in the yeast two-hybrid assay, whereas the C-terminus of Ryp2 mediates multimerization of Ryp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In a previous study, the C-terminal region of the Ryp2 ortholog VosA was predicted to be a transcriptional activation domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Ni1">[38]</xref>. Since co-expression of the Ryp2 N-terminus with Ryp3 is not sufficient to activate gene expression through Motif B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001614-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), we conclude that the Ryp2 C-terminus is required for activation of gene expression in our <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> transcriptional activation assays. Whether a Ryp2 homodimer or multimer has a role in gene expression in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> or is important for the higher order formation of a Ryp complex remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting findings to arise from this network analysis is that the Ryp factors, which themselves are YPS genes that are required for morphology, directly regulate YPS genes that are required for pathogenesis (e.g., <italic>CBP1</italic>, <italic>SOD3</italic>, and <italic>YPS3</italic>). A hallmark of thermally dimorphic fungal pathogens is that temperature regulates cell shape and other factors required for pathogenesis. In the case of <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>, yeast-phase morphology is thought to be critical for the lifestyle of this fungus in the host, especially since replication of the fungus within host immune cells is likely to be incompatible with filamentous growth. Thus, Ryp factors catalyze both the cell shape change and the increased expression of known virulence factors, resulting in a molecular link between temperature and the expression of traits required to cause disease in a mammalian host. A link between morphology and virulence has been explored for many of the major human fungal pathogens, perhaps most extensively for <italic>C. albicans</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Thompson1">[39]</xref>). Unlike the thermally dimorphic fungi, which are found almost exclusively in a hyphal form in the soil and a yeast or spherule form in the host, <italic>C. albicans</italic> is present in multiple morphologies in the host, and filamentous cells are thought to play a major role in disease. We observed co-regulation of yeast-phase morphology and known virulence genes in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>. Similarly, numerous studies in <italic>C. albicans</italic> have observed that hyphal formation is coordinated with the expression of genes required for adhesion, host tissue invasion, antifungal drug resistance, and oxidative stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Thompson1">[39]</xref>, suggesting that a subset of fungal pathogens have evolved regulatory circuits that link virulence gene expression with morphologic changes. Notably, despite the importance of the yeast-to-hyphal transition in the infectivity of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, a systematic analysis of a large-scale <italic>C. albicans</italic> deletion library showed that morphology can be uncoupled from virulence. Although a large number of mutants were identified to have defects in both virulence and morphology, a sizeable number of mutants were defective for virulence despite maintaining normal morphologic responses <italic>in vitro</italic>, and some mutants displayed normal infectivity despite having substantial defects in morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Noble1">[40]</xref>. In contrast, the ability to differentiate into yeast-form cells is likely to be essential for the intracellular parasitism that is characteristic of <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> infection. Therefore, it may be the case that yeast-phase morphology is categorically linked to virulence in the thermally dimorphic fungal pathogens.</p>
<p>Finally, this work expands the rich history of elucidating fungal transcription circuits to understand regulatory networks in eukaryotic cells. Studies of fungal gene regulation continue to provide examples of novel DNA-binding domains, as was previously the case with the Ryp1 family of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Lohse1">[14]</xref>. In this study, we show association between DNA and two Velvet family proteins that lack known DNA-binding domains, now implicating this highly conserved protein family in direct gene regulation. The most interesting molecular implication of these data is that the Velvet domain could be a novel DNA binding domain. Additionally, this analysis reveals a fundamental example of transcriptional rewiring: although Ryp4 regulates acetate utilization genes in related fungi outside of the thermal dimorphs, in <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> its major role is to regulate the transcriptional response to temperature. As a result, the temperature-dependent circuit elucidated here demonstrates cooperation and regulation between three distinct families of transcription factors: WOPR, Velvet, and Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub>. Expression of each of the Ryp proteins has been wired to be absolutely dependent on all of the others, so strains that lack any of the regulators fail to undergo a developmental program in response to temperature. This network structure is interesting, in part because of the regulatory implications described above, but also because the relationship between orthologs of these transcription factors is not static throughout the fungal kingdom. For example, Hemiascomycetes have retained WOPR family members but lack Velvet family proteins. These phylogenetic differences provide an opportunity to study how regulatory circuits evolve. Finally, the role of the Ryp proteins in the life cycle of other thermally dimorphic fungi has not been examined. Elucidating the nature of this circuit in these related fungal pathogens will provide insight on the evolution of this temperature-responsive circuit.</p>

<title>Plasmid Loss Experiments</title>
<p>Four independent <italic>ryp4</italic> mutants generated with two different episomal RNAi plasmids (pSB30 and pSB31) were grown in HMM broth supplemented with uracil (0.2 mg/ml) at 37°C, 120 rpm with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 4 wk, an inoculating loop was used to transfer cells from each flask onto HMM+uracil agarose plates followed by incubation at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Individual yeast-phase colonies were streaked again and tested for uracil auxotrophy on HMM agarose plates.

After removal of values for flagged spots, background subtraction, and median normalization, the ratio of the median Cy5 intensity/median Cy3 intensity for these spots was used for further analysis. For the genes represented by multiple 70 mer probes, only values for the first probe were used for subsequent analysis. Normalized data was analyzed by Bayesian Analysis for Gene Expression Levels (BAGEL) to obtain relative expression levels for each spot in each condition or mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Meiklejohn1">[45]</xref>. Using the values obtained by BAGEL, we compared any two samples by dividing the value of the first sample by the value of the second sample.

Gene-to-gene edges were added for An/Af/Ca/Cg/Sc genes to their <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> G217B (HcG217B) orthologs based on InParanoid mapping of each genome pair (using default parameters with no outgroup). InterPro domains (IPR) from the Pfam, TIGRFAMS, SMART, PANTHER, and Gene3D databases from InterPro version 34 were mapped to HcG217B genes with InterProScan version 4.8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Zdobnov1">[49]</xref>. GO-to-IPR and IPR-to-gene edges were added to the graph by parsing the InterProScan results. An/Af/Ca/Cg/Sc genes with no ortholog in HcG217B were pruned from the graph, as were obsolete GO terms. The set of G217B genes deriving from each GO term was tabulated by traversing the graph in reverse topological sort order, assigning each parent node to the union of the G217B genes spanned by its children. For each query gene set, the GO association graph was pruned to the subset of GO terms spanning the query. GO terms in the resulting subgraph with a single GO term parent and child were considered uninformative relative to the query and were replaced by a direct edge from parent to child. We further removed any GO terms that were associated only with a single gene. The graph was further reduced to only GO terms present in the union of the AspGD/CGD/SGD GO slim sets (12/7/2011 version). For each GO term spanning k genes in the query, the probability of that term spanning at least k terms in a random gene set of the same size was calculated from the hypergeometric distribution as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001614-Boyle1">[50]</xref>.

Hits were aligned to each HMM using hmmalign, and neighbor-joining trees were generated from the aligned domain sequences using CLUSTALW 2.1. For PF00172.13, Ryp4 was found in a monophyletic clade, sister to Sip4, with orthologs from each target species except for <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. For PF04082.13, Ryp4 was found in a monophyletic clade identical to the previous one except for the gain of <italic>B. cinerea</italic> BC1G_13551 and the loss of Sc Cat8.

Following cell lysis, lysates were sonicated in a Diagenode Bioruptor for 30 min (30 s on, 1 min off) to shear DNA. Input DNA was collected and the rest of the sample was subjected to immunoprecipitation. For filamentous-phase samples (<italic>ryp</italic> mutants), lysates from three identical tubes were combined prior to antibody incubation. Each sample was incubated overnight at 4°C with 20 µg of polyclonal antibodies against portion of Ryp1 (ID:2877, ELDKPFPPGEKKRA), Ryp2 (ID:237, QTNRDYPFYNGPDAKRPR), Ryp3 (ID:338, GIKIPIRKDGVKGPRGGQ), or Ryp4 (ID:8, PPPQQSLQGWSPEEW). On the next day, 40 µl of Protein-A Sepharose 4B Fast Flow (Sigma-Aldrich) beads were added to the lysate-antibody mixture and further incubated for 2 h. Subsequently, beads were collected by centrifugation and washed nine times. Protein–DNA complexes that are bound to the beads were collected by incubating beads at 65°C with elution buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS).

<p>Ryp4 is required for yeast-phase growth and the expression of <italic>RYP</italic> genes. (A) Phase-contrast microscopy images of wild-type cells, or wild-type cells carrying either a vector control or <italic>RYP4</italic> RNAi plasmid are shown. RNAi vectors were maintained episomally and strains were grown at 37°C. <italic>ryp4</italic> knockdown strains were grown without selection to allow growth of clones that underwent spontaneous plasmid loss. Isolates of these strains that converted to the yeast form were analyzed to confirm that they had lost the RNAi marker. Black bar equals 20 µm. (B, C) Ryp4 is an ortholog of FacB. Initial sets of Ryp4 homologs were identified using HMMer 3.0 and the Pfam hidden Markov models (HMMs) for the fungal Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> binuclear cluster domain (PF00172.13, shown in black boxes) and the fungal-specific transcription factor domain (PF04082.13, shown in grey boxes). Details of the databases used and searches are given in Materials and Methods. The full-length protein sequences of the Ryp4 orthologs, as well as Cat8 and Sip4, were aligned (C), and a bootstrapped (<italic>n</italic> = 1,000) neighbor-joining tree (B) was generated using CLUSTALW. (D) qRT-PCR was used to quantify relative levels of <italic>RYP1</italic>, <italic>RYP2</italic>, and <italic>RYP3</italic> transcripts in <italic>ryp4</italic> mutants and wild-type controls grown at 37°C and room temperature (RT). <italic>GAPDH</italic> was used as a normalizer gene. Experiments were performed with at least two biological replicates for each strain. Triplicate measurements of representative replicates are graphed as mean ± standard deviation.</p>

<p>Ryp4 associates upstream of Ryp1, Ryp2, and Ryp3 targets. A network view of ChIP targets was generated using Cytoscape software. Each large open circle is composed of individual closed circles that represent individual genes. YPS genes are colored in yellow, and FPS genes are colored in blue. Microarrays used in this study represent 9,289 genes, which were also colored similarly as shown. The distribution of YPS and FPS genes in each type of ChIP event was compared to the whole genome using the Wilcoxon test. The <italic>p</italic> values obtained in this analysis are given. Additionally, Ryp1, Ryp3; Ryp1, Ryp2, Ryp3; and Ryp1, Ryp2, Ryp3, Ryp4 shared targets were enriched for YPS genes (<italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.0001) as determined by hypergeometric tests performed in R.</p>

<p>Motif A and Motif B are sufficient to drive gene expression in the presence of Ryp factors. <italic>RYP</italic> genes were cloned into two different vectors with two different markers. Each of these vectors were transformed into yeast strains with plasmids containing the UAS-less <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter fused to the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene to generate “no motif” controls (A). Additionally, complementary sequences of (B) Motif A, (C) Motif B, and their mutated versions were cloned into a plasmid containing the UAS-less <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter fused to the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene. Point mutations made in the motifs are shown in red. Each of the motif and Ryp plasmids were transformed into yeast strains as labeled. β-galactosidase activities were measured for three independent isolates of each strain. Quadruplicate measurements of representative isolates are graphed as the mean ± standard deviation.</p>
