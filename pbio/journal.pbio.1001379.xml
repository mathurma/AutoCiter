        <p>Analysis of a genetic module repurposed between yeast and vertebrates reveals that a common antifungal medication is also a potent vascular disrupting agent.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Studies in diverse organisms have revealed a surprising depth to the evolutionary conservation of genetic modules. For example, a systematic analysis of such conserved modules has recently shown that genes in yeast that maintain cell walls have been repurposed in vertebrates to regulate vein and artery growth. We reasoned that by analyzing this particular module, we might identify small molecules targeting the yeast pathway that also act as angiogenesis inhibitors suitable for chemotherapy. This insight led to the finding that thiabendazole, an orally available antifungal drug in clinical use for 40 years, also potently inhibits angiogenesis in animal models and in human cells. Moreover, in vivo time-lapse imaging revealed that thiabendazole reversibly disassembles newly established blood vessels, marking it as vascular disrupting agent (VDA) and thus as a potential complementary therapeutic for use in combination with current anti-angiogenic therapies. Importantly, we also show that thiabendazole slows tumor growth and decreases vascular density in preclinical fibrosarcoma xenografts. Thus, an exploration of the evolutionary repurposing of gene networks has led directly to the identification of a potential new therapeutic application for an inexpensive drug that is already approved for clinical use in humans.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Yeast cells and vertebrate blood vessels would not seem to have much in common. However, we have discovered that during the course of evolution, a group of proteins whose function in yeast is to maintain cell walls has found an alternative use in vertebrates regulating angiogenesis. This remarkable repurposing of the proteins during evolution led us to hypothesize that, despite the different functions of the proteins in humans compared to yeast, drugs that modulated the yeast pathway might also modulate        angiogenesis in humans and in animal models. One compound seemed a particularly promising candidate for this sort of approach: thiabendazole (TBZ), which has been in clinical use as a systemic antifungal and deworming treatment for 40 years. Gratifyingly, our study shows that TBZ is indeed able to act as a vascular disrupting agent and an angiogenesis inhibitor. Notably, TBZ also slowed     tumor growth and decreased vascular density in human tumors grafted into mice. TBZ’s historical safety data and low cost make it an outstanding candidate for translation to clinical use as a complement to current anti-angiogenic strategies for the treatment of cancer. Our work demonstrates how model organisms from distant branches of the evolutionary tree can be exploited to arrive at a promising new drug.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Systems biology has shown great promise in providing a better understanding of human disease and in identifying new disease targets. These methods typically leave off once the target is identified, and further research transitions to established paradigms for drug discovery. However, the vast majority of molecular pathways that function in human disease are not specific to humans, but rather are conserved across vertebrates and even to very distantly related organisms. The remarkable growth of genetic data from tractable model organisms implies that most genetic modules relevant to human biology are currently best characterized in non-human species. Such evolutionary conservation, even when the homology of the systems to the human case is distant or perhaps non-obvious, should enable new drug design strategies.</p>
      <p>Clearly, identification of deeply conserved gene networks in distant organisms opens the possibility of pursuing drug discovery in those organisms. While traditional methods of drug discovery focus on gene-by-gene rather than network- or system-level similarities, we suggest that phenologs—gene networks that while orthologous may nonetheless produce different phenotypes due to altered usage or organismal contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-McGary1">[1]</xref>—can provide a basis not just for screening against a single protein, but also for simultaneous drug discovery efforts against multiple targets in parallel. Given the key roles that model organisms already play in biomedical research, identification of such deep homologies should also allow us to better leverage the particular strengths of the wide variety of animal models in order to rapidly test candidate drugs found from such an approach.</p>
      <p>We recently developed a method for systematically discovering phenologs, and this approach identified a conserved module that is relevant to lovastatin sensitivity in yeast and is also responsible for regulating angiogenesis in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-McGary1">[1]</xref>. Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels, plays an essential role in development, reproduction, and tissue repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Carmeliet1">[2]</xref>. Because the vascular network supplies oxygen and nutrients to cancer cells as well as to normal cells, angiogenesis also governs the growth of many types of tumors, and is central to malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Carmeliet1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Folkman1">[5]</xref>. The vasculature is thus considered to be a major therapeutic target for drug development. Some cancers, such as the most common and deadly brain neoplasm, glioblastoma multiformae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Bondy1">[6]</xref>, are heavily vascularized, but have not responded to current angiogenesis inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Chi1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Jain1">[8]</xref>. Because new agents that target the vasculature would increase our arsenal for battling cancers resistant to current therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Carmeliet1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Folkman1">[5]</xref>, there is a clear clinical need for novel approaches to their identification.</p>
      <p>Here, we have exploited data mining of genetic interactions in yeast, in vivo time-lapse imaging in a non-mammalian vertebrate, loss-of-function analysis in cultured human cells, and preclinical xenografts in mice to identify and characterize a novel anti-angiogenic small molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Excitingly, this compound is already FDA approved for use in treating certain infections in humans, making it an excellent candidate for rapid translation to the clinic. This research exemplifies a general strategy for exploiting deeply conserved genetic modules for drug screening, characterized by screens focused not on single genes but rather on conserved genetic modules and by a strong reliance on tractable model organisms in order to speed the discovery of therapeutics.</p>

        <title>Identification of a Novel Small-Molecule Angiogenesis Inhibitor</title>
        <p>The remarkable conservation of a genetic module that controls lovastatin sensitivity in yeast and angiogenesis in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-McGary1">[1]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g002">Figures 2AB</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s001">S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s017">Table S1</xref>) led us to test the possibility that small-molecule inhibitors modulating the yeast pathway might also act as angiogenesis inhibitors. Indeed, preliminary evidence suggests that lovastatin itself at least partly inhibits angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Depasquale1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Park1">[10]</xref> and may even reduce the incidence of melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Shellman1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Splichal1">[12]</xref>. We therefore devised a strategy to exploit the evolutionary repurposing of this module in order to direct our search (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Specifically, we desired to identify compounds in a manner that did not require their mechanism of action or even their biochemical target to match that of lovastatin; we thus employed a genetic strategy in yeast in order to select compounds that genetically interacted with this module. By computationally mining available large-scale chemical sensitivity datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Hillenmeyer1">[13]</xref>, candidate compounds were prioritized based upon their measured synthetic genetic interactions with yeast genes, using clustering algorithms to identify those compounds with genetic interaction profiles most similar to that of lovastatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s018">Table S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Notably, four out of eight prioritized chemicals were already known to modulate angiogenesis, indicating strong enrichment for angiogenesis effectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s018">Table S2</xref>).</p>

Here, complete linkage clustering employing uncentered correlation coefficients is shown; additional clustering methods are illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s002">Figure S2</xref>.</p>

        <p>One compound—thiabendazole (TBZ; 4-(1H-1,3-benzodiazol-2-yl)-1,3-thiazole)—stood out because it has already been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for systemic oral use in humans (as an anti-fungal and anti-helminthic treatment). TBZ was initially marketed by Merck as Mintezol, and is now off-patent and issued as a generic under the trade names Apl-Luster, Mertect, Mycozol, Tecto, Tresaderm, and Arbotect. TBZ has been used by humans since its FDA approval in 1967, so its safety has been well-established. In animals, TBZ has no carcinogenic effects in either short- or long-term studies at doses up to 15 times the usual human dose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Edwards1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Gosselin1">[15]</xref>. Moreover, TBZ does not appear to affect fertility in mice or rats, and it is not a mutagen in standard in vitro microbial mutagen tests, micronucleus tests, or host-mediated assays in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Edwards1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Gosselin1">[15]</xref>. Thus, TBZ was an outstanding candidate for further study.</p>

Using in situ hybridization to either the apelin-receptor (<italic>aplnr</italic>) or the vascular ETS factor (<italic>erg</italic>), we found that TBZ treatment severely impaired angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g003">Figure 3A–D</xref>).

        <p>These data implicate TBZ as an effective inhibitor of angiogenesis. Importantly, we observed angiogenesis inhibition in both human cells in vitro and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos in vivo at a concentration of 100–250 µM. This dose corresponds to 20–50 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g004">4</xref>), which is notable because the oral LD50 of MINTEZOL is 1.3–3.6 g/kg, 3.1 g/kg, and 3.8 g/kg in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively, and the human approved recommended maximum daily dose is 3 grams, corresponding to 50 mg/kg for 60 kg patients. Finally, we note that the overall morphology and patterning of TBZ-treated <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos was grossly normal at the stages when the vasculature was severely disrupted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

        <p>We next asked if angiogenesis inhibition may be a general property of benzimidazoles. Examination of commercially available TBZ derivatives showed that this is not the case, with benzimidazole itself inactive at doses up to 1 mM and administration of other benzimidazoles causing diverse developmental defects but not angiogenesis inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s005">Figure S5</xref>). These findings are thus significant for demonstrating a high level of precision for this evolutionary approach to drug discovery.</p>

        <title>Thiabendazole Is a Vascular Disrupting Agent</title>
        <p>We next sought to better understand the cellular basis for angiogenesis inhibition by TBZ. In the course of our studies, we noted an interesting feature of the vasculature in TBZ-treated embryos: disconnected and scattered arrays of cells in which vascular gene expression persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g003">Figures 3B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s003">S3</xref>). Hypothesizing that such morphological defects in the absence of changes to vascular gene expression may stem from direct impairment of vessel integrity, we tested the ability of TBZ to disrupt pre-existing vasculature by treatments at later stages, when blood vessels were already well formed and patent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Levine1">[20]</xref>. TBZ treatment elicited overt breakdown of established vasculature at these stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
        <p>The ability of TBZ to disassemble extant blood vessels was especially significant because such an activity has recently drawn the attention of cancer biologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Heath1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Tozer1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Hinnen1">[22]</xref>. A new class of drugs called Vascular Disrupting Agents (VDAs) break down existing vascular structures, thereby disrupting blood flow, particularly within solid tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Heath1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Tozer1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Hinnen1">[22]</xref>. No VDAs have as yet been approved for use in humans, although several such agents are therapeutically promising and are in phase II and III trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Heath1">[4]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As a direct test of the vascular disrupting activity of TBZ, we performed time-lapse imaging of developing vasculature. Using <italic>Kdr</italic>-GFP transgenic embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Doherty1">[19]</xref> and time-lapse confocal microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Kieserman1">[23]</xref>, we could effectively image developing vasculature in vivo for periods of up to 20 h. During this time, the growth of existing vessels and the sprouting of new vasculature could be easily followed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s007">Figure S7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s014">Movie S1</xref>). Treatment with TBZ completely prevented growth and sprouting of vessels, and moreover elicited a striking disintegration of established vessels after ∼90 min of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s008">S8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s015">Movie S2</xref>).

        </fig>
        <p>These data demonstrate the efficacy of TBZ as a vascular disrupting agent. Previously defined VDAs can act either by targeting endothelial cells for selective cell death (e.g., ASA404 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Ching1">[24]</xref>) or by disrupting endothelial cell behaviors (e.g., combrestatin A4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Kanthou1">[25]</xref>), and so we sought to distinguish between these two possible mechanisms for TBZ action. We noted that treatment with TBZ doses sufficient to severely perturb the vasculature elicited only modest increases in apoptosis in cultured HUVECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Moreover, vascular gene expression in dispersed, rounded <italic>kdr-GFP+</italic> endothelial cells in vivo reliably persisted for up to 17 h after TBZ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g003">Figures 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g005">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s008">S8</xref>).</p>
        <p>These data argue against a role for apoptosis in vascular disruption by TBZ. To test this idea more directly, we performed washout experiments. Compellingly, washout of the drug after overt TBZ-induced endothelial cell dispersal and rounding resulted in significant re-spreading of endothelial cells and re-formation of vessels in living <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos assessed by time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g006">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s016">Movie S3</xref>). In several cases, widely separated <italic>kdr-GFP</italic>-positive endothelial cells reconnected into nascent vessels after washout of TBZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Thiabendazole Acts via Tubulin and Rho Kinase to Control Endothelial Cell Behavior</title>
        <p>The effect of TBZ on endothelial cells is striking and rapid. Our in vivo imaging of the vasculature revealed that endothelial cells retract from one another and round up within 2 h of TBZ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g006">6</xref>). Moreover, we observed that this effect is reversible by washout within a similarly rapid time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The rapid time-frames observed here argue that TBZ may act at the level of the cytoskeleton to influence endothelial cell behavior.</p>
        <p>We first considered that, while not an assumption of the phenolog approach (see above), TBZ may nonetheless impact the vasculature by the same mechanism as lovastatin. Lovastatin disrupts angiogenesis at least in part by perturbing the geranyl-geranylation of the RhoA GTPase, thereby abrogating its activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Park1">[10]</xref>. RhoA is a critical regulator of actin-based behaviors in all animal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Jaffe1">[26]</xref>, and the loss of RhoA signaling in endothelial cells treated with lovastatin is directly linked to cytoskeletal changes and inhibition of angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Park1">[10]</xref>. Indeed, inhibition of angiogenesis by lovastatin can be overcome by addition of geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Depasquale1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Park1">[10]</xref>). We therefore used the HUVEC scratch-wound closure model to quantitatively assess the effects of GGPP addition on TBZ action. However, we found that addition of GGPP did not reverse the action of TBZ on HUVEC cell motility in this assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Similarly, while TBZ has been observed to affect the activity of porcine heart mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Zhou1">[27]</xref>, we detected no differences in mitochondrial mass (measured by MitoTracker Green signal) or mitochondrial membrane potential (measured as the ratio of MitoTracker Red signal to Mitotracker Green signal) (unpublished data), thus ruling out this potential activity as being relevant.</p>
        <p>We next considered the possibility that TBZ acted on the vasculature at the level of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton, because TBZ has been found to disrupt microtubule assembly and dynamics in a number of cell types (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Davidse1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Sawin1">[31]</xref>), and because several currently-studied VDAs act as MT-disrupting agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Tozer1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Schwartz1">[32]</xref>. Curiously, TBZ had only a very slight effect on the gross organization of the MT cytoskeleton in HUVEC cells in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s011">Figure S11A</xref>), but a quantitative analysis using mass-spectrometry revealed a significant reduction in the abundance of several tubulin proteins following treatment of HUVECs with TBZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001379.s011">Figure S11B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Many MT-targeting VDAs act via hyper-activation of Rho signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Kanthou1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Ren1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Bayless1">[34]</xref>, likely reflecting the key role of MT-binding RhoGEFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Birukova1">[35]</xref>. We reasoned, therefore, that TBZ may also act via increased Rho signaling, as the drug elicited several phenotypes known to be associated with dysregulated Rho signaling (e.g., cell rounding, re-distribution of actin filaments, and defects in cell motility; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g007">Figure 7</xref>). To test this model directly, we asked if disruption of Rho signaling might counteract the effects of TBZ. Indeed, pharmacological disruption of Rho kinase function using the small molecule Y27632 elicited a significant and dose-dependent rescue of the TBZ-induced HUVEC cell motility defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001379-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Together, these data suggest that vascular disruption by TBZ results from reduced tubulin levels and hyper-active Rho signaling.</p>

        <title>Thiabendazole Slows Tumor Growth in a Mouse Xenograft Model</title>
        <p>It is hoped that VDAs may open new therapeutic avenues by complementing the action of currently used angiogenesis inhibitors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Heath1">[4]</xref>).

        <p>In sum, an analysis of evolutionary repurposing of a genetic module shared from yeast to humans has led directly to the discovery that an orally available drug, thiabendazole, already FDA approved for clinical use in humans, also acts as an angiogenesis inhibitor and vascular disrupting agent. Moreover, these data establish TBZ as the only VDA currently approved for human use (albeit for a different purpose). Our data suggest that, even for antifungal or antihelmintic use, the possibility of side effects related to vascularization should be considered, for example, in patients with cardiovascular disease or to the fetus if administered to pregnant women, for whom TBZ has not been broadly tested. Significantly, while research on VDAs has largely centered on cancer therapy, their use may also provide new therapeutic avenues for non-malignant diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Griggs1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Randall1">[41]</xref>. With more than 40 years of human use, the low cost and generic availability of TBZ make it a compelling candidate for translation into the clinic as a VDA.</p>
        <p>Finally, this research emphasizes the advantages of an evolutionary approach to drug discovery, in which the natural experimental strengths of various organisms can be exploited to accelerate our understanding of a conserved genetic module. Importantly, this approach proceeded from a gene module-based discovery strategy and proved effective even though the associated organismal phenotypes were entirely unrelated. Curiously, at least two other known antifungal drugs can also act as angiogenesis inhibitors. Itraconazole, an azole antifungal drug otherwise structurally unrelated to TBZ and acting via different mechanisms, was identified as an angiogenesis inhibitor via high-throughput screening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Chong1">[42]</xref>. This observation, in addition to the dual anti-fungal and anti-angiogenic properties of lovastatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Depasquale1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Park1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Kumar1">[43]</xref>, suggests additional interesting evolutionary connections between the processes of yeast cell wall metabolism and vertebrate angiogenesis. Such evolutionary connections further support the yeast cell wall-relevant activity of TBZ, from among its multiple pharmacological targets, as being the relevant activity for angiogenesis. Thus there is no reason to suspect that a more highly targeted agent could not be repurposed in a similar fashion. Overall, these results suggest that a fundamental understanding of systems biology will prove to be directly relevant to drug discovery, complementing traditional screening approaches to pharmacophore discovery and accelerating both basic and clinical biomedical research.</p>

        <p>Specific pathogen-free athymic Cre nu/nu mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HT1080 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) in tissue culture flasks at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. In order to generate a mouse xenograft model, a suspension of the HT1080 cells (3×10<sup>6</sup> in 50 µl PBS) mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD Bioscience) was subcutaneously implanted into the flank region of 7–8-wk-old female mice. Upon establishment of tumors (approx. 40 mm<sup>3</sup>), mice were given daily intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg thiabendazole (Sigma-Aldrich), suspended in 20 µl DMSO. Mice weighed on average 20 grams; this dose thus corresponded to 250 µM TBZ. As a control, an equal volume of DMSO was injected in the same manner. Tumor growth was monitored by measuring the length and width of each tumor using digital calipers, and the tumor volume in mm<sup>3</sup> calculated by the formula: Volume = (width)<sup>2</sup>×length/2. Upon a tumor reaching the maximum size permitted by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (1.5 cm in diameter), the mouse was sacrificed, and the tumor excised.</p>

        <p>HUVECs were treated with 1% DMSO or 1% DMSO, 250 µM TBZ for 24 h, and lysed by Dounce homogenization in low salt buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) with 0.5 mM DTT and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol was added to 50% (v/v) for each sample, and samples were reduced with 15 mM DTT at 55°C for 45 min and then alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min. Following alkylation, samples were diluted in digestion buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) to a final 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol concentration of 5% (v/v) and digested using proteomics grade trypsin (Sigma) at 1∶50 (enzyme/protein) concentration and incubated at 37°C for 4–5 h. Digestion was halted with the addition of 1% formic acid (v/v), and sample volume was reduced to 200 µl by SpeedVac centrifugation prior to loading on HyperSep C-18 SpinTips (Thermo). Samples were eluted (60% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), reduced to 10 µl by SpeedVac centrifugation, and resuspended in sample buffer (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). Tryptic peptides were then filtered through Microcon 10-kDa centrifugal filters (Millipore), and collected as flow-through. Peptides were chromatographically separated on a Zorbax reverse-phase C-18 column (Agilent) via a 230 min 5%–38% acetonitrile gradient, then analyzed by on-line nanoelectrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry on an LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific). Data-dependent ion selection was performed, collecting parent ion (MS1) scans at high resolution (60,000) and selecting ions with charge &gt;+1 for collision-induced dissociation fragmentation spectrum acquisition (MS2) in the LTQ, with a maximum of 12 MS2 scans per MS1. Ions selected more than twice in a 30 s window were dynamically excluded for 45 s. MS2 spectra were interpreted using SEQUEST (Proteome Discoverer 1.3, Thermo Scientific), searching against human protein-coding sequences from Ensembl release 64 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001379-Flicek1">[47]</xref>.

VEGF levels in HT1080 cells and conditioned medium were measured in 1% DMSO-treated control and 1% DMSO, 250 µM TBZ-treated HT1080 cells, assaying cellular VEGF by Western blotting (A) and secreted VEGF by ELISA (B). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) level was measured for a Western blotting control.</p>
