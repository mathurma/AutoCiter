                <p>T-killer cells of the immune system eliminate virus-infected and tumorous cells
                    through direct cell–cell interactions. Reorientation of the killing
                    apparatus inside the T cell to the T-cell interface with the target cell ensures
                    specificity of the immune response. The killing apparatus can also oscillate
                    next to the cell–cell interface. When two target cells are engaged by
                    the T cell simultaneously, the killing apparatus can oscillate between the two
                    interface areas. This oscillation is one of the most striking examples of cell
                    movements that give the microscopist an unmechanistic impression of the
                    cell's fidgety indecision. We have constructed a three-dimensional,
                    numerical biomechanical model of the molecular-motor-driven microtubule
                    cytoskeleton that positions the killing apparatus. The model demonstrates that
                    the cortical pulling mechanism is indeed capable of orienting the killing
                    apparatus into the functional position under a range of conditions. The model
                    also predicts experimentally testable limitations of this commonly hypothesized
                    mechanism of T-cell polarization. After the reorientation, the numerical
                    solution exhibits complex, multidirectional, multiperiodic, and sustained
                    oscillations in the absence of any external guidance or stochasticity. These
                    computational results demonstrate that the strikingly animate wandering of aim
                    in T-killer cells has a purely mechanical and deterministic explanation.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Beyond the more widely known molecular recognition of antigen, specificity of the
                    cellular immune response relies on the precise orientation of immune cells
                    toward infected and tumorous cells. We studied the mechanics of the structural
                    orientation of T-killer cells (a type of immune cells) to their immunological
                    targets. One of the most remarkable features of this process as seen under the
                    microscope is the apparent “wandering of aim”: instead of
                    pointing steadily at the intended target, the killing apparatus inside the
                    T-killer cell can wave around. When two targets are engaged simultaneously, the
                    killing apparatus in the T cell can repeatedly oscillate between the two. It
                    might appear that the origin of this strikingly animate behavior should lie in
                    stochasticity of the underlying mechanism. Our numerical model, however, was
                    able to reproduce the complex, continuing motion in spite of the fact that the
                    model was purely deterministic. This result suggests that deterministic
                    quantitative explanations and supporting experimental evidence can be sought in
                    the other cases of extremely complex cell motility that give the microscopist an
                    acute sense that the object is alive.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The high specificity of the immune response depends in large measure on direct
                cell-cell interactions. An example is the interaction of a T-killer lymphocyte with
                a tumor cell, or with a cell that has been infected and is producing new viral
                particles. It is generally accepted (e.g., ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Serrador1">[1]</xref>) that the T-killer
                cell patrols the tissue, comes in contact with the abnormal cell, recognizes the
                specific antigen on its surface, develops firm contact with the target cell, and
                releases toxic compounds in its direction. The directionality of the release, which
                makes the killing efficient and spares the bystander cells, is arguably as important
                as the precise molecular recognition of the antigen for the specificity of the
                immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kupfer1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Alberts1">[3]</xref>.</p>
            <p>The killing apparatus in T cells is structurally assembled around the centrosome, the
                organelle in which the microtubule fibers of the cytoskeleton are anchored.
                Experiments suggest that the killing apparatus may be positioned next to the target
                cell by molecular motors. According to this hypothesis, dynein motors anchored at
                the T cell interface with the target “reel in” the centrosome by
                pulling on microtubules that pass over the interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Combs1">[5]</xref>. Surprisingly, large
                fluctuations of the centrosome next to the cell-cell interface have been observed,
                as well as fluctuations between interfaces with simultaneously engaged targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Is the pulling mechanism biophysically plausible? And what is the nature of the
                apparent wandering of aim in T-killer cells? Here we show by means of biomechanical
                modeling that the pulling mechanism is indeed capable of bringing about the
                functional orientation of the centrosome in a range of conditions. Our analysis also
                predicts substantial and verifiable limitations of this mechanism. Our calculations
                show that the complex fluctuations are an intrinsic property of this mechanism and
                of the T-cell structure, in the absence of any stochasticity or external guidance,
                suggesting a deterministic mechanical explanation for one of the most
                “animate” cell behaviors.</p>

                <p>From the experimental videos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref> we obtain the following idealizations to set
                    up our numerical model (refer to the diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The cell outline consists of an
                    unattached round part and of a flat part which is attached to the target cell
                    (called synapse, or synaptic plane). The large nucleus is coupled to the aster
                    of microtubules converging near its surface, and the mobility of both is
                    constrained by the cell outline. Microtubules slide along the cell outline in
                    the areas of contact with the targets. This active sliding–specified
                    in more detail below–drives all movements that are observed. The
                    movements are opposed by microtubule bending elasticity and by viscous drag in
                    the cytoplasm. This condition completes the physical specification of our model;

                <p>The active microtubule sliding in the model is meant to represent the action of
                    cortically anchored molecular motors. Idealizing what should happen when
                    microtubules come in contact with the cell cortex on which motor molecules are
                    anchored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Combs1">[5]</xref>, we assume that the
                    unit length of the contacting part of the microtubule will experience a constant
                    tangential force. The mechanical property of the synapse with respect to a
                    microtubule is therefore characterized in our model by a one-dimensional force
                    density (units of force per length). It is additionally assumed that the force
                    exerted on the microtubule is directed, along the local tangent to the
                    microtubule, to the end of the microtubule that is free (not attached to the
                    centrosome). This end is commonly referred to as the plus end of the
                    microtubule. The direction of the force so exerted on the microtubule is the
                    intrinsic property of the dynein-type molecular motors that have been implicated
                    in T cell polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Combs1">[5]</xref>. In the more commonly considered situation of
                    vesicular transport, dynein motors ferry intracellular cargo to the so-called
                    minus end of the microtubule (the end that is anchored at the centrosome).
                    Considering the action and reaction forces, when the intracellular vesicle is
                    moved along the microtubule to the minus end, the force exerted by dynein on the
                    microtubule is directed to the plus end. We assume that the force direction is
                    the same also in the case where the dynein-type motor is anchored at the inner
                    surface of the cell outline in the synapse area. The arrangement of motors on
                    this surface can be envisioned as entirely random (uniform and isotropic). This
                    is the implication behind our cell-level model assumption that the direction of
                    the force acting on a microtubule depends only on the direction in which the
                    microtubule passes over the inner surface of the synapse. Indeed, one can
                    envision motor molecules that can pivot on their cortical attachments and will
                    therefore be aligned by their very interaction with a microtubule.
                    Alternatively, motors may be randomly and stably oriented, and only the ones
                    with a matching orientation will engage with the microtubule passing over the
                    synapse in a certain direction. In both cases the pulling force density
                    experienced by the microtubule will be a constant, and the resulting force will
                    be tangential to the microtubule. The effectively isotropic arrangement of
                    motors is considered here merely as the simplest possibility in the absence of
                    empirical data on what an anisotropic arrangement could be like. The model
                    assumption of the constant pulling force density also stipulates that, in
                    molecular terms, there should always be a sufficient number of individual motor
                    molecules in contact with the microtubule. Then the pulling on that microtubule
                    can be processive (continuous), whether the individual motors are processive or
                    not: When some motor molecules disengage, others engage, and the average pulling
                    force is continuously exerted. We would like to emphasize that all
                    considerations regarding the motors are not part of our quantitative model per
                    se but are plausible molecular interpretations of the actual model assumption of
                    the constant density and tangentiality of the pulling force.</p>

                    show a simulation where the centrosome is initially oriented at 90° to
                    the developing cell-cell interface. This orientation is the likeliest if the
                    spherical T cell comes in contact with the target surface entirely at random.
                    This is so for the following reasons. Centrosomes facing any point around a
                    circumference on the T cell surface, which circumference is parallel to the
                    forming synapse, will all have an identical angular separation from the synapse.
                    Indeed, which way the centrosome is facing around the axis perpendicular to the
                    synapse, is of no consequence for the magnitude of the reorientation that is
                    required to bring the centrosome into the functional orientation toward the
                    synapse. Such a circumference corresponding to the identical orientation with
                    respect to the synapse will be the longest, when the angular separation of the
                    centrosome from the synapse is 90°. Random orientation of the T cell
                    cytoskeleton in three dimensions would mean that the centrosome is equally
                    likely to point towards any small area on the spherical outline of the T cell
                    body. The longest circumference then corresponds to the likeliest orientation
                    with respect to the synapse, which is therefore 90°. Our model
                    reproduces the observation that the centrosome becomes reoriented to the
                    interface. Interestingly, stabilization of the centrosome orientation in the
                    model is soon followed by development of pulse-like oscillations of the
                    centrosome position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g002">Figure
                    2</xref>). The oscillations are in agreement with the experimental observations
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>,
                    and are analyzed in more detail below. An interesting prediction of the model is
                    that the long-range reorientation also results in an arrangement of microtubules
                    that is very asymmetrical. On the side of the microtubule aster that was leading
                    during the reorientation movement (i.e., on the side next to which the synapse
                    initially developed), a relatively tight “bundle” of
                    microtubules is formed. The bundle is separated by a distinctive gap from the
                    microtubules that were trailing. There exists a published three-dimensional
                    experimental image of an <italic>early</italic> T cell-target cell conjugate
                        (Figure 6a in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>) that
                    may arguably show a similar gap. However, the gap formation has not been
                    specifically investigated experimentally, and therefore remains a prediction to
                    be verified. For the verification it will be important that in the model the gap
                    is a transient feature seen after reorientation, not a static-equilibrium
                    configuration. (Available images of fully established T cell-target cell
                    conjugates, e.g., in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>, show only a comparatively symmetric
                    structure.) The induced asymmetry in the model aster should be responsible for
                    the ratchet-like behavior of the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is predicted by
                    our model when the T cell develops a second synapse. The centrosome readily
                    reorients by another 90° in the same direction as it did the first time,
                    but does not reorient in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In view of this, another testable
                    prediction can be made regarding the experimentally observed oscillations of the
                    centrosome between two synapses: The cortical-pulling mechanism does not permit
                    reversible intersynaptic oscillations in cases where the centrosome undergoes a
                    large reorientation to the synapse that is the first to develop. Before
                    embarking on the analysis of the mechanical conditions that do permit the
                    intersynaptic oscillations, the capacity of the pulling mechanism for achieving
                    the functional polarity of the T-cell cytoskeleton needs to be outlined more
                    systematically.</p>

                            centrosome is initially pointing down (orientation
                            −90°), and the first synapse develops on the cell
                            equator (orientation 0°). The evolution of the centrosome
                            orientation with time is shown by the blue plot. Note the oscillations
                            following the stabilization of the equatorial position of the
                            centrosome. After this (at

                            cell is set to develop the second synapse. In one version of the
                            simulation (green plot), the second synapse develops on the top of the
                            cell, and the centrosome rapidly migrates to it. In the alternative
                            branch of the simulation (red plot), the second synapse develops on the
                            bottom of the cell. In this case, the centrosome does not leave its
                            position near the middle of the first synapse (red line). Both of the
                            alternative centrosome positions seen at the end of this graph persist
                            for much longer than plotted. Pulling force density, 40 pN/µm;

                <p>The orientation of the centrosome is described here using an angular measure. The
                    rounded outline of the T cell makes the angular measures and the terms
                    “orientation” and “reorientation”
                    convenient. It also makes the centrosome trajectory during the long-range
                    reorientation look at least partly like an arc. To show as much of this movement
                    as two-dimensional representation can convey, we chose throughout our paper to
                    show reorientation in figures and videos from such an angle that the line of
                    sight is directed along the axis of the arc. From any other angle, the same
                    movement would appear only less arc-like, and more
                    “vectorial”. In this sense, we feel that our model is
                    compatible with the vectorial description of translocation in experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The movements in our model are, strictly speaking, a superposition of the
                    movements caused by pulling and of movements caused by the deformation of the
                    cell outline in the beginning of each simulation. Simulations in which pulling
                    force density was set to zero (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s001">Figure S1</xref>) show, however, that the
                    “passive” component is small, usually not exceeding several
                    degrees of centrosome rotation. Thus, in the framework of the present model,
                    achieving any specific centrosome position, such as next to the synapse (or at
                    the rear in a migrating T cell), requires the active pulling force.</p>
                <p>Given the quasi-exponential kinetics of the reorientation to the target, i.e.,
                    one characterized by a rapid beginning followed by a slow stabilization at the
                    final position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g002">Figure 2</xref>),
                    it is appropriate to measure the rapidity of the reorientation by the time it
                    takes to reorient by one-half of the angle that separated the initial and the
                    functional orientations of the centrosome. This is analogous, for example, to
                    the widely used half-recovery time in photobleaching experiments. The
                    half-reorientation time achieved by the dynein-pulling mechanism in our model is
                    plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g003">Figure 3A</xref> vs. the
                    initial misorientation of the centrosome, i.e., vs. the angular separation of
                    the initial centrosome orientation and the middle of the forming synapse. This
                    plot is essentially the structural challenge – kinetic response curve
                    for the T cell polarization driven by the cortical dynein. It shows that for the
                    comparatively small required reorientations, up to about 70°, the rise
                    of the response time is nonlinear: the movement induced is actually the slower
                    the larger reorientation is needed. This can be attributed to the spatial
                    separation of the microtubules diverging from the centrosome. As a result, a
                    synapse of the given size that is formed farther away will be contacted by fewer
                    microtubules, and the integral force exerted on the microtubule cytoskeleton by
                    such a synapse will be smaller. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g003">Figure 3A</xref> further shows that this dependence breaks down for even
                    larger “challenges”: Between about 70 and 110° of
                    the initial separation of the synapse from the centrosome, the
                    half-reorientation time actually goes down with the increasing reorientation
                    range. This can be attributed to the advantages of the tighter contact of
                    microtubules with the pulling surface. The microtubules can therefore experience
                    a larger pulling force. This apparently becomes the overriding factor in this
                    range of initial misorientations. (Notice in the initial, mechanically relaxed
                    cell structure shown in the first inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g002">Figure 2</xref> that the more distal parts of the
                    microtubules are straighter and potentially better aligned with a synapse that
                    can form next to them than the highly curved proximal parts can be.) The
                    challenge-response plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g003">Figure
                        3A</xref> shows further that for initial misorientations that are larger
                    still, the half-reorientation time displays a tendency to rise and fall once
                    more, but the kinetics becomes much more dependent on the microtubule length,
                    and the half-reorientation may not then be achieved at all.</p>

                            region 1, the complete reorientation is achieved. In region 2, the
                            reorientation is “jammed” at around 30° of
                            remaining angular separation. In region 3, the reorientation is
                            “jammed” at the characteristic angular separation of
                            100°. In region 4, reorientation does not commence because the
                            microtubules are too short to contact the synapse. In region 5, complete
                            reorientation is achieved after a catastrophic stability loss of the

                            microtubule dynamic instability (colored curves). The three stochastic
                            simulations are independent (in the sense of pseudo-random number
                            generation on a computer) repetitions of a simulation which was
                            otherwise set up the same way as the deterministic one. The angle
                            plotted is defined as the angle formed by the lines drawn from the
                            nucleus center to the centrosome and to the middle of the synapse. The
                            deterministic prediction is that the centrosome, having started facing
                            the opposite side of the cell from the synapse, will not be able to
                            reorient to the synapse. The stochastic predictions differ between runs:
                            one is similar to the deterministic prediction, in the other two the

                <p>The complexity of outcomes reveals the limitations imposed by the basic cell
                    structure on the functional capacity of the pulling mechanism. The chart of the
                    simulation outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g003">Figure
                    3B</xref>) shows that the functionally required reorientation up to about
                    100° can be completed by the cell with microtubules of any plausible
                    length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g003">Figure 3B, region
                    1</xref>). However, as the initial separation of the centrosome and the synapse
                    increases, the microtubule cytoskeleton is predicted to become jammed at certain
                    positions without reaching the fully functional orientation (regions 2 and 3).
                    This is apparently due to limits to the movement of the microtubule aster in the
                    space between the nucleus and the outline of the cell. For certain microtubule
                    lengths and initial orientations (region 4), the microtubules are simply too
                    short to contact the synapse and initiate any movement. Interestingly,
                    examination of the boundary between regions 1 (“success”)
                    and 2 (“jammed”) shows that making microtubules longer can
                    actually create impediments to complete reorientation, when the movement could
                    otherwise commence. The most interesting in this regard are the predictions for
                    the largest initial misorientations of the centrosome with respect to the
                    forming synapse, such as near 180°, which is commonly hypothesized to be
                    the case in vivo (e.g., ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Serrador1">[1]</xref>). If the microtubules are long enough to reach
                    such a synapse, they will also likely to be long enough to overlap there in the
                    anti-parallel fashion. The model shows that in this case, the pulling will lock
                    the microtubule system in place (with microtubules wound tightly around the
                    nucleus), rather than reorient it. This can happen even if the synapse is quite
                    far from being symmetrically opposite the centrosome, provided only that the
                    microtubules are long enough to overlap at the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, region 7). However, for certain
                    microtubule lengths and initial orientations (regions 5 and 6), the locking,
                    although it may initially appear stable, is resolved through a catastrophic loss
                    of stability, and reorientation can then commence. Interestingly, the
                    comparatively violent loss of stability may make possible final reorientation
                    that is complete, even though this region in the parameter space (region 5) is
                    beyond the zone where functional orientation was already impossible in the
                    absence of any locking (region 3). The predicted variability of the
                    dynein-driven cytoskeleton polarization in T cells, depending on the exact
                    initial orientation and individual cell structure, appears very life-like and
                    demands experimental testing.</p>
                <p>Additional simulations where dynamic instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Mitchison1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Hill1">[7]</xref> was
                    included show that the jamming may be overcome if the microtubule length is not
                    constant but undergoes stochastic fluctuations. Our model predicts that due to
                    the very stochastic nature of dynamic instability, the jamming may be overcome
                    in some cells and not in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Statistically, therefore, dynamic instability of
                    microtubules has the capacity to facilitate reorientation driven by pulling.</p>
                <p>The mechanically dead-locked state with the non-functional orientation of the
                    centrosome has not been experimentally documented. This suggests three
                    possibilities: (1) the specific initial conditions that lead to it in the model
                    (region 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) are
                    not encountered in reality; (2) the pulling mechanism is not the correct
                    mechanism, or should be translated substantially differently into quantitative
                    model assumptions; (3) the pulling mechanism is complemented by other mechanisms
                    in reality. The first possibility is likely because the locking is predicted
                    only in a small fraction of the feasible parameter space (region 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The second
                    possibility is less likely, because the other predictions reproduce a number of
                    striking experimental observations. The third possibility is highly likely; in
                    particular, our simulations suggest that dynamic instability of microtubules is
                    one such additional mechanism that has the capacity to resolve the locking.
                    Disintegration of microtubules under load is another possibility in this regard
                    that our present model does not consider. It is however made less likely by the
                    fact that excessive bending is not seen in our simulations. The axial stress
                    induced by the pulling force in our simulations is likely to be withstood.
                    Measurements suggested that microtubules have mechanical properties resembling
                    Plexiglas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Takasone1">[8]</xref>. From this, M. W. Berns and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Botvinick1">[9]</xref>
                    estimated that, although the yield strength of a microtubule is not known, it
                    can be similar to that of polymethylmethacrylate, 40–70 MPa.
                    Considering the cross-section of microtubules 25 nm in diameter, we conclude
                    that microtubules should be able to bear the tensile loads encountered in our
                    model (up to ∼100 pN) without structural disintegration.</p>

                <title>Intra-Synaptic Oscillations</title>
                <p>Returning to the analysis of the purely deterministic effects of pulling (without
                    incorporating the dynamic instability of microtubule length in the model), we
                    analyzed further the mechanism of the deterministic mechanical instability of
                    the centrosome position that followed the long-range reorientation. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s005">Video S2</xref>
                    shows a generic case of oscillations developing after the functional position of
                    the centrosome next to the synapse is reached. It was found that oscillations
                    develop in the model even if the synapse is formed next to the initial location
                    of the centrosome. An otherwise insignificant tilt of the synapse (such as
                    2°) will determine the initial phase of the oscillations in our
                    deterministic model. Engagement of the microtubules with the pulling surface
                    causes the model centrosome to greatly “overshoot” and to
                    continue moving beyond the center point of the interface. It eventually stops
                    and begins the reverse motion, again approaching the center point and again
                    overshooting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).
                    The oscillations may persist without noticeable systematic changes over at least
                    1 h of simulated physical time. Typically it appears that there are overlapping
                    and interfering periodic motions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Also, oscillatory movements that are mostly tangential
                    to the model cell-cell interface occur simultaneously with oscillatory movements
                    that are orthogonal to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g005">Figure
                        5B</xref>). Gyrations (looping motions parallel to the interface) can also
                    be discerned in the complex trajectory of the model centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

                    modeled as in the simulations described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The ring-shaped distribution of
                    dynein was modeled by assuming that only the annulus between

                    the synapse radius, could exert pulling force on the microtubules. (The annulus
                    is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s006">Video S3</xref>.) Results show that incorporation of these kinetic and
                    structural details does not dramatically affect the oscillations predicted by
                    the simple deterministic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s006">Video S3</xref>). Overall our results suggest that
                    although dynamic instability of microtubules and ring-shaped distribution of
                    dynein may influence the exact trajectory of the centrosome in living cells,
                    they need not be the root cause of the oscillations, nor do they necessarily
                    have a large impact on the oscillation pattern. It is interesting that, as can
                    be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and
                        <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s007">Video
                    S4</xref>, when the pulling surface is assumed to be a disk, the area actually
                    contacted by the microtubules is nonetheless a ring, due to how the microtubules
                    bend against the synapse. This may explain the absence of a significant effect
                    of the assumption of the shape of the pulling area (ring or disk) on the
                    oscillations dynamics. Also, the movement of the centrosome to the edge of the
                    synaptic area in the model is restricted by bending of microtubules against the
                    sides of the cell, as discussed above. A similar effect restricting the
                    centrosome movement is predicted to arise, in the case of the ring-shaped
                    pulling area, from the reversion of polarity of microtubules contacting the
                    pulling annulus as the centrosome crosses it. It is tempting to speculate that
                    real T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Combs1">[5]</xref> may arrange their
                    cortical motors in the ring-shaped areas not to waste any in areas not contacted
                    by microtubules. In the rest of our analysis we refer only to the case of purely
                    deterministic and structurally simplified modeling that does not incorporate the
                    dynamic instability or the ring-shaped distribution of dynein.</p>
                <p>As regards the origin of the deterministic oscillations and of the repeated
                    overshooting which are exhibited by the centrosome, it is important to point out
                    that inertia plays no role in intracellular movements due to the prevailing
                    near-zero Reynolds number conditions. In fact, like in models for comparable
                    types of intracellular movements (e.g., refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Cytrynbaum1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kozlowski1">[12]</xref>), there is no mass in our mechanical model. Also,
                    the model is strictly deterministic, and therefore the deflections from the
                    middle position of the centrosome are not due to molecular stochasticity. Close
                    inspection of the model reveals that when the centrosome passes the middle point
                    during oscillations, the microtubule aster shows significant asymmetry. This
                    asymmetry is reversed when the centrosome passes the middle point the next time
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s007">Video S4</xref>).
                    Moreover, the microtubules are engaged with the pulling surface more to one side
                    of the centrosome than to the other. The other side of the aster becomes engaged
                    during the reverse swing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g004">Figure
                    4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s007">Video S4</xref>). Similarly to a model for pronucleus oscillations in worm
                    eggs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kozlowski1">[12]</xref>, it can be observed that the distal
                    (“plus”) ends of microtubules hardly move during the
                    oscillation cycle. This should be attributed to the cytoplasm viscosity
                    dampening propagation of the elastic perturbation along the microtubules from
                    their proximal parts, which may be pulled and which are coupled to the moving
                    centrosome. As a result, when microtubules on one side are pulled and the
                    centrosome shifts, the proximal parts of microtubules on the opposite side will
                    be lifted off the synaptic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s007">Video S4</xref>). This makes the tug of war
                    nonlinear: whenever one side is winning, this weakens the opposing side. We
                    ascribe to this effect the fact that our model tends to swing through the middle
                    position. At the same time the movement appears to be limited by the deformation
                    of the microtubules on the winning side. Their distal parts are bent against the
                    side of the cell, and therefore the zone where they can contact the pulling
                    surface cannot extend very close to the edge of the flat synaptic zone. Movement
                    toward the edge therefore diminishes the pulling force. This gives the elastic
                    relaxation of the trailing microtubules time to catch up and to bring their
                    proximal parts in apposition with the pulling surface. At this point the
                    microtubules that trailed are lying relatively flat on the synapse. They are
                    therefore experiencing a pulling force that is greater than the force exerted on
                    the microtubules which led and which are now contacting the synapse only with
                    their highly curved parts. Movement in the reverse direction ensues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s007">Video S4</xref>).
                    It is important to point out that while microtubule elasticity orchestrates the
                    movement, the continued oscillations are ultimately powered by the pulling
                    forces, which work ultimately against the energy-dissipating forces of viscous
                    drag. The source of energy is part of the present model only by implication: it
                    is ATP hydrolysis coupled to the working cycle of the dynein motors that are
                    behind the pulling force in the model.</p>
                <p>Simulations with different pulling force densities show that the basic frequency
                    of the oscillations is fairly insensitive to this parameter, although the
                    overall pattern of oscillations changes abruptly when a certain value of it is
                    crossed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Below
                    approximately 140 pN/µm, the oscillations appear multiperiodic and
                    continuous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).
                    Above approximately 150 pN/µm, the oscillations are pulse-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). In the relatively
                    narrow range of pulling force densities between approximately 140 and 150
                    pN/µm, the oscillations are continuous and pure, i.e., they exhibit a
                    single frequency and amplitude. Only in this narrow intermediate range does the
                    distance of the centrosome to the synaptic plane not oscillate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Based on the
                    experimental estimate of the force that can be exerted by a single cytoplasmic
                    dynein molecule interacting with a microtubule, 2.6 pN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Ashkin1">[13]</xref>, we limit the range
                    of the pulling force densities that are of analytical interest to between 20 and
                    200 pN/µm. Below this range, there will be only a few molecular motors
                    pulling on a given microtubule, giving rise to stochasticity that our
                    deterministic approach cannot reflect. Above this range the number will reach
                    into the hundreds, which may not be realistic. The present model shows that
                    within the entire range of 20–200 pN/µm, the period of
                    oscillations parallel to the synapse remains near 15–20 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). This is close to
                    the typical frequency seen in the experimental videos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>. This intrinsic
                    frequency of oscillations parallel to the synapse (<italic>x</italic> direction)
                    is seen in its pure form when the orthogonal (<italic>z</italic> direction)
                    oscillations are absent between 140 and 150 pN/µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In the other two
                    regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6A and 6C</xref>),
                    however, measurements show that the <italic>x</italic>-frequency is
                    approximately the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure
                    6D</xref>). The period of the <italic>z</italic>-oscillations is also mostly
                    insensitive to the force density, except that it is much longer for all values
                    above 150 pN/µm than it is below 140 pN/µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In the intervening
                    range, the <italic>z</italic>-oscillations are not sustained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), and their period,
                    therefore, not defined. The range of the distance (<italic>z</italic>) of the
                    centrosome from the synapse exhibits a similar step-like dependence on the
                    pulling force density, collapsing fully in the narrow transition zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). It can be observed
                    that the farther away from the synapse the centrosome is at any given time, the
                    smaller the amplitude of the movement parallel to the synapse will be. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6F</xref> shows that this
                    dependence is essentially independent of the force density and is quasi-linear.
                    The exception to its linearity appears related to the natural limit of zero
                    amplitude. When this limit is reached (this can happen only at high force
                    densities), the amplitude-distance relationship exhibits a breakpoint at the
                    axis intercept (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6F</xref>).
                    The zero amplitude of motion parallel to the synapse is observed during the
                    intervals between the pulses, such as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6C</xref>. Notably, the breakpoint of the
                        <italic>x</italic>-amplitude vs. <italic>z</italic>-position curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6F</xref>) is near the
                    centrosome-synapse distance of 1 µm, same as the breakpoint in the
                    dependence of the <italic>z</italic>-position on the force density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Close inspection
                    shows that this transition corresponds in individual trajectories to complete
                    but temporary loss of contact between the microtubule system as a whole and the
                    synapse. Explanation of this phenomenon proved challenging, although it appears
                    to arise from the viscous drag-induced “liftoff” of the
                    microtubules that was discussed above and illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. During particularly vigorous
                    movement that can occur at the higher force densities, not just one side but the
                    entire microtubule system may lose contact with the synapse (apparently due to
                    the lift force). In the absence of the active driving force it will take the
                    motile system considerable time to relax and contact the synapse again. These
                    periods of time correspond to the long, high arcs of the
                    <italic>z</italic>-trajectory and no <italic>x</italic>-movement, as seen in
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6C</xref>. Intuition
                    does not appear to keep up with the complexity of the movement. It is satisfying
                    that complexity exhibited in the simulations compares favorably with the
                    multi-periodic and variable-amplitude movement seen in the experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>.
                    However, the mechanistic explanation of it offered by the model will be
                    difficult to test with the existing live-cell imaging techniques, because it
                    would depend on resolving optically the small distances around the predicted
                    breakpoint (∼1 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g006">Figure 6E and 6F</xref>).</p>

                <p>Capacity to explain oscillations of the centrosome within a synapse is a
                    stringent test of a mechanism proposed for centrosome polarization, and our
                    computer simulation results indicate that the empirical hypothesis of cortical
                    dynein pulling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Combs1">[5]</xref> passes this test. The
                    immunological function of the oscillations within a synapse is however unclear.
                    (One can speculate that they might facilitate extrusion of the toxic granules.)
                    In contrast to this uncertainty, oscillations <italic>between two
                    synapses</italic> appear to be part of how a T cell engages two targets
                    simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>, no matter how illogical this may seem from a
                    “design” standpoint. We have therefore tested the ability of
                    the cortical pulling mechanism to produce oscillations between two synapses as
                    well.</p>
                <p>Numerical solution shows that after simultaneous development of two synaptic
                    areas on two sides of the initial centrosome position, the model centrosome goes
                    to one of them. Which one it goes to first in our deterministic model can be
                    decided by an otherwise insignificant deviation of the initial centrosome
                    orientation from the middle, such as by 2°. What is important is that
                    after pausing at the first synapse, which pause can last for a significant
                    period of time, the model centrosome spontaneously moves to the other synapse
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g007">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s008">Video S5</xref>).
                    The cycle of movement, pause, and movement to the other synapse appears to
                    continue indefinitely with a rather well-defined periodicity. The characteristic
                    delay before the reverse motion is as seen in the experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>. The
                    model predicts that for the delay to take place, the angle between the two
                    synaptic planes must be narrower than 150° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The angle was indeed sharp in the
                    experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kuhn1">[4]</xref>. By only crudely adjusting the pulling force
                    density and effective cytoplasm viscosity (to 40 pN/µm and 2 pN
                        s/µm<sup>2</sup>, respectively), it is easy to reproduce with
                    remarkable precision both the duration of the pause and the duration of the
                    movement phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).
                    Whereas the match of the <italic>absolute</italic> model time scale to the
                    experiment is a matter of (crude manual) data-fitting and therefore not
                    particularly significant, the fact that the computed phase of pause and the
                    computed phase of migration can have the same <italic>relative</italic> duration
                    as seen in the experiment is very remarkable. The same viscosity was used in all
                    other simulations shown, including those that, as was discussed above,
                    reproduced closely the characteristic period of intra-synaptic oscillations
                    independently of the pulling force density. This indicates that the
                    deterministic mechanics of the cortical pulling mechanism may indeed account for
                    the relevant features of centrosome motility in the T cell.</p>

                <p>In the light of the model, the pause of the centrosome and of the associated
                    killing apparatus next to each of the engaged targets appears to arise from the
                    delayed relaxation of microtubules that were trailing during the last period of
                    centrosome migration. This can be discerned by close examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, and it is the same
                    factor that leads, in the extreme, to the irreversible, ratchet-like behavior of
                    the model cytoskeleton following very large reorientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In comparison, the migration
                    between the two synapses is medium-range, and it therefore can be reversible.
                    Comparing it on the other hand with the relatively small-amplitude oscillations
                    within a synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g004">Figures 4</xref>
                    and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000260-g005">5</xref>), the migration of the
                    centrosome between the synapses winds up the trailing microtubules much more
                    around the nucleus, and it takes them longer to relax and contact the other
                    synaptic area after the movement was limited by the deformation of the
                    previously leading microtubules. Irrespective of these mechanistic details that
                    are suggested by the model, it is notable that the time which the killing
                    apparatus spends next to the given target may be determined so directly by mere
                    elasticity of the cytoskeleton. It is equally notable that, as the model
                    suggests, the movement of the killing apparatus to the other synapse is a direct
                    mechanical consequence of its previous movement to the synapse where it is
                    presently found.</p>
                <p>Simulations in which the pulling force density at the two synapses is unequal
                    show that the centrosome can be retained at the synapse which is the stronger,
                    even if it visits the weaker synapse first (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000260.s002">Figure S2</xref>).
                    This result suggests that the preferential orientation of the centrosome and
                    associated organelles to the stronger synapse, which was observed experimentally

                    case of the inter-synaptic oscillations.</p>
                <p>In summary, a purely deterministic, biomechanical model is capable of exhibiting
                    complex, life-like centrosome movements in a conceptually simple,
                    three-dimensional computer simulation of the dynein-pulling mechanism. Our
                    computational results demonstrate that the origin of the strikingly animate
                    wandering of aim in T-killer cells need not be sought necessarily in stochastic
                    dynamics of individual molecules, or in indecision that might be exhibited by
                    complex information processing in the T cell, or in indeterminate changes in the
                    signaling input from the target cells. Instead, the rigorous numerical
                    demonstration that a purely deterministic mechanical explanation exists for one
                    of the most animate behaviors exhibited by cells suggests that similar
                    explanations and supporting experimental evidence can be sought for other types
                    of cell behavior that appear strikingly far from mechanistic.</p>

                    <p>The forward Euler method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Press1">[21]</xref> was used to integrate the motion of the
                        microtubules and nucleus. The instantaneous velocities were derived from the
                        condition whereby all forces and torques exerted on the microtubules and
                        nucleus are balanced by the viscous drag force that resists their motion
                        through the cytoplasm. (I.e., overdamped, zero-Reynolds number conditions
                        were assumed, as in other models of intracellular movement of the
                        microtubule cytoskeleton and nucleus, e.g., as in refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Cytrynbaum1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Kozlowski1">[12]</xref>.) The time
                        step used was
                        Δ<italic>t</italic> = 0.0002 s. The
                        following presents more details on the calculations used to update the
                        positions of the microtubules and nucleus during a time step. First we
                        consider a microtubule node (see above) at position <bold>x</bold> in the
                        three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. (This does not apply to the most
                        proximal, or centrosome, node on each microtubule, which is in fact part of
                        the rigid-body nucleus.) Forces acting on this node are calculated as
                        detailed in the corresponding subsections above. These forces arise from (1)
                        bending, (2) inextensibility, (3) impenetrability of boundaries, and (4)
                        pulling at the synapse. We denote the sum of these forces by <bold>F</bold>.
                        This force will be balanced by viscous drag force. Since the drag
                        coefficient of the microtubule segment represented by the node depends on
                        the direction of movement, in the following calculation <bold>F</bold> is
                        decomposed into the components that are locally parallel to the microtubule,
                            <bold>F</bold><sub>∥</sub>, and orthogonal to it,
                            <bold>F</bold><sub>⊥</sub>. When divided by the appropriate
                        drag coefficient, these components of force will yield the corresponding
                        components of the node velocity. Therefore, using the widely accepted
                        approximations for the drag coefficient of a cylinder (see above), the
                        position of the node should be updated as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000260.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
                    <p>The following procedure is used to update the position and orientation of the
                        nucleus (together with the centrosome node and the vectors representing the
                        unstressed microtubule emanation directions, see above). The total force
                            <bold>F</bold><sub>n</sub> applied to the nucleus arises from the
                        conditions of impenetrability (see above) and from the forces applied to the
                        centrosome node. The latter are calculated the same way as for the generic
                        microtubule node (see above). The position of the nucleus center
                            <bold>x</bold><sub>n</sub> is updated as follows, in accordance with the
                        above formula for drag and with the forward Euler method:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000260.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
                    <p>The total force moment is also calculated. It arises only from the forces
                        applied to the centrosome, at the distance <italic>R</italic><sub>n</sub>
                        from the nucleus center. (All other forces exerted on the nucleus arise from
                        the impenetrability conditions and are therefore directed to the nucleus
                        center.) Torque balance with the drag force determines the angular velocity
                            <bold>ω</bold> of the nucleus:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000260.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <bold>r</bold> is the vector from the centrosome to the
                        nuclear center. The obtained instantaneous value of <bold>ω</bold>
                        is then used to calculate the displacement of the centrosome node that is
                        due to the nucleus rotation during the time step Δt, and to rotate
                        the vectors of the unstressed microtubule emanation directions.</p>

                    <p>In those special simulations that incorporated the dynamic instability of
                        microtubules, the following algorithm was used. At each time step, a
                        probabilistic decision was made independently for each microtubule, whether
                        to add a new segment to its free end, remove the end segment, or do nothing.
                        A pseudorandom number was generated from a uniform distribution between 0
                        and 1. If the number was smaller than a small parameter <italic>p</italic>,
                        a segment was added. If the random number was larger than
                            1−<italic>p</italic>, a segment was removed. Otherwise, no
                        changes were made. The nondimensional parameter <italic>p</italic> was
                        chosen so that when multiplied by the dimensionality constant

                        length (see physical assumptions above). This algorithm is a discrete
                        implementation of a diffusion-type stochastic process that is used to
                        approximate dynamic instability of microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000260-Maly1">[19]</xref>. New segments
                        added were parallel to the segment that was previously the end segment of
                        the microtubule. When this resulted in a violation of any of the impermeable
                        boundaries, the same rules applied to the new segment as to any microtubule
                        segment that violated the boundaries (see above).</p>
