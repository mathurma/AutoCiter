<abstract>
<p>Urease as a potential target of antimicrobial drugs has received considerable attention given its versatile roles in microbial infection. Development of effective urease inhibitors, however, is a significant challenge due to the deeply buried active site and highly specific substrate of a bacterial urease. Conventionally, urease inhibitors are designed by either targeting the active site or mimicking substrate of urease, which is not efficient. Up to now, only one effective inhibitor—acetohydroxamic acid (AHA)—is clinically available, but it has adverse side effects. Herein, we demonstrate that a clinically used drug, colloidal bismuth subcitrate, utilizes an unusual way to inhibit urease activity, i.e., disruption of urease maturation process via functional perturbation of a metallochaperone, UreG. Similar phenomena were also observed in various pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that UreG may serve as a general target for design of new types of urease inhibitors. Using <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> UreG as a showcase, by virtual screening combined with experimental validation, we show that two compounds targeting UreG also efficiently inhibited urease activity with inhibitory concentration (IC)<sub>50</sub> values of micromolar level, resulting in attenuated virulence of the pathogen. We further demonstrate the efficacy of the compounds in a mammalian cell infection model. This study opens up a new opportunity for the design of more effective urease inhibitors and clearly indicates that metallochaperones involved in the maturation of important microbial metalloenzymes serve as new targets for devising a new type of antimicrobial drugs.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Urease, a metalloenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, plays important roles in the survival and virulence of many microbial pathogens, and has long been considered an important drug target for the development of novel antimicrobials. However, its deeply buried active site and highly specific substrate of bacterial urease make it very challenging to design effective urease inhibitors by conventional approaches. In this study, we reveal that a bismuth-based drug (colloidal bismuth subcitrate) inhibits urease activity in an unusual way. This drug binds the urease accessary protein UreG and inhibits its GTPase activity, thus perturbing nickel insertion into the apo-urease, a process called urease maturation. UreG is therefore proposed as an alternative target for the development of urease inhibitors. Using <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> UreG as an example, combined with virtual screening and experimental validation, we further show that several small molecules that bind and functionally disrupt UreG could indeed inhibit urease activity in bacteria and in a cell infection model and possess potent antimicrobial activity. In summary, we discovered metallochaperone UreG as a new target for the design of urease inhibitors. Such a strategy should have a broad application in the development of metalloenzyme inhibitors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enzymes have been proven to serve as important drug targets, and enzyme inhibitors are among the most successful drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref001">1</xref>]. One dominant strategy for enzyme-targeted drug design lies in the discovery or synthesis of structure analogues of substrates that resemble the enzyme’s reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref002">2</xref>]. However, such a strategy might be restrained if the active sites of enzymes are not solvent exposed or if the substrates of enzymes are highly specific. This is the case for urease, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea in plants, fungi, and many pathogenic bacteria into ammonia and carbonic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref003">3</xref>]. X-ray structures of ureases reveal that the conserved active sites consist of a bis-μ-hydroxo dimeric nickel center deeply buried in the supramolecular assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref005">5</xref>]. Moreover, urease has a highly specific substrate, i.e., urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref005">5</xref>]. This makes it very challenging for the development of urease inhibitors by conventional methods. Alternative strategies are urgently needed to design urease inhibitors.</p>
<p>Urease has been recognized as a general microbial virulence factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref003">3</xref>]. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> relies on urease to invade the host epithelial cells and ensure successful colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref006">6</xref>]. The increased pH of the urinary system led by urease from <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> may result in the formation of urinary and kidney stones, catheter occlusion, and kidney infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref007">7</xref>]. Moreover, survival of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species in the phagolysosomes of infected cells depends on its urease activity to neutralize the local acid to avoid the destructive effect caused by cathepsins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref008">8</xref>]. Recently, the roles of urease during fungal infections in humans are beginning to be recognized. For example, urease from <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> has been observed to facilitate the crossing of the blood–brain barrier in a mice model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the importance of urease in the virulence of microbial pathogens, urease is thus considered one of the most important targets in the development of drugs, especially for the treatment of gastric and urinary infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref011">11</xref>]. Up to now, urease inhibitors were designed exclusively by either attacking the metallocenter or mimicking the substrate of ureases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref013">13</xref>]. In spite of enormous efforts being made, only one compound—acetohydroxamic acid (AHA)—with anti-urease activity has been used clinically for the treatment of urinary tract infections together with antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref014">14</xref>]. Unfortunately, adverse side effects, including inhibition of the biosynthesis of bone marrow, depressed DNA synthesis, and malformation of embryos at high doses, have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref015">15</xref>]. The potential of urease as a target for antimicrobial agents, therefore, has not yet been fully explored.</p>
<p>As apo-urease synthesized in microbes is inactive, urease exerts its function only if nickel is inserted into its active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref016">16</xref>]. The assembly of the active site of bacterial ureases, a process also called urease maturation, is a complex and guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-dependent process, involving the cooperative actions of several accessory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref016">16</xref>]. For example, the canonical urease system in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> requires UreE, UreF, UreG, and UreH to facilitate activation of the UreAB apo-enzyme. It has been proposed that nickel translocation from UreE to UreG is triggered by the formation of UreE-UreG (2E-2G) complex. Subsequently, Ni-UreG binds to UreF/H to form a supercomplex as an apo-urease/UreF-H-G, in which the final step of nickel insertion into the apo-urease is completed upon the GTP hydrolysis by UreG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref017">17</xref>]. Homologs of UreF, UreG, and UreH/D can also be found in urease-producing eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref016">16</xref>], indicating the maturation of urease is relatively conserved among different species. We therefore envision that disruption of urease maturation process to inactivate its function might serve as a superior strategy for the design of new types of inhibitors.</p>
<p>Urease is known to be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, a transmissible human pathogen strongly related to gastrointestinal diseases including gastritis, peptic ulcers, and even stomach cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref018">18</xref>]. The bismuth-based quadruple therapy has been used clinically as first-line therapy and surprisingly shown excellent success in eradication of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, even for antibiotic resistance strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref021">21</xref>]. However, the mechanism of action of bismuth drugs is not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref022">22</xref>]. Although it has been hypothesized that bismuth drugs may exert antimicrobial action via inhibition of urease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref023">23</xref>], our previous study on jack bean and <italic>Klebsiella aerogenes</italic> ureases showed that bismuth compounds exert very low in vitro activity towards inhibition of urease and could not displace nickel from urease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref024">24</xref>]. Given the critical role of urease in the survival and pathogenesis of the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref018">18</xref>], it is highly possible that bismuth inhibits urease activity via an alternative approach rather than direct perturbation on the active site. The knowledge of how bismuth exerts its inhibition on <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> urease may promote discovery of new targets for the development of antimicrobial agents.</p>
<p>In this report, we first elucidated the mechanism of action of a clinically used bismuth drug, colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), on inhibition of urease of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> with the aim of searching for new targets for design of urease inhibitors. We demonstrate that the bismuth drug inhibited urease activity in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> through binding to the urease accessary protein UreG, thus perturbing its GTPase activity and leading to subsequent disruption of urease maturation. Such a phenomenon was also found in other pathogenic bacteria. Using <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> UreG as a target, two compounds were identified by virtual screening and subsequently verified to attenuate urease activity attributable to the disturbance of essential chaperones and exhibited comparable or even better antimicrobial activity towards <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> compared to bismuth drug CBS or AHA with IC<sub>50(urease)</sub> values at micromolar levels. The efficacy of these compounds was further confirmed in a mammalian cell infection model. Overall, our studies offer a new strategy for design of urease inhibitors, as well as a novel paradigm for rational design of a new type of antimicrobial.</p>

<title>Bismuth inhibits urease activity through binding and functional perturbation of UreG</title>
<p>Given the critical role of urease in the pathogenesis of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and the success of bismuth-based drugs in the treatment of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection, urease has been proposed to be a key target of bismuth drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref023">23</xref>]. However, previous studies showed that bismuth exhibited trivial effects on urease activity even at high concentration (up to several mM level) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref026">26</xref>], which is unlikely to be accountable for its in vivo activity. We hypothesized that Bi(III) might inhibit urease activity indirectly, such as through disruption of urease maturation. To search which urease accessory proteins bound to Bi(III), we employed a homemade fluorescent probe Bi-<italic>NTA-AC</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref027">27</xref>], similar to Ni-<italic>NTA-AC</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref028">28</xref>], that can rapidly enter live cells to fluorescently label metal binding proteins in our recent report; the labelled proteins can be identified subsequently by proteomics upon photoactivation of arylazide of the probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref029">29</xref>]. Urease-related proteins lightened up by the probe are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1A</xref>.

<p>We further monitored the interactions of Bi(III) with these chaperones in vitro by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Titration of up to four molar equivalents of Bi(III) (as Bi nitrilotriacetic acid [NTA]) into solutions of apo-UreE or -UreFH complex led to negligible changes in the UV spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s003">S1 Fig</xref>), in agreement with in vivo data that UreE and UreF/H do not interact with Bi(III). In contrast, upon addition of Bi(III) to apo-UreG solution, a peak centered at about 350 nm, assignable to the π(S)(Cys)→Bi(III) ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref030">30</xref>], appeared, increased its intensities, and levelled off at a molar ratio of [BiNTA]/[UreG] of ca. 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating that two Bi(III) ions bound to each UreG monomer. The titration data were nonlinearly fitted via Ryan–Weber equation, and by taking account of Bi-NTA binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref030">30</xref>], an apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of Bi(III) to UreG was determined to be 3.1 × 10<sup>−24</sup> M. As UreG contains only two cysteine residues on the protein surface, Cys48 and Cys66 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref031">31</xref>], we prepared either single (UreG-C48A or UreG-C66A) or double mutants (UreG-C48C66A) of UreG and performed similar experiments. As expected, titration of Bi(III) into solutions of either UreG-C48A or UreG-C66A resulted in increases in intensities of the peak centered at approximately 350 nm with plateaus reached at [BiNTA]/[Protein] of 1:1. In contrast, titration of Bi(III) into UreG-C48C66A led to no absorbance at 350 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s003">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating that both Cys48 and Cys66 of UreG participated in the binding of Bi(III).</p>
<p>As Cys66 is involved in the binding of Ni(II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref031">31</xref>], it is highly possible that Bi(III) perturbs the Ni(II) coordination to the protein. Indeed, titration of Ni(II) (as NiSO<sub>4</sub>) into the Bi-UreG solution resulted in no changes in the UV spectra in the presence of GTP and Mg(II) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s004">S2 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the metal binding site became inaccessible to Ni(II) once it was occupied by Bi(III). Unexpectedly, stepwise addition of up to three molar equivalents of Bi(III) to Ni-UreG did not suppress the characteristic peak at approximately 337 nm (π(S)(Cys)→Ni(II) LMCT), while the peak at approximately 350 nm (π(S)(Cys)→Bi(III) LMCT) remained undetectable, indicating the lack of Bi(III) coordination to UreG protein when the metal binding site was preloaded with Ni(II) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s004">S2 Fig</xref>). However, in the presence of GTPase-activating element KHCO<sub>3</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref017">17</xref>], gradual addition of Bi(III) to UreG solution led to a decrease in the intensity and complete disappearance of the peak at approximately 337 nm accompanied by the emergence of a peak at approximately 350 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s004">S2 Fig</xref>), indicative of the simultaneous replacement of Ni(II) ions by Bi(III) from UreG protein. In contrast, titration of Bi(III) into Ni-UreG solution in the presence of KHCO<sub>3</sub> and GTPγs (a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP) did not disturbed characteristic Ni-binding peak, while the typical Bi coordination peak at 350 nm was unnoticeable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s004">S2 Fig</xref>). Taken together, we demonstrate that Bi(III) only disturbed UreG dimer at its GTPase transition state (i.e., in the presence of GTPase-activating elements), but not at its stable Ni, GTP-bound state.</p>
<p>Binding of Bi(III) to UreG also induced the tertiary structural changes of Ni-bound UreG in the presence of KHCO<sub>3</sub> as revealed by gel filtration chromatography. Incubation of Bi(III) with Ni-UreG (in the presence of KHCO<sub>3</sub>) led to a decrease in the intensity of UreG dimer peak, which was eluted at approximately 13 ml, and appearance of new peaks at elution volumes of approximately 18 ml and approximately 6 ml, with the former assignable to GTP molecule and the latter to high molecular weight oligomer of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s005">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined the effects of Bi-UreG interaction on the formation of UreE-UreG and UreG-UreFH complexes, which are crucial for the Ni(II) delivery into the Ni-containing active site of urease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref031">31</xref>]. A previous study revealed that the active complex UreE-UreG was assembled by an UreE dimer and an UreG dimer (i.e., 2E-2G), while UreG-FH complex was assembled as a dimer of UreG/F/H (i.e., 2G-2F-2H) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref031">31</xref>]. Incubation of Bi(III) with UreE-UreG led to the complete disappearance of 2E-2G peak, which was eluted at approximately 11.8 ml in gel filtration chromatography, accompanied by the appearance of a new broad peak at elution volumes of approximately 13 ml (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). Notably, supplementation of Bi(III) had no effects on the elution volumes of UreE dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s006">S4 Fig</xref>), implying that Bi(III) disrupted the formation of 2E-2G complex through targeting UreG. Similarly, UreG was dissociated from 2G-2F-2H complex without disrupting the 2F-2H complex upon Bi(III) incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These data confirm that binding of Bi(III) to UreG disturbed the protein–protein complexation, which is essential for urease maturation.</p>
<p>We then investigated the effects of Bi-UreG interaction on the enzymatic activity of UreG by carrying out GTPase assay in the absence and presence of Bi(III). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, a very low GTPase activity was observed for apo-UreG; upon incubation of apo-UreG with Ni(II), maximum GTPase activity was achieved, confirming the necessity of Ni(II) ions for the function of UreG as a GTPase. Addition of equimolar amounts of Bi(III) to Ni-UreG led to a drop in GTPase activity by 60%, and further addition of Bi(III) resulted in complete inhibition of the enzyme activity, signifying that binding of Bi(III) completely abolished GTPase activity of UreG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>We subsequently evaluated the effects of binding of Bi(III) to UreG on the activity of urease using cell lysate of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> harboring plasmid pHP8080ΔG, which consists of the urease gene cluster except <italic>ureG</italic> (as <italic>ureABIEFH</italic>Δ<italic>G</italic>). Purified UreG protein with or without treatment of Ni(II) or Bi(III) ions was supplemented to the system sequentially. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, the maximum urease activity (normalized to 100%) was achieved only when Ni-UreG was supplemented into the cell lysate. In contrast, no observable urease activity was found when apo-UreG was added. When stoichiometric amounts of Bi(III) ions were added to Ni-UreG, the urease activity was decreased by 50% and further addition of two or three molar equivalents of Bi(III) ions to Ni-UreG led to complete abolishment of urease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), demonstrating that the inactivation of urease is attributable to Bi(III) binding to UreG. We also investigated the influence of CBS on the GTPase and urease activity in bacterial cells. The <italic>ureG</italic> gene was complemented to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells harboring plasmid pHP8080ΔG, after which the GTPase and ureolytic activities of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells were monitored simultaneously. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s007">S5 Fig</xref>, treatment of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> with increasing amounts of CBS during bacterial growth resulted in the dramatic concerted declines in both the ureolytic and GTPase activities to approximately 20% compared with those without CBS treatment, implying that binding of Bi(III) to UreG abolished its enzymatic activity, leading to inactivation of urease through disruption of urease maturation in engineered bacterium.</p>

<title>Bismuth disrupts urease maturation in pathogenic bacteria</title>
<p>We have shown that a Bi(III) drug (CBS) can inhibit urease activation at relatively low concentration (μM level) through functional disruption of chaperone UreG in vitro and in an engineered bacterium.

<p>We then measured the nickel content in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> cells with or without supplementation of Bi(III) to culture medium. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s008">S6 Fig</xref>, only a slight decline in nickel content was noticed upon supplementation of CBS, indicating that Bi(III) did not influence the influx of Ni(II) into bacterial cells. We have shown previously that the expression levels of the urease system were not significantly altered upon treatment with Bi(III)-based drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref025">25</xref>]. We reason that the urease extracted from bacterial lysate might have already been maturated, i.e., urease exists in the Ni-bound form, and in this case, Bi(III) cannot replace Ni(II) from the active site. On the other hand, a newly synthesized urease exists in an apo-form and is inactive, which requires urease accessary proteins for maturation. Binding of bismuth drugs to UreG may thus disrupt urease maturation in live bacterial cells. Indeed, when gradient amounts of Ni-bound urease accessory protein UreG were incubated with CBS-treated <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> cell lysate, the urease activity was recovered by about 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), corroborating the theory that the reduced ureolytic activity of urease is likely due to the Ni(II)-deficiency in the active site of enzyme. Notably, supplementation of Ni(II) ions alone or CBS-treated Ni-UreG to the bacterial cell lysate failed to restore the urease activity completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), pinpointing that bismuth drugs inhibited urease activity via targeting accessory protein UreG in vivo.</p>
<p>Strikingly, similar phenomena were also observed when CBS was supplied to the culture of various bacterial species (either gram-negative or gram-positive, even some clinically isolated strains), including <italic>P</italic>. <italic>mirabilis</italic>, <italic>K</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>hongkongensis</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>saprophyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Importantly, CBS showed more potent efficiency than AHA towards inhibition of urease activity in all tested bacterial species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s009">S7 Fig</xref>). Maturation of ureases from these bacteria also require similar accessary proteins, especially the Ni-dependent GTPase UreG is much conserved among all these bacterial species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s010">S8 Fig</xref>). Inhibition of urease activity in vivo by bismuth drugs via disruption of urease maturation appears to be a general feature irrespective of the bacterial species. UreG might, therefore, serve as an alternative target for the design of potent urease inhibitors.</p>

<title>UreG serves as a novel target for design of new antimicrobial agents</title>
<p>As bismuth inhibits urease via disruption of its maturation through perturbation of UreG, we envision that small molecules that functionally disrupt the GTPase activity of UreG could potentially be effective inhibitors of urease in microbes. To validate this hypothesis, we performed a virtual screening using AutoDock Vina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref032">32</xref>]. As bismuth inhibits UreG activity by targeting the nickel binding site, which is located on the surface of UreG, we first attempted to find small molecules that could bind to this metal binding site; unfortunately, our initial screening resulted in no hits. We then turned our attention to search for small molecules that may block the guanine nucleotide binding pocket, which is located next to the nickel binding site, given that the contact between nucleotide binding pocket and metal binding site is essential for the nickel insertion into apo-urease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref031">31</xref>]. UreG structure from <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> (PDB 4HI0) was used as the docking receptor. A set of 1,700 compounds collected from the databases PubChem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref033">33</xref>] and BindingDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref034">34</xref>] were used for the screening. Three hundred of these compounds are active compounds as GTPase inhibitors based on the PubChem database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref033">33</xref>], and 1,400 of them showed a potential interaction with a G-protein in different species based on BindingDB. We ranked the 1,700 compounds based on their docking scores. Out of this screening and based on structural features, physical chemistry properties, and drug-like characteristics, the top 20 compounds were selected for further analysis. Eleven out of these 20 compounds were purchased for further bioactivity testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s011">S9 Fig</xref>). Five compounds (<bold>cmpd2, cmpd4, cmpd8, cmpd10, cmpd11</bold>) could inhibit the GTPase activity of UreG by 37% to 72%; subsequent urease assays showed that two compounds (<bold>cmpd4, cmpd8</bold>) exhibited very good activity (by ca. 60% and 90%, respectively) towards inhibition of urease activity in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s012">S10 Fig</xref>).

<title>cmpd4 and cmpd8 bind to UreG</title>
<p>To investigate whether both <bold>cmpd4</bold> and <bold>cmpd8</bold> bind UreG, we applied a thermal shift assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s013">S11 Fig</xref>, in comparison to <bold>cmpd1</bold>, which is inactive to inhibit UreG activity, <bold>cmpd4</bold> and <bold>cmpd8</bold> induced thermal shifts (approximately 2.5°C) on the melting temperature of UreG, indicative of binding between the compounds and UreG. Given that UreG itself displays a fluorescent signal at around 310 nm and 335 nm upon excitation at 280 nm, which corresponds to emission of intrinsic Tyr and Trp of UreG, respectively, we further characterized the binding of the compounds to UreG by measurement of the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of UreG upon addition of the compounds. The addition of <bold>cmpd4</bold> and <bold>cmpd8</bold> showed negligible effect on the absorption of incident radiation of UreG at 280 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s014">S12 Fig</xref>), whereas with the addition of <bold>cmpd4</bold> and <bold>cmpd8</bold>, the peaks at 310 nm and 335 nm (corresponding to emission of UreG) were reduced gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>); binding affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of UreG to <bold>cmpd4</bold> and <bold>cmpd8</bold> were determined to be 10.6 ± 2.3 and 7.5 ± 3.6 μM, respectively, by nonlinear fitting the curve of fluorescent changes at 310 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). <bold>cmpd4</bold> is a self-fluorescent molecule with its excitations at 250 nm, 280 nm, and 310 nm, and emission at 410 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s015">S13 Fig</xref>); upon addition of <bold>cmpd4</bold>, the emission peak of 410 nm was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Interestingly, as one of the excitations of <bold>cmpd4</bold> (310 nm) overlapped with the emission peak of UreG, the presence of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between UreG and <bold>cmpd4</bold> was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s016">S14 Fig</xref>). For comparison, we also determined the binding affinity of substrate GTP to UreG to be around 65 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s017">S15 Fig</xref>), indicating that <bold>cmpd4</bold> and <bold>cmpd8</bold> exhibited higher affinity towards UreG than GTP.</p>

<p>Computational models were built to reveal the potential binding interfaces between <bold>cmpd4</bold>/<bold>cmpd8</bold> and UreG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). The binding sites of small molecules were located at the guanine nucleotide binding pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s018">S16 Fig</xref>), involving G1 motif (P-loop, magenta color) and G4 motif (NKXD motif). The main chain amide groups of G1 motif wrapped around both <bold>cmpd4</bold> and <bold>cmpd8</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). For <bold>cmpd4</bold>, the side chain of T15 in G1 motif formed a hydrogen bond with an O atom of <bold>cmpd4</bold>, whereas <bold>cmpd8</bold> was stabilized by the side chains of K146 and D148 in G4 motif. Aliphatic regions of R179 and K146 (red) in G4 motif had extensive hydrophobic interactions with small molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>To further confirm the interface between UreG and small molecules generated from computational models, we then constructed an UreG mutant (UreGΔNKXD) by replacing selected residues (N145, K146, D148) with Ala to disrupt G4 motif, which abolished GTP binding of UreG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s019">S17 Fig</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s020">S18 Fig</xref>, mutation of these amino acids weakened the binding of UreG to <bold>cmpd4</bold> and <bold>cmpd8</bold>, with binding affinities of 34.7 and 33.4 μM. respectively.</p>
<p>We further investigated whether binding of <bold>cmpd4</bold> or <bold>cmpd8</bold> to the guanine nucleotide binding pocket perturbed the Ni(II) coordination to the protein. Considering that coordination of Ni(II) to UreG results in a (Cys)→Ni(II) LMCT band centered at about 337 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref017">17</xref>], we monitored the UV absorption of UreG samples (5 μM) at 337 nm upon titration of nickel with or without the supplement of <bold>cmpd4</bold> or <bold>cmpd8</bold>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s021">S19 Fig</xref>, <bold>cmpd4</bold> at a ratio of [cmpd4]/[UreG] of 5 and 10 reduced the percentages of Ni(II)-bound UreG to ca. 75% and 30%, respectively, and a similar phenomenon was also observed for <bold>cmpd8</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s021">S19 Fig</xref>), indicative of the disruption of nickel binding property of UreG through targeting nucleotide binding site.</p>

<p>We next investigated whether such small molecule inhibitors of urease could be used to treat bacterial infection in a mammalian cell culture infection model. It has been demonstrated that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> exerts toxic effect on host cells via producing ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref036">36</xref>].

After 24 h of bacterial infection, the viability of AGS cells exposed to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> was determined, and the ammonia concentration in medium was measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g005">Fig 5</xref>, compared to the control group, the survival rate of cultured AGS cells exposed to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> without small molecule urease inhibitors or with only DMSO in the medium dropped to only 28.8% ± 4.4% and 27.1% ± 5.4% respectively. With the addition of AHA to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, viability of AGS cells was determined to be 40.5% ± 8.2%. In contrast, survival rates of AGS cells exposed to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> with the addition of CBS, <bold>cmpd4</bold>, and <bold>cmpd8</bold> were 65.8% ± 9.9%, 70.3% ± 11.3%, and 81.1% ± 11.3%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Accordingly, the ammonia concentrations in culture medium of the bacteria (HP), bacteria with DMSO treatment (HP + DMSO), and with AHA (HP + AHA) groups were ca. 2.5 mM, which are significantly higher than those groups treated with CBS (HP + CBS) or <bold>cmpd4</bold>/<bold>cmpd8</bold> (HP + cmpd), in which the ammonia concentrations were around 1.1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Metalloenzymes serve as potentially druggable targets. Many existing drugs, including acetazolamide and romidepsin, have been designed by targeting zinc metalloenzymes, thus neutralizing their catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref037">37</xref>]. A common strategy for development of metalloenzyme inhibitors lies in either synthesis of small molecules directly targeting the active sites or identification of substrate mimics that bind to the enzyme with high affinity. However, many metalloenzymes possess complex structures comprising multiple subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref038">38</xref>] with the active sites buried deep inside, which makes it difficult to design enzyme inhibitors for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, the high substrate specificity of many enzymes also hinders the drug development. This is exemplified by bacterial ureases, which have a supramolecular assembly and high substrate specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref005">5</xref>]. Although urease has long been recognized as a critical virulence factor for microbial pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref003">3</xref>], there appears to be only one urease inhibitor (AHA) clinically available, and even that has detrimental side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref039">39</xref>]. Alternative strategies are therefore needed to fully explore the potential of urease as an antimicrobial target. Given that insertion of metal cofactors to the active sites of metalloenzymes, namely enzyme maturation, is a prerequisite for full enzymatic activity, and often involving a series of metallochaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref040">40</xref>], whereas metallochaperones of bacterial ureases are generally small proteins but essential for assembling the active sites of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref043">43</xref>], these metallochaperones might serve as better targets than metalloenzyme itself for designing urease inhibitors.</p>
<p>Bismuth drugs have been used clinically to treat <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> infection since its first discovery; however, the mechanism of action remains obscure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref022">22</xref>]. In this report, we intend to understand how bismuth inhibits urease activity in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and aim to discover a new target for designing urease inhibitors. By utilizing a homemade fluorescent probe, Bi-<italic>NTA-AC</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref027">27</xref>], we show that UreG, which plays a crucial role in urease maturation in microbial pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref003">3</xref>], appeared to be the only accessary protein that was found to bind Bi(III) in bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Binding of Bi(III) to UreG led to dissociation of the protein–protein complexes, e.g., UreE-UreG and UreG-UreF-UreH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s005">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), that are important for urease maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref044">44</xref>]. Consequently, bismuth drugs completely abolished the GTPase activity of UreG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). We further demonstrate that bismuth drugs inactivated urease indirectly by disruption of urease maturation via inhibition of UreG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s007">S5 Fig</xref>). This is further confirmed by the observation that CBS could efficiently inhibit urease activity of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> only in live pathogens, but not for matured urease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The newly expressed urease in live bacterium is in an apo-form, and binding of CBS to UreG disrupted the delivery of nickel cofactor to the active site of urease. In contrast, inhibition of urease activity in vitro was very inefficient, even at millimolar concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref024">24</xref>]; this is attributable to the deeply buried active sites of urease, which is less prone to be attacked by inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref005">5</xref>]. Our combined data provide solid evidence on the inefficiency of urease inhibitors designed based on directly targeting the active site of urease.</p>
<p>Besides its well-known role in acid acclimation for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, urease is also associated with the development of infection stones caused by bacterial urinary tract infections, including those caused by <italic>Klebsiella</italic> and <italic>Proteus</italic> species. Moreover, emerging roles of urease in different processes of microbial infection have also been established, such as participating in nitrogen metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref046">46</xref>], resisting peroxynitrite pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref047">47</xref>], avoiding destruction by phagolysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref008">8</xref>], and facilitating pathogen crossing of the blood–brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref009">9</xref>]. Apparently, there is a great medical urgency for the development of urease inhibitors to treat urease-related microbial infections, which has not been fully explored. In this study, we further show that inactivation of urease activity via disruption of urease maturation process by bismuth was not specific for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>. Instead, similar phenomena were also found in several other bacterial pathogens, such as <italic>P</italic>. <italic>mirabilis</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>K</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>hongkongensis</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>saprophyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Thus, it is highly possible that CBS, which is already a clinically used anti-ulcer drug, could be repurposed for the clinical use of treating urease-related microbial infection.</p>
<p>Moreover, considering that UreG is highly conserved among urease-producing microbial species, UreG might serve as a good target for the design of urease inhibitors. Using <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> UreG as a showcase, we performed a virtual screening from 1,700 compounds and tested 11 hits. Our detailed validation shows that two compounds exhibited good inhibition towards GTPase activity of UreG with IC<sub>50</sub> at μM level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Moreover, these two compounds exhibited more potent inhibitory effects on urease activity in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> cells than the clinically used urease inhibitor AHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Distinct from CBS, these two small molecules targeted nucleotide binding pockets instead of nickel binding sites of UreG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s018">S16 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s020">S18 Fig</xref>). The efficacy of the two lead compounds was further validated both in culture medium of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and in a mammalian cell infection model. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Taken together, we demonstrate that the compounds targeting UreG could indeed inhibit urease activity and therefore possess potent antimicrobial activity.</p>
<p>Hydroxamic acids are the most widely studied group of urease inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref013">13</xref>]. They inhibit urease through attacking the nickel ions in the active site of urease owing to their well-known metal-complexing properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref048">48</xref>]. However, this kind of compounds exerts only moderate inhibitory activity (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s009">S7 Fig</xref>, the IC<sub>50</sub> values of AHA against maturated ureases reach as high as mM level). Although AHA has been introduced into clinical use for urinary tract infections, high doses (approximately 1,000 mg/d for adults) are required due to its relatively low anti-urease activity; thus, severe side effects are noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref013">13</xref>]. Another group of urease inhibitors, which were considered as substrate analogues, shares similar structural characteristics with urea and competes with the substrate binding. Due to high specificity of urea to urease, such inhibitors also only exhibit moderate activity; for example, boric acid acts as a competitive inhibitor of urease from jack bean, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>mirabilis</italic>, and <italic>K</italic>. <italic>aerogenes</italic>, with <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> values at mM levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref012">12</xref>]. In contrast, CBS, <bold>cmpd4</bold>, and <bold>cmpd8</bold> inactivated urease in bacteria through targeting accessory protein UreG, either at nickel binding site or GTP binding site, exhibiting more potent activity than clinically used AHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003887.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s009">S7 Fig</xref>). Current compound libraries used in this study were designed for mammalian protein targets such as <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref033">33</xref>]. <bold>cmpd4</bold> and <bold>cmpd8</bold> have also been found to be active in several high throughput screenings (HTSs) against targets in human cells, such as G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), Interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), and Regulator of G-protein Signaling 7 (RGS7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref052">52</xref>]. As expected, these compounds might exhibit toxicity to mammalian cells. Indeed, administration of small molecule inhibitors to AGS cells infected by <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> resulted in low viability of AGS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003887.s022">S20 Fig</xref>), due to the toxicity of small compounds to mammalian cells. Therefore, it may be necessary to fine-tune structures of <bold>cmpd4</bold> and <bold>cmpd8</bold> to increase their selectivity and potency based on the rationale that the structure and regulation of bacterial GTPase UreG is distinct from mammalian proteins.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that UreG was selected as a showcase study, such a strategy should have a broad application in the development of metalloenzyme inhibitors. Indeed, proteins that are involved in metalation pathways have also been considered as good targets for the development of new classes of pharmaceutical agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref053">53</xref>]. A recent study also demonstrated that small molecules that inhibit the human copper trafficking proteins Atox1 and CCS significantly reduce proliferation of cancer cells, suggesting copper chaperones as new targets for the development of anticancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003887.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, we have discovered a metallochaperone, UreG, as a new target for the design of urease inhibitors based on extensive mechanistic study of bismuth inhibition of urease. Using virtual screening in combination with experimental validation, we demonstrate that compounds that bind and functionally perturb GTPase activity of UreG could indeed inhibit urease activity both in culture medium of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> and in a mammalian cell infection model. Our study clearly indicates that metallochaperones participating in maturation of important microbial metalloenzymes serve as new targets for devising antimicrobial drugs. In comparison with conventional antibiotics, such antimicrobials might have less likelihood of encountering antimicrobial resistance in pathogens, considering the crucial roles of these metalloenzymes in microbial pathogenesis that are less susceptible to mutation.</p>

<title>Interplay between Bi(III) and Ni(II) binding to UreG.</title>
<p>Given the critical role of GTP and Mg(II) in Ni-binding of UreG, UV spectroscopic studies were carried out in HEPES buffer containing 100 μM GTP and 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>. (A) UV spectra of Bi-UreG upon addition of zero to two molar equivalents of Ni(II) ions. (B) UV spectra of Ni-UreG upon incubation with up to three molar equivalents of Bi(III) ions. It is noted that addition of Bi(III) to Ni-UreG did not suppress the characteristic peak at approximately 337 nm (π(S)(Cys)→Ni(II) LMCT), while the LMCT peak of π(S)(Cys)→Bi(III) (approximately 350 nm) remained undetectable, indicating the lack of Bi(III) coordination to UreG protein when the metal binding site is preloaded with Ni(II). (C) UV spectra of Ni-UreG upon incubation with up to three molar equivalents of Bi(III) ions in the presence of GTPase-activating element KHCO<sub>3</sub> (1 mM). Gradual addition of Bi(III) to UreG solution led to a decrease in intensity of the peak at approximately 337 nm and the emergence of a peak at approximately 350 nm, indicative of the simultaneous replacement of Ni(II) ions by Bi(III) on UreG protein. (D) UV spectra of Ni-UreG(GTPγs) upon incubation with up to three molar equivalents of Bi(III) ions in the presence of KHCO<sub>3</sub> (1 mM). The characteristic Ni-binding peak was not disturbed, while the typical Bi coordination peak was unnoticeable even after the supplementation of excess Bi(III). It is noted that Bi(III) only disturbs UreG dimer at its GTPase transition state (i.e., in the presence of GTPase-activating elements), but not at its stable Ni, GTP-bound state.</p>

<title>Gel filtration profiles of protein UreGΔNKXD with or without GTPγs.</title>
<p>UreG recognizes GTP using the canonical NKXD motif (G4) and is likely to form UreG dimer upon Ni and GTP binding. To examine the effect of the triple mutagenesis (N145A/K146A/D148A) on GTP binding of UreG, UreGΔNKXD (10 μM) was incubated with or without GTPγs (30 μM) in HEPES buffer (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 30 μM NiSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) and was subjected to gel filtration chromatography. Both UreGΔNKXD samples (with or without GTPγs) were eluted as monomers at approximately 14 ml, and the intensity of peaks at approximately 18 ml corresponding to GTPγs in the presence of UreGΔNKXD remained unchanged compared with that of GTPγs alone, implying that UreGΔNKXD has no GTP binding ability.</p>
