      <abstract>
        <p>Metazoans display remarkable conservation of gene families, including growth factors, yet somehow these genes are used in different ways to generate tremendous morphological diversity. While variations in the magnitude and spatio-temporal aspects of signaling by a growth factor can generate different body patterns, how these signaling variations are organized and coordinated during development is unclear. Basic body plans are organized by the end of gastrulation and are refined as limbs, organs, and nervous systems co-develop. Despite their proximity to developing tissues, neurons are primarily thought to act after development, on behavior. Here, we show that in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the axonal projections of neurons regulate tissue progenitor responses to Wnts so that certain organs develop with the correct morphology at the right axial positions. We find that foreshortening of the posteriorly directed axons of the two canal-associated neurons (CANs) disrupts mid-body vulval morphology, and produces ectopic vulval tissue in the posterior epidermis, in a Wnt-dependent manner. We also provide evidence that suggests that the posterior CAN axons modulate the location and strength of Wnt signaling along the anterior–posterior axis by employing a Ror family Wnt receptor to bind posteriorly derived Wnts, and hence, refine their distributions. Surprisingly, despite high levels of Ror expression in many other cells, these cells cannot substitute for the CAN axons in patterning the epidermis, nor can cells expressing a secreted Wnt inhibitor, SFRP-1. Thus, unmyelinated axon tracts are critical for patterning the <italic>C. elegans</italic> body. Our findings suggest that the evolution of neurons not only improved metazoans by increasing behavioral complexity, but also by expanding the diversity of developmental patterns generated by growth factors such as Wnts.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>How a limited number of conserved growth factors such as Wnts generate diverse bodies throughout the animal kingdom is a fundamental question in developmental and evolutionary biology. Diversity is thought to arise in part through variations in the strength and location of growth factor signaling. How the signaling properties of growth factors are precisely tuned at specific locations to generate distinct tissue patterns is not well understood. Here, we present evidence that the axons of two specific neurons that span the anterior–posterior axis help pattern the epidermis of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. When the posteriorly directed axons of these neurons fail to grow to their normal length, the symmetry of the mid-body vulva is altered, and additional vulval tissue inappropriately forms in the posterior epidermis. We further present evidence that these neurons direct epidermal patterning by binding and sequestering posteriorly derived Wnts, thereby refining the strength and location of Wnt signaling along the anterior–posterior axis. We postulate that the evolution of neurons not only improved animals by endowing them with complex behaviors, but also by helping expand the diversity of body patterns generated by growth factors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Metazoan body plans display great morphological diversity in their overall organization and detailed patterns. Yet remarkably, these plans are generated from a small number of conserved growth factors that are reused many times during development to refine the plans in distinct ways. Thus, determining how a limited number of growth factors create different body patterns is key to understanding this diversity. It is known that variations in the magnitude and spatio-temporal aspects of signaling by growth factors and their effectors generate different cellular responses and body patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Nellen1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Zecca1">[3]</xref>. However, the mechanisms by which a developing animal organizes and coordinates the correct amplitudes of signaling at the right times and places are not well understood.</p>
      <p>Wnts comprise one of the oldest families of growth factors, and have conserved functions in organizing and refining body plans. In many metazoan embryos, Wnts are initially expressed from one pole, with their diffusion generating polarity and early patterning of the primary body axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Petersen1">[4]</xref>. During and after gastrulation, Wnt gradients, often derived from the posterior body, continue to establish basic identities in the body plan, and then refine these fates to create specific tissue and organ patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Petersen1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Gilbert1">[6]</xref>. As animals develop, it becomes increasingly challenging to spatially organize Wnt activity into the appropriate high and low signaling domains throughout the body. Furthermore, this organization must be coordinated between the multiple Wnts and other growth factors that pattern tissues and organs. Perhaps as a reflection of these challenges, numerous secreted and membrane-associated inhibitors have been identified that help modulate Wnt gradient activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-MacDonald1">[10]</xref>. However, our knowledge of what a Wnt gradient must look like to pattern a specific limb or organ is very limited, as is our understanding of the distinct roles of the different antagonists.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the generation of a vulva in the middle of the anterior–posterior axis has become a paradigm for understanding how Wnt and EGF family growth factors generate specific patterns at precise locations (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Sternberg1">[11]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Vulval organogenesis begins with the mid-body generation of six vulval progenitors from 11 blast cells. These progenitors (P3.p–P8.p) are specified by two posteriorly derived Wnt gradients (EGL-20 and CWN-1 [orange and green, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1</xref>]) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Coudreuse1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Whangbo1">[15]</xref>, with EGL-20 also polarizing some of the progenitors to face towards the posterior (e.g., P5.p and P7.p) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green2">[16]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Later, mid-body-produced Wnts (LIN-44 and MOM-2 [blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1</xref>]) reverse P7.p polarity so that P5.p and P7.p face each other and subsequently divide with mirror image symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Inoue1">[17]</xref>. With the help of the posterior Wnts (EGL-20 and CWN-1), centrally produced EGF (purple in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1</xref>) instructs P6.p to adopt a 1° fate, divide three times, and form the vulval lumen that attaches to the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Sternberg1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Eisenmann1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Maloof1">[20]</xref>. In parallel, P6.p activates Notch signaling in adjacent P5.p and P7.p to induce 2° fates, which, after three rounds of division, create the symmetrical sides of the vulva that attach the organ to the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). Insufficient signaling alters vulval patterning and reduces the amount of vulval tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Sternberg1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Ferguson1">[21]</xref>. Excessive signaling also alters vulval patterning and, if it occurs at certain axial positions, generates ectopic, non-functional vulvae, which can interfere with normal positioning of muscles and neurons that promote egg-laying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Gleason2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Ferguson1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Katz1">[24]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Wnt signaling and epidermal patterning in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</title>
          <p>(A) A wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> adult hermaphrodite. Scale bar is 100 µm. (B) During the L2 larval stage, LIN-3/EGF from pre-anchor cell/ventral uterine precursor cells (not shown) cooperates with a gradient of EGL-20/Wnt (orange) from rectal cells and CWN-1/Wnt (green) from posterior muscle and neurons to cause six epidermal cells to become vulval progenitors (P3.p–P8.p). 50% of the time, P3.p does not receive sufficient Wnt signaling and adopts the “F” fate (also known as the 4° fate) and fuses with a hypodermal syncytium called hyp7. EGL-20/Wnt also polarizes P5.p and P7.p so that they face posteriorly (horizontal arrows). The epidermal cells normally touch each other, but are drawn apart to facilitate depiction of muscle and neurons. (C) At the end of the L2 larval stage, anchor cell-produced MOM-2 and LIN-44 Wnts (blue) reorient P7.p towards the anterior (horizontal arrows). During the L3 larval stage, LIN-3/EGF (purple) from the anchor cell induces the 1° vulval fate in P6.p, which is facilitated by EGL-20 and CWN-1 Wnts. P5.p and P7.p adopt 2° vulval fates because of the activation of LIN-12/Notch via a lateral signal from P6.p. (D) During the L3–L4 larval stages, vulval progenitor cells (Pn.p) divide to generate Pn.px cells, with P5.p–P7.p undergoing two additional rounds of cell division (to ultimately make Pn.pxxx cells). Because of the opposite polarities of P5.p and P7.p, their asymmetrically dividing progeny generate mirror image patterns. By the early L4 stage, a 22-cell vulva is generated. The Pn.px progeny of P3.p, P4.p, and P8.p fuse with hyp7 (3° fate).</p>

      <p>To understand how growth factors such as Wnts generate specific fates at precise positions, we looked for mutations that affected placement of vulval tissue along the anterior–posterior axis. We were intrigued by mutations in the <italic>vab-8</italic> gene, which affect vulval development through an unknown mechanism and are primarily known for disrupting the migration and axon outgrowth of a few neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester2">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Wightman1">[26]</xref>. While nervous systems co-develop with tissues and organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Gilbert1">[6]</xref>, with only rare exceptions, their importance in refining body plans has been unexplored. In flies, through unknown mechanisms, motor neurons contribute to abdominal and flight muscle patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Lawrence1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Fernandes1">[28]</xref>, and in mammals, by secreting VEGF, sensory nerves direct arterial patterning in skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Mukouyama1">[29]</xref>. In addition, we previously discovered that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, motor neuron excitation stimulates vulval fate signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Moghal1">[30]</xref>. Thus, we were interested in exploring the possibility that neurons might refine patterning by widely used growth factors such as Wnts.</p>
      <p>Here we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> has evolved a neuronal-based mechanism to refine the amplitude and spatial signaling properties of the posterior-derived Wnt gradients that pattern the epidermis. Two canal-associated neurons (CANs), whose axons span the anterior–posterior axis, ensure that a vulva is generated with the correct morphology and only at the mid-body. When outgrowth of the posterior CAN axon is severely shortened, Wnt signaling is increased along the anterior–posterior axis, especially in the posterior body. This deregulated signaling alters the symmetry of the normal mid-body vulva, and causes ectopic vulval tissue to form in the posterior epidermis. Finally, we provide evidence that although the Ror/CAM-1 Wnt receptor is widely expressed, its expression in the CAN axons is part of a unique Wnt-sequestration mechanism that ultimately directs the locations and strength of Wnt signaling necessary for proper epidermal patterning.</p>

        <title>Mutations Affecting Neuronal Migration and Axon Outgrowth Affect the Symmetry and Axial Position of Vulval Tissue</title>
        <p><italic>vab-8</italic> encodes a long isoform, VAB-8L, and several short isoforms collectively called VAB-8S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Wolf1">[31]</xref>. These proteins act in a few neurons to promote their posterior-directed migration and axon outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Wolf1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Lai1">[32]</xref>. Both isoforms possess C-terminal coiled-coil domains, with VAB-8L having an additional N-terminal kinesin domain. In wild-type animals, only the three central vulval progenitors (P5.p–P7.p) adopt vulval fates. However, in <italic>vab-8(gm99)</italic> and <italic>vab-8(gm138)</italic> mutants, which lack both isoforms and have anteriorly displaced neurons, the posterior P8.p progenitor also acquired a vulval fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In the anterior epidermis of wild-type animals, Wnt signaling is limiting in P3.p because of its distance from the posterior Wnts; therefore, it becomes a progenitor only 50% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g002">2B</xref>). <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations did not cause ectopic vulval fates in anterior P3.p or P4.p (<italic>n = </italic>170), but they increased the frequency with which P3.p became a vulval progenitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In the mid-body, at low frequency, <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations disrupted the mirror image symmetry of the vulva. Initially, during the generation of the vulval progenitors in wild-type animals, posterior-derived EGL-20/Wnt causes P5.p and P7.p to polarize and face towards the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green2">[16]</xref>. Later, centrally produced MOM-2 and LIN-44 Wnts maintain P5.p polarity towards the posterior, but cause P7.p to reorient and face towards the anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g002">2C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Inoue1">[17]</xref>. <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations caused a “posterior-reversed vulval lineage” (P-Rvl) phenotype, in which P7.p remained polarized towards the posterior EGL-20/Wnt signal, so that its subsequent cell divisions caused a second vulval invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations cause P8.p to adopt a vulval fate. In wild-type animals, P8.p divides once, but never forms vulval tissue. (B) <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations increase the frequency of P3.p becoming a vulval progenitor. 50% of the time, P3.p receives sufficient Wnt signaling to become a vulval progenitor and divides once. (C) Upper panel depicts wild-type signaling by Wnts and EGF that promotes vulval development with mirror image symmetry. MOM-2 and LIN-44 Wnts dominate over EGL-20/Wnt to polarize P7.p towards the anterior. Lower panel shows a wild-type 22-cell vulva with normal symmetry at the mid-L4 stage. (D) Upper panel depicts abnormal Wnt signaling in <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants that causes the formation of vulval tissue with a P-Rvl phenotype. EGL-20/Wnt dominates over MOM-2 and LIN-44 Wnts, preventing P7.p from reorienting towards the anterior. Lower panel shows a P-Rvl vulva at the mid-L4 stage. In (C) and (D), EGL-20/Wnt was overexpressed from its native promoter with the <italic>muIs49</italic> transgene. Scale bar is 10 µm.

        <p>To study how VAB-8-regulated cells affect epidermal development, we used mutant backgrounds permitting sensitive quantification of the effects of <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations. A loss-of-function <italic>egfr/let-23(lf)</italic> mutation severely diminishes the 1° fate response in P6.p such that fewer than the normal three progenitors adopt vulval fates, causing an “underinduced” or “vulvaless” phenotype. This mutant phenotype can be suppressed by activating the EGFR pathway downstream of the receptor (e.g., by a loss-of-function mutation in the Ras/LET-60 inhibitor <italic>gap-1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Hajnal1">[33]</xref>) or by mutations that increase signaling by the parallel Wnt pathway (e.g., a loss-of-function mutation in the Wnt pathway inhibitor <italic>axin/pry-1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Gleason2">[19]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001465-t001">Table 1</xref>). By counting total vulval progeny, the extent to which any progenitor adopts a vulval fate can be quantified. <italic>vab-8(gm99)</italic> and <italic>vab-8(gm138)</italic> mutations suppressed the underinduced phenotypes of loss-of-function <italic>egf/lin-3</italic> and <italic>egfr/let-23</italic> alleles and of a dominant-negative <italic>ras/let-60(dn)</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001465-t001">Table 1</xref>). Since increasing EGFR activity above wild-type levels does not suppress the <italic>ras/let-60(dn)</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Moghal1">[30]</xref>, VAB-8-regulated cells must modulate a signal that is distinct from EGF. Based on the posterior bias in the induction of ectopic vulval fates, the P-Rvl phenotype (which can result from overactive EGL-20 signaling), and the increased P3.p progenitor frequency (which is normally regulated by EGL-20 and CWN-1), this signal(s) could include one of the posteriorly enriched Wnts such as EGL-20 or CWN-1.</p>

        <title>The CAN Neurons Regulate Epidermal Patterning</title>
        <p>In contrast to mutations that disrupt both VAB-8 isoforms, the <italic>vab-8(ev411)</italic> mutation, which only affects VAB-8L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Wolf1">[31]</xref>, did not cause ectopic vulval fates in P8.p, did not increase the frequency of P3.p becoming a vulval progenitor, and did not suppress the underinduced phenotypes of <italic>egf/lin-3</italic> or <italic>egfr/let-23</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001465-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, VAB-8S is sufficient to inhibit vulval fates. To identify cells whose position might influence epidermal development, we examined promoter activity in the smallest genomic fragment previously shown to encode functional VAB-8S activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Wolf1">[31]</xref>. This promoter drove reporter expression in eight head neurons and the pair of CANs (CANL and CANR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To determine whether any of these neurons regulate epidermal development, we used this promoter to restore VAB-8S (<italic>Pvab-8s::vab-8s</italic>) to all of these cells in <italic>egfr/let-23(lf); vab-8(gm138)</italic> double mutants. VAB-8S expression in these cells fully restored the <italic>egfr/let-23(lf)</italic> vulvaless phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s013">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that the positioning of one or more of these cells inhibits vulval fate signaling in P6.p. We then focused on the CANs, since (1) of the ten neurons, only the CAN axons span the entire anterior–posterior axis, (2) <italic>vab-8</italic> null mutations severely displace CAN cell bodies and shorten posterior axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Wightman1">[26]</xref>, and (3) the <italic>vab-8(ev411)</italic> mutation, which does not affect epidermal development, does not affect CAN cell body position, and only weakly affects CAN axon outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Wightman1">[26]</xref>. Since VAB-8 acts cell autonomously in the CANs to promote their posterior migration and axon outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Wolf1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Lai1">[32]</xref>, we used a previously described CAN-specific enhancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Wenick1">[34]</xref> to create an expression vector to specifically restore VAB-8S and proper positioning only to the CANs. This vector drove YFP expression only in the CANs, which was also the only site of co-localization with <italic>vab-8s</italic>-driven <italic>DsRed2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g003">Figure 3B and 3C</xref>), confirming the cell-specificity of this vector. When expressed from the CAN-specific promoter (<italic>PCAN::vab-8s</italic>), but not the control minimal <italic>pes-10</italic> promoter, VAB-8S also restored full inhibition to vulval fate signaling in P6.p in <italic>egfr/let-23(lf); vab-8(gm138)</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s013">Table S1</xref>). This transgene also fully suppressed the other <italic>vab-8(gm138)</italic> epidermal phenotypes, including the ectopic vulval fates at P8.p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), the increased frequency of P3.p becoming a vulval progenitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), and the P-Rvl phenotype (0%, <italic>n = </italic>64). Thus, VAB-8 acts in the CANs to regulate epidermal development.</p>

        <title>The CANs Inhibit EGL-20/Wnt Activity</title>
        <p>Since our genetic and phenotypic analyses suggested the CANs inhibit Wnt activity, we directly examined whether CAN displacement might increase Wnt activity in epidermal progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green2">[16]</xref>. An mCherry-based Wnt reporter has been described that specifically reflects Wnt signaling in epidermal progenitors beginning after their first division (Pn.px stage) and extending through their second division (Pn.pxx) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green2">[16]</xref>. In <italic>axin/pry-1</italic> Wnt inhibitor mutants, both the frequency and intensity of reporter activity was increased in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s002">Figure S2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s002">S2C</xref>). Although <italic>vab-8(gm99)</italic> and <italic>vab-8(gm138)</italic> mutations did not increase Wnt reporter intensity as dramatically as an <italic>axin/pry-1</italic> mutation, they did cause more animals to show reporter activity in P3.px, P4.px, P6.px, and P8.x progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>).

        <p>During vulval development, <italic>egl-20/wnt</italic> expression was detected in four rectal cells (K, F, B, and U) just posterior to P11.p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Whangbo1">[15]</xref>. <italic>cwn-1/wnt</italic> was strongly expressed in posterior body-wall muscle and a subset of posterior motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Gleason1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Hayashi1">[37]</xref>. These cells were posterior to the P8.px progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), but weakly expressing neurons and muscle extended anteriorly to P2.p. Strikingly, the CANs also expressed CWN-1/Wnt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s003">Figure S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Harterink1">[38]</xref>, and their posterior axons traveled parallel to the epidermal progenitors and the other CWN-1-producing cells, and terminated at the sources of EGL-20/Wnt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g004">Figure 4E–4H</xref>). Thus, the CANs appear well-positioned to regulate epidermal progenitor responses to these Wnts.</p>
        <p>To further investigate the possibility that the CANs target EGL-20/Wnt, we examined hermaphrodite-specific neuron (HSN) migration in <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants. The two HSNs are born in the posterior of the embryo, close to the EGL-20/Wnt-producing cells, and migrate to the mid-body position of the prospective vulva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Sulston1">[39]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s004">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>). <italic>egl-20/wnt</italic> mutations prevent this migration, while mutations in other Wnt genes have little effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Pan1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Zinovyeva1">[41]</xref>. Conversely, increased EGL-20/Wnt activity causes anterior overmigration of the HSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester1">[23]</xref>, implying that an EGL-20 gradient drives correct mid-body placement of the HSNs. Consistent with prior reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Wightman1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester3">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Manser1">[42]</xref>, we found that in <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants HSNs overmigrated anteriorly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s004">Figure S4C</xref>), suggesting EGL-20/Wnt activity is increased along the anterior–posterior axis. This phenotype was enhanced by increasing EGL-20/Wnt levels with an integrated transgenic array that carries additional copies of the genomic <italic>egl-20</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s004">Figure S4D and S4E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Pan1">[40]</xref>. Since laser ablation of the CAN precursors also causes HSN overmigration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester3">[35]</xref>, the effect of <italic>vab-8</italic> mutation on HSN migration is likely mediated by the CANs. The integrated <italic>egl-20/wnt</italic> transgenic array also cooperated with the <italic>vab-8(gm138)</italic> mutation to increase the incidence of the P-Rvl phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>), and to cause an embryonic posterior P11 to P12 blast fate transformation, which can occur when either EGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Jiang1">[43]</xref> or Wnt signaling activity is abnormally high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s004">Figure S4F and S4G</xref>). The P11 fate transformation in <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants is also at least partly mediated by the CANs, since CAN-specific restoration of VAB-8S significantly rescued this phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s004">Figure S4G</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since elevated EGL-20/Wnt activity specifically causes a P-Rvl phenotype, and increased activity of either EGL-20 or CWN-1/Wnt could, in principle, account for the increased conversion of P3.p into a vulval progenitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Myers1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green2">[16]</xref>, we asked whether elevation of one of these Wnts could also account for how <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations suppress the underinduced phenotype of an <italic>egfr/let-23(lf)</italic> mutation. When expressed from a heat-shock-regulated transgene (<italic>Phs::egl-20</italic>), EGL-20/Wnt suppressed the <italic>egfr/let-23(lf)</italic> mutation comparably to <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001465-t002">Table 2</xref>). However, this transgenic array did not induce ectopic vulval fates at P8.p in wild-type animals (<italic>n = </italic>52). This may be due to a lack of sufficiently high EGL-20/Wnt expression in the posterior epidermis and/or a need to increase signaling by additional Wnts such as CWN-1.</p>
        <p>In agreement with the idea that Wnt signaling sufficient for the induction of ectopic vulval fates is still limiting after heat shock of just EGL-20, mutation of the intracellular Wnt inhibitor <italic>axin/pry-1</italic> caused very high Wnt reporter activity in vulval progenitor progeny, fully suppressed the underinduced phenotype of <italic>egfr/let-23</italic> mutants, and caused ectopic vulval fates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001465-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Gleason2">[19]</xref>. This high level of Wnt signaling also caused P9.p and P10.p to become vulval progenitors, which, along with P8.p, formed most of the ectopic vulval tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s002">Figure S2D and S2E</xref>). Together, our combined data suggest that EGL-20/Wnt is one CAN target, and that additional Wnts, including CWN-1, may also be inhibited by the CANs.</p>
        <p>Anterior displacement of CAN cell bodies and foreshortening of the posterior axons caused a gradual post-embryonic withering of the posterior half of the animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Manser1">[42]</xref>, which placed some epidermal progenitors closer to the anus, where EGL-20/Wnt is produced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s005">Figure S5A</xref>), and reduced posterior body volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s006">Figure S6A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s006">S6C</xref>).

        <p>While in wild-type animals the median CAN cell body position along the anterior–posterior axis was near the P5.px progeny, and most posterior CAN axons terminated near P11.p and the EGL-20/Wnt-producing rectal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g004">Figures 4E, 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g005">5A, and 5B</xref>), in <italic>vab-8(gm138)</italic> mutants, both the CAN cell bodies and posterior axon termini were severely displaced anteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g005">Figure 5A–5C</xref>).

        <p>We next examined how a <italic>ceh-10</italic> homeobox gene mutation that has intermediate effects on posterior CAN axon outgrowth affects epidermal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester3">[35]</xref>. Although in <italic>ceh-10</italic> mutants the median CAN cell body position was anteriorly shifted to the head, similarly as in <italic>vab-8(gm138)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester3">[35]</xref>, the posterior CAN axon extended further than in <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants, to a median position of P4.px rather than P1.p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Mutation of <italic>ceh-10</italic> did not increase the frequency of P3.p becoming a vulval progenitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), and did not suppress the P6.p-based underinduced phenotypes of <italic>egf/lin-3</italic> or <italic>egfr/let-23</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001465-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, <italic>ceh-10</italic> mutants had a low incidence of ectopic vulval fates in P8.p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). These data suggest that a rarer aspect of the <italic>ceh-10</italic> mutant phenotype, such as severe shortening of the posterior CAN axon rather than displacement of the cell body, may promote vulval fate signaling along the anterior–posterior axis.</p>
        <p>To determine the relationship between the posterior CAN axon terminus and vulval fate signaling, we examined both parameters in individual <italic>ceh-10</italic> mutants. In animals where the furthest posterior CAN axon terminus of the pair of neurons was at or posterior to P8.p progeny, P8.p did not adopt a vulval fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, e.g., animal 52). By contrast, in animals where the furthest posterior CAN axon terminus was anterior to P8.p progeny, P8.p acquired ectopic vulval fates, with some animals also showing a P-Rvl phenotype in P7.p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, e.g., animal 79). We also identified rare <italic>ceh-10</italic> mutants that demonstrated a separation between tail withering and increased vulval fate signaling. In animals 79, 74, and 45, the Wnt-responding P8.px progenitors that gave rise to ectopic vulvae were further away from the EGL-20/Wnt sources (&gt;135 µm) than the non-Wnt-responding P8.px progenitors in animals not having ectopic vulval induction (135 µm) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s008">Figure S8</xref>). However, in these three animals, the posterior CAN axon never extended beyond P3.px, demonstrating that productive vulval fate signaling is always correlated with severe posterior axon shortening.</p>
        <p>To determine whether a similar relationship also exists between the posterior CAN axon terminus and the signaling involved in converting anterior P3.p into a vulval progenitor, we also examined these two parameters in <italic>ceh-10</italic> mutants. Analogous to the study at P8.p, we found that when the longest of the pair of posterior CAN axons reached only the P3.p position, the frequency of P3.p becoming a progenitor increased from the normal ∼50% to 72% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). This increased frequency is similar to that in <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants, which have a median furthest posterior axon terminus position of P1.p. In contrast, when the longest posterior CAN axon terminated past P3.p, the frequency of P3.p becoming a progenitor was 41%, which was not statistically different from that of wild-type animals. Together, these data indicate that foreshortening of the posterior CAN axons can cause epidermal progenitors to show evidence of enhanced responses to Wnt signaling.</p>
        <p>Although anterior and posterior epidermal progenitor responses to Wnts are inversely correlated with the length of the posterior CAN axon, the striking expression of CWN-1/Wnt in the CAN neurons suggests the possibility that when anteriorly displaced, the cell bodies of these neurons might promote Wnt signaling in anterior epidermal cells such as P3.p. Consistent with this model, we found that the increased frequency of P3.p becoming a vulval progenitor in <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants was more dependent on <italic>cwn-1</italic> than <italic>egl-20/wnt</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). If this strong dependence on CWN-1/Wnt was largely due to increased proximity of CWN-1-producing CAN cell bodies to P3.p, it would be expected that CAN cell bodies would be consistently closer to P3.p when P3.p becomes a vulval progenitor. We found 17 <italic>ceh-10</italic> mutants to test this hypothesis. In these mutants, at least one of the cell bodies of the pair of CAN neurons was displaced closer to P3.p, away from its normal median position of P5.p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). However, regardless of whether P3.p had or had not become a vulval progenitor, the cell body that was closest to P3.p (among the pair of CAN neurons) was similarly close to P3.p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s009">Figure S9C</xref>, left panel). Also arguing against a positive role for the CAN cell bodies in promoting Wnt signaling in P3.p, we found that when P3.p became a vulval progenitor, the cell body that was furthest from P3.p (among the pair of CAN neurons) was significantly further away from P3.p than in cases where P3.p did not become a progenitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s009">Figure S9C</xref>, right panel). In fact, in one case, we found an animal where the two CAN cell bodies were directly over P3.p, yet P3.p still failed to become a vulval progenitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s009">Figure S9B</xref>, animal 92). Notably, in this animal, both posterior CAN axons terminated past the P8.p progeny. The most significant correlation we noticed in animals with at least one of the two CAN cell bodies displaced closer to P3.p was that when P3.p became a vulval progenitor, fewer posterior CAN axons reached P3.p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the key role of the CANs in epidermal development is to inhibit Wnt signaling, and that the posterior CAN axons must extend a certain distance to confer this inhibition.</p>

However, the only other known extracellularly acting Wnt inhibitor in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the transmembrane Wnt-binding Ror/CAM-1 tyrosine kinase, could mediate the effects of the CAN axons on Wnt signaling. Ror/CAM-1 is widely expressed in muscle, the vulval progenitors, and many neurons, including the CANs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Hayashi1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester4">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Song1">[46]</xref>.

        </fig>
        <p>To explore the possibility that Ror/CAM-1 might largely act from specific neurons such as the CANs to refine the EGL-20 and CWN-1 Wnt gradients that pattern the epidermis, we first examined the extent to which a <italic>cam-1</italic> null mutation, <italic>gm122</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), phenocopies the effects of <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations. Similar to mutation of <italic>vab-8</italic>, <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> mutation elevated Wnt reporter activity in P6.px and P8.px progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Also similar to mutation of <italic>vab-8</italic>, <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> mutation increased the frequency of P3.p becoming a vulval progenitor, cooperated with EGL-20/Wnt overexpression to cause embryonic P11 to P12 fate transformations, and suppressed the underinduced P6.p-based phenotype of an <italic>egf/lin-3</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001465-t002">Table 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green1">[7]</xref>. Notably, mutation of <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> did not perturb primary vulval symmetry, induce ectopic vulval fates in P8.p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), or increase Wnt reporter activity to the same degree as <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations. These discrepancies may be due to dual negative and positive functions of Ror/CAM-1 in epidermal development. Within certain epidermal progenitors such as P7.p, Ror/CAM-1 may transduce Wnt signals, while in the CANs, it may sequester Wnts to refine the posteriorly derived Wnt gradients to which the vulval progenitors respond. Since Ror/CAM-1 mediates the polarizing effect of EGL-20/Wnt on P7.p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green2">[16]</xref>, the P-Rvl phenotype, which stems from this polarization, cannot be manifested in <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> mutants. Furthermore, we found that Ror/CAM-1 is required for P8.p to adopt a vulval fate when the posterior CAN axons are foreshortened by <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Further consistent with the model that Ror/CAM-1 positively transduces Wnt signals in P8.p, the increased frequency of Wnt reporter activity in P8.p progeny was significantly lower in <italic>cam-1</italic> mutants than in <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). The mildly elevated P8.px Wnt reporter activity in <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> mutants must therefore reflect activation of other Wnt receptors that are not sufficient to drive a vulval fate.</p>
        <p>Since Ror/CAM-1 has been reported to affect CAN cell body positioning and axon outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester3">[35]</xref>, we evaluated whether <italic>cam-1</italic> mutations might increase posteriorly derived Wnt signaling by affecting the location of the CANs and their axon termini. As has been previously reported, we found that <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> mutations caused anterior displacement of the CAN cell bodies that was as severe as that caused by <italic>ceh-10</italic> mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester3">[35]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g005">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g007">7A</xref>). However, since <italic>ceh-10</italic> mutants do not have as strong Wnt phenotypes as <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> mutants, the CAN cell body displacement in <italic>cam-1</italic> mutants cannot explain their increased Wnt signaling. Also, in <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> mutants, outgrowth of the posterior CAN axon was only mildly affected, with the median end point being even more posterior than in <italic>vab-8(ev411)</italic> and <italic>ceh-10(lf)</italic> mutants that have no or weaker Wnt phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g005">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g007">7B</xref>). Thus, Ror/CAM-1 does not inhibit Wnt signaling by regulating posterior CAN axon outgrowth, but could mediate an inhibitory effect of the extended axons.</p>

In this line, despite similar levels of expression between animals, re-expression of Ror/CAM-1 did not fully restore proper migration to the CANs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This partial rescue suggests that in these animals, the level of transgenic Ror/CAM-1 expression may be just below physiologic amounts. However, of those animals displaying normal migration of at least one of the two CAN cell bodies, CAN-expressed Ror/CAM-1 completely restored the parental <italic>egf/lin-3(lf)</italic> underinduced phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>). This result indicates that epidermal progenitors such as P6.p no longer receive abnormally high Wnt signaling when Ror/CAM-1 is expressed only in the CANs of <italic>cam-1(null)</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>Similar to <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants, <italic>cam-1</italic> mutants also show an embryonic HSN overmigration phenotype, which has been proposed to be due to overactive EGL-20/Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester1">[23]</xref>. To evaluate whether Ror/CAM-1 could also be part of the embryonic mechanism by which the CANs regulate Wnt-dependent responses, we examined another transgenic line with CAN-specific expression of Ror/CAM-1::GFP. These animals had a <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> mutation and also expressed an HSN GFP marker to visualize HSN migration. Similar to the other transgenic line described above, this line also only weakly rescued the CAN migration defect (only ∼30% of animals had CANs in their normal mid-body position). However, despite this incomplete functional activity, these transgenic animals still showed significant, but not wild-type, rescue of HSN migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s010">Figure S10</xref>). These data further support a CAN-specific role for Ror/CAM-1 in cell non-autonomously regulating responses to Wnts.</p>
        <p>To explore the model that Ror/CAM-1 acts from the CANs to sequester Wnts, we examined the requirement of the intracellular kinase domain for inhibition of Wnt signaling in the epidermis. Prior work showed that in conjunction with other Wnt receptor mutations, a <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> null mutation or a <italic>cam-1</italic> mutation affecting only the extracellular Wnt-binding domain (<italic>sa692</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), but not a <italic>cam-1</italic> deletion affecting only the kinase domain (<italic>ks52</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), can induce ectopic vulval fates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green1">[7]</xref>. To determine whether similar requirements for the extracellular, but not intracellular, kinase domain extend to the regulation of epidermal progenitor responses assayed in this work, we also examined the effects of these domain-specific mutations. Consistent with the prior work and our model, we found that the <italic>cam-1(sa692)</italic> mutation, but not the <italic>cam-1(ks52)</italic> mutation, increased the frequency of P3.p becoming a vulval progenitor and suppressed an <italic>egf/lin-3</italic> mutation comparably to the <italic>cam-1</italic> null mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001465-t002">Table 2</xref>). To determine whether the extracellular-domain-only requirement specifically extended to CAN-based Ror/CAM-1 inhibition of epidermal progenitor responses to Wnts, we repeated our transgenic rescue experiments with a <italic>cam-1</italic> construct that lacked the entire intracellular domain (ΔIntra, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Similar to with the wild-type construct, it was difficult to generate transgenic lines with detectable GFP expression. Our best-expressing transgenic line showed partial rescue of the CAN cell body migration defect, but not as much as the wild-type-expressing line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), and there was no rescue of the CAN axon outgrowth or the mild tail-withering defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g007">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s011">S11</xref>). Despite its limited activity in promoting proper CAN migration, the ΔIntra construct fully restored inhibition to vulval development in <italic>ror/cam-1(gm122); egf/lin-3(lf)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Also consistent with our model, it has been suggested that the ΔIntra construct may have a higher Wnt-binding capacity than the wild-type receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Kim1">[47]</xref>, which could explain its seemingly more potent ability to restore Wnt inhibition.</p>
        <p>To complement our transgenic add-back experiments with a more physiologic assessment of the Ror/CAM-1 site of action in regulating Wnt responses in epidermal progenitors, we used a genetic approach. We scored two quantitative epidermal phenotypes that are equally manifested in <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> and <italic>vab-8</italic> single mutants. In this strategy, we used a <italic>vab-8</italic> mutation to maximally displace the posterior CAN axon terminus away from the epidermal progenitors. If Ror/CAM-1 acts mostly through other neurons and muscle, a <italic>cam-1</italic> mutation should still significantly increase Wnt signaling in <italic>vab-8</italic> mutants. On the other hand, if Ror/CAM-1 acts mostly through the CANs, a <italic>cam-1</italic> mutation should have no further effect on Wnt signaling. Both <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> and <italic>vab-8</italic> single mutations have the same effect on the frequency with which P3.p becomes a vulval progenitor, increasing this frequency from 50% to ∼70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">6D</xref>). However, double mutants showed no further increase in this frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Similarly, both <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> and <italic>vab-8</italic> mutations suppressed the vulvaless phenotype of <italic>egf/lin-3</italic> mutants centered at P6.p to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001465-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001465-t002">2</xref>), yet combining the two mutations did not further increase this suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g007">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>

        <title>Ror/CAM-1 Regulates EGL-20/Wnt Localization to the Posterior CAN Axon</title>
        <p>Although Ror/CAM-1 is expressed at much higher levels in muscle than the CANs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), our data surprisingly indicate that CAN-expressed CAM-1 plays a critical role in regulating epidermal progenitor responses to Wnts such as EGL-20. While the EGL-20/Wnt gradient has been visualized in early L1 stage larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Coudreuse1">[12]</xref>, its potential refinement by specific cell populations like the CANs has not been reported. To investigate whether the EGL-20/Wnt gradient might be affected by the posterior CAN axons, we examined the distribution of EGL-20 in the vicinity of these axons. To accomplish this, we employed two transgenes. One expressed functional EGL-20/Wnt as a fusion to protein A, under the control of its native promoter (<italic>Pegl-20::egl-20::protein A</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Coudreuse1">[12]</xref>. This transgene rescues <italic>egl-20/wnt</italic> mutant phenotypes, but does not cause gain-of-function phenotypes, and, therefore, expresses EGL-20 at near physiologic levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Coudreuse1">[12]</xref>. The second transgene expressed GFP under the control of the <italic>ceh-23</italic> promoter (<italic>Pceh-23::gfp</italic>), which drives expression in the CANs, as well as a few other neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Zallen1">[48]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To visualize EGL-20/Wnt in living animals, we injected Cy5-labeled rabbit IgG, which has a high affinity for protein A, into double transgenic animals. This technique has been successfully used to label the extracellular portions of cell surface receptors, including protein-A-tagged receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Gottschalk1">[49]</xref>. In single <italic>Pceh-23::gfp</italic> transgene control animals, IgG-Cy5 did not accumulate to a significant amount or label any cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). In contrast, when injected into <italic>Pegl-20::egl-20::protein A; Pceh-23::gfp</italic> double transgenic animals, IgG-Cy5 labeled the surfaces of EGL-20/Wnt-producing rectal cells near the anus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), demonstrating specificity to the IgG-Cy5 signal. Cy5-labeled punctae were also enriched in other parts of the posterior body, but detection was variable, presumably because of variations in labeling between injected animals (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s012">Figure S12</xref>). However, the posterior enrichment of the Cy5-labeled punctae is consistent with the description of the EGL-20/Wnt gradient in fixed <italic>Pegl-20::egl-20::protein A</italic> L1 larvae stained with IgG-FITC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Coudreuse1">[12]</xref>. Strikingly, Cy5 labeling was also detected along stretches of the posterior CAN axon, suggesting EGL-20/Wnt is bound to the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, three different animals are shown).</p>

        <p>Since our data indicate that only the extracellular domain of Ror/CAM-1 is necessary to inhibit Wnt signaling from the CAN axons, and CAM-1 has been reported to bind Wnts such as EGL-20 in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green1">[7]</xref>, we tested whether CAM-1 mediates localization of EGL-20 to the posterior CAN axons. First, we observed that when driven by the CAN-specific promoter, Ror/CAM-1::GFP appeared as punctae along the CAN axon, as reported for other cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g008">Figure 8D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Babu1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Jensen1">[52]</xref>. Notably, the Ror/CAM-1 punctae resembled the size and pattern of the EGL-20/Wnt punctae along the posterior CAN axon, suggesting EGL-20 might be bound to CAM-1. Next, we quantified the density of EGL-20/Wnt punctae along the posterior CAN axon in wild-type and <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> mutants. Mutation of <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> reduced the EGL-20/Wnt density along the axon, indicating that CAM-1 mediates some of the EGL-20 enrichment at the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g008">Figure 8E and 8F</xref>). While in <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> mutants the measured EGL-20/Wnt density along the posterior CAN axon was not zero, it may have been lower than what we quantified because it is impossible to be absolutely certain what fraction of the punctae are actually bound to the axon. Nevertheless, these data indicate that EGL-20/Wnt is enriched at, or in very close proximity to, the posterior CAN axon in a Ror/CAM-1-dependent manner, and provide evidence for these axons affecting the distribution of EGL-20 in the extracellular space. These data are in accord with our functional analyses of the properties of the CAN axons, and provide a potential explanation for how the CAN axons exert their unique role in epidermal development.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Despite the identification of so many Wnt antagonists, our understanding of how Wnt gradients are established with precision and integrated with the activities of multiple growth factors is still quite limited. Here, we show that even to create an anatomically simple structure such as the <italic>C. elegans</italic> vulva, the diffusion of Wnts and their inhibitors does not provide sufficient spatial resolution of signaling. To overcome this problem, <italic>C. elegans</italic> has incorporated the unique axonal projections of specific neurons to set the exact strengths of Wnt signaling at precise locations. The CAN neurons use their posterior-directed axons and the Ror/CAM-1 Wnt receptor to regionally dampen the activity of posteriorly derived Wnt (EGL-20 and possibly CWN-1). This dampening prevents ectopic induction of vulval tissue in the posterior epidermis and ensures that other centrally produced Wnts specify proper symmetry in the primary vulva. However, this mechanism still permits the posterior-derived EGL-20 and CWN-1 Wnts to retain sufficient activity in the mid-body and anterior epidermis to specify the vulval progenitors, and cooperate with EGF/LIN-3 in promoting a 1° vulval fate in P6.p. Surprisingly, this type of regulation of epidermal pattering is unique to the Ror-expressing posterior CAN axons, and is not conferred by the other Ror/CAM-1-expressing cells along the anterior–posterior axis, or the SFRP-1-expressing cells. In fact, the posterior CAN axons are such potent regulators of Wnt signaling that foreshortening their normal length can dramatically alter an epidermal progenitor's response to Wnts. Given the unique role of the posterior CAN axons in regulating epidermal patterning, much of Ror/CAM-1 expression in other cells may be for more subtle control of epidermal patterning that we could not detect in our genetic experiments, or for inhibition of Wnt signaling for cell populations we did not assay, or could reflect other biological functions for CAM-1. For example, in muscle, Ror/CAM-1 is an important regulator of synapse strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Babu1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Jensen1">[52]</xref>, and in other cells, it plays important roles in cell polarity, cell migration, axon guidance, and neurite survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester3">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Hayashi1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester4">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Kim1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Yamamoto1">[53]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although for technical reasons we could not quantify the EGL-20/Wnt gradient in the vicinity of the epidermal progenitors that respond to Wnt signaling, we could quantify other aspects of EGL-20 distribution in living adult animals. Notably, we detected EGL-20/Wnt punctae along the posterior CAN axon in a pattern similar to how Ror/CAM-1 clusters along the same axon, suggesting EGL-20 may bind to the axon via CAM-1. In support of this model, mutation of <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> reduced EGL-20/Wnt density along the posterior CAN axon. However, Ror/CAM-1 may not be the only factor determining where EGL-20 is distributed within the posterior body. Ror/CAM-1 is expressed at levels similar to the CANs in other neurons, and at much higher levels than the CANs in muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Yet, despite this expression pattern of Ror/CAM-1, EGL-20/Wnt does not appear to be proportionally concentrated at muscle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s012">Figure S12</xref>), and appears to be somewhat enriched at the posterior CAN axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Since Ror/CAM-1 has been reported to act in complexes with other Wnt-binding receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Kennerdell1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Song1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Jensen1">[52]</xref>, it is possible that part of the EGL-20-binding properties of the CAN axons arises from co-expression of other specific Wnt receptors or post-translational modifications of CAM-1 that affect its EGL-20-binding properties. Notably, in muscle, CAM-1 functions in a heteromeric complex with LIN-17/Frizzled to transduce CWN-2, but not EGL-20, Wnt signaling at the neuromuscular junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Jensen1">[52]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Given the Ror/CAM-1-dependent localization of EGL-20/Wnt to the posterior CAN axon, the ability of CAM-1 to bind EGL-20 in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green1">[7]</xref>, and the requirement for only its Wnt-binding extracellular domain for CAM-1 to inhibit Wnt signaling from the CANs, it is possible that Wnt sequestration is part of the mechanism by which the CAN axons regulate epidermal patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001465-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Our data indicate that if Ror/CAM-1 is absent or if the posterior CAN axon does not grow to a sufficient length, the extracellular distribution of EGL-20/Wnt is altered. In these cases, in a simple model, the EGL-20/Wnt that is displaced from the CAN axons would be available to cause excess EGL-20 signaling in the epidermal progenitors, thereby perturbing normal Wnt patterning. Although only a small fraction of the total EGL-20/Wnt punctae appear to be bound to the posterior CAN axons, there are several possible scenarios in which this pool might be critical in determining the nature and strength of epidermal progenitor Wnt responses. First, many of the EGL-20/Wnt punctae that we detected at other locations might not be truly “free” and able to stimulate epidermal progenitors. They may be bound to other cells or trapped in the extracellular space. Thus, if the EGL-20/Wnt released from the posterior CAN axons is more diffusible than the other EGL-20, it may have a potent ability to change the pattern of epidermal progenitor responses to Wnts. Alternatively, the rectal cells may produce distinct forms of EGL-20/Wnt, with distinct abilities to bind and signal through different EGL-20 receptor complexes. Perhaps a form of EGL-20/Wnt that is specific for the epidermal progenitors is also preferentially sequestered by the CANs, endowing the CANs with a unique ability to regulate epidermal progenitor responses to EGL-20.</p>

          <p>(A) In wild-type animals, EGL-20/Wnt (orange) (and possibly CWN-1/Wnt [green]) is sequestered by the Ror/CAM-expressing posterior CAN axons. At the end of the L2 larval stage, this sequestration allows MOM-2 and LIN-44 Wnts (blue) to reorient and polarize P7.p towards the anterior (horizontal arrows). During the L3 larval stage, anterior-facing P7.p divides with the mirror image pattern of P5.p, and P8.p does not receive sufficient Wnt or EGF signaling to adopt a vulval fate. (B) If the posterior CAN axons do not extend far enough into the posterior body, where EGL-20/Wnt is produced, an abnormally high concentration of EGL-20 occurs, which prevents anterior polarization of P7.p, and causes ectopic vulval tissue to form at P8.p.</p>

      <p>Although our data indicate a critical role during larval epidermal development for the posterior CAN axons in regulating Wnt responses, in certain settings, the CAN cell bodies may also be able to perform this function. Notably, EGL-20/Wnt-dependent HSN migration is completed prior to CAN axon outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Durbin1">[54]</xref>, yet embryonic laser ablation of the CAN precursor cells still causes HSN overmigration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester3">[35]</xref>. Similarly, genetic mutation of <italic>ror/cam-1</italic> also causes HSN overmigration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Forrester1">[23]</xref>, and we can partially rescue this phenotype by re-expressing Ror/CAM-1 specifically in the CANs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001465.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Ror/CAM-1 might also be able to act from the CAN cell bodies to affect EGL-20/Wnt distributions, and hence the migration pattern of the HSNs.</p>
      <p>Our data raise the possibility that besides their behavioral functions, another core property of neurons may be to act as unique spatial cues to refine developmental patterns created by growth factors such as Wnts. This refinement may be manifested at two levels. First, in a specific tissue in a given organism, a specific fixed pattern of neurons may increase the robustness of inducing a specific pattern. For example, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the CANs ensure that the normal epidermal pattern of a single vulva with mirror image symmetry in the mid-body is invariant. When the posterior CAN axons are severely foreshortened, additional epidermal patterns are observed. However, our data also indicate that the pattern of neuronal positioning and axon outgrowth can also affect the appearance of a tissue pattern. Shortening of the normal length of the posterior CAN axon causes a second vulva to inappropriately form in the posterior body and alters the normal symmetry of mid-body vulval tissue. Based on these data, we also suggest that at a broader level, more phenotypic diversity can be generated among tissues and organisms with neurons than without neurons. In a simplified model of aneural tissue patterning, Wnt gradients established by diffusion direct patterning, with distances between Wnt-producing and -responding cells mostly affecting the pattern. In contrast, in organisms with nervous systems, the layering of different intricate patterns of Wnt-sequestering neurons into developing tissues could expand the diversity of functional Wnt gradients, and hence the diversity of tissue patterns that are possible.</p>
      <p>The ability of axons to refine Wnt signaling may be conserved, since Wnts are used extensively throughout metazoan development, and Ror kinases and other Wnt receptors are expressed in the nervous systems of diverse species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Petersen1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Grigoryan1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Green3">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Salinas1">[56]</xref>. Furthermore, the close proximity of developing neural circuits and tissues is not unique to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In vertebrates, neural crest cells begin to occupy the embryonic gut at the time of organ budding, and axon tracts are found in undifferentiated limb buds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Heanue1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Taylor1">[59]</xref>. The ability of neurons to refine spatial domains of Wnt signaling may also be important after development for certain homeostatic functions. In mammals, Wnt signaling must be precisely regulated in specific niches to promote stem cell self-renewal and prevent tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Barker1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Sato1">[61]</xref>. By expressing the appropriate cognate receptors, neurons may even use the mechanism we have discovered to regulate the extracellular distributions of many other growth factors, thereby expanding the repertoire of biological processes under their control.</p>

By contrast, our work provides evidence for a non-secretory function of neurons, where, by binding of one of the oldest conserved metazoan growth factors, neurons can help organize the complex signaling patterns that direct tissue development.</p>
      <p>The use of neurons to refine patterning by Wnts may have arisen from the ancestral functions of Wnts in establishing and patterning the primary body axis, and their subsequent use in directing neuronal migration, axon guidance, and synaptic strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Petersen1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001465-Salinas1">[56]</xref>. By additionally sequestering Wnts, neurons provide an efficient and unique mechanism to reshape initial Wnt gradients and help generate distinct body patterns. Given that the neuronal function we describe here does not involve the release of canonical neurotransmitters, but rather involves the axon outgrowth properties of neurons, our data raise intriguing questions regarding the earliest functional properties of primordial neurons. In addition to their behavioral importance, the evolution of neurons may also have improved metazoans by refining the plans of the bodies they would ultimately control.</p>

        <title>Vulval Induction and P3.p Fate</title>
        <p>Vulval development was scored during the L4 stage under DIC optics using a Zeiss Axio Imager. Animals were anesthetized with 10 mM sodium azide unless otherwise indicated. The number of vulval nuclei was used to extrapolate how many vulval progenitor cells adopted vulval fates. A vulval progenitor cell generating seven or eight great granddaughters (Pn.pxxx) and no hyp7 tissue was scored as 1.0 cell induction. A vulval progenitor cell in which one daughter (Pn.px) fuses with hyp7, and the other daughter generates three or four great granddaughters was scored as 0.5 cell induction. In wild-type animals, P5.p, P6.p, and P7.p each undergo 1.0 cell induction, resulting in a total of 3.0 cell induction. Animals with more than 3.0 cell induction are overinduced, and animals with less than 3.0 cell induction are underinduced. To determine whether P3.p had become a vulval progenitor, all Pn.p (P1.p–P11.p) progeny nuclei were counted at the mid-L4 stage and used to extrapolate whether P3.p had divided. P3.p division is indicative of having become a vulval progenitor.</p>
