However, despite accumulation of anecdotal evidence, an exact and conclusive relationship between the former and the latter has been elusive. We present an exhaustive study of the relationship between amino acid composition of proteomes, nucleotide composition of DNA, and optimal growth temperature (OGT) of prokaryotes. Based on 204 complete proteomes of archaea and bacteria spanning the temperature range from −10 °C to 110 °C, we performed an exhaustive enumeration of all possible sets of amino acids and found a set of amino acids whose total fraction in a proteome is correlated, to a remarkable extent, with the OGT. The universal set is Ile, Val, Tyr, Trp, Arg, Glu, Leu (IVYWREL), and the correlation coefficient is as high as 0.93. We also found that the G + C content in 204 complete genomes does not exhibit a significant correlation with OGT (R = −0.10). On the other hand, the fraction of A + G in coding DNA is correlated with temperature, to a considerable extent, due to codon patterns of IVYWREL amino acids. Further, we found strong and independent correlation between OGT and the frequency with which pairs of A and G nucleotides appear as nearest neighbors in genome sequences. This adaptation is achieved via codon bias. These findings present a direct link between principles of proteins structure and stability and evolutionary mechanisms of thermophylic adaptation. On the nucleotide level, the analysis provides an example of how nature utilizes codon bias for evolutionary adaptation to extreme conditions. Together these results provide a complete picture of how compositions of proteomes and genomes in prokaryotes adjust to the extreme conditions of the environment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Prokaryotes living at extreme environmental temperatures exhibit pronounced signatures in the amino acid composition of their proteins and the nucleotide compositions of their genomes, reflective of adaptation to their thermal environments. However, despite significant efforts, the definitive answer of what are the genomic and proteomic compositional determinants of optimal growth temperature (OGT) of prokaryotic organisms remained elusive. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of amino acid and nucleotide compositional signatures of thermophylic adaptation by exhaustively evaluating all combinations of amino acids and nucleotides as possible determinants of OGT for all prokaryotic organisms with fully sequenced genomes. We discovered that total concentration of seven amino acids in proteomes—IVYWREL—serves as a universal proteomic predictor of OGT in prokaryotes. Resolving the old-standing controversy, we determined that the variation in nucleotide composition (increase of purine load, or A + G content with temperature) is largely a consequence of thermal adaptation of proteins. However, the frequency with which A and G nucleotides appear as nearest neighbors in genome sequences is strongly and independently correlated with OGT as a result of codon bias in corresponding genomes. Together these results provide a complete picture of proteomic and genomic determinants of thermophilic adaptation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the US National Institutes of Health.

Given the limited alphabet of amino acid residues, an apparent way to control protein stability is to properly choose the fractions of different residue types and then to arrange them in sequences that fold into stable and unique native structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b004">4</xref>] at physiological conditions of a given organism. Various mechanisms of thermostability were discussed in the literature, and many authors pointed to changes in amino acid composition as one of the clearest manifestations of thermal adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b008">8</xref>].</p><p>Indeed, it is well-known that enhanced thermostability is reflected in specific trends in amino acid composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b011">11</xref>]. The most pronounced ones are in elevated fractions of charged residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b016">16</xref>], and/or increased amounts of hydrophobic residues in (hyper)thermophilic organisms as compared with mesophilic ones. An early attempt of a systematic search for amino acids that are most significant for protein thermostability was made by Ponnuswamy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b017">17</xref>], who considered a set of 30 proteins and about 65,000 combinations of different amino acids to find the amino acid sets serving as best predictors of denaturation temperature.</p><p>Furthermore, a number of authors explored the possible relationship between an optimal growth temperature (OGT) of organisms and nucleotide content of their genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b019">19</xref>]. An increase in purine (A + G) load of bacterial genomes of some thermophiles was noted recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b020">20</xref>] as a possible primary adaptation mechanism.</p><p>However, despite significant efforts, a clear and comprehensive picture of genomic and proteomic signatures of thermal adaptation remains elusive. First, it is not fully established which compositional biases in genomes and proteomes represent the most definitive signatures of thermophilic adaptation. On the genomic level, is it G + C as widely believed by many after the classical experimental study by Marmur and Doty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b021">21</xref>] or alternative signatures such as purine loading index as suggested by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b019">19</xref>]? For proteomic compositions is it excess of charge residues or hydrophobic or both, and which amino acids specifically are most sensitive to thermal adaptation? On a more fundamental level the key question is which factor—amino acid or nucleotide composition—is primary in thermal adaptation and which one is derivative? This issue is most vivid in prokaryotes whose genomes consist mostly of coding DNA, leading to a well-defined relationship between nucleotide and amino acid compositions. However, this relationship may be not rigid due to degeneracy of genetic code. In principle, amino acid and nucleotide compositions can adapt, to a certain degree, independently due to possible application of codon bias.</p><p>Definite answers to these questions can be obtained only via a comprehensive study that considers in a systematic way all known prokaryotic genomes and all possible composition factors. Here, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between the OGT (<italic>T<sub>opt</sub></italic>) of prokaryotes and the compositions of their complete proteomes and compositions and pairwise nearest-neighbor correlations in their genomes. First, our goal is to find the sets of amino acids and nucleotides whose total content in a proteome (genome) serves as the best predictor of the OGT of an organism. We perform an exhaustive enumeration of all possible combinations of amino acid residue types, without making any a priori assumptions of the relevance of a particular combination for thermostability. Our analysis is based on 204 complete genomes of bacteria and archaea thriving under temperatures from −10 °C to 110°C, comprising psychro-, meso-, thermo-, and hyperthermophilic organisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030005-st001">Table S1</xref>). It reveals a particular combination of amino acids whose cumulative concentration in proteomes is remarkably well-correlated with OGT. This result holds mainly for globular proteins composing most parts of prokaryotic proteomes. For comparison, we apply this approach also to membrane proteins having α-helical bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b022">22</xref>] and β-barrel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b023">23</xref>] structures, and show that the amino acids predictors of OGT found for proteomes of globular proteins do not work for membrane proteins. This finding clearly indicates that mechanisms of thermal stabilization of membrane proteins are different from those of globular proteins.</p><p>Next we turn to genomes and carry out the same comprehensive analysis to determine compositional genomic determinants of OGT. We find that purine load index, i.e., concentration of A + G exhibits the highest correlation with OGT, consistent with an earlier observation made on several individual genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b020">20</xref>]. Having found both proteomic and genomic compositional characteristics that correlate with OGT, we then turn to the key question of whether genomic and proteomic determinants are independent of each other or one is a derivative of the other. By running a set or reshuffling controls as described below, we show that the primary factor is adaptation on the level of amino acid composition and the variation in DNA composition is largely a derivative of amino acid adaptation. While the nucleotide composition biases appear to be largely due to adaptation at the level of amino acid compositions, an additional DNA sequence adaptation that is independent of amino acid composition adaptation is still possible—at the level of higher-order correlation in nucleotide sequences. A possible mechanism for that in prokaryotes is through codon bias. Indeed, we find clear evidence for independent adaptation in DNA at the level of nearest-neighbor correlation of nucleotides (possibly due to strengthening of stacking interactions). We show that this adaptation of DNA sequences does indeed occur via codon bias. Finally we discuss how observed patterns of change in amino acid compositions in response to extreme conditions of the environment are related to physical principles that govern stability of globular proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The complete genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030005-st001">Table S1</xref>) were downloaded from the NCBI Genome database, and the OGTs were collected from original publications, and from the Web sites of the American Type Culture Collection, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.atcc.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.atcc.org</ext-link>, the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dsmz.de" xlink:type="simple">http://www.dsmz.de</ext-link>, and PGTdb database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b024">24</xref>], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pgtdb.csie.ncu.edu.tw/" xlink:type="simple">http://pgtdb.csie.ncu.edu.tw/</ext-link>. The distribution of OGTs of prokaryotes with completely sequenced genomes shows that 75 species out of 204 have an OGT of 37 °C (mostly human and animal pathogens), 27 species have an OGT of 30 °C, and 19 species grow best at 26 °C. Therefore, 121 genomes, or 59% of the data, correspond to just three values of OGT. To overcome this obvious bias in the data, we averaged the amino acid compositions of the organisms with OGTs of 26 °C, 30 °C, and 37 °C, respectively. After this procedure, our dataset consists of 86 proteomes, 83 real proteomes, and three averaged proteomes at 26 °C, 30 °C, and 37 °C. To validate the averaging of the overrepresented amino acid compositions, we repeated the complete analysis for the 204 genomes and did not find any major differences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030005-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>We represent the different sets of amino acids by vectors {<italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic>} of 20 binary digits, where each digit <italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic> takes the value of 1 if the amino acid of type <italic>i</italic> is present in the set, and 0 otherwise. For the set to be nontrivial, at least one of the components of <italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic> must be 1 and at least one other must be 0. There are 2<sup>20</sup> − 2 = 1,048,574 such vectors, enumerating all possible subsets of 20 amino acids. Let <inline-formula id="pcbi-0030005-ex001"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.ex001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>
				 be the fraction of amino acid of type <italic>i</italic> in proteome <italic>j</italic>. Then, for each of the 86 proteomes and each vector {<italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic>}, we calculate the total fraction <italic>F</italic><sup>(<italic>j</italic>)</sup> of the amino acids from a particular subset,<inline-formula id="pcbi-0030005-ex002"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.ex002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>

				. The higher the correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic> of this regression, the more important is a given subset of amino acids as a predictor of OGT. Since for each proteome <inline-formula id="pcbi-0030005-ex004"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.ex004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>
				, there are in fact only 2<sup>19</sup> − 1 linearly independent combinations of fractions of amino acids; if the total fraction of <italic>N</italic> amino acids increases with OGT and the correlation coefficient is <italic>R,</italic> the total fraction of the complementary set of 20 − <italic>N</italic> amino acids is decreasing with OGT with the correlation coefficient –<italic>R.</italic> Therefore, the predictive powers of the complementary subsets of amino acids are equal. To resolve this ambiguity, we focus on the amino acid combinations that are positively correlated with OGT.
			</p><p>For 86 proteomes, the best predictor consists of amino acids IVYWREL, correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic> = 0.930, and accuracy of prediction 8.9 °C (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>).</p><p>We also performed an exhaustive enumeration of 3<sup>20</sup> − 1 combinations of amino acids in a ternary model, where the coefficients <italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic> can take the values of −1, 0, and 1. We expected that this method could be advantageous, as it allows us to enrich the predictor combination by the amino acids whose fraction is decreasing with OGT (such amino acids would have a weight of −1). The best predictor combination in the ternary model consists of amino acids VYWP with weight +1 and CFAGTSNQDH with the weight −1, correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic> = 0.948, accuracy of prediction of 8.1 °C for 86 proteomes. While this result is generally consistent with the IVYWREL predictor, the ternary model does not offer a significant increase of accuracy of the prediction of OGT as compared with a much simpler binary model. It is also possible to perform a full linear regression between the amino acid fractions and OGT, effectively allowing for noninteger values of {<italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic>}. This procedure involves a great risk of overfitting, and results only in a marginal improvement of accuracy of OGT prediction as compared with both binary and ternary models.</p><p>TMHMM prediction server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b022">22</xref>] at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM</ext-link> has been used to identify the sequences of alpha-helical membrane proteins in the 83 genomes.

Therefore, signatures of thermal adaptation in protein sequences can be due to the specific biases in nucleotide sequences and vice versa. In other words, one has to explore whether a specific composition of nucleotide (amino acid) sequences shapes the content of amino acid (nucleotide) ones, or thermal adaptation of proteins and DNA (at the level of sequence compositions) are independent processes.</p><p>To resolve this crucial issue, we applied the following logic. If amino acid biases are a consequence of just nucleotide biases and not protein adaptation, then proteomes translated from randomly reshuffled genomes will feature similar “thermal adaptation” trends in amino acid composition as observed in real proteomes. In contrast, if amino acid compositions are selected independently, then such control calculation will result in apparently different amino acid “trends” in randomly reshuffled genomes than observed in reality. We carried out this computational experiment by randomly reshuffling nucleotides in the coding sequences of 83 genomes and translating the reshuffled genomes into protein sequences. Then, we calculated the amino acid compositions of the resulting control proteomes, and found (using the same exhaustive enumeration of all amino acid combinations) the amino acid combinations that are best correlated with temperature.

A particularly important question is whether a specific codon bias is required to reproduce the trends in DNA composition.</p><p>To answer this question, we reverse-translated the protein sequences of the 83 organisms into DNA sequences without codon bias, i.e., by using synonymous codons with equal probabilities.

In other words, the amount of variation of A + G explained by the peculiarities of amino acid composition is almost the same with and without codon bias.

Indeed, by imposing the correct amino acid composition and choosing the available synonymous codons with equal probabilities, one arrives at the correct prediction of the trend in DNA composition, increase of A + G with temperature. Together with the apparent irrelevance of G + C content for thermal adaptation on the organism scale, this finding suggests that on the level of nucleotide composition, direct selection pressure on DNA sequence composition appears to be weak.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Nearest-Neighbor Correlation in DNA Sequences</title><p>After nucleotide composition, the next level of description of DNA sequences is the pairwise nearest-neighbor correlation function, or normalized probability to find successive pairs of specific nucleotides.

Is codon bias necessary to explain the observed sequence correlations in coding parts of DNA, given that amino acid bias is established independently? To answer this question, we reverse-translated the actual protein sequences into nucleotide sequences, using synonymous codons with equal probabilities.</p><p>In principle, there are two possible sources of the correlations in DNA sequences, one stemming from the neighboring nucleotides within a codon, and another one stemming from the combination of nucleotides at the interface of successive codons. The latter possibility implies the dependence of correlations in DNA on the sequence correlations in proteins. Reshuffling of protein sequences while retaining the actual codons used for each amino acid removes the effect of codon interface (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030005-t003">Table 3</xref>, column 2). These data show that ApG pairs are still highly correlated with OGT, and correlations in protein sequences have a small effect on the correlations in DNA.</p><p>After removal of codon bias, ApG pairs are no longer correlated with OGT, <italic>R</italic> = 0.20 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030005-t003">Table 3</xref>, column 3, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030005-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, the correlation between the ApG pairs and temperature is entirely due to the evolved codon bias. Importantly, CpT pairs in coding sequences of DNA are also highly correlated with OGT. As we analyze correlations in the sense strand of DNA molecule, abundance of CpT pairs points out to the enrichment of anti-sense strand with ApG ones. Therefore, double-stranded DNA is stabilized by stacking interactions provided by ApG dinucleotides that are spread in different locations of both sense and anti-sense strands. This conclusion holds for the entire DNA sequence when both coding and noncoding parts are considered. Therefore, it appears that the crucial role of codon bias is to increase the number of ApG pairs in coding DNA in response to elevated environmental temperatures, enhancing the stacking interactions in DNA. We also note that the trend to increase the frequency of ApG dinucleotides via codon adaptation may be another factor (besides amino acid adaptation, see above) that gives rise to increased overall composition of purine nucleotides A + G in hyperthermophiles, as can be seen from comparison of slopes of scatterplots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030005-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030005-g007">7</xref>B.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030005-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Dependence of the Pairwise Nearest-Neighbor Correlation Function for A,G Nucleotides <italic>c<sub>AG</sub></italic> on the OGT in the Genomes of 83 Species (Black) and in the DNA Sequences Obtained from the Proteomes of 83 Species without Codon Bias (Red)</title><p>While codon bias is not essential for reproducing the trends in nucleotide composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030005-g006">Figure 6</xref>), nucleotide correlations are entirely dependent on the proper choice of codon bias.

Here we found the pronounced amino acid biases and related proteomic determinant of thermal adaptation: IVYWREL combination of amino acid residues, which are highly correlated with the OGT of prokaryotes. To better understand possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed highly significant proteomic trends, one must establish a connection between thermal adaptation at organismal and molecular levels.</p><p>Remarkably, all amino acids from the IVYWREL predictor set are attached to tRNA by class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b032">32</xref>]. Other amino acids belonging to the group of class I synthetases are Cys (prone to form stabilizing S-S bridges), Lys (important in the generic mechanism of thermostability, see below and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b033">33</xref>]), and Met which are often placed in N-termini of proteins. Thus, class I amino acids, contrary to those of class II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b034">34</xref>], may constitute a group of amino acids sufficient for the synthesis of thermostable proteins. Besides, all class I synthetases have the Rossmann fold structure, one of ancient LUCA domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b035">35</xref>] with high compactness and, therefore, stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b036">36</xref>]. These observations suggest a possible connection between thermal adaptation and evolution of protein biosynthesis.</p><p>As it is known from statistical mechanics and the theory of protein folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b037">37</xref>], the stability of proteins is largely determined by the Boltzmann weight exp(−Δ<italic>E/k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>), where Δ<italic>E</italic> is the energy gap between the native state and the nearest in energy misfolded decoy structure, <italic>T,</italic> is environmental temperature, and <italic>k<sub>B</sub></italic> is the Boltzmann constant. As IVYWREL amino acids are important for thermostability, it is natural to assume that the energy gap Δ<italic>E</italic> is established mainly by interactions between these types of residues. Thus, we suggest that natural selection adjusted the content of IVYWREL in the proteomes to maintain Δ<italic>E/k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> at a nearly constant level irrespective of the environmental temperature. Interestingly, the total fraction of IVYWREL residues in the proteomes changes from 0.37 to 0.48 over the accessible temperature range. This relatively small yet significant change highlights a very delicate balance between hydrophobic, van der Waals, ionic, and hydrogen-bond interactions in correctly folded proteins. Indeed, the IVYWREL set contains residues of all major types, aliphatic and aromatic hydrophobic (Ile, Val, Trp, Leu), polar (Tyr), and charged (Arg, Glu), both basic and acidic. Recently, we have shown, using exact statistical mechanical models of protein stability, that the increase of the content of hydrophobic and charged amino acids can be quantitatively explained as a physical response to the requirement of enhanced thermostability (“from both ends of the hydrophobicity scale” mechanism, unpublished data), reflecting the positive and negative components of protein design.</p><p>The basic mechanism of protein thermal stability can be further augmented or modified by other biological, evolutionary, and environmental inputs. Availability of different amino acids in the environment, protein–protein interactions, and protein function requirements are just a few of those other major factors affecting the amino acid composition. Membrane proteins deliver an example where the mechanism of thermal adaptation is adjusted according to the specificity of the structure and interactions with its hydrophobic environment. In α-helical bundles, the temperature dependence of IVYWREL deviates from that of soluble proteins, whereas in β barrels even the determinant of thermostability, CVYP, is completely different. These observations are suggestive of the differences between the folding processes of globular and membrane proteins. Thermostability predictors derived for individual folds confirm a generic nature of the IVWREL predictor, which dominates in the majority of protein folds. Specific mechanisms of structure stability present in metal-binding proteins (globin, cytochrome C, ferredoxin) or those stabilized by S-S bridges (lysozyme) explain the lesser importance of the IVYWREL predictor for these folds.</p><p>Thermostability of proteins is, however, only a partial prerequisite of thermal adaptation of an organism, as DNA molecules must also remain stable at elevated environmental temperatures. Numerous experimental and theoretical works established two fundamental interactions in double-stranded DNA, base pairing and base stacking, as major determinants of DNA stability in vitro. GC pairs in the double helix have stronger base-pairing interactions than AT pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b021">21</xref>], while purines, A and G, yield a low energy of stacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b038">38</xref>].</p><p>The role of G + C content in establishing certain biases in amino acid composition has been widely discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030005-b041">41</xref>]. Our high-throughput analysis of nucleotide and amino acid compositions has confirmed that the G + C content of DNA is not correlated with the OGT of prokaryotes. The only signature of thermal adaptation in DNA composition that we found, increase of A + G content in the coding DNA, is to a considerable extent a consequence of the thermal adaptation of protein sequences. Elimination of codon bias and reverse-translation of the protein sequences into nucleotide sequences does not change the major trends in DNA composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030005-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This result suggests that composition-dependent (pairing) interactions in double-stranded DNA are not the bottleneck of thermal adaptation in prokaryotes, as even without codon bias the variation in composition of DNA follows the variation of composition of proteins across the whole range of environmental temperatures.</p><p>On the contrary, pairwise nearest-neighbor correlations observed in DNA sequences are largely independent from amino acid trends as they are entirely determined by the codon bias developed as a form of thermal adaptation in prokaryotes. We found that natural selection tailored the codon bias to increase the fraction of ApG pairs in both strands of DNA molecules of thermophilic organisms. Indeed, an increased number of ApG pairs leads to a lower stacking energy, and, thus, stabilization of DNA. We also demonstrated that the trend of higher frequency of ApG pairs in thermophiles persists for the whole DNA, including its coding and noncoding parts. To our knowledge, this consideration is one of the first physical models that quantitatively explain the necessity of and one of the possible reasons for codon bias in prokaryotes.</p><p>An important finding presented in this work is that amino acid composition adaptation is a primary factor, while certain signatures of thermal adaptation at the level of nucleotide composition such as purine loading index may be partly derivative of the amino acid adaptation requirement. This is perhaps not surprising given that many (but not all) proteins are present in cytoplasm in monomeric form and must be stabilized on their own—by interactions between their own amino acids (and also destabilize misfolded conformations, performing negative design as well). On the other hand, many proteins bind to DNA in prokaryotic cells, and some of them may provide additional stabilization to DNA in hyperthermophiles, making thermal adaptation at the level of DNA sequences a “collective enterprise” of the cell, relieving direct pressure on DNA sequence to adapt to high temperature. Positive superhelicity provided by gyrases may be one such mechanism, and perhaps several other mechanisms of DNA stabilization by proteins could be discovered in the future. In particular, the observed purine–purine AG correlation as an “independent” (from amino acid composition) adaptation mechanism may be a signature of the important role of stacking interaction in DNA thermal stabilization. Alternatively, the AG correlations may be a signature of an additional thermal adaptation of DNA via modulation of local mechanical properties or facilitation of interaction with proteins. Elucidation of the exact mechanism(s) by which DNA in prokaryotic genomes adapt to high temperatures is a matter of future research.</p><p>To summarize, we have shown that thermal adaptation of proteins in prokaryotes is strongly manifest at the level of amino acid composition. Among all possible combinations of amino acids, the fraction of IVYWREL amino acids in a proteome is the most precise predictor of OGT. We also observe a difference in the signatures of thermal adaptation of soluble and membrane proteins. We did not find a strong evidence for thermal adaptation of DNA at the level of nucleotide composition. The G + C content of the genomes is not correlated with environmental temperature, while A + G content increases with environmental temperature, to a considerable extent, as a consequence of thermal adaptation of proteins. At the same time, our analysis of sequence correlations in DNA shows that ApG dinucleotides are overrepresented in both strands of dsDNA of thermophilic organisms. The abundance of ApG pairs is a direct consequence of the codon bias developed in thermophilic prokaryotes. These findings provide a definitive answer to the long-standing problem of which genomic and proteomic compositional trends reflect thermal adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030005-sg001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.sg001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Dependence of the Fraction of KVYWREP Amino Acids on the OGT for the 204 Genomes from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030005-st001">Table S1</xref></title><p>(134 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030005-sg002" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.sg002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Histogram of the Values of the Correlation Coefficient <italic>R</italic> between OGT and Fraction <italic>F</italic> of a Set of Amino Acids for All Possible Seven-Letter Combinations and IVYWREL Combinations with One Substitution</title><p>(132 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030005-sg003" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.sg003" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><title>Probability to Find Each of the 20 Amino Acids in the Predictor Combinations (Highest-<italic>R</italic> Amino Acid Combination) Calculated from 1,000 of 43-Organism Training Sets</title><p>(126 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030005-sg004" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.sg004" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><title>Dependence of the Fraction of G + C Nucleotides on the OGT for the 204 Genomes from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030005-st001">Table S1</xref></title><p>(147 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030005-st001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.st001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Cardinal Temperatures of Prokaryotes (Minimum, Optimal, and Maximum Growth Temperatures)</title><p>(477 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030005-st002" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.st002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S2</label><caption><title>Combinations of Amino Acids Giving the Ten Highest Values of the Correlation Coefficient <italic>R</italic> between OGT and Fraction of the Amino Acids for 86 Proteomes</title><p>(29 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030005-st003" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.st003" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S3</label><caption><title>Organisms Used for Prediction of Transmembrane Beta Barrel Proteins and Their OGT</title><p>(44 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030005-st004" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.st004" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S4</label><caption><title>Combinations of Nucleotides and Correlation Coefficients between OGT and Fraction of the Corresponding Nucleotides in the Coding DNA of 83 Organisms</title><p>(31 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030005-st005" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030005.st005" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S5</label><caption><title>Correlation Coefficients <italic>R</italic> between OGT and Amino Acids and Pairs of Amino Acids</title><p>(A) Correlation coefficients <italic>R</italic> between OGT and fractions of individual amino acids for 83 genomes, ordered by <italic>R</italic>.</p><p>(B) Correlation coefficients <italic>R</italic> between OGT and fractions of two-letter combinations of amino acids for 83 genomes, ordered by <italic>R</italic></p><p>(70 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to M.
