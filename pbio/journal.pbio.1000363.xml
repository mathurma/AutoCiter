<p>The newly evolved pheromone response pathway of the white cell phenotype of the opportunistic human pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> provides a unique view of how signal transduction pathways evolve.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>The way in which signal transduction pathways evolve remains a mystery, primarily because we have few examples of ones that have newly evolved. There are numerous examples of how signal transduction pathways in the same organism selectively share components, most notably between the signal transduction pathways in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> for the mating process, the filamentation process, cell wall integrity, ascospore formation, and osmoregulation. These examples, however, have not provided insights into how such pathways evolve. Here, through construction of an overexpression library for 107 transcription factors, and through mutational analyses, we have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of the newly evolved signal transduction pathway that regulates the pheromone response of the white cell phenotype in <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The elucidation of this last component, Tec1, establishes a comprehensive description of the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, providing a unique perspective on how new signal transduction pathways may evolve. The three portions of this new regulatory pathway appear to have been derived from three different ancestral programs still functional in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The upstream portion, including signals, receptors, the trimeric G protein complex, and the MAP kinase cascade, was derived intact from the upstream portion of the opaque pheromone response pathway of the mating process; Tec1, the transcription factor targeted by the MAP kinase pathway, was derived from a filamentation pathway; and the white-specific downstream target genes were derived from an ancestral biofilm process. The evolution of this pheromone response pathway provides a possible paradigm for how such signal transduction pathways evolve.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Signal transduction pathways regulate the response of cells to changes in the extracellular environment. Here, we report the identification of Tec1 as the single effector transcription factor of the pheromone response pathway of the human pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> white cell type. This newly evolved pathway provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate signal transduction pathway evolution. In the <italic>C. albicans</italic> white-opaque transition, mating-competent opaque cells release mating pheromone that induces mating-incompetent white cells to form a biofilm which facilitates mating of the former. Each of the three major portions of the pathway that regulates white cell pheromone response appears to be derived from an ancestral pathway that is still intact and functional in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The upstream portion—including the pheromone, its receptor, trimeric G protein complex, and a MAP kinase cascade—appears to be derived from the mating response pathway; transcription factor Tec1 from the filamentation pathway; and Tec1 target genes from the biofilm biosynthesis pathway. We posit that the sharing of upstream signaling components coordinates white and opaque cell pheromone responses, yet the divergence of downstream pathway components allows each cell type to elicit a unique phenotypic outcome. The white cell pheromone response pathway therefore provides a paradigm for how other such pathways may have evolved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are numerous examples of how signal transduction pathways within an organism selectively share components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Tan1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Salojin1">[5]</xref>. For instance, in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, components are shared to varying degrees among pathways regulating mating, filamentation, cell wall integrity, ascospore formation, and osmoregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Levin1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Yi1">[10]</xref>. However, such examples have not engendered a discussion of how signal transduction pathways evolve. For such insights, one must identify and interpret the origins of components in very new, or “young,” signal transduction pathways. Here, the elucidation of the last unidentified component of the pheromone response pathway of the white phenotype of <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, provides such a view, which may prove to be a paradigm for how some signal transduction pathways evolve.</p>
<p>In order for <italic>C. albicans</italic> to mate, it must undergo homozygosis from <bold>a</bold>/α to <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> or α/α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Hull1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Magee1">[13]</xref>, then switch from the white to opaque phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Miller1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Lockhart1">[15]</xref>. This latter requirement appears to be unique to <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the highly related species <italic>Candida dubliniensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Pujol1">[16]</xref>. The reason for this dependency may be due in part to a unique signaling system that evolved between opaque and white cells that leads to the formation of a biofilm that can facilitate mating between minority opaque cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Daniels1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Soll1">[18]</xref>. Mating-competent opaque cells, but not mating-incompetent white cells, release pheromone that induces a cell cycle block in G1, polarization, shmoo formation, and the expression of a number of mating-associated genes in opaque cells of opposite mating type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Daniels1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Lockhart2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Daniels2">[20]</xref>. Pheromone released by opaque cells has none of these effects on white cells of opposite mating types. Pheromone does, however, induce in these cells adhesion, cohesion, enhancement of biofilm formation, and the expression of select genes involved in these responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Yi1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Daniels1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Yi2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>. White cell biofilms have been shown in vitro to facilitate chemotropism between minority opaque cells of opposite mating types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Daniels1">[17]</xref>, leading to the hypothesis that the white-opaque switching system evolved from the direct ancestor of <italic>C .albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> to facilitate mating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Soll1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>The white cell pheromone response is mediated by a signal transduction pathway that shares all of the upstream components with the opaque cell signal transduction pathway involved in mating, including the pheromone signal, the pheromone receptors, the heterotrimeric G protein complex, and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Yi1">[10]</xref>. The pheromone response pathway in opaque cells targeted the transcription factor Cph1, an ortholog of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> transcription factor Ste12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Dolan1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Errede1">[25]</xref>, which activates mating-associated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Yi1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Chen1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Magee2">[27]</xref>. The pheromone response pathway in white cells, however, was found not to target Cph1, but rather an unknown transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Yi1">[10]</xref>. Cph1 up-regulated genes through the common GC-rich <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence OPRE, whereas the unidentified white-specific transcription factor up-regulated genes through the common AT-rich <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence WPRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>. Many of the genes that were found to be up-regulated by the white-specific transcription factor, but were not components of the pheromone response pathway, had already been implicated directly or indirectly in biofilm formation in <bold>a</bold>/α cells and, through mutational analyses, were shown to be involved in pheromone-induced white cell biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>. These observations have led to a unique glimpse into the evolution of a relatively new signal transduction pathway, the white cell pheromone response pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>, which is probably no older than the common ancestor of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, given that white-opaque switching is unique to these two highly related species. It appears that in the evolution of the white pheromone response pathway, the upstream portion was borrowed intact from the mating pathway conserved in the Hemiascomycetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Butler1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Soll2">[29]</xref>, whereas the downstream target genes appeared to have been borrowed from the presumably conserved biofilm process of <bold>a</bold>/α cells. Only one piece of the pathway was missing, namely the identity and origin of the transcription factor connecting the upstream portion of the pathway and the downstream target genes.</p>
<p>To identify this factor, we generated an overexpression library of 107 individual <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> strains, each transformed with a construct in which a different transcription factor was placed under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Park1">[30]</xref>. A screen for the unidentified white-specific transcription factor was then performed based on the assumption that overexpression of the correct transcription factor in the absence of pheromone would induce the white cell pheromone response. Using the dramatic increase in adhesion associated with the white cell pheromone response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Daniels1">[17]</xref> as an assay, we found that only one of the 107 transcription factors, when overexpressed in the absence of pheromone, induced adhesion. The factor was Tec1, which had previously been shown to play a role in filamentation in both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Madhani2">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Lo1">[33]</xref> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Schweizer1">[34]</xref>. Characterization of the <italic>TEC1</italic> deletion mutant <italic>tec1/tec1</italic> confirmed that it encoded the target transcription factor in the white cell pheromone response pathway. With this last component of the pathway identified, the evolution of the white-specific pheromone response pathway suggested a scenario in which all major components of the pathway had been derived from three conserved ancestral programs still functioning in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, providing a possible paradigm for how new signal transduction pathways may evolve.</p>

<title>Generating an Overexpression Library for Transcription Factors</title>
<p>Our strategy to identify the transcription factor targeted by the MAP kinase pathway involved a screen in which the overexpression strains in the library were tested for the white cell response in the absence of pheromone. To accomplish this, we first identified 107 putative transcription factor genes involved in biofilm formation, adhesion, filamentation, cell wall integrity, membrane biogenesis, drug resistance, stress responses, and metabolism, and in a few cases of unknown function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s004">Table S1</xref>). Each gene was synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction using the primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s005">Table S2</xref>, verified by sequencing and inserted into the expression site of the plasmid pNIM1 under the control of a promoter inducible by tetracycline or doxycycline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Park1">[30]</xref>, which we will refer to as <italic>TETp</italic>. This promoter was derived from the <italic>tet</italic> operator regulating tetracycline-resistant genes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Park1">[30]</xref>. Each transcription factor gene was fused in frame at the 3′ end with the GFP ORF. Each of the 107 plasmids was then used to transform the natural <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> strain P37005 by integration at the <italic>ADH1</italic> locus, generating an overexpression library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s006">Table S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Screen for the White-Specific Pheromone-Induced Transcription Factor</title>
<p>Each of the 107 overexpression strains was tested in the absence of pheromone for increased adhesion to a plastic surface in the absence or presence of 100 µg per ml of doxycycline. To obtain a measure of maximum pheromone induction, white cells of the parental control strain P37005 were first analyzed in the absence and presence of α-pheromone. Adhesion was negligible (&lt;10<sup>6</sup> cells per well bottom) in the absence and maximal (&gt;10<sup>8</sup> cells per well bottom) in the presence of α-pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In the absence of α-pheromone, doxycycline induced adhesion in only one of the 107 overexpression strains, and did so to the same extent as α-pheromone induction in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). That single strain overexpressed the gene <italic>TEC1</italic>.

<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Tec1 binds to the <italic>cis</italic>-acting AT-rich motif, TCS (TEA consensus sequence), in the promoters of Tec1-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Madhani2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Baur1">[37]</xref>. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, WPRE (the white pheromone response element), the presumed Tec1 binding site is also AT-rich, in contrast to the Cph1 binding site, which is GC-rich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>. The genes used to generate consensus motifs for <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences with the MEME program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Bailey1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Bailey2">[40]</xref> are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s007">Table S4</xref>. Although the MEME program identified a consensus sequence, WPRE, which was 15 bases in length in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, that was longer than the TCS consensus sequence in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, WPRE contains nearly intact the TCS motif as a subcomponent. This WPRE subcomponent differs from TCS by only a single base mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence has been conserved to some extent across species, including humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s008">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>The DNA binding domain of Tec1 in <italic>C. albicans</italic> is 63 amino acids in length (amino acids 183 to 245), whereas the deduced binding domain of Tec1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is 413 amino acids (amino acids 74 to 486). The <italic>C. albicans</italic> binding domain shows strong homology (60% identity, 84% similarity) to a subdomain of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> binding domain, between amino acids 130 and 192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

<title>Regulation of <italic>TEC1</italic></title>
<p>To test whether <italic>TEC1</italic> expression was regulated by α-pheromone and the MAP kinase pathway, a northern analysis was performed to assess its expression in deletion mutants for key elements of the signal transduction pathway in the absence and presence of α-pheromone. In white cells of the control strain P37005, <italic>TEC1</italic> was expressed at a basal level in the absence of α-pheromone, but at a highly elevated level in the presence of α-pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In opaque cells of P37005, <italic>TEC1</italic> was expressed at the same basal level in the absence and presence of α-pheromone, demonstrating that unlike white cells, α-pheromone did not up-regulate <italic>TEC1</italic> transcription in opaque cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In white cells of the deletion mutants of <italic>STE2</italic>, which encodes the α-pheromone receptor, and <italic>STE4</italic>, which encodes the beta subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, and in white cells of the double mutant for <italic>CEK1</italic> and <italic>CEK2</italic>, which encode the two MAP kinase isoforms (<italic>ste2/ste2</italic>, <italic>ste4/ste4</italic>, <italic>cek1/cek1 cek2/cek2</italic>, respectively), α-pheromone did not up-regulate <italic>TEC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Hyperactivating the MAP kinase pathway by overexpressing <italic>STE11</italic>, which encodes the first component of the MAP kinase cascade, in white cells of strain P37005-<italic>TETp</italic>-<italic>STE11</italic> in the absence of α-pheromone, caused an increase in adhesion of over 100-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and up-regulation of <italic>TEC1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

(A) Northern analysis of pheromone (α-ph) induction of <italic>TEC1</italic> in P37005 white (Wh) and opaque (Op) cells, and in white cells of the mutants <italic>ste2/ste2</italic>, <italic>ste4/ste4</italic>, and <italic>cek1/cek1 cek2/cek2</italic>. (B) Overexpression of <italic>STE11</italic> induces adhesion in the absence of α-pheromone. Overexpression was induced in white cells by adding 50 µg per ml of doxycycline (Dox) to the overexpression strain P37005-<italic>TETp</italic>-<italic>STE11</italic>. (C) Overexpression of <italic>STE11</italic> by addition of 50 µg per ml of doxycycline in the absence of α-pheromone activates genes in the white response pathway in strain P37005-<italic>TETp</italic>-<italic>STE11</italic>.

<p>To demonstrate that the protein product of <italic>TEC1</italic>, in addition to the <italic>TEC1</italic> transcript, was selectively up-regulated by α-pheromone in white but not opaque cells, we analyzed the level of Tec1-GFP in strain <italic>tec1/tec1</italic>-<italic>TEC1</italic> in which <italic>TEC1</italic>-GFP had been inserted into its endogenous site under the control of its native promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s009">Table S6</xref>). The level of Tec1 was assessed by Western blot analysis, using anti-GFP antibody. In the absence of α-pheromone, the basal level of Tec1 in white cells of strain <italic>tec1/tec1</italic>-<italic>TEC1</italic> was extremely low, whereas in the presence of α-pheromone, it was close to two orders of magnitude higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In the absence and presence of α-pheromone in opaque cells, the level of Tec1-GFP was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that <italic>TEC1</italic> is selectively up-regulated by α-pheromone at the RNA and protein levels through the MAP kinase pathway in white cells, but not in opaque cells.</p>

<p>To test whether downstream genes that were not involved in the signal transduction pathway, but were regulated by Tec1 in turn were involved in up-regulating <italic>TEC1</italic>, we analyzed <italic>TEC1</italic> expression in the strains P37005-<italic>TETp-CSH1</italic>, P37005-<italic>TETp-PBR1</italic>, and P37005-<italic>TETp-WH11</italic>.

White cells of this strain were treated with α-pheromone to induce the putative interaction between Tec1-myc and the promoters of regulated genes. An antibody against myc was then used to immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments bound to Tec1-myc. Immunoprecipitated DNA was then amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with primers designed to span approximately 400 base pairs of the promoter region harboring the WPRE in the case of white-specific genes and the OPRE in the case of opaque-specific genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s009">Table S6</xref>).

<title>Tec1 Localizes to White Cell Nuclei</title>
<p>Since Tec1 functions as a white-specific transcription factor, is expressed selectively in white cells, and binds to the promoters of genes up-regulated by α-pheromone in white cells, it would be expected to localize to the nuclei of white cells. To test this, we compared DAPI staining, which is specific for DNA and GFP fluorescence, in a strain <italic>tec1/tec1</italic>-<italic>TEC1</italic> that expressed GFP-tagged Tec1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s006">Table S3</xref>).

White cells of this strain, however, did exhibit weak GFP fluorescence in the absence of α-pheromone and very intense nuclear fluorescence in the presence of α-pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The relative GFP fluorescence in the nucleus in the absence and presence of α-pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) reflected the basal and induced levels, respectively, of protein assessed in Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

In marked contrast, α-pheromone–induced adhesion was abolished in white <italic>tec1/tec1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, biofilm formation was defective. Thickness in the absence of minority opaque cells was depressed by 39% and 34%, respectively, when compared to wild-type and complemented strains, respectively, and opaque cells stimulated thickness by only 11% in mutant cells versus 35% in cells of both control strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). The formation of a basal layer of cells was diminished in <italic>tec1/tec1</italic> cells, the orientation of hyphae was horizontal rather than vertical, the latter suggesting a decrease in matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). The release of β-glucan into the supernatant, a measure of biofilm matrix formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Nobile2">[46]</xref>, was diminished 4-fold in <italic>tec1/tec1</italic> cells in the absence of α-pheromone and 8-fold in the presence of α-pheromone, when compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). The optical density of the matrix was also noticeably diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). The differences in the basal layer, thickness, and hyphae are evident in reconstructed side views and substrate views of confocal images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g005">Figure 5G</xref>).

This sequence differs markedly from the <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence OPRE, which regulates pheromone-inducible genes in the opaque cell pheromone response and includes the GC-rich consensus motif <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GTGAGGGGA</named-content> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>. WPRE contains the six-base motif <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AGAAAG</named-content>, which is remarkably similar to the <italic>cis</italic>-acting TCS motif <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AGAATG</named-content> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Madhani2">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Baur1">[37]</xref> that mediates Tec1 binding in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. To demonstrate that Tec1 interacted directly with WPRE-containing promoters of genes up-regulated by pheromone in white cells, we performed ChIP experiments followed by PCR, amplifying a region in each white- or opaque-specific gene promoter that spanned either the WPRE or OPRE, respectively. The results indicated direct interactions. Whereas Tec1 bound to the promoter regions of <italic>CSH1</italic>, <italic>PBR1</italic>, <italic>RBT5</italic>, <italic>WH11</italic>, <italic>STE2</italic>, and <italic>RBT1</italic>, which all contained a WPRE and were all up-regulated by pheromone in white cells, Tec1 did not bind to the promoter regions of <italic>KAR4</italic> or <italic>MFA1</italic>, which contained an OPRE and lacked a WPRE, and did not bind to the promoter of <italic>ACT1</italic>, which lacked both an OPRE and a WPRE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>. The apparent homology between WPRE in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and TCS in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is noteworthy given the high speed at which transcription factor binding sites have been found to diverge normally in the evolution of yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Borneman1">[57]</xref>.</p>

<title>Tec1 Regulates Biofilm Genes</title>
<p>Tec1 activates both genes that are involved in the signal transduction pathway shared with the opaque cell pheromone response, and genes involved in a variety of membrane or cell wall–associated processes, including adhesion and biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>. In a Northern analysis of 107 genes implicated in adhesion, cell wall biogenesis, biofilm formation, filamentation, and switching, nine genes were found to be strongly up-regulated by pheromone in white but not opaque cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>. All of the promoters of these genes as well as those of three additional genes that had been shown to be similarly up-regulated in white cells by pheromone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Yi1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>, contained a WPRE and lacked an OPRE. Four of these genes randomly selected and deleted were found to play fundamental roles in white cell biofilm formation, suggesting that all or a majority of genes containing a WPRE, but not an OPRE, play a role in α-pheromone–induced white cell biofilm formation. It is noteworthy that all of the biofilm genes up-regulated by Tec1 in the white response in <italic>C. albicans</italic> contain WPRE, and that these same genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s010">Table S7</xref>) in the closely related species <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> also contain WPRE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s011">Table S8</xref>). However, these same genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s010">Table S7</xref>) in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, another species of the <italic>Candida</italic> group in the Hemiascomycetes, that does not undergo white-opaque switching, do not contain a WPRE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000363.s011">Table S8</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found Bcr1, which functions downstream of Tec1 in biofilm formation by <bold>a</bold>/α cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Nobile1">[36]</xref>, did not play a role in early white cell biofilm formation in response to pheromone. <italic>BCR1</italic> did not contain a WPRE, and was not up-regulated by pheromone in white cells (unpublished data). Overexpression of <italic>BCR1</italic> had no effect on the white cell biofilm response to pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Mitchell and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Nobile1">[36]</xref> specifically discuss this gene as it relates to hypha formation, a much later process in biofilm formation, which may explain why we found no function in early biofilm development. Moreover, it must be kept in mind that there may be fundamental differences between <bold>a</bold>/α biofilms and the <italic>MTL</italic>-homozygous biofilms found in the white response.</p>

<title>The Evolution of the White Phase Pheromone Response Pathway</title>
<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, MAP kinase signaling pathways have been compared for common components between the best understood one, the pheromone response pathway, and a number of others, including those for filamentation, high osmolarity, cell wall integrity, and cell wall assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Chen2">[58]</xref>. Remarkably, except for the mating pathway, the signal–receptor interactions for the rest are poorly understood. The sharing of common components between these pathways is limited, except for the pheromone response pathway and the filamentation pathway. For these pathways, the GTPase Cdc42 and the kinase Ste20 immediately upstream of the MAP kinase pathway, as with the downstream components of the MAP kinase pathway, Ste11, Ste7, and Kss1, are shared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>For the white and opaque response pathways of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, a different set of relationships exist. The <italic>C. albicans</italic> opaque cell pheromone response pathway shares with the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> haploid cell pheromone response pathway components from the signal to the transcription activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The white cell pheromone response pathway, however, shares with the opaque cell pheromone response pathway every component from signal and receptor through the MAP kinase cascade, but targets a different transcription factor, and, hence, a different combination of genes that includes biofilm genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). We believe that this set of relationships provides unique insights into how signal transduction pathways may evolve.</p>
<p>First, we argue that the white response pathway must be relatively new since white-opaque switching is unique to <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the closely related species <italic>Candida dubliniensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Pujol1">[16]</xref>, and probably had evolved in their immediate common ancestor approximately 20 million years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Mishra1">[55]</xref>. White-opaque switching has not been observed in any of the other members of the Hemiascomycetes. We propose that in the evolution of the white pheromone response pathway, all of the components were derived from components in other ancestral pathways that had been conserved and still serve the same functions in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. First, we propose that the components in the upstream portion of the white pathway, including signals, receptors, the coupled trimeric G protein complex, and the MAP kinase cascade, were borrowed intact from the ancestral mating pathway (step <bold>a</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), as evidenced by the strict homology between components of the white cell pheromone response pathway, the opaque cell pheromone response pathway, and the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> haploid cell pheromone response pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Yi1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Yi2">[21]</xref>. Second, we argue that the transcription factor regulated by the MAP kinase cascade in the white cell pheromone response pathway, Tec1, was borrowed from an ancestral filamentation pathway (step b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), as is suggested by its conserved role in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> filamentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Oehlen1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Chou1">[35]</xref> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> filamentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Schweizer1">[34]</xref>. We argue that Tec1 was not borrowed in a single step with downstream target genes involved in biofilm formation, because those genes that possess a Tec1 binding site (WPRE) in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, do not possess that site in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, suggesting that Tec1 may not have regulated biofilm genes in a common ancestor. Finally, we propose that the genes directly regulated by Tec1 and involved in the formation of white cell biofilms were borrowed from an ancestral system for biofilm formation, which remains active in biofilm formation in <bold>a</bold>/α cells of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (step c in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic>-acting WPRE element evolved in the promoters of these genes for responsiveness to Tec1. The steps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6C</xref> reflect what we believe to be three discrete evolutionary events and are not supposed to reflect any temporal order.</p>
<p>The signal transduction pathway of the white cell pheromone response evolved to facilitate the outcome of the pathway from which it was derived, namely the mating process. Hence, the upstream portions of the original (opaque) and derived (white) pathways share the same signal and receptor for coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). However, since the specific outcomes of the original and derived pathways differ (i.e., mating versus biofilm development), the derived white cell pathway borrowed target genes from another pathway with the necessary phenotypic outcome, namely the ancestral biofilm program, still functioning in <bold>a</bold>/α strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Hawser1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Nobile3">[61]</xref>. To glue the upstream and downstream components together, the transcription factor Tec1 was borrowed from a third developmental program, filamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000363-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). We therefore suggest that all of the components of the white cell pheromone response pathway have been borrowed from ancestral programs that are still relatively intact and functional. The white pathway is young and thus has had insufficient time to duplicate, replace, or modify components in response to new selective pressures or changing roles. We suggest that the evolution of the white cell pheromone response pathway in <italic>C. albicans</italic> affords a unique glimpse into the evolution of a new signal transduction pathway, and may provide at least one paradigm for how such pathways may evolve.</p>

Cells were then spun down and resuspended in fresh medium at a concentration of 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in the absence or presence of 3×10<sup>−6</sup> M α-pheromone, and incubated at 25°C for 4 h. Shmoo formation was then monitored microscopically, and the percentage of shmooing cells was quantified from a total of 1,500 randomly selected cells. For mating assay, opaque cells of an <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> mutant or wild-type strain P37005 were resuspended in fresh liquid medium from a stationary phase culture, and mixed with an equal amount of opaque cells of the α/α strain WO-1. The mating mixture was incubated at 25°C for 24 h before it was monitored microscopically for fusants. Mating efficiency was computed as the percentage of cells that fused out of a total number of 5,000 randomly selected cells. The means and standard deviations for percent shmoo formation and mating efficiency from three independent experiments are presented in bar charts.</p>

<title>Quantitation of Biofilm Formation</title>
<p>Biofilm enhancement by minority opaque cells was assessed by adding 5% opaque <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> P37005 cells and 5% opaque α/α WO-1 cells. The cell mixture was incubated at 29°C on silicone elastomer squares (Cardiovascular Instrument Corp.) in RPMI medium in a well of a 12-well cluster plate (Costar, Corning Inc.) for 90 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Yi1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Daniels1">[17]</xref>. The squares were then washed gently with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), placed in a new well with fresh RPMI medium, and further incubated on a rocker (Immunetics) for 48 h. The biofilm was then fixed by addition of 10% formaldehyde to the culture, rinsed with PBS, and stained with calcofluor (Fluorescent Brightener 28, Sigma) in 0.1 M Tris (pH 9.0) and imaged as above. Calcofluor was excited at 818 nm. Using BioRad LaserSharp software, an initial <italic>x-y</italic> optical section was gathered at the biofilm–substrate interface. Thickness of the biofilm in the same field was determined by a 125-µm <italic>Z</italic>-series 2.0-µm steps. Biofilms were prepared in triplicate cultures, and the means and standard deviations of biofilm thickness from three samples were presented. The characteristics of the biofilm (matrix, hyphae, etc.) were determined by scrolling through the <italic>Z</italic>-series. A single <italic>Z-X</italic> slice through the <italic>Z</italic>-series was then digitally acquired.</p>
<p>Biofilm matrix formation was quantitated by measuring the concentration of (1,3)-β-glucan in the biofilm supernatant, according to the methods previously described in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Sahni2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000363-Nobile2">[46]</xref>. Glucan concentration was measured using Glucatell (1,3)-β-<sc>d</sc>-Glucan Detection Reagent Kit (Associates of Cape Cod) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The glucan concentration was assessed by an end-point assay in which the optical density values were measured at 540 nm in a microplate reader (MDS Analytical Technologies). The means and standard deviations of (1,3)-β-glucan concentration from the three independent biofilm samples are presented in a bar chart.</p>
