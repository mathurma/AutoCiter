It has been proposed that long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber (PF)–Purkinje cell (PC) synapses forms the cellular basis of cerebellar learning, and that the presynaptically synthesized messenger nitric oxide (NO) is a crucial “gatekeeper” for LTD. Because NO diffuses freely to neighboring synapses, this volume learning is not input-specific and brings into question the biological significance of LTD as the basic mechanism for efficient supervised learning. To better characterize the role of NO in cerebellar learning, we simulated the sequence of electrophysiological and biochemical events in PF–PC LTD by combining established simulation models of the electrophysiology, calcium dynamics, and signaling pathways of the PC. The results demonstrate that the local NO concentration is critical for induction of LTD and for its input specificity. Pre- and postsynaptic coincident firing is not sufficient for a PF–PC synapse to undergo LTD, and LTD is induced only when a sufficient amount of NO is provided by activation of the surrounding PFs. On the other hand, above-adequate levels of activity in nearby PFs cause accumulation of NO, which also allows LTD in neighboring synapses that were not directly stimulated, ruining input specificity. These findings lead us to propose the hypothesis that NO represents the relevance of a given context and enables context-dependent selection of internal models to be updated. We also predict sparse PF activity in vivo because, otherwise, input specificity would be lost.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The cerebellum is essential for coordinated movements. The skills for executing such movements are acquired in modules of the cerebellum, and the appropriate modules in which to store the skill for a certain movement are selected according to the environment, or the context, where the movement is made. We are interested in the molecular mechanisms that enable context-dependent cerebellar learning. In search of the key molecules, we combined established simulation models of Purkinje cells, the only output neurons in the cerebellar cortex, and constructed a new model. Using computer simulation, we found that nitric oxide is likely to have a pivotal role in context-dependent learning. Our simulation also provides insights into how sparse sensory information is coded in the cerebellar cortex. These findings have led us to propose the experimentally testable hypothesis that the relevance of a given context to learning modules is represented by the concentration of nitric oxide.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was performed through the Human Frontier Science Program.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ogasawara H, Doi T, Doya K, Kawato M (2007) Nitric oxide regulates input specificity of long-term depression and context dependence of cerebellar learning.

Recent studies have shown that multiple internal models are acquired in the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b002">2</xref>], and that these can be switched under a given context of behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b004">4</xref>], so that, for example, we can walk on stairs or on escalators without losing balance. Contextual information, which consists of various modalities of afferent signals from the entire body and efferent signals from the cerebrum, is transmitted to the cerebellar cortex via mossy fibers (MFs) and parallel fibers (PFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b007">7</xref>]. Contexts may also be processed in the upstream cerebral regions, such as the superior parietal lobe, the occipital lobe, and the middle temporal lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b004">4</xref>]. The combination of contexts and tasks is thought to enable the cerebellum to acquire and switch between multiple internal models in a context-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b007">7</xref>]. Indeed, adaptation to multiple motor tasks is possible when they are presented together with adequate sensory or cognitive cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b011">11</xref>]. On the other hand, without these contexts, the motor memory of a previously learned task would be erased by the experience of an opposing task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b012">12</xref>]. However, the biological mechanisms of context-dependent learning have yet to be explored.</p><p>Long-term depression (LTD) of PF–Purkinje cell (PC) synapses is widely thought to form the cellular basis of cerebellar learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>], with some controversies regarding its computational roles and the participation of other types of plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b017">17</xref>]. The presynaptically synthesized messenger nitric oxide (NO) is a “gatekeeper” to plasticity at these synapses; LTD and long-term potentiation are induced only in its presence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b021">21</xref>].

It is basically a passive electrical cable representing a PC dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) whose dendritic spines contain ion channels, calcium buffers, calcium pumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), and a biochemical reaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). For our purposes, it was necessary to simulate the whole sequence of events in PF–PC LTD, from stimulation of PF–PC synapses coupled with depolarization, diffusion of NO, and an increase of calcium concentration in the spine ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub>), to activation of the intracellular signaling cascade and phosphorylation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors (AMPARs), using a rather complicated model, because cerebellar LTD is a very nonlinear phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b026">26</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0020179-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020179.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of the Model</title><p>(A) The electrophysiological structure of the model.

The electrophysiological part of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) is based on a realistic PC model proposed by De Schutter et al. (De Schutter's model) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b024">24</xref>] but is greatly simplified. It consists of a 90-μm dendritic cable that is as long electrically as the average PC dendrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b027">27</xref>] and is composed of 30 compartments. The peripheral ten compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, left side) are 1.3 μm in diameter and 2 μm in length; the middle ten are 2.6 μm in diameter and 3 μm in length; and the proximal ten (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, right side) are 3.9 μm in diameter and 4 μm in length. A total of 1,350 single-compartment spines are connected to the dendrite (15 spines per micrometer of the dendrite length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b029">29</xref>]) by a spine neck. The electrical potential of each spine and dendritic compartment is expressed in cable equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b030">30</xref>]. Despite considerable alterations to De Schutter's model, our model retains important characteristics of the PC, as expected from the robustness of the original model to any changes made in its parameter values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b031">31</xref>]. For example, the input resistance measured at the tip of the dendrite is 129 MΩ, which is on the same order as the values estimated from real PCs (132–511 MΩ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b027">27</xref>].</p><p>Stimuli to PF–PC synapses are represented as AMPAR currents into the spines<bold> (</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), and diffusion of presynaptically synthesized NO. We assumed a constant release probability and did not model presynaptic plasticity. The kinetics of NO and calcium are introduced in later subsections. Spillover of glutamate was not considered, because granular layer stimulation and molecular layer stimulation that involve approximately 60 PF–PC synapses each have been reported to produce excitatory postsynaptic currents with almost equal decay time constants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b032">32</xref>], suggesting that glutamate spillover has only minimal effects, if any, on the extent of stimulation in our study. Inhibitory interneurons were not simulated.</p><p>The biochemical reaction network for LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) was derived from a model proposed by Kuroda et al. (Kuroda's model) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b026">26</xref>]. According to their study, AMPAR phosphorylation, the key step in expression of cerebellar LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b026">26</xref>], is regulated in the initial phase by Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and diacylglycerol-mediated linear pathways, and is maintained in the intermediate phase by a positive feedback loop pathway that is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), and protein kinase C (PKC). Indeed, the essential role of this feedback loop in cerebellar LTD has been virtually proved by a series of in vitro pharmacological experiments demonstrating the following: PKC activation results in MAPK activation; MAPK activation results in PKC activation; cPLA2 is activated by MAPK and activates PKC; and prolonged activation of PKC is necessary for induction of LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b033">33</xref>]. Similar to Kuroda et al., we measured the concentration of phosphorylated AMPARs ([P-AMPAR]) as the output of the simulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Production, Diffusion, and Decay of Nitric Oxide</title><p>Firing of PFs activates NO synthase (NOS) in their presynaptic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b021">21</xref>]. The NO produced by NOS then freely diffuses into the intracellular and extracellular spaces and decays, affecting postsynaptic signaling pathways en route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b023">23</xref>]. We modeled the decay and diffusion of NO synthesized at a PF bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) and calculated the NO concentration ([NO]) at various distances from the bouton and at various times. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>B is a plot of the time course of NO synthesized in a bouton at various distances from the observation point, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>C shows its spatial distribution at various time points. [NO] rapidly peaked after activation of NOS, then gradually fell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The distribution of NO was restricted to within 10 μm or 20 μm of its source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In reality, however, when a PF fires, NO is not synthesized at a single bouton but at multiple neighboring boutons, which occur every 5.2 μm along the PF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). These boutons also contribute to [NO] at the observation point on the PC dendritic plane, according to their distance away from the observation point; that is, <inline-formula id="pcbi-0020179-ex001"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020179.ex001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>

NO derived from a PF persisted slightly longer than that derived from a bouton. The concentrations of NO derived from a PF at R = 1 μm, 5 μm, and 10 μm returned to 36.8% of their peak values in 64 ms, 72 ms, and 79 ms, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), whereas the concentrations of NO derived from a single bouton at the same distances returned to 36.8% of their peak values in 59 ms, 67 ms, and 75 ms, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). In addition, NO derived from a PF was spatially less restricted than that derived from a single bouton. At 25 ms, 50 ms, and 100 ms after activation of NOS, the ratios of the [NO] derived from a PF at R = 10 μm to that at R = 5 μm were 0.33, 0.35, and 0.35, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>F), whereas the ratios of the [NO] derived from a bouton at R = 10 μm to that at R = 5 μm were 0.23, 0.24, and 0.24, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). The spatial distribution of NO synthesized in a PF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>F) quantitatively agrees with the results of a previous slice experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b035">35</xref>].

Goodness of fit was quantified by the ratio of the confidence interval of the SF to the SF. [P-AMPAR] best fitted a sigmoid curve at 19 min with a SF of 9.9 (95% confidence interval, 8.7–11.1), indicating strong nonlinearity of AMPAR phosphorylation in the intermediate phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>C; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>D for [P-AMPAR] at 19 min with the sigmoid curve superimposed).

In other words, under such conditions, a submicromolar increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> is sufficient for induction of LTD. However, stimulation of a smaller number of PFs, coupled with depolarization, fails to induce LTD, even in stimulated synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b038">38</xref>]. Furthermore, when the stimulation parameters are varied, stimulated synapses and their neighboring synapses often undergo modification in the same direction—that is, either long-term potentiation or LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b038">38</xref>]. These findings conflict with the proposed role of cerebellar LTD in supervised learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>], in which input specificity is taken for granted. We therefore compared AMPAR phosphorylation in a stimulated spine and an adjacent spine to determine whether there is any opportunity for synaptic specificity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>D plots [P-AMPAR] at 19 min after stimulation in a stimulated synapse and a neighboring synapse 9 μm from the tip of the dendrite against the number of stimulated synapses, N. The slope of [P-AMPAR] in the neighboring synapse was less steep than that in the stimulated synapse, probably because the MAPK-mediated positive feedback loop, which is responsible for the bistability of AMPAR phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b026">26</xref>], is not fully activated by submicromolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub>.

We therefore concluded that synapse-specific LTD is theoretically possible within a narrow range of N (ten to 18), although experiments have failed to clearly demonstrate input specificity of LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b038">38</xref>]. Just by adjusting parameters so that LTD would begin to spread through the neighborhood at an N of about 20 (Materials and Methods), our simulation succeeded in demonstrating the failure of LTD at smaller Ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), which has also been shown experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b038">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>The Time-Averaged Concentration of NO, Not Its Actual Waveforms, Is Critical for AMPAR Phosphorylation</title><p>Although only a fraction of PFs form electrically connected synapses with a PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b043">43</xref>], other PFs can also affect these synapses by producing NO. PFs convey diverse modalities of signals, and the set of PFs responsible for a certain motion in a certain context does not always fire in exact synchrony. The more out of synchrony they fire, the more blunt the NO waveforms become. Taking the slow time constant of protein phosphatase 2A inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) into account, we hypothesized that [P-AMPAR] would depend not on NO waveforms, but rather on its time-averaged concentration. To test this hypothesis, we compared receptor phosphorylation induced by pulses of NO and that induced by continuous exposure to NO. A spine was stimulated for 5 min, either repetitively at 1 Hz with realistic waveforms of NO (identical in shape to the solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and variable in amplitude), or constantly with the equivalent time-averaged concentration of NO. Calcium surges (identical in shape and amplitude to the curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) were applied concomitantly at 1 Hz. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g005">Figure 5</xref>A shows the time course of AMPAR phosphorylation induced by constant NO and that induced by equivalent pulses. Their time courses almost coincide, suggesting that constant NO can substitute for equivalent pulses in AMPAR phosphorylation. We then tested NO waves at various frequencies to further confirm the independency of AMPAR phosphorylation from the waveforms of NO. It should be noted that what we examined here is not the frequency of stimuli to PFs, upon which presynaptic NO synthesis is dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b035">35</xref>]. A spine was stimulated for 5 min with NO pluses at a frequency of 0.25 Hz, 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz, or 4 Hz, and with calcium surges at 1 Hz. The NO pulses were rescaled so that their time-averaged concentrations would be the same. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g005">Figure 5</xref>B shows [P-AMPAR] at 19 min, the time point when the all-or-none principle of AMPAR phosphorylation is most obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), plotted against the frequencies of NO pulses. This figure indicates that the effect of NO on AMPAR phosphorylation is independent of its frequency within the range shown. Because of these findings, we were able to define the concentration of constant NO that would result in [P-AMPAR]<sub>50%,19min</sub> of phosphorylated AMPARs at 19 min (median effective concentration, or EC<sub>50</sub>). The EC<sub>50</sub> of NO for a stimulated spine and that for a neighboring spine are 0.41 nM and 0.69 nM, respectively.

At one extreme, they might all be concentrated in a small area of a PC dendrite; at the other extreme, they might be evenly distributed in the molecular layer, with only one of them forming an electrically active synapse with the PC (if none of them formed an electrically active synapse, there would be no room for synapse-specific modification linked to that movement). We were able to examine the relationship between PF distribution and AMPAR phosphorylation in a simple scheme in which [NO] is constant throughout stimulation, because AMPAR phosphorylation depends on the time-averaged concentration of NO, and not on its actual waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Synaptic stimulation was represented as NO synthesis, AMPAR current, and mGluR activation, but we were also able to regard neighboring PFs merely as additional sources of NO, because stimuli to them had hardly any effect on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> in the synapse of interest, and because the downstream signaling cascade of mGluR activation was synapse-specific, at least in our model.

However, this rather simple model was able to demonstrate the key features of PF–PC LTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and shed light on some important characteristics of cerebellar LTD and learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g006">6</xref>).</p><p>The simulation results revealed that synapse-specific modification is theoretically possible despite the difficulty in demonstrating it experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b038">38</xref>]. Furthermore, [P-AMPAR] in the intermediate phase was found to be dependent on NO derived from surrounding PFs. During low PF activity in the vicinity, stimulated PF–PC synapses were incapable of undergoing prolonged AMPAR phosphorylation because of an insufficient NO concentration; during excessive PF activity, even neighboring synapses underwent AMPAR phosphorylation, and synapse specificity was lost. Only at a moderate level of PF activity in the vicinity did AMPAR phosphorylation occur in a synapse-specific manner. We predict that any movement in any context is encoded by a small number of PFs, because otherwise synapse specificity would be lost.</p><p>Although LTD can be induced by a large increase in calcium alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b048">48</xref>], in vivo studies have shown the essential role of NO in cerebellar learning and adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b051">51</xref>], suggesting that LTD in such a condition is unphysiological. Similarly, LTD induced by strong activation of PFs alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b042">42</xref>] can be regarded as another unphysiological extreme, because the predicted sparse activity of PFs in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g006">Figure 6</xref>) will never be sufficient for supralinear increase in calcium levels if it is not paired with CF firing. Between these two extremes lies our simulation setting, where LTD is induced by the increase of NO and calcium levels due to conjunctive activation of PFs and the CF, which corresponds better to the physiology of behaving animals.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Synaptic Specificity</title><p>Our simulation shows that synapse-specific AMPAR phosphorylation is theoretically possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Some slice experiments have demonstrated that, in most cases, standard procedures to induce homosynaptic PF–PC LTD also induce heterosynaptic LTD in neighboring synapses, bringing into question the input specificity of cerebellar LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b042">42</xref>]. There are, however, strong reasons to expect input specificity in vivo, if not in vitro. Cerebellar LTD needs to be input-specific if it is the cellular substrate of supervised learning, as suggested experimentally and theoretically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>]. In addition, synapse-specific modification is more advantageous by orders of magnitude than the nonspecific form in terms of metabolic costs and memory capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b041">41</xref>]. Moreover, neurons have acquired through evolution the apparatus to localize modification in individual spines, such as the intraspinal calcium store [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>] and the calcium-compartmentalizing spine neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b052">52</xref>]. Thus, our demonstration of room for synapse-specific AMPAR phosphorylation is not at all trivial. The range of the number of stimulated synapses for input-specific LTD was found to be narrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figures 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020179-sg003">S3</xref>), which accounts for the difficulty in demonstrating this form of LTD experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b038">38</xref>].</p><p>In contrast with the previous report that multiple PFs need to be stimulated in order to induce LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b038">38</xref>], Casado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b019">19</xref>] demonstrated LTD at the synapse between a single granule cell (GC) and a PC. However, as is suggested in their paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b019">19</xref>], not only the PF–PC synapse, but also multiple synapses at the ascending part of the GC axon, could be involved. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to confirm the possibility that stimuli to a single synapse is sufficient for induction of LTD.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>NO Represents the Relevance of Contexts</title><p>The IP<sub>3</sub>R, which is sensitive to both calcium and IP<sub>3</sub>, appears to be sufficient for the coincidence detection mechanism triggered by conjunctive stimulation of the PF and the climbing fiber (CF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b036">36</xref>]. So, what can NO add in terms of computation? Considering that only a fraction of PFs traversing a PC dendritic plate make electrical connections with the PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b043">43</xref>], this diffusing messenger seems to have a specific role in cerebellar learning. According to the results of our simulation, input-specific LTD necessitates that NO be provided by a modest number of surrounding PFs. This is a very important finding, because it might underlie context-dependent learning in the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b010">10</xref>], as we propose here. In our hypothesis, NO represents the relevance of a given context and enables context-dependent selection of internal models to be updated. Imagine that a PF–PC synapse responsible for a certain movement in a certain context is surrounded by thousands of PFs coding vast modalities of information, such as joint angles, audiovisual cues, verbal instructions, etc. The synapse will be modified only when it and a few of its surrounding PFs fire together and produce a sufficient concentration of NO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, left). However, if a small fraction of them happen to fire in an inappropriate situation, the synapse will remain unmodified, because [NO] does not reach the level necessary for prolonged AMPAR phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, right). As a result, the internal models for a movement are acquired or updated only when they are responsible in the given context. In other contexts, where these internal models are not responsible, they are left unmodified. This corresponds to the system-level findings that the cerebellum can form modules of internal models according to the context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b004">4</xref>], while adaptation to multiple tasks is interfered with in the absence of adequate contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b012">12</xref>].

However, a recent in vivo study revealed that a burst of activity in an MF is not filtered at the MF–GC synapse, but rather directly transmitted to the downstream GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b055">55</xref>], implying that input patterns are not likely to be separated there. Our hypothesis might provide a resolution by suggesting that pattern separation, or assignment of adequate internal models for a movement to be learned in a given context, takes place in the molecular layer instead, according to the [NO] determined by the surrounding PF activity in that context.</p><p>Because bursts of PF activity are more efficient than single pulses in induction of LTD in cerebellar slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b056">56</xref>], one may argue the possibility that repetitive activation of a single PF is sufficient for induction of LTD. However, it is very difficult to experimentally test this, because even the weakest stimuli might activate several PFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b036">36</xref>]. Bursts of PF activation might be too strong and less appropriate than single stimuli as an analog for physiological activation of PFs in vivo for the following reason: single activation of PFs in slices elicits repetitive firing through the antidromic activation of GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b057">57</xref>], just like physiological stimuli in vivo typically evoke triplets of action potentials in GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b055">55</xref>], presumably firing their PFs as many times. On the other hand, bursts of activation applied in slice experiments usually consist of five pulses, which are much greater stimuli than triplets in vivo, considering the multiplication of pulses in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b057">57</xref>].</p><p>A recent study implicated the presynaptic terminals of interneurons rather than PFs as the origin of NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b058">58</xref>]. If so, our simulation model and hypothesis would still apply, because the activity of interneurons reflects that of connected PFs, and their connection with multiple PFs might serve to integrate PF activity in the neighborhood. Namiki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b035">35</xref>] estimated [NO] after stimulation of PFs to be at micromolar levels, whereas Hall and Garthwaite estimated the peak concentration of NO produced by a single bouton to be 15 pM and the tissue concentration of NO to be 50 nM at most following full activation of NOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b059">59</xref>]. This severe discrepancy might reflect a lack of knowledge and understanding of NO kinetics in the brain. The peak concentrations of NO in our simulation lie between Hall's and Namiki's estimates, at a nanomolar level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Because we estimated a production rate of NO (k<sub>f</sub>[NOS]<sub>total</sub>) at which NO would mediate the spread of LTD at a realistic size of PF stimulation, our model as a whole yields quantitatively compatible outcomes with experimental findings in terms of AMPAR phosphorylation and LTD.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Sparse PF Activity Codes a Movement in a Context</title><p>According to the results of our simulation, synapse specificity requires that every movement in every context be coded by a small number of PFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This is in agreement with Marr and Albus' postulation that only a small fraction of PFs is active at any given time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b054">54</xref>], and might at least partly explain the extreme difficulty in demonstrating in vivo PF activity induced by natural stimuli, in spite of recent technical developments in the bioimaging of and electrophysiology of the cerebellar cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b060">60</xref>].

Moreover, a simulation study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b065">65</xref>] has shown that a slight increase in the PF firing rate can raise the SS frequency dramatically. Indeed, a burst of activity in only a few PF–PC synapses is sufficient to evoke large excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the soma. Assuming a maximum conductance of 1 nS at the spine and an input resistance of 200 MΩ at the soma (counterintuitively, this is at a level comparable with that of dendritic terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b027">27</xref>]), and considering the relatively low electrical resistance of the spine neck and the short electrical length of the dendrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b024">24</xref>], a rough calculation shows that full activation of the AMPARs at a single spine can elevate the somatic potential by 10 mV. Thus, bursts of activity in several PFs only are probably sufficient to generate action potentials in a PC, increasing its SS rate.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Proposal for an Animal Experiment</title><p>We propose an animal experiment to test our novel hypothesis that [NO] represents contextual relevance and enables context-dependent selection of internal models to be learned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Retrieval of a memory has been shown to make the memory labile in paradigms such as contextual fear conditioning and eyelid conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b066">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b068">68</xref>]. In other words, after retrieval, a new round of protein synthesis is necessary to preserve the memory in the future. In our proposed experiment, we take advantage of this retrieval-triggered transition of memory from a stable state to a labile state. First, animals are trained to perform a task in a particular context, Context A (wallpaper, odor, etc.), until their performance of the task reaches a plateau (training session). The task could be, for example, wheel running. The animals are then divided into four groups. Group 1 animals are subjected to the task again in Context A after injection of a protein synthesis inhibitor (retrieval session); Group 2 animals also perform the task after administration of the drug, but in a distinct context, Context B, instead of Context A. Their performance of the task in Context A is evaluated later (evaluation session). Considering a context-dependent modular organization of internal models in the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b004">4</xref>], it is expected in the evaluation session that Group 1 animals would show poor performance because the internal models for the task have been activated by the retrieval and prevented from reconsolidation by the protein synthesis inhibitor.</p><p>In contrast, Group 2 animals would show better performance because the internal models previously acquired in Context A are not fully activated during the retrieval in Context B and remain stable. This experiment will advance our understanding of cerebellar learning by pharmacologically proving context-dependent activation of internal models, which has been demonstrated only indirectly by functional imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b004">4</xref>]. Our proposal for the experiment goes beyond that. In the retrieval session, Group 3 animals are subjected to the task in Context A after an NOS inhibitor or an NO scavenger is administered together with the protein synthesis inhibitor; Group 4 animals are subjected to the task in Context B after injection of a NO donor and the protein synthesis inhibitor. The expected performance of the task in the evaluation session would be as follows: Group 3 animals would be expected to perform better than Group 1 animals, because in the retrieval session the memory of the task in Context A would remain stable due to the shortness of NO. Group 4 animals would show poorer performance than Group 2 animals, because exogenous NO would perturb the context-dependent regulation of plasticity and make labile even those synapses to which Context B is not relevant.</p><p>In summary, this simulation study reveals that AMPAR phosphorylation at a synapse depends on [NO] determined by nearby PF activity, and this might form the foundation of context-dependent learning in the cerebellum. We predict that any movement in any context is coded by a small number of PFs, because otherwise input specificity would be lost. Lastly, we have proposed an animal experiment to critically test our hypothesis that NO represents the relevance of a given context and enables context-dependent selection of internal models to be updated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Modeling a PC dendrite.</title><p>Our model is basically a PC dendrite represented as a passive electrical cable with spine compartments attached to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

The peak conductance of the currents equals the value obtained from a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b027">27</xref>]. Spines contained the P-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and the BK Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel described in Hodgkin–Huxley type equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b024">24</xref>]. The other ion channels in De Schutter's model were omitted because they are relatively rare in the distal dendrite, whose PF–PC synapses were of interest to us. As the P-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel is localized at the spine head and rarely occurs in the dendritic shaft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b069">69</xref>], we concluded that our model, a passive cable with spines containing ion channels, was a fairly accurate model of the PC dendrite. The potassium and calcium currents followed Ohm's law and the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz current equation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b070">70</xref>]. The maximum membrane permeability (p<sub>max</sub>) of the P-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel to calcium was estimated to be 1.2 × 10<sup>−13</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/s per spine based on immunoelectron-microscopic studies that provided its unitary conductance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b072">72</xref>] and the number of the channels per spine in the PF–PC synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b069">69</xref>]. The increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> opened BK Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels as in De Schutter's model and repolarized the spine. Change in the electrical potential of spines was free to propagate through the dendrite and affect the potential of neighboring spines. The spines were also equipped with calcium buffers and pumps. Doi's model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b025">25</xref>] provides their kinetics and parameter values. The model has shown that IP<sub>3</sub>Rs detect the coincidence of PF and CF inputs and release a large amount of calcium, and has predicted the maximum [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> to be several micromolars and its peak to occur about 200 ms after stimulation. These values are quantitatively consistent with the results of in vitro experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b036">36</xref>]. The IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) detects the coincidence of PF inputs and depolarization and activates a large release of calcium from the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b025">25</xref>]. For simplicity, our model postulates that during the 2 s after each stimulus, a fixed number (5.3 × 10<sup>4</sup>) of calcium ions flow from the ER into the coincidently stimulated spines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020179-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), instead of simulating the mGluR–IP<sub>3</sub>R pathway.

Although <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors are thought to be implicated in NOS activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b074">74</xref>], single stimuli to PFs can induce NO synthesis and PF–PC LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b042">42</xref>] for unknown reasons, as we assumed here. The distance between the presynaptic site of NO synthesis and its opposing spine was 1 μm in the model.
				</p><p>We estimated the unknown parameter, k<sub>f</sub>[NOS]<sub>total</sub>, in the following way: LTD has been reported to spread to neighboring PF–PC synapses when dozens of PFs are stimulated in synchrony with somatic depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b041">41</xref>], and the spread is NO-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b042">42</xref>]. According to another experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b075">75</xref>], uncaged NO paired with somatic depolarization induces LTD, indicating that an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> at submicromolar levels is sufficient for cerebellar LTD, if [NO] is high enough. Under the constraints of these findings, we chose to use k<sub>f</sub>[NOS]<sub>total</sub> of 20 μM/s, at which [P-AMPAR]<sub>50%,19min</sub> of AMPARs were phosphorylated at 19 min in synapses that were not directly stimulated by stimulation of 19 synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Important results of our simulation—that AMPAR phosphorylation in the intermediate phase was not induced by stimulation of a single PF but of multiple PFs, and that input-specific LTD was actually possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>)—were robust with respect to the k<sub>f</sub>[NOS]<sub>total</sub> value (≤80 μM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020179-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), as indicated by the distance between N<sub>50%</sub> for stimulated synapse (solid line) and that for its neighboring synapse (dotted line). At larger k<sub>f</sub>[NOS]<sub>total</sub> values (≥120 μM), where the two curves almost converged, homosynaptic LTD was induced by stimuli to a single PF, but at the same time heterosynaptic LTD was also about to occur, and input specificity was almost ruined.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Intracellular signaling cascades.</title><p>The signaling cascade in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) is based on Kuroda's model and uses the same parameter values that are listed in their paper and its supplementary information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b026">26</xref>]. Kuroda's model demonstrates that PKC is activated by a linear pathway and by a positive feedback loop in the presence of NO. These signaling cascades are reviewed elsewhere in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b076">76</xref>]. Briefly, NO diffusing from presynaptic terminals activates soluble guanylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate to cGMP. cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase, which phosphorylates the G substrate, and the phosphorylated G substrate eventually inhibits protein phosphatase 2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b077">77</xref>], which then dephosphorylates MAP/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) and AMPARs. Calcium ions, either released from the ER or flowing in through the VGCC, activate cPLA2, resulting in the production of arachidonic acid and subsequent activation of PKC. In addition to arachidonic acid, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and diacylglycerol also activate PKC. PKC activates the MAPK cascade, which consists of Raf, MEK, MAPK, and the MAPK phosphorylate cPLA2, forming a positive feedback loop.</p><p>However, we had to make several alterations to Kuroda's model because it was inconsistent with other parts of our model and previous findings in terms of calcium concentration. More specifically, (1) Kuroda's model assumes the basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> to be 0 μM, whereas in reality it is about 0.05 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b036">36</xref>], a value that is assumed in Doi's model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b025">25</xref>]. This disagreement prevented the direct import of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> predicted in the dendritic part of our model. (2) Kuroda's model also assumes the peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> of conjunctively stimulated synapses to be 0.55 μM, which is much smaller than the value estimated in Doi's model and in an experimental study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b036">36</xref>].</p><p>Some modification was necessary to overcome these problems. Specifically, the dissociation constants of cPLA2 and PKC for calcium were reduced 100-fold, and the catalytic constants for the calcium-bound forms of these enzymes were reduced 11-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> was imported to the signaling cascade part of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) from other parts that computed calcium influx, release, buffering, and pumping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g001">1</xref>B) as (1) 0 μM when the predicted [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> value was less than 0.05 μM, and as (2) the predicted [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub> value minus 0.05 μM, when the predicted value was 0.05 μM or greater.</p><p>The Lyn pathway and the CHRH pathway, which play only minor roles in Kuroda's model, were omitted in our model.</p><p>Despite these alterations, the behavior of our model was very similar to that of Kuroda's model, such as the time courses of activation of kinases and phosphorylation of the receptors. Stimulation of a few synapses (11, 20, or 29) led to activation of MAPK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020179-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A) and PKC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020179-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B), and to phosphorylation of AMPARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">4</xref>B) during the intermediate phase; the time courses for these events were quantitatively similar to those in Kuroda's model. In addition, phosphorylation of AMPARs followed the all-or-none principle in our simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref>), as in Kuroda's model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020179-g004">Figure 4</xref> of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b026">26</xref>]).

AMPAR phosphorylation after stimulation of 11, 20, and 29 synapses clearly demonstrated the all-or-none principle according to the duration of stimulation, and the optimal duration of stimulation that induced stable phosphorylation of AMPARs in the intermediate phase was comparable to that predicted by Kuroda's model.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Stimulation conditions.</title><p>The neighboring synapses to be stimulated were chosen so that they roughly followed a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 5 μm to mimic stimuli applied with a thin electrode (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020179-st001">Table S1</xref>). The synapse of interest (9 μm from the tip of the dendrite) was at the center of the Gaussian distribution. The soma, which was actually the proximal end of the dendrite, was depolarized from −70 mV to 0 mV for 100 ms in synchrony with the synaptic stimuli. Thus, all synapses on the dendrite were either conjunctively stimulated (comprising PF–PC stimulation and depolarization of the soma), or only depolarized without direct application of stimuli to the synapses.</p><p>In this study, single stimulation of PF–PC synapses was used instead of PF bursts. Actually, single stimulation of PFs in vitro can be regarded as an analog for their bursts in vivo (Discussion), and it is the bursts that convey information in the cerebellum. Accumulating evidence suggests that spontaneous activity of MFs and GCs is irrelevant in terms of cerebellar computation, and that information in the MF–GC–PC pathway is transmitted in the form of bursts. Spontaneous MF inputs in anesthetized rats do not evoke action potentials in GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b055">55</xref>]. GCs also fire spontaneously at 0.5 Hz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b055">55</xref>], and hundreds of thousands of them project onto each PC via PFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b005">5</xref>]. Thus, a PC is estimated to receive several dozens of thousands of PF inputs per second in the resting state. Microinjection of an AMPAR antagonist, however, has no effect on the spontaneous firing rate in the majority of PCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b064">64</xref>], implying that spontaneous firing of MFs and GCs does not contribute to generation of SSs in PCs, and that PCs intrinsically generate spontaneous spiking activity in vivo as well as in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b078">78</xref>]. Furthermore, spontaneous activity in GCs is also likely to have only a negligible effect on the production of NO in PFs, because it requires repetitive firing at a high frequency, such as dozens of pulses at 20 Hz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b018">18</xref>]. By contrast, sensory stimulation produces bursts of MF excitatory postsynaptic currents, which then successfully trigger bursts of spikes in GCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b055">55</xref>]. A burst of activity in the GC layer is associated with SSs in the PCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b079">79</xref>]. Thus, it is highly likely that sensory information is transmitted from MFs to GCs and PCs in the form of bursts, and that their spontaneous activity is filtered out at MF–GC and PF–PC synapses. Paired-pulse facilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020179-b057">57</xref>] might explain the strong preference of PCs for PF bursts. The evidence mentioned above suggests that only bursts can produce NO and transmit information over synapses in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Robustness of the model.</title><p>Although most parameters were available from experimental studies and existing simulation models [23–28,65,67,69,71,72], we still had to estimate some of them.

This is at least partly because we assumed a fixed number of calcium ions to be released from the ER upon stimulation, instead of actually simulating the mGluR and IP3 pathway. If our model had simulated the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor pathway as theirs did, p<sub>max</sub> values smaller than the estimated value would have led to the following consequences: depolarization would have introduced a smaller amount of calcium into the spine through the P-type calcium channels; IP<sub>3</sub> receptors would have been less activated; fewer calcium ions would have been mobilized into the cytoplasm; and PKC and the MAPK-mediated positive feedback loop would have been activated to a lesser degree, leaving more AMPARs unphosphorylated in neighboring synapses, and making the N50% ratio smaller than the estimate in our model. On the other hand, p<sub>max</sub> values greater than the estimated value yielded smaller N50% ratios because depolarization of the soma brought a sufficient amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the spine through P-type calcium channels to activate the MAPK-mediated positive feedback loop.</p><p>(C) g<sub>max</sub> of the BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channel. The ratio was very robust to change in the g<sub>max</sub> value when it was varied between 1/10-fold and 10-fold of the original value, 80 mS/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>(D) Amount of calcium released by the ER. This parameter was varied between 1/4-fold and 4-fold of the estimate (5.3 × 10<sup>4</sup> ions). The N<sub>50%</sub> ratio was very robust against changes in this parameter.</p><p>(305 KB EPS)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0020179-st001" mimetype="application/msexcel" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020179.st001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Synapses To Be Stimulated</title><p>(28 KB XLS)</p></caption></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Tetsuo Yamamori of the National Institute for Basic Biology for his valuable comments.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AMPAR</term><def><p>alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>spine</sub></term><def><p>concentration of calcium in the spine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>cGMP</term><def><p>cyclic guanosine monophosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>cPLA2</term><def><p>cytosolic phospholipase A2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ER</term><def><p>endoplasmic reticulum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GC</term><def><p>granule cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IP3</term><def><p>inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IP3R</term><def><p>inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LTD</term><def><p>long-term depression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAPK</term><def><p>mitogen-activated protein kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MEK</term><def><p>MAP/extracellular signal-regulated kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MF</term><def><p>mossy fiber</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mGluR</term><def><p>metabotropic glutamate receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>N</term><def><p>number of stimulated synapses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NO</term><def><p>nitric oxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>[NO]</term><def><p>concentration of nitric oxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NOS</term><def><p>nitric oxide synthase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>[P-AMPAR]</term><def><p>concentration of phosphorylated AMPARs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PC</term><def><p>Purkinje cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PF</term><def><p>parallel fiber</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PKC</term><def><p>protein kinase C</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF</term><def><p>sloping factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SS</term><def><p>simple spike</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VGCC</term><def><p>voltage-gated calcium channel</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pcbi-0020179-b001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" xlink:type="simple">
