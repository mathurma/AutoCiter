<abstract>
<p>Synthetic biology aims to design <italic>de novo</italic> biological systems and reengineer existing ones. These efforts have mostly focused on transcriptional circuits, with reengineering of signaling circuits hampered by limited understanding of their systems dynamics and experimental challenges. Bacterial two-component signaling systems offer a rich diversity of sensory systems that are built around a core phosphotransfer reaction between histidine kinases and their output response regulator proteins, and thus are a good target for reengineering through synthetic biology. Here, we explore the signal-response relationship arising from a specific motif found in two-component signaling. In this motif, a single histidine kinase (HK) phosphotransfers reversibly to two separate output response regulator (RR) proteins. We show that, under the experimentally observed parameters from bacteria and yeast, this motif not only allows rapid signal termination, whereby one of the RRs acts as a phosphate sink towards the other RR (i.e. the output RR), but also implements a sigmoidal signal-response relationship. We identify two mathematical conditions on system parameters that are necessary for sigmoidal signal-response relationships and define key parameters that control threshold levels and sensitivity of the signal-response curve. We confirm these findings experimentally, by <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of the one HK-two RR motif found in the <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> chemotaxis pathway and measuring the resulting signal-response curve. We find that the level of sigmoidality in this system can be experimentally controlled by the presence of the sink RR, and also through an auxiliary protein that is shown to bind to the HK (yielding Hill coefficients of above 7). These findings show that the one HK-two RR motif allows bacteria and yeast to implement tunable switch-like signal processing and provides an ideal basis for developing threshold devices for synthetic biology applications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells process external cues in order to produce appropriate responses that ensure survival and efficient proliferation. They achieve this goal through a myriad of signaling and gene regulatory networks, which implement specific signal processing capabilities such as switch-like threshold dynamics, logic gates, oscillations, and noise filtering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Buchler1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Chickarmane1">[8]</xref>. Understanding the architecture and response dynamics of these systems is of fundamental value, providing us with a better insight into cell biology and allowing us to engineer <italic>de novo</italic> biological systems. The field of synthetic biology exploits the understanding and components from natural systems to rationally design synthetic systems that implement specific signaling dynamics. So far, this led to the development of oscillatory systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Elowitz1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Koseska1">[10]</xref>, systems with threshold dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Buchler1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Hsu1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Khalil1">[12]</xref> and logic gates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Gardner1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Friedland1">[15]</xref>. In most cases, these studies use transcriptional regulation to implement the desired dynamics, while a few studies have explored the possibility of extending synthetic design approaches to signaling networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Wang1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Peisajovich1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>Bacterial systems are particularly attractive for attempting synthetic engineering of signaling networks. Most bacteria and certain eukaryotic microbes and plants utilize the so-called two-component signaling systems for signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Wuichet1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Stock1">[21]</xref>. In their most simple implementation, these systems consist of a histidine protein kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR). The activity of the HK is controlled in most cases by an environmental stimulus, which controls the rate of autophosphorylation. Once phosphorylated, the HK transfers its phosphoryl group to a cognate RR, which in its phosphorylated form mediates the output of the signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Stock1">[21]</xref>. The phosphotransfer reaction is at the core of all two-component systems, and regulating its specificity could allow direct control over microbial (and to some extent plant) physiology, as well as creating synthetic signaling systems. Thus, several studies have attempted to decipher the coupling specificity of HK and RR proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Casino1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Weigt1">[26]</xref> and have generated chimeric HKs with specified and controllable inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Ninfa1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Mglich1">[31]</xref>. More recently, artificial molecular scaffolds have been used to increase the local concentrations of HK and RR proteins, allowing significant control over the phosphotransfer rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Whitaker1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Generating synthetic systems with specified signal processing capabilities, however, requires a deeper understanding of system properties such as the signal-response relationship they embed. Around the core HK-RR interaction, different two-component systems have diverse architectures, which could underpin specific signal processing capabilities. For example, the commonly observed phosphorelays, where the flow of phosphoryl groups from the HK to the RR is relayed through several proteins, are believed to allow signal integration and specific response properties such as control of noise and ultrasensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Bischofs1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Arnaud1">[36]</xref>. Other architectural features such as presence of a bifunctional or a split HK, formation of specific “dead-end” complexes and also transcriptional feedbacks have been shown to allow ultrasensitivity and even bistability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Amin1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Tiwari1">[39]</xref>. Of such different architectural features, one that has not attracted much attention is the “sink” system, where two RRs can compete for the phosphoryl group from a single HK. This architectural motif has been identified in several microbial and plant systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Sourjik1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Lohrmann1">[44]</xref>. In the <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> chemotaxis pathway, the two response regulators CheY1 and CheY2 are phosphorylated by their cognate kinase CheA. Of these, only CheY2 in its phosphorylated form can bind to the flagellar motor and control its rotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Sourjik1">[40]</xref>. Both CheYs can also perform reverse phosphotransfer, where they return the phosphoryl group to CheA. Given its high phosphorylation rate (from HK), low reverse phosphorylation rate (to HK), and the observation that the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> chemotaxis system lacks a dedicated phosphatase, it is proposed that CheY1 acts as a sink that accelerates dephosphorylation of CheY2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Sourjik1">[40]</xref>. A similar situation is described in the <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> chemotaxis pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Tindall1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-JimnezPearson1">[42]</xref> and the yeast osmoregulation pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Posas1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Fabiola1">[45]</xref>. In the latter case, the HK, SLN1 autophosphorylates in response to changes in the membrane structure and phosphorylates two downstream RRs, SSK1 and SKN7. <italic>In vitro</italic> phosphotransfer studies found similar dynamics as in the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> chemotaxis pathway with SKN7 displaying significant reverse phosphotransfer to SLN1, while SSK1 showing no such activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Fabiola1">[45]</xref>. Interestingly, both SSK1 and SKN7 are functionally active in this system, with SSK1 activating the downstream HOG1 MAP kinase cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Posas2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Horie1">[47]</xref> and SKN7 acting as a transcription factor for genes involved in various stress related responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Brown1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Krems1">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we use mathematical and experimental approaches to identify the full signal processing capabilities of this two-component system. We first develop a generic model of the one HK – two RR motif and perform both analytical and simulation-based analyses. These reveal that this system is capable of both enhancing signal termination time and implementing a threshold signal-response relationship, i.e. the system displays a sigmoidal signal-response relationship in which the steady state levels of the phosphorylated output RR remains low until a threshold level of signal is crossed. We then verify these dynamics experimentally by <italic>in vitro</italic> re-constitution of the two-component proteins from the chemotaxis pathway of <italic>S. meliloti</italic>. Using this <italic>in vitro</italic> setup, we further show that specific properties of the threshold dynamics can be controlled through the concentrations of the core components, as well as through presence of an auxiliary protein that is known to bind the HK in <italic>S. meliloti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Dogra1">[50]</xref>. These findings allow better understanding of the physiological responses mediated by phosphate sink-containing two-component systems in microbes and plants, and will facilitate design of synthetic threshold devices using two-component signalling proteins.</p>

<title>Analysis of response dynamics in the one HK – two RR motif</title>
<p>While the implementation of the phosphate sink motif in diverse two-component systems could differ in the molecular details of the proteins involved and their exact kinetic rates, the sink mechanisms can be formulated as a general architectural motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s001">S1A</xref>); a two-component system comprising a single HK and two RRs, namely the output-RR and the sink-RR (as referred to, in the rest of the text). We have developed a generic model of this motif and parameterized it using experimental measurements from the reaction kinetics of the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> chemotaxis and yeast osmoregulation systems (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). To monitor temporal dynamics in the presence of a signal, we simulated two conditions, one with the sink-RR and one without the sink-RR. Using the “controlled comparison” approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Alves1">[51]</xref>, we simulated each scenario at a signal level that resulted in 90% phosphorylation of the output-RR at steady state. The signal was then removed and the half-time for the decay of phosphorylated output-RR measured. We found that under the experimentally measured parameters, the presence of the sink-RR decreases the half-time for the output-RR dephosphorylation by more than 2-fold in both <italic>S. meliloti</italic> and yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s001">S1B</xref>). These simulation results are consistent with previous experimental results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Sourjik1">[40]</xref>, which led to the sink hypothesis, and show that in the experimentally observed parameter regime, a sink-RR can accelerate the dephosphorylation of the output-RR.</p>

<title>The one HK – two RR motif can exhibit a sigmoidal signal-response relationship</title>
<p>Besides temporal dynamics, another key characteristic of any signaling system is the signal-response relationship that it implements, i.e. the steady state output of the system for any given signal level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Tyson4">[52]</xref>. Focusing again on experimentally measured parameters, we found that the presence of the sink-RR changes the signal-response relationship in the system from hyperbolic to sigmoidal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s001">S1C</xref>). In other words, the presence of the sink-RR allows threshold dynamics in these natural systems, whereby the steady state level of the phosphorylated output-RR remains low until a threshold signal level is reached, at which point the capacity of the sink-RR is filled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Once the sink RR is filled, the steady state level of phosphorylated output-RR is highly sensitive to small changes in signal.</p>
<p>To better understand whether the sensitivity and threshold levels in the sigmoidal signal-response curve can be controlled, and by which parameters, we performed a sensitivity analysis around experimentally measured kinetic rates from <italic>S. meliloti</italic> and yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s002">S2</xref>). This revealed several kinetic features for ensuring a sigmoidal signal-response relationship (see below for exact necessary conditions). For example, we found that a key kinetic feature is for phosphotransfer to the sink-RR (parameter <italic>k<sub>S</sub></italic>) to be faster than reverse phosphotransfer from the sink-RR back to the HK (parameter <italic>k<sub>rS</sub></italic>). Under this condition, the steady state phosphorylation level of output-RR remains low until the sink-RR is almost fully phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s003">Figure S3</xref>), resulting in a high level of sigmoidality in the signal-response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s002">S2A</xref>). We also found that both the sharpness of the sigmoidal signal-response relationship and the threshold signal level can be controlled through changes in parameters and the ratio of the concentration of HK to the two RRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s004">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s005">S5</xref>). In particular, the phosphotransfer rate constant between the HK and sink-RR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s002">S2A</xref>), and the autodephosphorylation rate constant of the sink-RR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s004">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s002">S2</xref>) can affect the sharpness of the signal-response curve, while the threshold signal level is determined by the amount of sink present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s002">S2B</xref>). The effect of the autodephosphorylation rate of the sink-RR can be intuitively understood as increasing this rate directly increases the level of signal required to “fill” the sink-RR. The effect of the forward phosphotransfer rate (between the HK and sink-RR) can be understood when considering the dynamics of the system. When the phosphotransfer from the HK to the two RRs occurs at comparable rates, the increase in the phosphorylation of both RRs occurs in linear fashion. In other words, any increase in the signal levels trickles down the system to affect both RRs. However, what is required from an ultrasensitive signal-response relationship is that one of the RRs remains largely unaffected by increasing signals until a threshold signal is reached. To create such dynamics, having a higher phosphotransfer rate to the other RR is essential, such that any small increases in signal predominantly result in alterations of only this RR.</p>

<title>Necessary conditions for the one HK – two RR motif to exhibit sigmoidal signal-response relationships</title>
<p>To understand more completely the effects of parameters on the signal-response curve, we derived an analytical description for this curve and computed its second derivative when the signal level is zero (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s008">Text S1</xref>). The second derivative at zero can be used as an indicator of sigmoidal or hyperbolic nature of the signal-response relationship; a hyperbolic shape of the signal-response curve implies that the second derivative of this function is constantly negative on its domain (i.e. positive signals), while a sigmoidal shape implies that the second derivative is initially positive and then it changes sign. Thus, the sign of the second derivative of the signal-response curve at zero can be taken as a test for sigmoidality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Kothamachu1">[53]</xref>. Using this approach we found two necessary conditions on the parameters of the system for achieving a sigmoidal signal-response relationship (i.e. conditions that are required for a positive second derivative at zero): (<italic>i</italic>) <italic>k<sub>S</sub>·k<sub>hS</sub>·[RR1]<sub>tot</sub></italic>≠0 <italic>and (ii) k<sub>S</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>k<sub>rS</sub></italic>, where <italic>k<sub>hS</sub></italic> is the autodephosphorylation rate constant of the sink-RR, <italic>[RR1]<sub>tot</sub></italic> is the total amount of sink-RR, and <italic>k<sub>S</sub></italic> (<italic>k<sub>M</sub></italic>) and <italic>k<sub>rS</sub></italic> (<italic>k<sub>rM</sub></italic>) are the forward and reverse phosphotransfer rate constants of the sink-RR (output-RR) respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s008">Text S1</xref>). The first condition shows that the sink-RR is necessary for the system to exhibit sigmoidality. Provided these two conditions are satisfied and, additionally <italic>k<sub>rS</sub>/k<sub>S</sub>&lt;k<sub>rM</sub>/(k<sub>M</sub>+k<sub>rM</sub>)</italic>, having high concentrations of the HK and the sink-RR (i.e. the RR with no/weak reverse phosphotransfer to the HK), and low concentration of the output-RR further ensures sigmoidality. It is important to note that experimentally measured values from both the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> chemotaxis and yeast osmoregulation systems fit with these analytical conditions for sigmoidality (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003890-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s007">S1</xref>). We found that these analytical results on the necessary conditions for the sigmoidality of the signal-response relationship are further simplified when assuming complex formation in the phosphotransfer reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s008">Text S1</xref>). In particular, the second condition (i.e. of having <italic>k<sub>S</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>rS</sub></italic>&gt;1) is not a strict requirement for the second derivative of the signal-response curve at zero to attain a positive value. In this extended model, the second necessary condition becomes either <italic>k<sub>S</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>rS</sub></italic>&gt;1 or <italic>k<sub>S</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>rS</sub>&gt;(k<sub>yM</sub>-k<sub>yS</sub>)/k<sub>yrS</sub></italic>, where <italic>k<sub>yM</sub>, k<sub>yS</sub>, k<sub>yrS</sub></italic> are the inverse of the Michaelis-Menten constants of the added complexes in the forward phosphotransfer reactions of the sink-RR and output-RR, and the reverse phosphotransfer reaction of the sink-RR, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s008">Text S1</xref>). We conclude that for sigmoidality to arise, the quotient <italic>k<sub>S</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>rS</sub></italic> must be larger than a specific value, which depends on the parameters of the system and, further, sigmoidality cannot arise simply by the introduction of complex forming reactions in a system without a sink-RR.</p>

<p>The finding that achieving a sigmoidal signal-response relationship for the single HK- two RR system is facilitated by the presence of complexes, prompted us to use the chemical reaction network toolbox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Hazelbauer1">[54]</xref> to analytically assess the potential of bistability. We found that when the phosphotransfer reactions are modelled as bi-molecular reactions, the system is not capable of bistability (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s009">Text S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s009">S2</xref>). However, when considering complex formation and alternative reaction schemes involving the different possible binding events among the HK, the two RRs and their complexes, we found that a certain scenario allows for the presence of bistability in the system (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s009">Text S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s010">S3</xref>). In this scenario, the HK can bind to both of the RRs, irrespective of its own phosphorylation state and the phosphorylation states of the two RRs. The resulting system contains four complexes between the phosphorylated/unphosphorylated HK and the phosphorylated/unphosphorylated RRs, and can permit bistability under certain parameter regimes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s009">Text S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s010">S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Experimental verification of the sigmoidal signal-response relationship in a one HK – two RR motif</title>
<p>To test the model findings experimentally, we re-constituted <italic>in vitro</italic> the CheA, CheY1 (sink-RR) and CheY2 (output-RR) proteins from <italic>S. meliloti</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, CheA kinase activity is controlled by interaction with the signaling domain of chemoreceptor proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Shinar1">[55]</xref>. Since it is experimentally difficult to re-constitute chemoreceptors in the <italic>in vitro</italic> system, we varied the kinase activity of CheA by varying the concentration of its substrate, ATP, as a proxy for the <italic>in vivo</italic> signal. This allowed us to monitor the steady state levels of phosphorylated CheY1 and CheY2 at different levels of kinase activity, i.e. to derive an experimental signal-response curve. We found excellent quantitative agreement between the signal-response curves resulting from the model and experiments. In the presence (absence) of CheY1, the steady state levels of phosphorylated CheY2 displayed a sigmoidal (hyperbolic) relation with increasing ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>CheS sharpens the signal-response curve</title>
<p>In the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> system, the behavior of the sink-RR (CheY1) was found to be altered by a small auxiliary protein, CheS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Dogra1">[50]</xref>. In particular, it was shown that CheY1 binds 100-fold more strongly to the CheA∶CheS complex than to CheA alone and that the decay of phosphorylated CheA (CheA-P) in the presence of CheY1 is faster with CheS than without. This suggests that CheS might directly or indirectly promote CheY1 dephosphorylation and thus make the sink-RR more efficient in allowing signal termination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Dogra1">[50]</xref>. Analysis of the analytical solution of our model suggests that another way of increasing the efficiency of the sink is to increase the rate at which phosphoryl groups are transferred from CheA to the sink CheY (i.e. by increasing <italic>k<sub>s</sub></italic>). Moreover, since CheA∶CheS binds CheY1 100-fold more strongly than CheA alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Dogra1">[50]</xref>, it is conceivable that CheS, in addition to its effects on CheY1-P dephosphorylation, could also accelerate phosphotransfer from CheA-P to CheY1. This would further enhance the possibility of the analytical conditions for sigmoidality to be fulfilled (see above).</p>
<p>Towards obtaining a better understanding of the role of CheS in the system and quantifying its potential effects on the signal-response curve, we first re-constituted CheS in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay along with CheA, CheY1 and CheY2. Running phosphotransfer experiments in the presence or absence of CheS, we found that the presence of CheS in the system resulted in the sharpening of the signal-response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g004">Figure 4</xref>), with the Hill coefficient increasing from 3.43, in the absence of CheS, to 7.61, in the presence of CheS. This increase in the Hill coefficient is in line with the observed capacity of two-component systems to display high levels of ultrasensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Arnaud1">[36]</xref> and potentially bistability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Amin1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Tiwari1">[39]</xref>. In an attempt to recapitulate these experimental findings in our mathematical model, we optimised two parameters: the rate of CheY1-P dephosphorylation (<italic>k<sub>hs</sub></italic>) and/or the rate of phosphotransfer between CheA and CheY1 (<italic>k<sub>s</sub></italic>). We found that the experimentally observed sharpening of the signal-response curve by CheS can be best recapitulated by increasing both <italic>k<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>hs</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g004">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that CheS may increase both the rate at which CheA-P donates phosphoryl groups to the sink CheY and the rate at which the sink CheY dephosphorylates. These results suggest that the function of CheS is to sharpen the threshold of the sigmoidal signal-response curve given by the system comprising CheA, CheY1 and CheY2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have analyzed the system dynamics of an architectural motif found in bacterial two-component signalling pathways where a single HK can reversibly phosphorylate two RRs. We have shown that this one HK-two RR motif can accelerate signal termination, i.e. act as a sink, as hypothesized before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Sourjik1">[40]</xref>, but more interestingly, allows the system to exhibit a sigmoidal signal-response relationship. This high level of sigmoidality and corresponding high Hill coefficients can be explained by the effect of the sink-RR on the response dynamics. Due to differing phosphotransfer kinetics, as signal levels increase from zero and kinase activity increases, phosphoryl groups are preferentially given to sink-RR rather than the output-RR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This continues until the sink-RR becomes saturated with phosphoryl groups i.e. is completely phosphorylated. At this threshold point, phosphorylation levels of the output-RR rise dramatically with increasing signal, giving the observed sigmoidal response. We have shown that such threshold behavior is observed under experimentally measured parameters from the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> chemotaxis and yeast osmoregulation pathways. Further, theoretical analyses showed that the presence of a sigmoidal signal-response relationship necessitates two conditions on the system; (<italic>i</italic>) the sink-RR to be present and (<italic>ii</italic>) <italic>k<sub>S</sub></italic>&gt;<italic>k<sub>rS</sub></italic>, where <italic>k<sub>S</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>rS</sub></italic> are the forward and reverse phosphotransfer rate constants of the sink-RR respectively. Factors that promote operation of the sink e.g. increasing the kinetic preference of the kinase for the sink-RR over the output-RR, and/or increasing the rate at which the sink can autodephosphorylate all increase this sigmoidality by sharpening the transition at the threshold point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We verified these findings experimentally, showing that the auxiliary protein, CheS in the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> chemotaxis pathway, can modulate levels of sigmoidality (resulting in Hill coefficients of 7.6) by sharpening the response threshold.</p>
<p>These findings have important implications for understanding bacterial physiology and designing synthetic signaling circuits. In broad terms, the findings of this study will have implications for any two-component signaling circuit where multiple response regulators compete for phosphorylation by a single phosphodonor. This includes the cases where the HK acts as the phosphodonor, as well as the cases where this function is performed by an Hpt domain or protein. These include the majority of bacterial chemotaxis systems (which employ CheY and CheB as response regulators) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Sourjik1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-JimnezPearson1">[42]</xref>, fungal osmoregulatory circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Posas1">[43]</xref> and certain plant signaling systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Lohrmann1">[44]</xref>. Additional examples include the <italic>E. coli</italic> kinases NarX and NarQ that can both phosphorylate the response regulators, NarL and NarP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Noriega1">[56]</xref>. Similarly, in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, the kinases DivJ and PleC can each phosphorylate the two response regulators, DivK and PleD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Paul1">[57]</xref>. The present study indicates that these systems might be acting as a threshold device, whereby cells commit to a specific outcome only above certain signal thresholds. Alternatively, the threshold behavior could be used for regulating the noise characteristics of the system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Knudsen1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Shibata1">[58]</xref>. It is important to note however, that the one HK – two RR architectural motif is <italic>able</italic> to display sigmoidal signal-response relationships, but does not preclude hyperbolic relationships. In other words, this motif cannot be taken as proof for threshold behavior but should be taken as indicative and be considered in experimental design when analyzing the response dynamics in associated signaling systems.</p>
<p>Synthetic biology has so far concentrated on designing small circuits based on transcriptional regulation. While two-component systems have been recognized as potential candidates for synthetic design, the main efforts have concentrated on engineering chimeric proteins and interaction specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Friedland1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Whitaker1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Ninfa1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Mglich1">[31]</xref>. Our findings show that a system dynamics perspective can allow understanding of the signal processing capabilities of natural bacterial signaling pathways and new avenues for reengineering these. Exploiting the single HK - two RR system in the construction of synthetic signaling circuits will require coupling of an appropriate output (e.g. an RR that can act as a transcription factor) to a useful signal that can control HK activity. This could be accomplished through mutational alterations on the signal and output of an existing natural system (such as the one used here), using chimeric proteins, or by artificially engineering phosphate sinks into existing two-component systems.</p>
<p>Two-component proteins are highly modular, and evolution seems to have exploited this feature in creating diverse architectures in signaling. Studies such as those provided here should allow us to understand these functionalities and ultimately lead to their application in synthetic biology.</p>

<p>To analyze the behavior of the system with increasing signal, the incoming signals were simulated (e.g. chemoreceptors in case of the chemotaxis system or membrane alterations in the yeast system) as an increase in the autophosphorylation rate constant of the HK (<italic>k<sub>a</sub></italic>). The model was parameterized with data from literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003890-t001">Table 1</xref>). In the case of the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> chemotaxis system the parameters for phosphotransfer to CheY1 and CheY2 (<italic>k<sub>S</sub>, k<sub>rS</sub>, k<sub>M</sub> and k<sub>rM</sub></italic>) were derived through fitting the simulation data to previously published <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Sourjik1">[40]</xref>. Fitting was done using a hybrid genetic algorithm (functions ga and fmincon from the MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox).</p>

<title>Temporal simulations and signal-response curve</title>
<p>The model was numerically integrated to derive time course and steady state signal-response relationships. The latter analysis gives the steady state phosphorylated RR levels at a given signal (<italic>k<sub>a</sub></italic>), where signal was taken as the rate constant of HK autophosphorylation and allows deriving a so-called signal-response curve. This curve is found by numerically integrating the system to steady state at a fixed signal level and then numerically “following” this steady state, while changing the signal. This analysis is equivalent to allowing the system to reach steady state under different signal values. Both time course and signal-response analyses were performed using the software packages XPPAUT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html</ext-link>) and Oscill8 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://oscill8.sourceforge.net" xlink:type="simple">http://oscill8.sourceforge.net</ext-link>). An explicit description of the inverse of the signal-response curve was also obtained, using a recently developed recursive technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Knudsen1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Feliu1">[59]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s008">Text S1</xref>). The resulting analytical function for the signal-response curve was then used to verify the results of the numerical approach and to derive the necessary conditions that the parameters must fulfill for the signal-response curve to be sigmoidal. This analytical approach is also used to extend the analysis to the case with complex formation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s008">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Measuring “sigmoidality” of signal-response curves and sensitivity of this feature to parameters</title>
<p>To measure sigmoidality of the signal-response curve the Hill coefficient was used as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Zhang1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Goldbeter1">[61]</xref>. The Hill coefficient is measured as ln81/ln(S90/S10) where S90 and S10 are the signal levels for achieving 90 and 10 percent of output saturation, respectively. Using alternative measures, such as the maximum value of the response coefficient across the signal domain produces qualitatively similar results as those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003890-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s005">S5</xref>. To quantify the sensitivity of sigmoidality of the signal-response curve to variations in each of the parameters, these were varied from their described experimentally measured values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003890-t001">Table 1</xref>) and in a biologically relevant range. Each parameter was varied around its basic value up/down 10-fold and the Hill coefficient of the resulting signal-response curves measured as described above.</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>The CheA, CheY1, and CheY2 system was reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> to measure the signal-response curve in the presence/absence of CheY1. For this, phosphorylated CheY2 levels were measured under increasing ATP levels as a proxy for signal. The protein concentrations used for these experiments were 10 µM, 2.5 µM, 2.5 µM for CheA, CheY1 and CheY2 respectively. This gives a ratio of 4∶1∶1, which is different from the <italic>in vivo</italic> measured ratio of 1.5∶20∶20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003890-Sourjik1">[40]</xref>, but the higher HK concentration gave increased capacity to measure CheY1 and CheY2 phosphorylation levels at low levels of signal. We found that the system can display sigmoidality under a range of ratios of sink- and output-RRs to HK, including the experimentally measured ratio, but the level of sigmoidality is altered by this ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003890.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
