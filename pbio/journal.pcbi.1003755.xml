<abstract>
<p>The within-host evolution of influenza is a vital component of its epidemiology. A question of particular interest is the role that selection plays in shaping the viral population over the course of a single infection. We here describe a method to measure selection acting upon the influenza virus within an individual host, based upon time-resolved genome sequence data from an infection. Analysing sequence data from a transmission study conducted in pigs, describing part of the haemagglutinin gene (HA1) of an influenza virus, we find signatures of non-neutrality in six of a total of sixteen infections. We find evidence for both positive and negative selection acting upon specific alleles, while in three cases, the data suggest the presence of time-dependent selection. In one infection we observe what is potentially a specific immune response against the virus; a non-synonymous mutation in an epitope region of the virus is found to be under initially positive, then strongly negative selection. Crucially, given the lack of homologous recombination in influenza, our method accounts for linkage disequilibrium between nucleotides at different positions in the haemagglutinin gene, allowing for the analysis of populations in which multiple mutations are present at any given time. Our approach offers a new insight into the dynamics of influenza infection, providing a detailed characterisation of the forces that underlie viral evolution.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The evolution of the influenza virus is of great importance for human health. Through evolution, current influenza viruses develop the ability to infect people who have been vaccinated against earlier strains. New strains of influenza that infect birds and pigs could evolve to infect and spread between people, causing a global pandemic. The influenza virus lives within a human or animal host, so that viral evolution happens within, or in the spread between, individuals. As such, what happens to the virus during the course of an infection is a question of great interest. We here describe a statistical method that uses viral genome sequence data to measure how evolution affects the influenza virus within a single host. Studying data from infections transmitted between pigs, we find evidence for evolutionary adaptation in six of sixteen animals for which data were available. In one case, an immune response mounted by a pig against the virus is apparent. Our method provides a statistical framework for using sequence data to study viral evolution on very short timescales, enabling new research into within-host viral evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The overall risk to human health posed by the novel H7N9 influenza virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Gao1">[1]</xref>, while potentially severe, is as yet unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Lai1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Morens1">[3]</xref>. Pandemic influenza is a zoonosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Shortridge1">[4]</xref>, and as such any new pandemic may be expected to arise through a two-step process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Wolfe1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Morse1">[6]</xref>, the virus first gaining the ability to cause sporadic, localised infections in humans until, after a second transition, emerging into a global pandemic. Each of these steps are evolutionary in nature, being characterised in turn by the adaptation of a virus to be able to infect a human host, and the development of increased transmissibility between hosts. In the nH7N9 strain, the first of these steps has already taken place, including the acquisition of mutations responsible for human-specific receptor binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Liu1">[7]</xref>. Progression to a global epidemic, therefore, depends upon the evolution of increased transmissibility of the virus, a phenotypic change which can only occur while the virus grows in a host environment. As is true for other viral species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Pepin1">[8]</xref>, understanding the intra-host evolution of influenza is an important task.</p>
<p>A vast array of mathematical modelling approaches have been directed at the questions of influenza infection, transmission, and evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Murillo1">[9]</xref>. Of particular relevance to this study are models which track the dynamics of a single infection. Based upon observed changes in viral titre over time, inferences have been made of many important properties of infection, including the reproductive number for cellular infection, the timescale and numbers of viruses produced during the infection of a cell, and the impact upon the viral population of both innate and adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Baccam1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Luo1">[14]</xref>. Considering data of intracellular RNA levels, the fine detail of viral replication within a cell has been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Heldt1">[15]</xref>. Evolutionary models of competition between viral strains have clarified the relationship between selection for growth and transmission effects, and the dynamics of immune escape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Coombs1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Park1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the cases above, the viral population was either modelled as a population of identical individuals, or as a set of distinct classes of virus, characterised by differing immune escape or transmission properties. Building upon these approaches, a genetic classification of viruses was used to model H5N1 influenza evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Russell1">[19]</xref>; the fitness of a virus was defined according to the presence or absence of a set of mutations. Here we divide the viral population in a similar manner, expressing the fitness of a virus as a function of its genetic composition. However, rather than analysing the consequences of a proposed fitness landscape, we here infer how selection was actually at work based upon observed genetic sequence data.</p>
<p>In chronic infections such as HIV, time-resolved sequence data from individual hosts is readily available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Rhee1">[20]</xref>. However, the course of an influenza infection, even in an immunocompromised host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Ghedin1">[21]</xref>, is relatively short. As such, time-resolved genetic data is rare, the main examples having been collected from experimentally-infected animal populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Murcia1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Murcia2">[23]</xref>. In this work, we consider data from one such study, examining the evolution of H1N1 influenza within individuals in a swine population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Lloyd1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Murcia3">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>The basic principle of our method is to learn the role of selection acting upon a viral population by means of a maximum likelihood method. We adopt a coarse-grained quasispecies model (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Eigen1">[26]</xref>) to describe the evolution of the viral population, in which viruses are classified according to the nucleotides (here denoted alleles) present at a limited number of positions (or loci) in their genomic sequence. In this model, evolution proceeds deterministically, contingent only upon the initial state of the population, and the role of selection for or against specific alleles. By considering the consequences for the population dynamics of different proposed models of selection, and comparing these to the observed evolution of the system, we estimate how selection was at work.</p>
<p>The low rate of recombination within RNA segments of influenza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Boni1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Lam1">[28]</xref>, combined with a high viral mutation rate, leads to complex evolutionary dynamics, with the fate of mutations being strongly affected by genetic hitchhiking and clonal interference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Miralles1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Illingworth1">[31]</xref>. As such, discerning the effects of selection requires that interactions between alleles at different loci are taken into account <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Illingworth2">[32]</xref>. Here this is achieved by considering the frequencies of haplotypes, sets of sequences with specific alleles at specific loci (e.g. allele C at locus <italic>i</italic> and allele T at locus <italic>j</italic>).</p>
<p>In our model, the viral population can be described at potentially any genomic resolution, keeping track of the population in terms of haplotyes spanning arbitrary numbers of loci. However, higher-locus models are more computationally demanding. As such, we first apply a filtering process to cut out loci at which alleles do not show statistical evidence of having evolved under selection. For each polymorphic locus, we use a single-locus model of evolution to find alleles that appear to evolve in a non-neutral behaviour, changing in frequency over time. Change in the frequency of an allele may occur as the direct result of selection, or due to linkage disequilibrium with a selected allele, or alleles, at other loci. As such, to distinguish between these cases, wherever apparent non-neutrality is observed at more than one locus, we apply a multi-locus model of haplotype frequency change to the data. This model explicitly accounts for interactions between alleles at different loci, and is used to identify the maximum likelihood explanation for the changes observed in the sequence data.</p>
<p>As has been noted elsewhere, the use of viral sequence data to understand population structures requires substantial care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Depledge1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Skums1">[34]</xref>). Selective amplification of sequences, or general sequencing bias, can produce a misleading picture of a population as a whole. PCR-induced recombination can lead to false measurements of linkage disequilibrium between alleles at different loci. We discuss the potential impact of each of these factors upon our results.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Viral sequence data collected from a previous transmission experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Murcia3">[25]</xref> were analysed. An overview of the structure of this experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003755-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The chain of infection was propagated by a process of housing pairs of uninfected pigs with pairs of infected pigs, the previously-infected pigs being removed after transmission had occurred. Throughout the experiment, samples were collected from pigs using nasal swabs, with viral sequences being amplified via RT-PCR and Sanger sequenced. Viral sequences were collected from the majority of the pigs; for 16 of the 24 pigs involved in the experiment, data was collected at more than one time-point, an essential prerequisite for our method. For the samples collected in these animals the depth of sequencing varied from 6 to 81 sequences (mean 51) from a pig at a given time-point, with data being collected at up to five time-points across the course of an infection. Limited transmission of variants was observed between individual infections.</p>

<p>In our analysis, non-neutral behaviour was identified in six populations. In general, signs of selection were relatively rare. While very many individual mutations were observed in the population as a whole, most of the substantial changes in allele frequency occurred at a small number of sites (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003755-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As such, eighteen alleles in the dataset were identified as being potentially non-neutral. Interference effects between alleles were found to be of importance; of these eighteen alleles, a total of nine were identified as being genuinely under selection, changes in frequency at the other nine being explicable in terms of linkage disequilibrium with other selected alleles. In the populations identified to be non-neutral, a variety of forms of selection were found, including evidence for time-dependent selection, and for selection acting simultaneously at more than one locus (a selection of inferred trajectories are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003755-g003">Figure 3</xref>; further inferences are presented in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003755.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Our multi-locus model discriminated between cases where multiple alleles changed in frequency under independent selection, and cases where selection acting upon one allele led to substantial changes in the frequency of others (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003755-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In Pig104, strong evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Kass1">[35]</xref> was found for negative selection acting against the G → A mutation in locus 114, with an inferred selection coefficient of −1.6 per 12 hours (h). Such a magnitude of selection is relatively large; by comparison, an allele at frequency 50% with a selection coefficient of −1 per 12 h would decrease to 12% frequency after one day and to less than 2% after 2 days. The mutation under selection in this case is synonymous, such that the observation of strongly deleterious selection is perhaps a surprising one. While, using our method, no statistical evidence for selection upon this allele was identified in other pigs, the same polymorphism was found in data collected at the earliest time point for pigs 115 and 116, but not at subsequent time-points, consistent with a hypothesis of negative selection for this nucleotide across all viral populations.</p>
<p>In Pig109 strong evidence was found for positive selection upon at least two of three alleles; in favour of the G → A polymorphism at locus 553, the A → G polymorphism at locus 696, or the G → A polymorphism at locus 914. Fixation of all three of these mutations occurred between two samples, and models with any single one of these mutations as the selected allele performed similarly well, giving estimated selection coefficients between 3.0 and 3.1 per 12 h for the selected allele. Joint consideration of four-locus haplotype frequencies provided evidence that at least two of these mutations were independently under selection. The most likely model had coefficients of 2.8 per 12 h at each of the loci 696 and 914. However, the difference between two-locus additive models was small, and models in which any two of the three polymorphisms were under selection performed similarly well (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003755.s008">Table S1</xref>). An interesting feature of this result is that the pairs of mutant alleles inferred to be under selection are highly linked, the mutant alleles at loci 696 and 914 appearing only jointly on a sequence, and never in isolation. The inference that selection is acting at two loci, rather than at only one locus, arises from the effect of mutation in the model; this result is explored more fully in Supporting Information. We note that, while the polymorphism at locus 696 is synonymous, those at 553 and 914 are non-synonymous in character, corresponding to the mutations D185N and S305N (the former being contained within the Ca2 epitope region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Brownlee1">[36]</xref>).</p>
<p>In Pig115 weak evidence was found for positive selection in favour of the G → A polymorphism at the locus 188, with an inferred selection coefficient of 1.2 per 12 h. This polymorphism is non-synonymous, representing the amino acid substitution G63E. Bootstrapping of this result against inferences from sequence data that had been randomised in time largely supported this inference; from a total of 200 sets of randomised sequence data, a stronger signal in favour of a model of constant selection was identified in only eight cases. Details of the bootstrapping of all results are given in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003755.s009">Text S1</xref> and in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003755.s002">Figure S2</xref>.</p>
<p>In Pig405, strong evidence was found for positive selection acting upon the G →A polymorphism at locus 844, with a selection coefficient of 0.4 per 12 h, along with simultaneous, time-dependent selection acting upon the A → G polymorphism at locus 553. Selection at this second locus was inferred to be initially positive, with mean strength 0.9 per 12 h during the first time-interval, weakly negative during the second time interval, with mean strength −0.1 per 12 h, then finally strongly negative, of mean magnitude greater than −2 per 12 h for the final time interval. Each of these polymorphisms are non-synonymous (corresponding to the mutations V282I and N185D respectively; the mutation at locus 553 is identical to that observed in Pig109, albeit in the reverse direction). Identification of time-dependent selection acting upon the latter, epitope mutation is of particular interest, raising the possibility that this corresponds to an adaptive immune response by the host to the virus. In this population the magnitude of the time-dependent selection inferred for the final time-point was large and negative, but hard to identify with precision. This arises from a time-dependent model of selection being coupled with an observed allele frequency of zero at the final time-point. Excluding the influence of allele frequencies at other loci, the data in such a case can lead to an inference of arbitrarily strong negative selection; the time resolution at which data are collected imposes a limit on the magnitude of selection that can correctly be inferred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Illingworth3">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>In Pig410 we identified weak evidence for time-dependent selection acting upon the synonymous C → T mutation at locus 447; in this case, a bootstrapping calculation produced a stronger signal of selection than that for the real data in only three out of 200 cases (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003755.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Time-dependent selection was also identified in Pig412, where strong evidence was found for time-dependent selection acting upon the synonymous G → A mutation at locus 696, with further weak evidence for negative selection acting upon the synonymous A → G mutation at locus 48. Under the multi-locus model, a selection coefficient of 1.8 was identified at locus 696 for the first time interval. The inferred strength of selection at this locus for the second, final time interval was imprecise, but very large and negative; the value of −22.8 per 12 h reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003755-t001">Table 1</xref> again being caused by an observed frequency of zero at the final time-point.</p>
<p>Alleles at which selection was inferred were distributed across the HA protein (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003755.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Significant changes in allele frequency were identified in more than one infection at five different loci (447, 553, 696, 824 and 844). Of these, selection was inferred to act at the loci 696 and 844 in more than one infection. This repetition of mutations may be explained by the design of the experiment; selection is most likely to be observed when polymorphisms exist at non-negligible frequency in the population, while polymorphisms at higher frequencies are more likely to be transmitted between infections.</p>
<p>Under an initial scan for potentially non-neutral alleles, very weak evidence for selection was identified in the data from Pig113 at the three loci 447, 824 and 844. However, under the full multi-locus model, a neutral model of evolution was finally preferred. As we discuss further in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003755.s009">Text S1</xref>, our evolutionary model is more conservative in identifying selection in cases where multiple loci are considered simultaneously.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have here described a novel approach to understanding the within-host evolution of the influenza virus, based upon sequences collected at subsequent times within a single infection. Our method combines a quasispecies model of viral evolution with a hierarchical set of potential models of selection, identifying the evolutionary scenario which best explains the observed sequence data. A crucial component of our model is its accounting for linkage disequilibrium between alleles at different loci; while a single-locus model is sufficient for cases in which only one mutation in a gene changes in frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Foll1">[38]</xref>, the observation of more than one simultaneous change in allele frequency within a non-recombinant gene demands a more sophisticated analysis.</p>
<p>Our approach to inferring selection differs substantially from the calculation of dN/dS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Murcia3">[25]</xref>, not least in considering data at the haplotype frequency level. While in earlier work dN/dS has been applied to sequences collected across viral populations from all observed infections, we allow for the landscape of selection acting upon the virus to vary between animals, or potentially to change within a single animal over time. The results of our analysis also differ; while significant dN/dS ratios were identified at the codon positions 204 and 257, we did not find evidence of selection for alleles at either of these loci. We note that, over short time-scales, difficulties may arise in using numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations to infer selection. While this approach is of great value when applied to diverged sequences, such as those collected from homologous genes in different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Hurst1">[39]</xref>, its application to sequences from a single population gives results that may be harder to interpret <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Kryazhimskiy1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Mugal1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our approach to within-host viral evolution is rooted in the interpretation of viral sequence data, collected at multiple times from single infections. By modelling evolution, it is possible to assess the consequences for a viral population of hypothetical fitness landscapes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Coombs1">[16]</xref>). If it is known that a mutation fixes with given probability in a given timescale, the requisite fitness advantage conferred by that mutation can be learnt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Fonville1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Kimura1">[43]</xref>. However, obtaining a detailed picture of within-host viral evolution requires the use of time-resolved sequencing, describing the population at multiple time points. Our method provides a systematic approach to inferring selection; while the set of potential fitness models is very large <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Franke1">[44]</xref>, we build upwards from a neutral model to increasing complexity, as guided by the data. Keeping data central to our approach means that we may miss the influence of certain fitness effects; sufficient data may not be available to infer the complete picture of how evolution is at work. However, our hierarchical approach means that, given accurate data describing a population, we should not generate false inferences of the presence of selection.</p>
<p>Analysing the data, we identified selection acting upon both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. Weak selection acting upon synonymous mutations has been identified for codon usage in influenza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Kryazhimskiy2">[45]</xref> and against mutations that disrupt RNA structure in HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Zanini1">[46]</xref>, although the magnitude of selection inferred here is significantly higher than in either case. While inferring the presence of selection, our method cannot match occurrences of selection to specific biological mechanisms; further data would generally be required to do this.</p>
<p>One result for which a biological mechanism may be proposed is in the viral population of Pig405, where we identified variable, and decreasing selection acting upon a non-synonymous mutation in the Ca2 epitope region, potentially as a result of a specific immune response. For this mutation the timing of the onset of strong negative selection, in the fourth day after exposure to the virus, is earlier than the five days before detection of an adaptive response reported for an H3N2 influenza infection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Miao1">[47]</xref>. Further to this, modelling studies have associated the innate immune response with an initial decline in viral load, the adaptive response leading to final clearance of the virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Pawelek1">[13]</xref>. Here, no drop in viral titre was seen at the time of inferred negative selection, with clearance occurring eight days after infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Lloyd1">[24]</xref>. Again, further data would be required to produce a more specific conclusion; combined data of viral sequence and immune response would lead to greater understanding of systems such as this.</p>

<title>Modelling assumptions</title>
<p>Our evolutionary model assumes that the viral population is genetically well-mixed in the host, and that it evolves in a deterministic manner, both with respect to mutation, and to selection. The first of these assumptions asserts that each sample of viruses collected from the pig is representative of the viral population in the animal at the time. This would not be true if, for example, the viral population was split into diverse subsets, with selection acting in very different ways in each. Study of these effects was not possible given the data studied here.</p>
<p>Our assumption of deterministic evolution is based on the underlying viral population being large in number, that is, large enough that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are significantly greater than 1, where <italic>N</italic> is the number of viruses in an animal, <italic>μ</italic> is the mutation rate per locus, and <italic>σ</italic> is the magnitude of selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Rouzine1">[48]</xref>. Considering selection, the lowest resolution at which we report selection, of 0.1 per 12 h, is, accounting for two rounds of replication in the lifetime of an infected cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Baccam1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Heldt1">[15]</xref>, equivalent to a fitness difference of 0.05 per generation. As such, this part of the assumption holds if <italic>N</italic> is substantially larger than 20 viruses. Considering mutation, the criterion that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is stricter than that for selection (where <italic>μ</italic> is of order 10<sup>−5</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Parvin1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Sanjun1">[50]</xref>), requiring <italic>N</italic> to be substantially larger than 10<sup>5</sup>. In influenza, models of replication in a single cell suggest that of the order of 10<sup>4</sup> virions are produced within each cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Sidorenko1">[51]</xref>, while in the samples from which viruses were sequenced, a viral load of between 30 and 5500 particles per <italic>µ</italic>l <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Lloyd1">[24]</xref> was measured; once an infection has progressed to the point where viral sequencing is possible, the population is very likely large enough for this to be fulfilled. In the earliest stages of an infection, stochastic mutational behaviour could potentially lead to an incorrect inference of the initial variant frequencies within the population; however, these values are not used to draw any biological conclusions about the system.</p>
<p>Horizontal transmission between co-housed animals was not incorporated into the model; we believe this was unlikely to have greatly influenced the collected data. If the viral populations in the two simultaneously infected pigs were substantially different in composition, transmission of viruses from one animal to the other might alter the composition of the viral population in the second animal. However, the viral populations in this experiment were not sufficiently different in sequence to be able to distinguish superinfection from the growth of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations. Further, while the viral titre implicated in transmission is unknown, we believe that the incoming titre is likely to be substantially smaller than the pre-existing number of viruses in the second infected animal.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Accuracy of the data</title>
<p>A second assumption in our study is that the collected sequence data are relatively accurate. That is, we assert that the sequences obtained from the sample are representative of the sample itself. The basis of our inference upon data means that the accuracy of the data is vital for obtaining useful results. For example, in addition to raw allele counts, our approach makes explicit use of linkages between mutations. Our method allows for the possibility of generic error in the sequencing process, and fully accounts for the statistical noise inherent to a finite data sample. However, there are systematic data biases that may also affect the results obtained. For example, PCR-induced recombination has the potential to alter the observed frequencies of multi-locus haplotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Meyerhans1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Shao1">[53]</xref>. Testing for such an effect, by fitting an exponential model to the observed absolute linkage disequilibrium between pairs of alleles, we found no evidence for such recombination, no decay in this statistic being observed with increasing distance between alleles (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003755.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Sequencing bias also has an effect on whether or not a mutation is recognised as being under selection. Mutations that are preferentially identified by a sequencing method would appear in the sample at higher frequencies, such that changes in their frequencies were amplified, leading to a greater chance that such mutations were found to be under selection. For this dataset, a consistent sequencing method was used to process all of the samples; we therefore assumed sequencing bias to be consistent between samples, such that observed changes in allele frequency were caused either by the finite sampling process, or by a process of mutation and selection. Estimating the extent of sequencing bias in the observed sequences is difficult, the sequences themselves representing the only information about the real viral population. Counting the mutations observed in the data showed a high transition:transversion ratio of 9.7 (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003755.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This is broadly consistent with values observed for other RNA viral populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Sharp1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Acevedo1">[55]</xref>, albeit that measurements of this ratio in influenza have previously been based upon global, rather than within-host, populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Taubenberger1">[56]</xref>. Biased sampling, whether occurring via the collection of a biological sample that is unrepresentative of the whole population, or as a result of the subsequent PCR amplification, also has the potential to affect our inference. We have here assumed that the data is an unbiased sample of the real population.</p>
<p>Our inferences are partially limited by the use of sequences describing only the HA1 region of the influenza virus. While our inferences of deviation from neutrality in a population are not affected by alleles elsewhere in the virus, the attribution of selection to given alleles may be affected by unobserved polymorphisms in the HA2 region of influenza, or if reassortment were limited (though see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Marshall1">[57]</xref>), with alleles in other viral segments. The potential influence of selection acting upon polymorphisms that have not been observed is of greatest relevance to the cases of apparently time-dependent selection; constant selection acting upon interfering mutations causes time-dependent selection effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Illingworth2">[32]</xref>. One example is the case of Pig412 where initially positive, then negative selection is inferred. In this infection, many haplotypes which are observed at the intermediate time point are no longer seen in the final time point; this pattern is consistent either with a switch in the direction of selection acting upon the synonymous mutation at locus 696, as was inferred, or with very strong positive selection acting upon an unobserved mutation on the consensus haplotype causing a selective sweep later in the observation. Such a scenario is much less likely in the case of Pig405, where the haplotype containing the allele inferred to be under negative selection is outcompeted in the final time interval by four other haplotypes, including that of the initial consensus.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have here described a framework for the inference of selection acting upon a viral population within an individual host, based upon time-resolved sequence data. Within-host selection is of importance for the future evolution of the H7N9 influenza virus, and for understanding the epidemiology of other influenza strains. During an epidemic, both within-host growth, and the transmission of viruses, are important, and potentially competing factors; a mutation which is beneficial for within-host growth may prove deleterious for transmission and vice versa. While we have here considered only the first of these factors, our method could easily be used to infer the role of selection for transmission, given specific conditions. First of all, substantial continuity would be required between the native and the transmitted populations, such that changes in allele frequencies before and after transmission were primarily the result of selection; severe bottlenecking would distort the population structure. Secondly, clarity would be required about the source of each infection; in the experiments considered, where an infection begins with an unknown mixture of viruses from two other individuals, the role of selection in transmission cannot be evaluated. Transmission events in the data analysed here have been discussed elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Stack1">[58]</xref>. In more straightforward cases, where transmission occurs between known individuals, and where continuity between viral populations is more evident (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Richard1">[59]</xref>), use of our method to infer selection acting across transmission events is likely to be achievable.</p>
<p>The collection of sequence data describing the within-host evolution of influenza is at present, relatively rare, although we anticipate that improvements in sequencing technology will make such data increasingly accessible. Increased collection of sequence data from patients, and from evolutionary experiments, will greatly add to our understanding of viral infection. Our approach increases the value of such work, characterising in detail the forces that underlie within-host viral evolution.</p>

<title>Description of viral dynamics</title>
<p>Quasispecies theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Eigen1">[26]</xref> provides a deterministic description of the evolution of mutation-prone, self-replicating organisms; this framework has profoundly influenced studies of RNA viral evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Holmes1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003755-Lauring1">[63]</xref>. To describe the evolutionary dynamics of the influenza virus within an individual host we apply a coarse-grained quasispecies model, in which the viral population is described as haplotypes spanning a limited set of loci, rather than as complete viral sequences. Specifically, we represent the viral population as a frequency vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, defined at discrete times <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and comprised of elements <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the fraction of sequences in the population with the haplotype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; that is, with the nucleotides <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at a subset of loci <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the viral genome.</p>
<p>To model mutation between haplotypes, we assumed a constant rate of mutation, <italic>μ</italic>, between any two specific nucleotides at a given locus, the probability of mutation from haplotype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to haplotype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in a single generation being given by <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003755.e054"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e054" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the Hamming distance between the two haplotype sequences.</p>
<p>Selection was accounted for by ascribing to each haplotype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the (potentially time-dependent) selection coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>We note that, while sequence data was collected at known times throughout the course of each infection, the precise moment at which each infection began is unknown.

<title>Inferring non-neutral behaviour and selection</title>
<p>An inference of selection was carried out by comparing maximum likelihood values obtained under a hierarchical series of models, each specifying the parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The coarse-grained quasispecies model can be expressed in terms of haplotypes of arbitrary length. We describe the general model below.</p>
<sec id="s4b1">
<title>Evolutionary model</title>
<p>We consider a population with an arbitrary number of polymorphic loci, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, each containing alleles that may or may not be under selection. Each locus may contain one of four nucleotides, such that the vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, describing the initial state of the population, has <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> elements, potentially a large number. To reduce the complexity of the model, we therefore considered only the consensus and largest minority alleles at each locus. At each locus, the consensus allele, denoted 0, was defined as the majority allele in the sample collected from the population at the first time of observation. The largest minority allele, denoted 1, was then defined so as to maximise the total number of observed sequences which had one of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> haplotypes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at the loci <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Where more than two alleles were present at a given locus, this simplification distorts the resulting model likelihood. However, in the dataset considered here, such cases were extremely rare; we discuss this further in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003755.s009">Text S1</xref>.</p>
<p>Parameters describing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were defined independently. The initial frequency <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of a haplotype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was included as a variable in the model if that haplotype was observed at least once in the sequence data, other initial frequencies being set to zero. Selection parameters were included according to the model of selection being applied. In the basic, neutral model, we set the magnitude of selection <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each haplotype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and time point <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be zero. In other models of selection, the variant allele could be either neutral, or under constant or time-dependent selection at each locus. Where more than one locus had an allele under selection, the interaction between these alleles could be additive or epistatic in nature.

<p>Beginning with a neutral model, selection models of increasing complexity were tested, adding loci under selection. This process was continued either until adding selection to an allele at another locus did not improve the BIC value, or until the model likelihood was sufficiently close to the maximum theoretically achievable likelihood (obtained when the inferred haplotype frequencies <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were identical to the observed frequencies <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003755.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) that adding an additional parameter would inevitably increase the BIC.</p>

<p>A test of the ability of the method to discriminate between selected and non-selected alleles, and to correctly infer the magnitude of selection acting upon a locus, was performed by running analyses for simulated data. For simulated populations with a single allele under selection, a correlation coefficient of of more than 0.95 was found between real and inferred selection coefficients, with an equivalent correlation of 0.91 for simulated systems with two alleles under selection.
