<abstract>
<p>Oscillatory neuronal synchronization between cortical areas has been suggested to constitute a flexible mechanism to coordinate information flow in the human cerebral cortex. However, it remains unclear whether synchronized neuronal activity merely represents an epiphenomenon or whether it is causally involved in the selective gating of information. Here, we combined bilateral high-density transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS) at 40 Hz with simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to study immediate electrophysiological effects during the selective entrainment of oscillatory gamma-band signatures. We found that interhemispheric functional connectivity was modulated in a predictable, phase-specific way: In-phase stimulation enhanced synchronization, anti-phase stimulation impaired functional coupling. Perceptual correlates of these connectivity changes were found in an ambiguous motion task, which strongly support the functional relevance of long-range neuronal coupling. Additionally, our results revealed a decrease in oscillatory alpha power in response to the entrainment of gamma band signatures. This finding provides causal evidence for the antagonistic role of alpha and gamma oscillations in the parieto-occipital cortex and confirms that the observed gamma band modulations were physiological in nature. Our results demonstrate that synchronized cortical network activity across several spatiotemporal scales is essential for conscious perception and cognition.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Brain activity is profoundly rhythmic and exhibits seemingly random fluctuations across a very broad frequency range (&lt;0.1 Hz to &gt;600 Hz). Recently, it has become evident that these brain rhythms are not just a generic sign of the brain-at-work, but actually reflect a highly flexible mechanism for information encoding and transfer. In particular, it has been suggested that oscillatory synchronization between different areas of the cortex underlies the establishment of task-relevant networks. Here, we investigated whether gamma-band synchronization (∼40 Hz) is causally involved in the integration between the two brain hemispheres of alternating visual tokens into a coherent motion percept. We utilized transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a novel non-invasive brain stimulation technique, which allows frequency-specific entrainment of cortical areas. In a combined tACS-electroencephalography study, we selectively up- and down-regulated interhemispheric coherence, resulting in a directed bias in apparent motion perception: Increased interhemispheric connectivity sustained the horizontal motion percept, while decreased connectivity reinforced the vertical percept. Thus, our data suggest that the level of interhemispheric gamma-band coherence directly influenced the instantaneous motion percept. From these results, we conclude that synchronized neuronal activity is essential for conscious perception and cognition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Synchronization of oscillatory brain activity on multiple temporal scales across distant cortical regions is thought to constitute a key mechanism for conscious perception and cognition in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Engel1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Siegel1">[3]</xref>. Recently, it has become evident that synchronized cortical networks are dynamically established during cognitive processing to selectively route information to task-relevant cortical sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Hipp1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Jensen1">[5]</xref>. In particular, it has been shown that cortical information flow can selectively be controlled by shifting phase relations between cell groups oscillating at similar frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Womelsdorf1">[6]</xref>. In the visual system, synchronized gamma-band activity, mediated over cortio-cortical callosal connections, might facilitate feature integration across both visual hemifields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Engel2">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, most evidence is still correlative in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Siegel1">[3]</xref>. As a consequence, it remains unclear whether the observed rhythmic synchronization patterns merely represent concurrent neuronal activity or whether they are causally relevant for the information flow within cortical networks. The frequency-specific modulation of phase relations with subsequent behavioral alterations would constitute an unequivocal confirmation for the functional role of synchronization processes in large-scale neuronal networks. Up to now, it has been considered difficult to selectively manipulate rhythmic brain activity in the human cerebral cortex. Recently, novel methods for entrainment of perceptually relevant brain oscillations have become available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Thut1">[8]</xref>. In particular, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to entrain cortical oscillations in a frequency-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Helfrich1">[9]</xref>. Phase-dependent tACS effects have been demonstrated in a variety of human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Brittain1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Neuling1">[11]</xref>, animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Bernyi1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Ozen1">[13]</xref>, and modeling studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Kutchko1">[14]</xref>, making it a prime candidate to selectively modulate phase relationships in distant cortical regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Polana1">[15]</xref>. Optimized stimulation electrode montages and novel multi-electrode setups now allow a selective cortical stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Dmochowski1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Kuo1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to test whether perceptually relevant neuronal synchronization in large-scale neuronal networks can selectively be modulated with weak electric currents. Recent studies investigating tACS effects on long-range functional coupling remained equivocal and did not provide conclusive electrophysiological evidence for the causal role of synchronized oscillatory activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Polana1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber1">[18]</xref>. Here, we focused on the role of interhemispheric gamma-band coherence over parieto-occipital areas during ambiguous motion perception. To this end, we utilized the well-known ambiguous stroboscopic alternative motion (SAM) paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber1">[18]</xref>. In this paradigm, a physically identical stimulus can be perceived as either horizontally or vertically moving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Chaudhuri1">[19]</xref>. This perceptual bi-stability makes the stimulus ideally suited to assess percept related network differences. The perceived motion direction might alternate spontaneously depending on the level of interhemispheric gamma-band coherence over motion sensitive cortical areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Rose1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Sterzer1">[21]</xref>, and might be mediated via cortico-cortical callosal fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Gen1">[22]</xref>.</p>

(C) Electrode montage: The output signals of the tACS-stimulator were split with several Y-connectors and fed into 10 Ag/AgCl electrodes (common impedance &lt;5 kΩ), which were positioned on the cortex to create an in-phase (0° phase difference between hemispheres, green) and anti-phase (180° phase difference, orange) setup.

<p>To investigate the functional role of interhemispheric gamma-band coherence in ambiguous motion perception, we combined multi-focal 40 Hz high density (HD)-tACS at opposite polarities (in-/anti-phase stimulation) with concomitant electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate oscillatory brain activity during stimulation. We expected that the different stimulation protocols might bias network synchrony in opposite directions and therefore facilitate or impair interhemispheric integration of the visual tokens into the horizontal percept.</p>

<p>Participants (<italic>n</italic> = 14) were presented with the SAM stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) on two separate days (sessions) in three different conditions (sham, stimulation, and post) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In each session either in- or anti-phase tACS was applied. In case of horizontal motion perception, visual information from both visual hemifields has to be integrated and thus might be reflected in enhanced functional connectivity between both hemispheres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Rose1">[20]</xref>. We directly assessed coherence values for 13 interhemispheric electrode pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g002">Figure 2A</xref> inset, electrode pair of interest in red) and seven <italic>frequency</italic>-bands of interest: delta/theta (1–7 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta<sub>1</sub> (13–25 Hz), beta<sub>2</sub> (26–35 Hz), gamma<sub>1</sub> (36–45 Hz), gamma<sub>2</sub> (46–70 Hz), and gamma<sub>3</sub> (71–100 Hz).</p>

<p>Consistent with results from a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Rose1">[20]</xref>, we found a significant increase in gamma-band (γ<sub>1–3</sub>) coherence over extrastriate visual areas during horizontal motion perception (+9.5%±3.2%; t<sub>13</sub> = −2.9, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g002">Figure 2A–2C</xref>).

Source reconstruction of gamma power revealed two distinct sources in parieto-occipital cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>), which did not differ between percepts (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, permutation test).</p>
<p>We tested the causal role of this interhemispheric gamma-band coherence increase by driving both hemispheres with either in-phase (0° phase difference) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g001">Figures 1C and S</xref>1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002031.s006">Text S1</xref>) or anti-phase (180° phase difference) tACS for 20 minutes in each session to modulate functional coupling and study subsequent perceptual alterations.</p>

<title>Phase- and Frequency-Specific Stimulation Effects on Interhemispheric Coherence</title>
<p>All analyses for the SAM were conducted without the gamma<sub>1</sub>-range (spectral estimates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4A</xref> were obtained after spectral smoothing) to remove the 40 Hz stimulation artifacts. In order to assess whether stimulation selectively affected the gamma-band, grand average interhemispheric coherence values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) were submitted to a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) (<italic>session</italic>: sham, in-, and anti-phase stimulation; <italic>frequency</italic>: six bands).

<p>In addition, source reconstruction revealed that gamma-band power was again confined to parieto-occipital areas and did not differ between different percepts or stimulation conditions (all <italic>p</italic>-values &gt;0.05; cluster test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4I</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4A</xref> indicated that the coherence modulation was confined to the gamma-band. Thus, we analyzed the gamma coherence change over the three conditions with cluster-based permutation statistics and found a significant difference between in- and anti-phase stimulation over stimulated parieto-occipital cortex (cluster test: <italic>p</italic> = 0.006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), while no differences where present between both sham or post conditions (cluster tests: all <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). The modulation at the channel pair of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) highlights the difference between the increase during in-phase stimulation (+0.07±0.02; change to common baseline) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, dashed line) and the decrease during anti-phase stimulation (−0.03±0.03; effect size: d = 1.00).

<p>Interestingly, the coherence modulation was strongest for subjects with an individual gamma coherence peak frequency close to 40 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4G</xref>; cluster test: <italic>p</italic> = 0.049). The mean gamma peak frequency did not differ between sessions (t<sub>13</sub> = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> = 0.87; Peak<sub>InPhase</sub>: 51.14 Hz±3.9 Hz; Peak<sub>AntiPhase</sub>: 50.14 Hz±4.02 Hz).

Taken together, these results indicate that 40 Hz tACS successfully modulated interhemispheric phase synchrony and behavioral outcome, depending on the chosen electrode montage and the subsequently induced phase shifts. The individual percept was influenced by (i) the absolute coherence values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4A and 4F</xref>) and (ii) the relative coherence difference between the vertical and the horizontal percept (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g002">Figures 2B, 2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate the phase-specific modulation of perceptually relevant interhemispheric gamma-band coherence by 40 Hz tACS. Exogenously enhanced functional coupling facilitated the emergence of the horizontal motion percept, whereas the selective impairment reinforced vertical motion perception. Importantly, the induced coherence effects during stimulation did outlast stimulation offset, and thus imply the selective entrainment of oscillatory gamma-band activity. In addition, our results also suggest that rhythmic external stimulation shaped functional network architecture across multiple temporal scales and subsequently reduced oscillatory alpha power through enhanced cross-frequency interactions. This approach offers a unique opportunity to selectively modulate synchronization processes in large-scale neuronal networks in a frequency-specific manner.</p>

<p>Especially, volume spread in the cortical tissue constitutes a severe constraint for the interpretation of human M/EEG data at sensor level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Siegel1">[3]</xref>. Here, we utilized source reconstruction to highlight two distinct oscillatory gamma sources in the parieto-occipital cortex. The absence of any power differences between conditions or percepts reinforced our conclusion that interhemispheric coherence changes were a direct consequence of altered phase coupling and could not be attributed to differences in source configuration. Novel methods for coupling analysis at source level have successfully been introduced in the past <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Gross1">[32]</xref>. However, these techniques ideally require the use of many more electrodes than employed in this study. Only relatively few electrodes have been utilized here, to avoid amplitude clipping of adjacent EEG electrodes during tACS, since stimulation currents exceed the usual recording range of EEG amplifiers by several orders of magnitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Helfrich1">[9]</xref>.</p>

We utilized sham stimulation as a baseline to control for these effects, since it is unlikely that volume conduction changes as a function of condition. Likewise, the vertical percept served as a baseline for the horizontal percept. Importantly, the directionality of behavioral and electrophysiological effects was directly related to opposite stimulation polarities. Hence, we assume that the key findings of this study were not affected by current methodological limitations.</p>

<title>Entrainment of Perceptually Relevant Brain Oscillations</title>
<p>Neocortical spike activity is directly controlled by weak electric fields generated by the cortex itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Frhlich1">[36]</xref>. Recently, it has been shown that externally applied weak electric fields may mimic endogenous fields and therefore may modulate the temporal structure of large-scale neuronal networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Kutchko1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Ali1">[25]</xref> and synchronize spiking activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Frhlich1">[36]</xref> to different driving frequencies in a phase-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Ozen1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Entrainment of perceptually relevant brain oscillations in humans has been demonstrated for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Thut2">[37]</xref> and tACS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Helfrich1">[9]</xref>, but the exact mechanisms of action are still largely unknown. The direct interaction of a cortical oscillator and a rhythmic external source by synchronization has been suggested to constitute a key mechanism for entrainment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Thut1">[8]</xref>. Computational models indicated that the intrinsic network frequency is ideally suited to entrain the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Ali1">[25]</xref>. Nonetheless, stimulation at adjacent frequencies with higher stimulation intensities can also entrain the network sufficiently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Ali1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Helfrich2">[26]</xref> and might explain the observed effects of the 40 Hz stimulation on the γ<sub>2/3</sub>-range. Importantly, the strongest coherence modulation was observed in subjects with an intrinsic gamma peak frequency close to 40 Hz, emphasizing the need for frequency-matched stimulation protocols in future studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Neuling2">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previously, the assessment of neuronal activity during stimulation has been hampered by the difficulty to remove stimulation artifacts in concurrent EEG recordings. Recently, a novel approach for artifact rejection has been introduced to remove 10 Hz tACS artifacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Helfrich1">[9]</xref>. However, its applicability is limited to lower stimulation frequencies, since the jitter in the exact tACS trigger location, caused by an internal-clock-mismatch between tACS and EEG devices, is amplified during 40 Hz tACS. Therefore, a notch-filter was applied to remove the stimulation artifact, a procedure that is commonly used for line noise removal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Voytek1">[39]</xref>. Hence, we focused the analysis during stimulation on effects in adjacent frequency bands. Importantly, immediate stimulation effects on the phase of the ongoing activity were still present after stimulation offset, thus, making a successful gamma modulation with 40 Hz tACS highly likely. Current limitations concerning the artifact removal might be overcome with synchronized tACS-EEG systems and improved artifact rejection algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Helfrich1">[9]</xref>. In addition, the combination of tACS with different imaging modalities, such as fMRI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Antal1">[40]</xref> or magnetoencephalography (MEG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Soekadar1">[41]</xref> might extend our understanding of the physiological efficacy of tACS.</p>
<p>The modulation of long-range functional connectivity has been demonstrated for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Plewnia1">[42]</xref> and tACS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Polana1">[15]</xref>. However, none of the above studies presented conclusive behavioral and electrophysiological evidence for a successful modulation of perceptually relevant long-range synchronization.</p>
<p>The study by Strüber and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber1">[18]</xref> also employed the SAM paradigm. However, the authors found a divergent pattern of results. At the behavioral level, their results suggested that only anti-phasic stimulation at 40 Hz effectively modulated the conscious experience of apparent motion. Here we replicated the behavioral key finding, i.e., that anti-phase stimulation at 40 Hz introduces a bias to vertical motion. We extended the behavioral findings by demonstrating that a HD-tACS electrode montage may lead to a more focal in-phase stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002031.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which biases the SAM perception to horizontal motion. In contrast, the in-phase montage used by Strüber and colleagues mainly targeted the occipital pole and resulted in no perceptual bias (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002031.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Taken together, both studies suggest that 40 Hz tACS biases apparent motion perception, irrespective of SAM stimulus parameters or presentation (foveal or parafoveal) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002031.s005">Table S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Lavidor1">[43]</xref>. At the electrophysiological level, Strüber and coworkers reported that anti-phase stimulation resulted in increased interhemispheric coherence after stimulation, while we found the opposite pattern of results, i.e., in-phase stimulation enhanced synchronization, anti-phase stimulation impaired functional coupling. Strüber and colleagues had interpreted this apparent contradiction as functional decoupling, i.e., that two signals with opposite polarities still might be highly coherent as long as the phase shift remains constant. Given the differences in study design, stimulus presentation, and tACS settings (for a detailed overview please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002031.s005">Table S2</xref>), we assume that the divergent patterns might result from the fact that even slight variations in stimulation intensity or electrode montage might lead to opposite network effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Reato1">[44]</xref>. In addition, divergent results might also be explained by the cortical network state dependence of tACS effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Kutchko1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Neuling2">[38]</xref>. These findings highlight the need for well-controlled tACS protocols, which should ideally be based on computational models and electric field predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Ali1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Wagner1">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we based our hypothesis on phase-specific electric field predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002031.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and subsequently presented evidence for the selective modulation of perceptually relevant interhemispheric gamma synchronization. Crucially, coherence effects, as induced during stimulation, outlasted the offset by approximately 20 minutes.</p>
<p>It has been argued that the low spatial specificity might constitute a severe limitation of tACS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Herrmann1">[46]</xref>. However, this characteristic might prove beneficial for the modulation of large-scale networks. Here we utilized bilateral 4×1 ring electrode montages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Kuo1">[17]</xref> to selectively stimulate regions of extrastriate visual cortex involved in motion perception (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002031.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Sterzer1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Helfrich3">[47]</xref>. In the future, multi-channel stimulators and additional modeling work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Dmochowski1">[16]</xref> will hopefully allow more focal stimulation settings.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that network dynamics across multiple temporal scales become more regular during external rhythmic stimulation. In particular, our results reveal that alpha power was selectively reduced after entrainment of gamma signatures. However, effects on phase coupling were mainly observed in the gamma-band. Our results support the idea that tACS effects on the phase of the ongoing activity are frequency-band specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Herrmann1">[46]</xref>, but ancillary effects might not be constrained to a single frequency-band <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Neuling1">[11]</xref>. At present, it remains unclear whether neuronal entrainment is the only mechanism contributing to the coherence effects or whether mechanisms of neural plasticity are equally important <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Zaehle1">[48]</xref>. In absence of effects on alpha phase coupling, it is unlikely that entrainment induced the transient alpha power decrease. Our results rather imply that entrainment of gamma-band activity influenced the physiological antagonistic alpha-gamma interplay in the parieto-occipital cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Jensen2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Voytek1">[39]</xref>. Conversely, the alpha power decrease might serve as a surrogate marker for the selective entrainment of gamma band signatures, since this modulation resembles a physiologic antagonistic response to pronounced gamma band activity.</p>

<title>Physiological Efficacy of 40 Hz tACS</title>
<p>A number of recent studies have demonstrated that 40 Hz tACS modulates cognitive processing, e.g., enhances fluid intelligence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Santarnecchi1">[49]</xref>, induces lucidity in dreams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Voss1">[50]</xref>, or modulates the conscious experience of apparent motion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber1">[18]</xref>. So far, most studies utilized 40 Hz stimulation to entrain the gamma-band, even though some evidence suggested that 60 Hz tACS might be more effective than 40 Hz tACS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Lacz1">[51]</xref>. However, results by Voss and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Voss1">[50]</xref> indicated that the efficacy of tACS at 25 Hz and 40 Hz might be similar. Currently, it is unclear whether there are distinct sub-bands within the gamma-band <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Fries3">[52]</xref> and, furthermore, whether they can selectively be entrained with tACS. Previous tACS-EEG studies suggested very narrow-banded effects of tACS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Helfrich1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Voss1">[50]</xref>, while our present results indicate that 40 Hz stimulation modulated the gamma-band in a broad frequency-range. Importantly, we found that the effects of 40 Hz tACS were mainly confined to the gamma-band, indicating that tACS operates within canonical frequency boundaries constituting the rhythmic brain architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Buzski1">[53]</xref>. These findings imply that tACS might be a powerful tool to assess causal contributions of certain frequency-bands to distinct cognitive processes. Given that we observed clear cross-frequency interactions operating within physiologic boundaries, we urge caution when interpreting tACS effects in absence of electrophysiological recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Brignani1">[54]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our data also indicated that subjects with a gamma coherence peak close to 40 Hz exhibited the strongest coherence modulation during 40 Hz tACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Thus, previously observed effects might be contorted due to a large intersubject variability.

<title>The Role of Cortical Network States for Perception</title>
<p>Recently, it has become evident that cortical dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales influence conscious perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Siegel1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Engel3">[56]</xref>. Multi-stable phenomena have been related to changes in oscillatory activity in large-scale neuronal networks and might therefore reflect the periodical and constant reevaluation of sensory input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Leopold1">[57]</xref>. Crucially, it has been shown that both, local ongoing activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Busch1">[58]</xref> and interregional network activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Hipp1">[4]</xref>, influence subsequent perception. Bistable perception is ideally suited to study underlying network activity, since identical sensory input can lead to distinct percepts, depending on the current network state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Hipp1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previously, perception of the SAM has been linked to different spectral features. In particular, it has been demonstrated that frontal gamma power increments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-BaarEroglu1">[59]</xref> together with parieto-occipital alpha power decrements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber2">[60]</xref> precede a perceptual switch. Importantly, the subjects' perceptual bias was influenced by the level of interhemispheric gamma-band coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Rose1">[20]</xref> and the individual percept was enforced by selectively modulating coherence levels by tACS. Frontal gamma-band increments might trigger changes in parieto-occipital networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Dehaene1">[61]</xref> and thereby influence perception. Our data suggest that the selective entrainment of interhemispheric gamma-band synchrony might mimic the physiologic mechanism of top-down controlled percept reversals. A similar mechanism has previously been demonstrated for bottom-up processes with lower level neuron populations entraining rhythmic patterns in higher cortical areas in a feed-forward fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Bosman1">[62]</xref>.</p>
<p>Complementary coupling analyses in source space employing human M/EEG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Siegel1">[3]</xref> will be necessary to determine whether top-down control of the SAM is associated with the selective entrainment of interhemispheric phase synchrony.</p>
<p>Interestingly, decreased parieto-occipital alpha activity has been linked to a destabilization of the SAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber2">[60]</xref>. In our study, we found a decrease in alpha activity in response to the entrainment of physiologic gamma-band signatures, however, without any accompanying switch rate changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This observation indicates that the alpha decrease might actually reflect a secondary process in response to the gamma mediated perceptual reversals, thus, highlighting the antagonistic role of alpha and gamma oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Jensen2">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings strongly support the idea that neuronal interactions across different cortical regions are encoded at multiple temporal scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Engel3">[56]</xref> by selective synchronization between task-relevant areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Siegel1">[3]</xref>.</p>

<title>Confounds and Limitations</title>
<p>tACS studies have a seemingly endless search space: Electrode placement, stimulation frequency, intensity, and duration are obvious concerns. Here we based our hypothesis on two recent SAM studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Rose1">[20]</xref> and subsequently reproduced their main findings. We documented the electrophysiological signatures of SAM perception in absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g002">Figure 2A–2C</xref>) and in presence of tACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). However, a number of limitations do apply. (i) We only applied tACS for 20 minutes, since it had previously been shown that 20 minutes of 40 Hz tACS effectively modulated apparent motion perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber1">[18]</xref>. While 20 minutes of stimulation are well within current safety limits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Nitsche1">[63]</xref>, it is unclear how stimulation duration impacts the behavioral and electrophysiological outcome. (ii) Furthermore, our results suggest that stimulation at individual peak frequencies might actually be more efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g004">Figure 4G</xref>) than using a fixed stimulation frequency. (iii) Another limitation is the preceding sham session. In accordance with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Helfrich1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Neuling2">[38]</xref>, we observed outlasting stimulation effects for approximately 20–30 minutes, which impede an inverse procedure. Here we utilized a post condition to validate the sham condition and to control for outlasting behavioral and electrophysiological effects. Throughout the study we did not find any differences between sham and post conditions. Furthermore, the counter-balanced within-subject design in two sessions allowed us to study directionality effects, thus, minimizing concerns that the subjects could distinguish between real and sham stimulation. In fact, it was impossible for subjects to distinguish in- and anti-phase stimulation. (iv) Another clear restriction is the unbalanced electric field distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002031.s001">Figure S1</xref>). While our in-phase stimulation was very focal, the anti-phase montage led to a more distributed electric field. However, in contrast to the study by Strüber and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber1">[18]</xref>, both montages targeted the extrastriate visual cortex and modulated the behavioral outcome. We believe that multi-channel stimulators and optimized electric field models will improve the focality of tACS in the future. We expect that a rational design of tACS experiments using frequency-matched and neuro-navigated protocols will improve the efficacy in human tACS studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Frhlich2">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>So far, the basic physiological principles behind the efficacy of tACS are still largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Herrmann1">[46]</xref>. Further work in human, animal, and modeling studies will hopefully advance our understanding of tACS and its interactions with neuronal circuits. In the future, complementary modeling approaches may guide individually tailored stimulation protocols and electrode features to overcome current limitations, such as the unclear electric field distribution in the head, the cortical state dependence, and the high intersubject variability.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, our results demonstrate that interhemispheric gamma-band coherence can be selectively modulated by tACS. In this study, we established a causal role of synchronized gamma band oscillations for feature integration across both hemispheres and confirmed the antagonistic role of alpha and gamma oscillations in the parieto-occipital cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Jensen2">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate the ability of tACS to selectively entrain cortical oscillations and add to a growing body of evidence indicating that synchronized oscillatory activity in large-scale neuronal networks is a key mechanism for conscious perception and cognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Siegel1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Engel3">[56]</xref>. Disturbances of synchronized network activity have previously been related to schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and Parkinson's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Uhlhaas1">[64]</xref>. In particular, ASD have been associated with impaired feature integration across both hemispheres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-David1">[65]</xref>.</p>
<p>Future research might therefore offer the possibility to individually tailor therapeutic interventions by means of non-invasive brain stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Schulz1">[66]</xref>.

The display was 60 cm away from the participants. The horizontal dot distance was 5.1°, the vertical 6.9° at a constant dot size of 0.35°. We introduced a shorter horizontal than vertical distance to compensate the vertical bias of equidistant SAMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Chaudhuri1">[19]</xref>. Every trial of continuous visual stimulation lasted 1 minute. Participants reported their percept by pressing two different buttons with their right hand. All volunteers participated in two sessions of the experiment carried out within 1 week. After preparation of the tACS and EEG electrodes (see below), participants completed a training session with ambiguous and non-ambiguous trials to familiarize volunteers with the stimulus and to ensure that all participants could reliably track their percepts. On both days all participants completed ten trials during sham, 20 trials during stimulation (in- or anti-phasic tACS), and ten trials during the post condition. Whether participants were stimulated with in- or anti-phase stimulation on the first day was counterbalanced across subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, the participating experimenters were blinded whether they received in- or anti-phasic stimulation).

The recorded EEG was filtered between 1 Hz and 100 Hz using two-pass finite element response filters (eegfilt.m function) as implemented in EEGLab and down-sampled to 1,000 Hz. For the analysis of the SAM data, a higher (&gt;6th) order two-pass butterworth notch filter in the range from 35 to 45 Hz was applied to the sham, stimulation, and post measurements to remove the stimulation artifact and to keep results comparable across all conditions. Forward and backward filtering was performed to avoid phase distortions. Note, that sham and post conditions were also analyzed without the notch-filter for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Then the data was segmented into 3,000 ms epochs, starting 500 ms after an indicated perceptual switch. Epochs containing excessive noise, saccades, or muscle artifacts were removed after visual inspection. Data acquired during resting states was split into 1-second segments. Segments containing artifacts were excluded after visual inspection.</p>
<p>Spectral estimates for SAM and resting state data were computed by means of a sliding Hanning window (1–35 Hz, 1 Hz steps, 500 ms window) and a multi-taper approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Jarvis1">[71]</xref>; (36–100 Hz, 1 Hz steps, 250 ms window length, ±10 Hz frequency smoothing, SAM: 59 slepian tapers, resting state [RS]: 19 slepian tapers). Slow frequencies (delta/theta) were pooled and treated as one frequency band given that (a) delta-band activity is likely confounded by the stimulus presentation rate (visual tokens alternated every 250 ms and (b) a recent study already demonstrated that 6 Hz tACS did not impact apparent motion perception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber1">[18]</xref>. Coherence estimates were calculated for 13 interhemispheric channel pairs (inset <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) in 1 Hz steps and then averaged across the frequency bands of interest. The increase in interhemispheric coherence was quantified as the relative coherence increase for horizontal over vertical motion perception, since the vertical percept serves as a rigorous baseline that controls for effects such as volume conduction or reference electrode position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Rose1">[20]</xref>. The number of data segments per subject was balanced across conditions and percepts to avoid a sample size bias.</p>
<p>Cortical sources of gamma-band activity were reconstructed with a linear beamforming approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Gross1">[32]</xref> as implemented in FieldTrip. A volume conduction model was derived from the MNI template brain, resulting in a three-shell model. The leadfield matrix was calculated using the boundary element method. The source activity at each grid point was estimated by constructing a spatial filter using the leadfield at a given point and the cross-spectral density matrix. For each participant and condition, the cross-spectral density matrix was calculated between all 31 EEG channels, separately for the RS (baseline) and the respective conditions and percepts. Differences were assessed by cluster-based permutation statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Maris1">[72]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to assess whether network activity was more regular during stimulation, we calculated the Shannon entropy at every channel for every condition on normalized spectral estimates S<sub>x</sub>, i.e., for each frequency the spectra were divided by the sum of all estimates across channel and these quantities were formally treated like probabilities. The entropy H(X) was calculated for four frequency-bands of interest f (δ, α, β<sub>1/2</sub>, γ<sub>2/3</sub>) at every given channel x as:<disp-formula id="pbio.1002031.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002031.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Cross frequency interactions between alpha and gamma were assessed for every channel, condition, and subject separately. In order to calculate the amplitude-envelope-correlation between both, we first band-pass filtered every trial in the alpha and the gamma<sub>2</sub> range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), similar to the approach, which had been introduced and validated by Voytek and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Voytek1">[39]</xref> for 1,000 ms data segments. We also utilized a two-way, zero phase-lag, finite impulse response filter (eegfilt.m function in EEGLab toolbox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Delorme1">[69]</xref>) to prevent phase distortion. Then Hilbert's transform was applied to extract the amplitude of the alpha (Aα) and the gamma (Aγ) oscillation. Then a second Hilbert transform was used to extract the envelope (Eγ) of the band-pass (8–12 Hz) filtered gamma amplitude. Amplitude-envelope-correlations between Aα and Eγ were calculated for every trial separately. Subsequently, correlation values were Fisher-Z-transformed and averaged.</p>
<p>The instantaneous phase of the ongoing activity was also derived from the Hilbert transformation, after band-pass filtering the signal in different frequency bands as outlined above, and subsequently used for circular statistics.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>In accordance with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Strber1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Rose1">[20]</xref>, we focused our analysis on the electrode pair of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1002031-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, red in inset). If not stated otherwise, we used repeated measures analyses of variance (RM-ANOVAs) with post hoc planned contrasts according to our hypothesis. Data were tested for normality with Lilliefors test and for sphericity with Mauchly's test. Where applicable, Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied and corrected <italic>p</italic>-values and degrees of freedom are reported. Effect size was quantified by means of Cohen's d. All values reported are mean ± SEM. We confirmed the regional specificity of the observed effects with permutation statistics as implemented in Fieldtrip (Monte Carlo method; 1,000 iterations; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). The cluster approach corrects for the multiple comparison problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Maris1">[72]</xref>. Dependent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests were computed at each sensor pair and for each frequency. Clusters were obtained by summing up <italic>t</italic>-values, which were adjacent in space and frequency below a cluster alpha level of 5%. A permutation distribution was computed by randomly switching condition labels within subjects in each of 1,000 iterations. The permutation <italic>p</italic>-value was obtained by comparing the cluster statistic to the random permutation distribution. The observed clusters were considered independently significant when the sum of <italic>t</italic>-values exceeded 95% of the permutated distribution. Circular statistics were calculated with the CircStat toolbox for MatLab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Berens1">[73]</xref>. We utilized Rao's spacing test to assess the non-uniform distribution of instantaneous phase angles, which is advantageous for assessment of multimodal non-uniform distributed data, in order to account for the procedure with two sessions. Differences in non-uniform circular distribution between conditions were assessed with Kuiper's tests.</p>
<p>Cluster-based permuted correlation analyses: In order to link the coherence modulation during stimulation to (i) the change in behavior and (ii) the outlasting coherence effects, we implemented a data-driven cluster-based permutation test based on Pearson's linear correlation coefficient. We calculated a baseline corrected composite measure of the behavioral MR by means of a motion index: MI  =  (MR<sub>InPhase</sub> − MR<sub>ShamIn</sub>) − (MR<sub>AntiPhase</sub> − MR<sub>ShamAnti</sub>), resulting in a single value per subject. During each iteration of the permutation test, we compared the coherence difference ΔCoh  =  Coh<sub>InPhase</sub> − Coh<sub>AntiPhase</sub> to the difference between both sham conditions and calculated a correlation value per channel pair. We utilized the Monte Carlo method for cluster tests as implemented in Fieldtrip. Therefore, we transformed the resulting correlation coefficients (r-values) into <italic>t</italic>-values using the following formula (<italic>n</italic> =  number of subjects): <disp-formula id="pbio.1002031.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002031.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Then clusters were formed based on combining adjacent sensors with <italic>p</italic>-values below a cluster alpha of 20% and summing up <italic>t</italic>-values. A permuted distribution was computed randomly switching condition labels within subjects in each of 1,000 iterations. On every iteration, clusters were again formed based on combining neighboring channels with <italic>t</italic>-values below the cluster alpha. The sum of <italic>t</italic>-values from the largest cluster was added to a permutation distribution. Finally, only clusters spanning at least two adjacent channels with a <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 tested against the permutation distribution were considered significant. The same approach was used to compare the coherence modulation in the gamma-band after stimulation offset. However, here we calculated a coherence modulation index per channel pair after stimulation offset, resulting in a channel pair × subject matrix that was used for the correlation analysis. Hence, correlation values were not computed across different channel pairs.</p>

<title>Eyetracking data</title>
<p>Data analysis was performed using a previously established algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Engbert1">[30]</xref> and customized MatLab code. Data within 1 second of a button press was discarded. Fixation was quantified as the average eye position for every subject across all trials, for all sessions, conditions, and both percepts separately. Microsaccades were analyzed by means of a two-step approach: First, data were filtered for saccades &lt;0.05° or &gt;1.6° visual angle and eye blinks. Epochs with less than 80% remaining samples were automatically rejected. Running the algorithm again on the remaining filtered epochs, microsaccades were classified as samples exceeding the average velocity by more than eight standard deviations. They had to have a duration of at least 10 milliseconds and an amplitude between 0.05° and 1° <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002031-Engbert1">[30]</xref>. Vertical and horizontal microsaccade directions were then assessed for every session, condition, and percept direction (vertical and horizontal) separately.</p>

Electrode placement in the study by Strüber and colleagues was according to the international 10–10 system: In-phase stimulation was delivered over C3, C4, and slightly posterior to O1 and O2, while anti-phase stimulation was delivered over P7, PO7, P8, and PO8. In the present study, the stimulation polarity for the anti-phase session was adjusted to closely match the montage as introduced by Strüber and colleagues. The electric field simulations of the present study indicate that both montages targeted the extrastriate visual cortex and induced subsequent behavioral modulations, with the in-phase setup providing a more focal stimulation. In contrast, the anti-phase montage by Strüber and colleagues also targeted the extrastriate cortex and induced subsequent behavioral alterations, while their in-phase montage targeted mainly the occipital pole and induced no subsequent behavioral modulation. Note that only the relative electric field spread is depicted.</p>

Their results indicated that only anti-phasic stimulation at 40 Hz influenced the conscious experience of apparent motion perception. The authors obtained no significant results for in-phase stimulation at 40 Hz, nor did they find any effects for 6 Hz or sham stimulation. In particular, they demonstrated that anti-phasic 40 Hz tACS increased the amount of perceived vertical motion in the SAM. Here, we replicated their key behavioral finding and adjusted several experimental parameters to demonstrate that interhemispheric coherence could, in fact, be modulated in a desired and predictable fashion.
