      <abstract>
        <p>In systems and computational biology, much effort is devoted to functional identification of systems and networks at the molecular-or cellular scale. However, similarly important networks exist at anatomical scales such as the tendon network of human fingers: the complex array of collagen fibers that transmits and distributes muscle forces to finger joints. This network is critical to the versatility of the human hand, and its function has been debated since at least the 16<sup>th</sup> century. Here, we experimentally infer the structure (both topology and parameter values) of this network through sparse interrogation with force inputs. A population of models representing this structure co-evolves in simulation with a population of informative future force inputs via the predator-prey estimation-exploration algorithm. Model fitness depends on their ability to explain experimental data, while the fitness of future force inputs depends on causing maximal functional discrepancy among current models. We validate our approach by inferring two known synthetic Latex networks, and one anatomical tendon network harvested from a cadaver's middle finger. We find that functionally similar but structurally diverse models can exist within a narrow range of the training set and cross-validation errors. For the Latex networks, models with low training set error [&lt;4%] and resembling the known network have the smallest cross-validation errors [∼5%]. The low training set [&lt;4%] and cross validation [&lt;7.2%] errors for models for the cadaveric specimen demonstrate what, to our knowledge, is the first experimental inference of the functional structure of complex anatomical networks. This work expands current bioinformatics inference approaches by demonstrating that sparse, yet informative interrogation of biological specimens holds significant computational advantages in accurate and efficient inference over random testing, or assuming model topology and only inferring parameters values. These findings also hold clues to both our evolutionary history and the development of versatile machines.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In science and medicine alike, one of the critical steps to understand the working of organisms is to identify how a given individual is similar or different from others. Only then can the specific features of an individual be distinguished from the general properties of that species. However, doing enough input-output experiments on a given organism to obtain a reliable description of its function (i.e., a model) can often harm the organism, or require too much time when testing perishable tissues or human subjects. We have met this challenge by demonstrating that our novel algorithm can accelerate the extraction of accurate functional models in complex tissues by continually tailoring each successive experiment to be more informative. We apply this new method to the problem of describing how the tendons of the fingers interact, which has puzzled scientists and clinicians since the time of Da Vinci. This new computational-experimental method now enables fresh research directions in biological and medical research by allowing the experimental extraction of accurate functional models with minimal damage to the organism. For example, it will allow a better understanding of similarities and differences among related species, and the development of personalized medical treatment.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Much attention is given to functional networks (e.g., scale-free, small world and others) resulting from the complex interactions between their constituents [e.g., 1–5]. For example, the mechanisms of module assembly in biological molecular networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Yanai1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Vazquez1">[8]</xref> (with underlying motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Milo1">[9]</xref>) exhibit coordinated, complex functionalities; interconnectivity among unreliable elements yields reliable dynamic performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Klemm1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Patil1">[12]</xref>. Similarly, the study of a complex biological system as a whole can be emphasized to understand how system properties emerge from the interaction of multiple components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Snoep1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Noble1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Tendon networks at anatomical scales are intricate and poorly understood componentsof the neuromuscular control of the hand. Understanding their functional characteristics is critical to gaining insight into the brain-body co-evolution that has facilitated dexterous manipulation in modern humans, as well as improving clinical rehabilitation strategies in orthopedic and neurological conditions. The complexity of tendon networks of the fingers is legendary, and thus the so-called Winslow's rhombus is a generic topological approximation that has been widely adopted since the 18<sup>th</sup> Century as proposed by the famous Danish-born anatomist J.B. Winslow in 1732 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Winslow1">[16]</xref>—especially as the descriptions popularized by Zancolli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Zancolli1">[17]</xref> and Garcia-Elias et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-GarciaElias1">[18]</xref>. It is known that minor variations in its structure can exist across humans [e.g., 19], and most work has focused on anatomical/structural descriptions via dissection or imaging and material properties [e.g., 20–27], or simplified computational models [e.g., 28,29]. Importantly, critical structural features, e.g., tendon multiplicity and interconnections are known to remain un-detected with imaging modalities, for example, Ultrasonography (US) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Clavero1">[30]</xref>. As an alternative to structural descriptions, we have proposed functional descriptions of such systems that underscore their sensitivity to topological details <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-ValeroCuevas2">[31]</xref>. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that it is possible to use sparse experimentation to, in practice, extract topologies that capture the dominant functional features of these poorly understood structures, which allows us to begin to understand in detail the anatomical and neural co-adaptations that enable dexterous manipulation in modern humans.</p>
      <p>This work is enabled and motivated by our earlier work in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-ValeroCuevas3">[32]</xref>, where we inferred the topology of tendinous networks <underline>in simulation</underline>. That work showed not only that network topology matters functionally, but that it was—in principle—possible to infer experimentally the structure of arbitrary networks using the most informative force data. Now, we take the critical enabling <underline>experimental </underline>step of demonstrating the validity and utility of this approach when applied to actual physical anatomical systems, with the imperfections, nonlinearities and actuation/measurement noise that this implies. We do so by testing networks of “known” topology made of strings of synthetic Latex, as well as biological (i.e., cadaveric) tendinous networks of <underline>unknown</underline> topology. As mentioned above, these biological specimens are complex sheets of collagen fibers, which for centuries have been approximated as networks of strings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Winslow1">[16]</xref>, but for which there is no functionally validated string-based approximation.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>We describe (i) the development and implementation of the estimation-exploration algorithm for arbitrary networks of strings, and (ii) its application to the experimental inference of two known networks made of synthetic Latex, and one extensor mechanism network excised from the middle finger of a cadaveric human hand.</p>
      <p>The key concept in the estimation-exploration inference process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Bongard1">[33]</xref>) is to infer a functional model of the physical network in an informative way that minimizes testing time and potential damageto the tissue—both critical when testing perishable or fragile biological specimens and systems. This three-stage process begins with the collection of a few random input-output force data sets (i.e., <bold>loadsets</bold>) from the network to seed the database of load sets (<bold>Stage I</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>). <bold>Stage II</bold> is a modeling process to synthesize a population of candidate functional models that best replicate the first random and then the informative data acquired in <bold>Stage I</bold>. The fitness of each model is calculated by performing forward simulations to predict how well the model can replicate the available load sets in the database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). <bold>Stage III</bold> is a complementary modeling process to synthesize a population of candidate force inputs to apply to the experimental system next (i.e., to generate the most informative future load sets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>). The fitness of each input is given by the disagreement (i.e., variance) it produces in output responses of the models synthesized in <bold>Stage II</bold>(i.e., an input that produces similar outputs across all models is the least informative test to perform). In <bold>Stage I</bold>again, the predicted, most-informative input is applied to the network system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>). This adds a new, presumablymost informative, load set to the database whose subsequent impact on the fitness of previously evolved models leads to the synthesis of a new population of models that is on average more compatible with the available experimental data. This inference method is in essence a predator-prey co-evolutionary process between models and the most informative tests that promotes both accurate functional models and efficient experimental testing thatcontinues until the termination criteria are met.</p>

      <p>We first describe the modeling processes for Stages II and III, which are identical for the synthetic Latex and cadaveric networks because they are both modeled as networks of elastic strings. Details of how we measureand apply input/output data to generate load sets in Stage I forboth experimental systems are described thereafter. We assume that the mechanical function of the target network system is well approximated by a model of discrete, interconnected/sliding strings. We further assume that all the input and output nodes are accessible for otherwise hidden networks, as is the case for the synthetic and anatomical networks tested. The state of a hidden network is described by a set of actuating forces at the input nodes, those resulting at the grounded output nodes, and the distances between the input and output nodes after the network attains equilibrium. Input and resultant forces comprise the load set while the inter-nodal distances comprise the deformation data. Both force and deformation data are used to evolve the models to best explain a network since ignoring either information may result in more number of experiments (in Stage I), see supporting information S1.</p>
      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>Stage II: Simultaneous topological and parametric evolution of models in simulation</title>
        <p>We evolve a population of models (both topology and their parametric attributes) bottom-up from a primordial mesh of strings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). The strings are arranged such that some are joined at the nodes (shown as filled circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>), while the rest overlap and slide past each other. This connectivity allows the models to evolve into any topology (i.e., number of strings and intermodal connectivity) that a hidden network system may have. The length and cross sectional area of each string are used as free parameters to evolve the model topology and parameter values simultaneously. String length is a topological as well as a parametric variable: a string can be considered absent from the model if it evolves to a length for which it remains slack for all loading conditions; or present if taut for some or all load setswhere its length influences force transmission and inter-nodal distances. Cross sectional area is a parametric variable that defines the load-bearing and deformation characteristics of a string for given stress-strain relationship (linear or nonlinear). For synthetic networks in this work, we used the linear stress-strain relations for Latex rubber (part SLR-040-E, 1 mm thickness, 380 mm×305 mm, Small Parts Inc.), while for the tendinous extensor mechanism we employed nonlinear tendon properties as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Zajac1">[34]</xref>. The total number of nodes is maintained constant, but their location is allowed to vary in response to loading—except for the two grounded nodes (shown as filled squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>) where reaction output forces are measured.</p>

            <p>Length of each string behaves as a topological and parametric design variable. For the informative equilibrium configurations that the mesh observes, if some strings remain slack, they are eliminated from the topology. Only taut strings in some or all configurations get retained. Length and cross sections of strings are evolved as design variables. (b) Each taut string in the parent mesh is modeled as a large deformation truss finite element. Slack strings do not support the external loads. Analysis performed is geometrically (for synthetic targets) and materially (for the finger extensor mechanism) nonlinear and equilibrium is achieved through efficient, quadratically convergent Newton-Raphson iterations.</p>

          <list-item>
            <p><bold>Population of models.</bold> We evolve eight models for each synthetic network and five models for the finger extensor mechanism. The models are evolved independent of each other (i.e., no information exchange is permitted among them). While large populations of models are desirable, the computational cost increases with every model introduced. As a proof of concept, we were able to evolve small populations of eight and five models respectively within 24 hours using the available computational resources. As mentioned before, each model stems from a primordial mesh of strings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). The length and cross-section of each string in a model are optimized (see below) to explain all available load sets in the database. In each model, the three movable input nodes and the two grounded output nodes are pre-specified in the primordial mesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). We ensure that the distances between the grounded nodes in the target network and those in the models are identical. Initial distances among the input nodes can however be different from those in the target networks. This is because we assume that all strings are slack before the model is actuated.</p>

Before proceeding to Stage III, each model is cross-validated to predict how well it emulates the target network using data sets different from those most informative ones used to evolve the model topologies. This fitness criterion helps to prevent over-fitting in the training set.

For all the experiments performed, <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> = −8 and <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> = 9 are used for which, changes in <italic>c</italic>, if they occur, are permitted within 3.35×10<sup>−4</sup>(<italic>c</italic><sub>U</sub>−<italic>c</italic><sub>L</sub>) and 2.72(<italic>c</italic><sub>U</sub>−<italic>c</italic><sub>L</sub>). If <italic>c<sub>new</sub></italic>&lt;<italic>c</italic><sub>L</sub>, <italic>c<sub>new</sub></italic> is set to <italic>c</italic><sub>L</sub>. Otherwise, if <italic>c<sub>new</sub></italic> exceeds <italic>c</italic><sub>U</sub>, <italic>c<sub>new</sub></italic> is set to <italic>c</italic><sub>U</sub>. Changes in free parameters are performed as follows. If a uniformly distributed random number <italic>p</italic> represents the probability for change and if <italic>p</italic>&lt;<italic>p<sub>rate</sub></italic> (e.g., 8%), the value of the free parameter is altered. A small <italic>p<sub>rate</sub></italic> (typically less than 15%) is chosen to prevent the hill climber algorithm from degenerating into a random search. A new model is created by altering only some free parameter values <italic>c</italic> of the prior model to <italic>c<sub>new</sub></italic>. The new model is analyzed (see model analysis, <bold>stage II</bold>) and if it has a lower training set error, <italic>e_training</italic>, the new model then replaces the current model. Else, the current model is retained. To limit the computational cost and yet allow sufficient iterations/time for the models to evolve after a new most informative test is introduced, the search is continued until any one of the following termination conditions is met: (a) The training set error for a model is less than the chosen threshold (0.5%). Further evolution of this model is ceased but other models in the population are continued to evolve. (b) Before the model evolution commences in Stage II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, a counter <italic>G<sub>L</sub></italic> that tracks favorable changes is set to 0. A favorable change is one that lowers the training set error of any model in the population. Another counter <italic>G</italic> (initially set to 0) used is such that it is incremented by 1 if none of the models improve in the training set error in an iteration of Stage II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. For any model, if the training set error is lowered, <italic>G</italic> is set to zero and <italic>G<sub>L</sub></italic> is incremented by 1. When <italic>G</italic>&gt;2<italic>G<sub>L</sub></italic>, model evolution is stopped. It may happen that a small value of <italic>G<sub>L</sub></italic> will lead to premature convergence to avoid which, the minimum permitted value for <italic>G</italic> used is 5000. (c) To permit model evolution in finite time for a newly introduced most informative test, a hard limit on the number of iterations in Stage I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g001">Fig. 1</xref> is set to 100,000.

        <p>A few additional evolutionary strategies are also used so that the models can evolve better and faster. In the first, very small changes (&lt;1%) in the free parameters are performed but with a higher rate (<italic>5p<sub>rate</sub></italic>). In the second, major changes (&gt;20%) are accomplished with a smaller rate (0.2<italic>p<sub>rate</sub></italic>). Lastly, the worst model in the population is crossed over with a random one if the former does not exhibit improvement over a number of iterations.</p>
        <p>After the free parameters of a chosen number of models are evolved using the informative input-output data (Stage II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), only those strings that become taut for at least one set of simulated tests constitute the model topology. Those that remain slack for all simulated tests do not participate in the connectivity. However, they are retained in each model as they may get taut at a later stage in the inference algorithm.</p>

        <p>Ideally, conducting the inference process in real time requires the availability of a large parallel computing network to evolve the models and the most informative actuation tests shortly after each new load set is added to the database.

          <title>Experimental generation of input-output load sets</title>
          <p>As mentioned above, conducting the inference process in real time requires the availability of a large, parallel computing network to evolve the models and the most informative actuation tests shortly after each new load set is added to the database. Because this is not feasible for this first study, we collected data for both Latex and tendinous networks in dedicated experimental sessions—and ran the algorithm off-line using those data sets. In all three experiments (inference of two Latex and one tendinous networks), we collected 72 input-output data sets in response to 72 different combinations of tests in random order to prevent any bias due to loading order (see details in Stage I below). These tests were designed to be evenly distributed in the 3D input space: The input nodes were tugged with combinations of four force levels of 1.25 N, 2.50 N, 3.75 N and 5.00 N and the resulting static force-deformation responses were measured for a total of 64 load sets (4<sup>3</sup> = 64). Additionally, we interspersed eight more load sets for cross validation. Here, tensions of 1.9 N and 4.4 N (2<sup>3</sup> = 8 combinations) were employed to pull each input string.</p>
          <p>All tests were chosen to amply deform the cadaveric network and yet be conservative to not tear the collagenous cadaver tissue. Further, by introducing the tests used for cross validation uniformly between those used to generate the training set, we ensured that the cross-validation load sets were distinct from any training load set.</p>
          <p>For all three networks, the experiments for data collection lasted about 8 hours, which is well within the time frame for studies of cadaveric tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-ValeroCuevas4">[37]</xref>. While it is known that the human finger tendons can uphold large forces (∼90 N) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-An1">[38]</xref>, a conservative range for the actuation forces was chosen for this experiment (≤5 N) to prevent rupture of tissue or tethers, or interconnections between them during repeated loading.</p>
          <p>The collection of the 72 load sets allowed us to execute and validate the inference algorithm off-line. Whenever the algorithm requested the next most informative test, we provided the load set corresponding to the nearest neighbor (in the least squared sense) to it from the 64 training load sets. Within each cycle of the estimation-exploration algorithm, after the models were evolved, their cross-validation was performed with 8 additional load sets.</p>

The tethers were routed above the experimental bed via pulleys with adjustable locations so that (i) the network issuspended above the bed to improve the accuracy in the force readings by removing friction and stiction; and (ii) the line of action of the tests (input loads) can be adjusted. Once the loaded network attained equilibrium, the inter-nodal distances between the three input and two output nodes (6 values) were measured with a dial caliper to an accuracy of 1 mm. The deformed configuration of the network is uniquely specified by these distances.</p>

A characteristic of this structure is the overlap between the lateral offshoot and the diagonal band on both symmetric sides.

(c) the tissue mounted over the experimental bed for force-motion data extraction (d) magnified view of the extensor tissue (e) ten best inferred networks that are all functionally equivalent within the training set and cross validation errors of 7.9% and 7.2% respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002751-t002">Table 2</xref>). The models are structurally diverse. Strings colored yellow are not taut in the equilibrium configuration shown. Those colored red are taut. Slack strings do become taut when some other test, used to infer the model network, is employed. Models (i), (iv), (viii) and (ix) in (e) structurally resemble with the Winslow's rhombus in (a) with notable deviations besides the presence of additional strings. In model (i), all modules according to the classical description in (a) are captured except for the left lateral offshoot which is shorter in length. In (iv), a string connects the middle and terminal slips. In (viii), the central band is replaced by a diamond. In model (ix), the left lateral offshoot does not overlap with the left diagonal band but instead, is fused with it.</p>

          <p>When loading the ‘AFH’ and ‘aWR’ networks, the location of the input nodes was allowed to change as the networks deformed, but the lines of action were maintained constant. For the ‘AFH’ network, the directions for the tests were fixed along −135°, −90° and −45°, respectively from the horizontal at the left, center and right bottom input nodes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

          <title>Experimental set up for the cadaveric extensor mechanism</title>
          <p>As in our prior cadaveric work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-ValeroCuevas4">[37]</xref>), a fresh-frozen cadaver hand was thawed overnight and an extensor mechanism was excised from the middle finger by a practicing hand surgeon (Dr. S.S. Roach, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>). Because it is critical to maintain the structural integrity of the tissue throughout the experiment, all load sets were collected within 8 hours of the surgical excision of the extensor mechanism. The tissue was continually kept moist using a 0.9% saline solution to prevent desiccation. Using techniques similar to those described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-ValeroCuevas4">[37]</xref> we used a hydrophilic surgical glue [VetBond, 3 M Inc.] to attach rigid tethers (i.e., Nylon strings) to the insertion slips of the <italic>extensor digitorum communis</italic>, <italic>second palmar</italic> and <italic>second dorsal interosseous</italic> muscles (i.e., the three input nodes) and the two terminal slips of the extensor mechanism (i.e., the <italic>proximal</italic> and <italic>distal slips</italic>, or two output nodes). The cadaveric specimen was suspended over the experimental bed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>) via pulleys to eliminate stiction and friction and the input tethers were held at constant angles of −115° (left), −90° (middle) and −75° (right) from the horizontal. It is assumed that these are the approximate angles along which the three actuating muscles are orientedon the dorsum of the hand, and that the changes in these angles are negligible when the muscles coordinate to result in the finger ad-abduction.</p>

        <title>Comparison of parametric vs. parametric and topological inference</title>
        <p>We also performed simple parametric fitting to infer the target networks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g003">Figs. 3 (a) and (b)</xref> using the all-in-all (see Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s002">Figs.

In parametric fitting, only six strings were used to connect the three input nodes to the two output ones. The length and cross section of each string were evolved as in the topological inference which allowed us to use the model evolution algorithm described before. In parametric fitting, all the six strings participated by becoming taut and hence the all-in-all topology did not change.</p>
        <p>In all cases, inferring the topology of the target network yields significantly better results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, green lines) than only inferring parametric values using respective all-in-alltopologies. The stated primary aim of this study is to infer the structure of hidden tendinous systems. This is important both from the evolutionary perspective where it is the actual topology that changes, and also to plan the rehabilitation and surgical repair/replacement in cases of minor/major injuries. A 3-input, 2-output system for instance the synthetic networks herein can be learnt through say, a neural network. However, such learning processes provide only a mathematical relation but lack the physical structure and insight into the complex biological systems. Thus, in our work we emphasize the need for structural models. By allowing the tendon topology to vary and comparing the data fitting results with those obtained for a presumed, primitive (all-in-all) structure, we demonstrate that performing parametric-only fitting with preconceived topologies resulting from, say, a scientist's ingenuity and insight may not necessarily lower the fitting errors. Topological inference is essential in addition to parametric-only fitting.</p>

Models (i), (iv), (viii) and (ix) closely resemble the Winslow's rhombus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4</xref> (a)), which is consistent with the findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Zancolli1">[17]</xref> that ignores the transverse bands. The cross-validation errors for models (i) and (iv) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4</xref> (e) are the lowest, with model (i) being marginally higher even though its training set error is significantly lower.</p>

            <p>Errors incurred during the inference of the finger extensor mechanism. (a) Training set errors. (b) Cross validation errors. Progression of the error values are depicted as the number of data sets are introduced for model evolution. Error values are depicted for five executions for the topologic and parametric inference using informative tests. Bars represent standard errors. Solid lines correspond to the mean error when informative data is employed in topological and parametric inference of the target. Dotted lines show mean errors when sequential random data sets are used (error bars depicted for 20 executions). Dashed lines represent mean errors (error bars depicted for 20 executions) when only parametric evolution is performed using the basic topology where in only 6 strings connect all accessible (input and output) ports and no other interconnection is allowed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s002">Fig. S2 d</xref>). At the end of the inference process, the mean <italic>cross validation</italic> error when models are topologically inferred using informative tests is 6.8%, better (by about 3%) than parametric-only inference with informative tests and improved (by about 7%) compared to the topological inference with random tests. The topology chosen for parametric-only inference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s002">Fig. S2 d</xref>) comprises most components of the Winslow's Rhombus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>) except for the lateral offshoots and transverse bands. We observe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4e</xref> that some inferred models do resemble the Winslow's Rhombus structurally. The low difference (3%) in the mean <italic>cross validation</italic> errors suggests that the disparity between the topologically and parametrically inferred models and the parametric-only inferred models (both using informative tests) is minor but essentially topologic (we reckon this could be because of the absence of the lateral offshoots in the all-in-all topology in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s002">Fig. S2d</xref>). The difference of 7% in (b) between models inferred using informative and random tests is however, relatively significant and is expected to be larger with further improvements in the inference process (see discussion). As observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Schmidt1">[56]</xref>, the margin gained with the estimation-exploration algorithm grows with the complexity of the problem. Additionally, one may require more number of trials (which will add to the temporal and computational cost) to achieve a certain accuracy. With the estimation-exploration algorithm, a given accuracy can be achieved faster.</p>

        <p>Therefore, we chose models (i) and (iv) from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4</xref> to further investigate the functional contribution of each member string. We eliminate one string at a time from each network and re-evaluate the <italic>e_cross</italic> errors. For model (i), that is shown in panel (a) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, the comparison of <italic>e_cross</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g007">Fig. 7 (b)</xref>) reveals that the intact model invariably yields the lowest <italic>e_cross </italic>error, demonstrating that all member strings in its topology are functionally relevant. In contrast, <italic>e_cross</italic> errors are lower (strings 22 and 24 removed) or the same (strings 7 and 10 removed) when several member strings are removed from model (iv) (shown in panel (d) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). The <italic>e_cross</italic> error decreases when member strings 22 and 24, which are in series and connect the grounded nodes, are removed. Such a connection does not exist in model (i) or the target network <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4c/d</xref>, which suggests they are not necessary and in fact only serve to bias the loading on the grounded nodes and thus pollute the reaction forces. In contrast, the <italic>e_cross </italic>error remains unchanged when member strings that form the right lateral offshoot (member strings 7 and 10 connected in series) are removed. Further visual inspection of model (iv) indicates that these member strings barely get taut when the model is actuated with the informative tests used during its inference. This suggests that member strings 7 and 10 are not functionally necessary, but do not negatively affect the fitness of the network for the loading tested.</p>

(d) Each string member is removed one at a time from model (iv) and cross validation errors are computed. On removal of strings 22 or 24, the error decreases. This suggests that connection between middle and distal slips should be absent. Removing string 7 or 10 from the model in (c) does not alter the cross validation error from that of the intact model. This is because these strings do not get taut when cross validating load sets are used. Visual inspection further shows that these strings barely get taut when the model is actuated with the informative load sets used for its evolution. This suggests that strings 7 and 10 do not participate in the network which explains why the training set error for this model is larger (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002751-t002">Table 2</xref>) compared to that of model (i) in (a).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first functional inference of a complex anatomical structure using sparse experimentation. Without reverting to exploratory dissection (which is disruptive) or structural imaging (which is expensive and not necessarily informative of mechanical interactions under loading), we infer functional structure of a biological tendinous network by co-evolving the models with informative tests. We began by validating and calibrating our novel methodology using two synthetic Latex target networks, and then applied our method to the real-world problem of inference of the functional structure of the tendinous extensor mechanism tissue excised from a cadaver hand. Notwithstanding (i) the specific optimization procedure (we used a stochastic hill climber search, which are hotly debated by its supporters and retractors, but any other optimization that is suitable to the problem at hand can be used), or (ii) our current inability to run the estimation-exploration algorithm real time (we collected the experimental data for the Latex and tendinous networks in dedicated experimental sessions—and ran the algorithm off-line using those data sets), our results clearly illuminate and demonstrate several important features and concepts about this approach. These include (i) the powerful utility of a novel, general purpose predator-prey estimation-exploration algorithm for topologic and parametric inference of physical systems, and (ii) the particular functional characteristic of our test system: the extensor mechanism of the fingers whose structure and function have been debated since at least the 16<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
      <p>In this first application of the predator-prey estimation-exploration algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Bongard1">[33]</xref> for topologic and parametric inference toactual biological (cadaveric) physical systems, we demonstrate that informative tests perform better than random tests. This is critical when limited to a finite number of tests of the physical specimen, which in this case is costly and can damage the specimen by excessive testing. We define the most informative tests as those that, in simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), are evolved to maximize disagreement among the population of current models. We introduce these tests sequentially in that the population of models evolved explains the informative data available up to that point in time. We show that a small number of informative physical tests produce input-output data sets that significantly lower the cross-validation error of the resulting models. Thus, the predator-prey competition carried out in simulation findsthe most informative tests. These tests, even with minor deviations from those predicted, provide significantly useful experimental data to guide the development of the next generation of models.</p>
      <p>We remark that, for the tendinous specimen, we needed to extract the experimental data within the first 8 hours of its excision to avoid structural and/or material degradation. Evolving the models with the most informative tests, as predicted in simulation in stage III of the inference process, was not possible with the available computational resources; the overall inference process took much more than 8 hours. Rather, we sought to access the closest possible tests that were informative, if not the most informative, from the experiments performed a priori. We further remark that for both, synthetic and biological networks, generating the most informative test was not possible with the experimental setup used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g003">Figs. 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">4</xref>) as it required the input tensions to be achieved by pulling on the tethers manually. As the inputs were strongly interrelated, a slight manipulation of an input tether disturbed the tensions in the others. Achieving the accuracy of the recommended most informative test required much effort and was cumbersome. There were discrepancies (noise and/or measurement errors) even when efforts were made to load the network(s) with the most informative tests. While structural/material degradation was not a concern with the synthetic networks of known topologies, inference of these was performed with informative tests to verify if the latter, even when they not being the most informative, can evolve models to adequately resemble the target in structure and/or function. We show in all three cases (synthetic and biological targets) that informative tests do infer the networks, known or hidden, better than the random tests. This work is, therefore, a successful proof of concept that does demonstrate the utility of our approach and produces results that are valuable to the field of functional inference in biological systems. Based on our earlier work in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-ValeroCuevas3">[32]</xref> where we infer the Winslow's Rhombus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>) in simulation using the most informative force-displacement data, and supporting information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s001">Fig. S1 c</xref>) where we infer the structure of the ‘aWR’ and ‘A’ networks in simulation but using only the most informative force data, we further expect that the most informative tests will perform better than the informative ones once better computational resources and experimental setups are available to make the overall inference process more efficient.</p>
      <p>We also show that simultaneous topological and parametric inference yields better results than the parametric inference alone. Most system identification for biomechanical models is limited to parametric inference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-An1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Delp1">[40]</xref>—wherein the structure or topology of the system is chosen a priori based on expert knowledge, and parameter values are tuned to fit the experimental data. Very few studies, (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-ValeroCuevas5">[41]</xref>) have performed simultaneous inference of both the topology and parameters of anatomical systems. We show that in our experiments on synthetic and biological physical systems, the tuning of string parameters in networks with fixed topology is insufficient to minimize cross-validation errors. Importantly, cross-validation errors are a better estimate of model accuracy and generalizability because they evaluate fitness with respect to input-output data sets that were not used to train the model in the first place.</p>
      <p>A clear distinction needs to be made between topology and parameter values. Models are assembled by exploring the space of possible combinations of building blocks (in this case, strings and nodes). A specific model topology is a specific connectivity map among a specific set of building blocks (i.e., string connectivity). The model parameters are the individual properties of each building block (i.e., length of strings). In practice, however, it is necessary to “parameterize” the topology to be able to encode (i.e., represent) it so that an algorithm can search the topological space. In our case, we defined our primordial mesh of strings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>) and parameterized different topologies by allowing strings to become long enough to, in practice, “disappear” because they can no longer carry tension. While this methodological distinction between topology and parameter values may be considered semantic—and therefore debatable—in practice such implementations can and do produce models with distinctively different physical structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Bongard1">[33]</xref>. In our case, we evolve populations of string networks with patently different number and connectivity among load-carrying strings—which assume distinct anatomical structures.</p>
      <p>On the methodological side, several issues are key to accurate inference. These include accurate assumptions pertaining to (a) the material properties and the strain-deformation models, (b) informative experiments capturing full network functionality and interaction conditions, (c) automated experimental setup, (d) the primordial connectivity representation, and (e) the choice of the algorithm used for model evolution. If inappropriate assumptions are used, the experimental data may not be within the set of predictions of any feasible model topology or parameter values, or the candidate tests generated by the inference process may not be informative.</p>
      <p>The inference of the extensor mechanism was also performed assuming constant elastic modulus (1 GPa) as opposed to nonlinear stress-strain relationship for tendons used from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Zajac1">[34]</xref> to evolve the models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4</xref>. The <italic>e_cross </italic>errors of the resulting models were about 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g008">Fig. 8</xref>), much higher than the <italic>e_cross</italic> errors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002751-t002">Table 2</xref>) for the models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4</xref>. Inaccurate assumptions for the tendon material properties led to the evolution of models whose functionality was not in agreement with that of the target extensor mechanism. Alternatively, while it is possible to evolve the material properties as well along with the models, approximating the form and range of the stress-strain relation (e.g., exponential, transcendental, linear) may be difficult. Use of a different set of material properties can lead to either (i) erroneous structural and parametric predictions with high <italic>e-training</italic> or <italic>e_cross </italic>errors for the models, or (ii) an alternate set of functionally similar models that explain the network functionality reasonably well.</p>

Models may also be evolved using the Green-Lagrange large-strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Crisfield1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Bathe1">[36]</xref> theory. In case of the tendinous tissue, the anatomical extensor mechanism did not exhibit significant deformationand thus, the small-strain assumption was suitable.</p>
      <p>We inferred the hand extensor mechanism by considering only a part of its overall functionality. We were limited to testing the anatomical specimen as it lay flat on a hydrated surface, as opposed to wrapped over finger joints. Even so, all string modules, as described in the classical Winslow's model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4 (a)</xref>), were nearly captured in some models.</p>
      <p>To reproduce the most informative tests recommended by Stage III of the estimation exploration algorithm, the setup should be fully automated and computer-controlled. Independent motors should be mounted with the respective input tethers wrapped tightly around them to control the tensions. In addition to using digital force scales, force sensors (e.g., strain gages) should also be used to control the motor rotations via a feedback loop. Achieving the most informative test with the automated setup (as opposed to manual) will be less painstaking and more accurate.</p>
      <p>The Latex and biological specimens are inferred using the string model representations shown in Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s002">Fig. S2</xref>. Both the number and interconnectivity between the strings in that primordial network can influence model evolution. Here, we allow the strings to be both overlapping and tightly connected (small circles in meshes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). This initial mesh is chosen to facilitate the model(s) inferred from the finger extensor mechanism to assume the form of Winslow's Rhombus. A primordial mesh with no overlapping strings can yield a different set of models. Factually, however, the extensor mechanism is a sheath of collagen fibers. Using two-dimensional parameterizations (e.g., rectangular/hexagonal cells to represent the primordial mesh) canhelp yield more topologically diverse models.</p>
      <p>All factors mentioned above, and the noise involved in experimental data influence the landscape of the objective function. In view of this, functionally similar but topologically and parametrically diverse models obtained through the Random Mutation Hill Climber (RMHC, a variant of Genetic Algorithm that employs only mutation) could all be local optima existing very close to the global one in the design space. Due to the noise present in the data, it is not expected for a global optimum to have significantly lower <italic>e_training</italic> and <italic>e_cross</italic> errors. As an aside, we show that the RMHC is capable of finding a close to global optimum for smooth functions (see supporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), even when the design space is infested with numerous local optima, if adequate computational resources are employed. We also show that alternative, classical optimization algorithms often converge to a local minimum. Further, they will not be able to negotiate the discontinuities in the design space such as those in our problem which correspond to cases wherein nonlinear analyses do not converge for candidate models.</p>
      <p>One of the goals was to confirm whether the Winslow's Rhombus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4 a</xref>) is an accurate string representation of the hand extensor mechanism. On performing parametric only fitting with this representation (but without transverse bands) as the primordial mesh and informative data generated using the predator-prey approach, we found that the mean <italic>e_training</italic> and <italic>e_cross </italic>errors (supporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s004">Fig. S4</xref>) were comparable to those of the topologically and parametrically inferred models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4 (e)</xref>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g006">Fig. 6</xref>. This suggests that the Winslow's Rhombus could belong to the same family as these functionally similar models. As detailed later, additional information may be necessary to extract a true global model.</p>
      <p>The predator-prey approach is an optimal experiment design (OED) method wherein through competition, most informative tests (optimal sample points) are generated to evolve the best models that explain these tests. However, this approach is unlike other OED methods, e.g., D-optimal, L-optimal and minimax-optimal wherein model parameters (or their functions) are determined by minimizing, for instance, generalized variance. In Bayesian type OEDs, prior information on model parameters is assumed.</p>
      <p>With regard to the study of complex biomechanical structures by anatomists, biomechanists and biologists, most previous work has naturally focused on inferring the structure of the tendinous networks via dissection or imaging. In contrast, we interrogate biological networks through a non-invasive computational machine learning procedure. Invasive techniques may damage the tissue, while imaging methods may miss critical functional interactions (e.g., seen only under specific loading conditions). Our non-destructive inference method yields both topological and parametric information. For example, the specific number and lengths of the tendinous members of the extensor mechanism affect the distribution of tension to the finger joints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Gonzalez1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-ValeroCuevas5">[41]</xref>. We suggested before that the interpretation by Zancolli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Zancolli1">[17]</xref> and Garcia-Elias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-GarciaElias1">[18]</xref> of the hand extensor mechanism as Winslow's Rhombus is partly correct. We also illustrated that functionally similar models that have different string connectivity can exist to explain the functionality of the extensor mechanism. We reckon that additional information may be necessary to identify the details of structurally diverse models that exhibit similar functionality.</p>
      <p>This raises the important issues of uniqueness and observability, which are central to computational model inference—and critical in the context of biological populations that naturally exhibit anatomical variability. Some 2D sub-topologies can be equivalent to each other under certain parameter and loading sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-ValeroCuevas3">[32]</xref>. The load transfer patterns in these substructures can be similar despite their structural diversity. Due to these equivalencies, some substructures in a model can be transformed into one another resulting in a number of similar models. Consequently, multiple local optima as opposed to single global optimum may exist in the design space.</p>
      <p>From the computational perspective, our use of populations of models forrandom mutation based hill climber search is very much conducive to the maintenance of model diversity (i.e., alternative hypotheses) to understand the uniqueness and observability of model topologies. This allows our search in this large dimensional space to proceed along multiple alternative paths that do not favor any particular local minimum. In all of our results with synthetic or anatomical networks, we find families of solutions: multiple different, yet functionally similar, topologies. This suggests that (i) additional data are necessary to further constrain the search, (ii) that different functional domains (such as deformation during finger flexion) are necessary to make the differences across various models observable, or (iii) that there are indeed functionally similar implementations for the domain of behavior that we studied (load transmission in this case). The latter idea is quite intriguing from the evolutionary perspective as it agrees with the well-documented natural variability in the gross anatomical structure of the extensor mechanism across humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Gonzalez1">[19]</xref>. It suggests that, for the types of anatomical structures achievable with collagen fibers, anatomical variability in human population may not be functionally detrimental, and may in fact enable a wider variety of adaptations in future generations. Thus, the popular representation of Winslow's Rhombus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002751-g004">Fig. 4</xref> (a)) may no longer be considered a uniquely valid or accurate representation of the extensor mechanism. Furthermore, we observe that only a few models inferred from the human extensor mechanism concur with its classical description. While Winslow's anatomy book [16, pub. 1732] has no illustrations, the first graphical string model depiction of the extensor mechanism is by Zancolli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Zancolli1">[17]</xref> and An et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-An1">[38]</xref> wherein the tendinous network is suggested to have crossover tendons that slide past each other. In most models obtained with our experimental loading conditions, sliding crossover tendons are seldom observed and they do not grant particularly higher fitness—even though the primordial mesh was specifically designed to allow for them. In our detailed dissections of the extensor mechanism as well, crossover tendons were not clearly and independently observed.</p>
      <p>From the clinical perspective, damage to this network can cause severe dysfunction of manipulation (e.g., mallet finger, swan-neck or boutonnière deformity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Brzezienski1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Doyle1">[48]</xref>), which can significantly affect a person's quality of life. Both non-operative and surgical methods [49 for a brief overview, 50–55] are reported following which subjects undergo rigorous, rehabilitative tendon gliding exercises <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002751-Combs1">[49]</xref>. Through accurate structural and parametric prediction of the target biological network with the aim to determine sources of injuries and/or deformities specific to the patients, or the classification of patients into structurally/functionally similar subgroups, our methods and results can help plan surgical/corrective strategies more effectively (e.g., multiple trial-and-error procedures can be avoided) requiring less rigorous and more cost effective rehabilitative follow-ups. By allowing the inference of functional interactions in musculoskeletal systems, they are also relevant to the understanding of the functional adaptations that led to the evolution of the modern human hand and body.</p>

          <p>We establish here the information mode – whether force or motion (distances between the accessible ports) data, or both will be required through a data set for inferring the functionality and physical manifestation of the target network. We illustrate by inferring two ‘simulated’ targets, the ‘A’ network and a minor adaptation of the Winslow's Rhombus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s001">Fig. S1</xref> a, b), that the use of force information alone will be inadequate. We perform model evolution using a sequence of the informative data sets generated using the inference procedure described in the paper. The two evolved ‘A’ models and that representing the Winslow's rhombus are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002751.s001">Fig. S1</xref> (c) top, bottom. Only the force information is employed to minimize the training set error for model synthesis. Through visual comparison, we observe that even when the respective topologies are captured, there exist significant discrepancies in distances between the accessible ports when comparing the models with their respective targets. Maintaining these distances is an essential functional requirement for which reason, it is important to record, compare and minimize the differences in the respective inter-nodal distances as well when evolving the models. (a)–(b) Two simulated target networks (a: the ‘A’ target; b: adaptation of the Winslow's rhombus) employed to illustrate that the experimental data containing the force information alone is not adequate for accurate topological/parametric inference. (top) two models inferred from the ‘A’ target data (15 informative force data sets were used) and (bottom) model inferred through simulated experiments from the adapted Winslow's target network (20 informative force data sets were used). The models evolved using the informative data are topologically very similar to the respective targets. By using only the force information, the inter-nodal distances between the actuation and fixed (shown as squares) ports are not captured from the targets.</p>
