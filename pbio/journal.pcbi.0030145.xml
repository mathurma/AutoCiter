A human-transmissible avian influenza virus is expected to cause clusters of infections in humans living in close contact. Therefore, epidemiological analysis of infection clusters in human households is of key importance. Infection clusters may arise from transmission events from (i) the animal reservoir, (ii) humans who were infected by animals (primary human-to-human transmission), or (iii) humans who were infected by humans (secondary human-to-human transmission). Here we propose a method of analysing household infection data to detect changes in the transmissibility of avian influenza viruses in humans at an early stage. The method is applied to an outbreak of H7N7 avian influenza virus in The Netherlands that was the cause of more than 30 human-to-human transmission events. The analyses indicate that secondary human-to-human transmission is plausible for the Dutch household infection data. Based on the estimates of the within-household transmission parameters, we evaluate the effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis, and conclude that it is unlikely that all household infections can be prevented with current antiviral drugs. We discuss the applicability of our method for the detection of emerging human-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses in particular, and for the analysis of within-household infection data in general.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Recent outbreaks of emerging diseases such as SARS and H5N1 avian influenza have underlined the fact that animal pathogens may acquire the ability to spread efficiently in humans. Monitoring the transmissibility of pathogens from the animal reservoir in humans is key for early detection of epidemic spread, and for effective control. Here we have used data from a small but well-defined study of H7N7 avian influenza virus transmission in human households to estimate the transmissibility of H7N7 avian influenza in humans living in close contact. The analyses make use of household final size data (i.e., the number of individuals in the household who are ultimately infected), which, for many pathogens, are easily collected. For the H7N7 data, the analyses indicate that the transmission chain in humans may well have extended beyond the first generation of infections in humans, and that less than half of the household infections could have been prevented by antiviral prophylaxis. Our method of analysis provides a rapid and generally applicable tool that can be used to monitor emerging human transmissibility of pathogens from the animal reservoir.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>van Boven M, Koopmans M, Du Ry van Beest Holle M, Meijer A, Klinkenberg D, et al.

Although these infections from the animal reservoir continue to accumulate, the virus does not seem to spread extensively among humans. Nevertheless, a fear is that these human infections may ultimately spark an influenza pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b009">9</xref>]. Indeed, recent clusters of infections in human households hint at the possibility of virus transmission from humans who were infected by poultry to their household contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b011">11</xref>]. These suggestions are strengthened by the observation of mutations in recent H5N1 viruses that seem to predispose the virus for more efficient transmission in mammals, including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b016">16</xref>] (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b018">18</xref>]).</p><p>It is likely that a virus with pandemic potential will present itself initially through an increase in the number of infections in humans who have been in close contact with the case infected by animals. Therefore, rapid detection and control of clusters of infections is of key importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b009">9</xref>]. Such clusters may result from (i) multiple introductions from the animal reservoir (zoonotic transmission), (ii) multiple transmission events from humans who were infected by animals (primary human-to-human transmission), or (iii) multiple transmission events from humans who were themselves infected by humans (secondary human-to-human transmission). Obviously, evidence for (iii) is the most worrisome as it indicates that the virus has acquired the ability to spread efficiently in humans.</p><p>It is often thought that pathogens from the animal reservoir that have made the jump to a new host species are usually not (yet) well-adapted for sustained transmission in the new host, and that transmissibility in a new species will gradually increase over time by the process of adaptation by means of natural selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b023">23</xref>]. Interestingly, however, in the case of H5N1 avian influenza in humans, the evidence so far does not seem to fit this prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b024">24</xref>]. Mechanisms that could be responsible for the lack of efficient secondary human-to-human transmission could be due to a dose effect whereby humans infected by animals receive a higher infection dose than humans infected by humans, or to behavioural changes after infection that limit spread of the virus after it has been detected.</p><p>In this paper we develop a method to detect and quantify different routes of virus transmission in a household setting. Our main aim is to investigate whether within-household pathogen transmission has been restricted to transmission from the primary infected individual or whether there is evidence that the transmission chain has extended beyond the first generation of human-to-human infections. Our analyses are based on theoretical developments on the distribution of the final size of an epidemic in finite populations, which allow construction of flexible methods to analyse within-household transmission chains.</p><p>We apply the method to a recent study of within-household transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the H7N7 subtype that caused a large epidemic in poultry in The Netherlands in 2003. Shortly after the detection of virus circulation, the Dutch authorities undertook an aggressive control strategy that consisted of an animal movement ban in the affected regions, tracing and screening suspected flocks, and culling of infected and contiguous flocks. In all, a total of 255 flocks became infected during a period of nine weeks, and more than 30 million birds were culled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b026">26</xref>]. Subsequent studies of poultry workers revealed that at least 86 infections from the animal reservoir to humans had taken place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b029">29</xref>]. In addition, more than 30 household contacts of the infected poultry workers who had not been in direct contact with poultry were reported positive. These reports indicate that human-to-human transmission did occur from individuals infected from the animal reservoir.</p><p>Here we analyse data of the transmission chains in 24 households that led to 33 human-to-human transmission events, measuring the extent of onward transmission from humans who were infected by humans (i.e., secondary human-to-human transmission). We complement the statistical analyses by systematic (post-hoc) power analyses to obtain insight into the study size needed to be able to find significant secondary human-to-human transmission, given that it is present.</p><p>Although we have applied the method to a specific dataset, we believe that our method is of general interest as it enables rapid estimation of within-household transmission rates based on data that are easily gathered for most infectious diseases. For instance, our method of analysis is not restricted to the analysis of emerging pandemic influenza, but it can just as well be used to estimate different routes of within-household transmission rates of human influenza A viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b032">32</xref>] and, importantly, to assess the potential effectiveness of control measures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Data</title><p>Based on evidence of human-to-human transmission of H7N7 avian influenza virus that was the cause of the outbreak among poultry in The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b027">27</xref>], a retrospective cohort study was undertaken to determine the extent of human-to-human transmission in households of infected poultry workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b029">29</xref>]. Briefly, the families of 63 of 86 poultry workers who were found positive agreed to participate in the study. Of these, 39 households were excluded because direct contact of the household members with infected birds could not be ruled out. Our dataset thus contained 24 households with a single confirmed H7N7 infected poultry worker. There were no indications of an age bias or sex bias in our study population, and the distribution of household sizes in our study was not untypical for the Dutch population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b029">29</xref>].

In a density-dependent model, the number of contacts per unit of time is proportional to the number of individuals. Hence, in a frequency-dependent model, the transmission rate in a household of two individuals of which one is infectious equals the transmission rate in a household of four of which two are infectious.

Although the size of the study is relatively small, it is the most detailed investigation of household transmission of avian influenza virus thus far and therefore forms a good starting point to evaluate methods aimed at quantifying human-to-human transmission of avian influenza viruses. Households in which additional bird-to-human transmission could not be ruled out were excluded in order to be able to focus solely on different routes of human-to-human transmission. The methods, however, are also applicable to the situation where the source of the human infections (animal or human) is not known.</p><p>The ability of our method to distinguish between primary and secondary human-to-human transmission is determined by the distribution of the final size within households. If secondary human-to-human transmission is efficient (i.e., such that it can lead to a sustained chain of infections in sufficiently large populations of susceptibles), epidemiological theory informs that the final size distribution is expected to be bimodal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b038">38</xref>], while if there is no or little secondary human-to-human transmission the final size distribution is expected to remain unimodal (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030145-sd001">Text S1</xref> for details). As the power analyses have shown, our method works best for intermediate transmission rates, since then the difference between scenarios with reproduction numbers smaller and higher than 1 is most pronounced. This also explains the difference in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030145-g003">Figure 3</xref> between the models, assuming a fixed or exponentially distributed infectious period, as the probability of a minor outbreak is, for a fixed value of the reproduction number, smaller if the infectious period is of fixed duration than if it is exponentially distributed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b034">34</xref>]. Given these results, it would be interesting to know the actual distribution of the infectious period of avian influenza viruses in humans. Unfortunately, for avian influenza virus infections in humans, very little is known about the duration and the distribution of the duration of the infectious period. For human influenza viruses, more is known about the duration of the infectious period. For instance, a detailed analysis of H3N2 human influenza virus data indicated that the mean infectious period was about four days, with very little variation around the mean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b044">44</xref>]. At present, however, it is unclear if and how these results of human-adapted strains can be translated to strains that are not (yet) adapted for transmission among humans.</p><p>Our post-hoc power analyses furthermore indicate that if secondary human-to-human transmission is fairly inefficient (i.e., if β*<sub>22</sub> is small enough so that no prolonged infection chain is possible in a large population of susceptibles), it can still be detected using fairly small studies that contain a few dozens of households (e.g., <italic>n</italic> = 96 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030145-g002">Figure 2</xref>). If, however, secondary human-to-human transmission is very inefficient, larger study sizes are needed, probably containing several hundreds of households, to unequivocally demonstrate the existence of secondary human-to-human transmission. In other words, our method is well-suited to detect animal pathogens that are on the verge of obtaining the ability for continued spread in humans.</p><p>Our general power analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030145-g003">Figure 3</xref> also have shown that our model is able to detect efficient secondary human-to-human transmission with very small study sizes (e.g., <italic>n</italic> = 24 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030145-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Perhaps surprisingly, the method works best when transmission rates are intermediate, because then the difference between models that include or exclude secondary human-to-human transmission is most pronounced. It would be interesting to investigate whether these types of phenomena are also observed in other and more general two-type epidemic models for the spread of pathogens within households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b023">23</xref>].</p><p>For the Dutch outbreak, our results show that there is some but no conclusive evidence of secondary human-to-human virus transmission. In fact, the combined support for the four models that exclude secondary human-to-human transmission (models 1A–1D) is 39.8%, while the combined support for the eight models that do include secondary human-to-human transmission (models 2A–2D and 3A–3D) is only 60.2% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030145-st001">Table S1</xref>). In addition, the model with the highest individual support (model 1B) has a support of 29.9% and does not include secondary transmission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030145-st001">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, if both transmission parameters are estimated separately (models 3A–3D), the estimates of secondary human-to-human transmission are consistently much lower than the estimates of primary human-to-human transmission. These results suggest that humans infected by animals transmit the virus fairly efficiently to other humans, but that humans infected by other humans do not efficiently pass the virus on to other humans.</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that the observed difference between primary and secondary human-to-human transmission is due to a dose effect, i.e., that humans infected by humans had been infected with a lower number of virus particles than humans who were infected by poultry. Unfortunately, independent evidence of the “degree of infection” that could corroborate this suggestion is lacking. An alternative explanation that could conceivably explain the observed difference between primary and secondary human-to-human transmission would involve changes in behavior whereby people become more careful in preventing risky contacts after the index case shows signs of illness. Again, evidence supporting or against this hypothesis is lacking.</p><p>Often, it is assumed that the transmissibility of an emerging pathogen will increase as more individuals are infected, because it allows the pathogen to adapt to the new host species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b020">20</xref>]. However, if anything, our analyses have shown that secondary human-to-human transmission is less efficient than primary human-to-human transmission, in contrast with conventional wisdom. A possibility that is invariably overlooked is that within-host selection of avian influenza viruses in human hosts does not select for higher but rather for lower transmissibility. Theoretical studies focusing on evolution of the dispersal rate in a metapopulation context indicate that this is a theoretical possibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b045">45</xref>]. Empirical studies with ferrets focusing on the transmissibility of H5N1 avian influenza viruses have begun to unravel the evolutionary pathways of these viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b018">18</xref>], and indicate that evolutionary adaptation in mammals is a multifaceted process that is unlikely to lead to simple maximization of the transmission rate.</p><p>Our analyses indicate that the benefit of giving antiviral drugs to household members of an infected individual in terms of reducing the number of infections would have been modest. In fact, for the study population of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030145-t001">Table 1</xref>, the results show that the number of household infections could have been decreased from more than 30 to 22–25 if antiviral drugs are moderately effective, and to 12–18 if antiviral drugs are more effective. This is due to the fact that antiviral drugs provide only partial protection against infection and shedding, while the estimate of the transmission rate of primary human-to-human transmission is relatively high. If the baseline transmission parameters are decreased, the potential effectiveness of antiviral treatment increases (unpublished data), in line with the observation that control measures usually are most effective whenever the basic reproduction number is close to 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b043">43</xref>]. Alternatively, if the baseline transmission parameters are increased, the effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis decreases.</p><p>Although our analyses suggest that antiviral drugs are only moderately effective in reducing the number of household infections, we do not intend to suggest that antiviral drug treatment should or should not be used as prophylaxis against avian influenza viruses. In fact, it may well be that even though prophylactic antiviral drug treatment is only moderately effective in preventing the number of human infections, it may still be quite effective in reducing the disease symptoms of individuals who are infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b041">41</xref>]. On the other hand, it is also possible that by reducing the disease symptoms, individuals who are infected will in effect be <italic>more</italic> infectious because they are less likely to remain bedridden. Studies quantifying the relation between disease and infectiousness (i.e., viral titers in the upper respiratory tract) are needed to answer this question.</p><p>Finally, with the number of H5N1 infections in humans accumulating at a steady pace, it is important to keep track of the ability of this virus to enhance its transmissibility in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030145-b007">7</xref>]. At present, however, there is still a conspicuous lack of data pertaining to the possibility of human-to-human spread of H5N1 viruses. In our opinion, detailed investigations of infected individuals, as well as tracing and investigation of the individuals in close contact with a confirmed case, should become an integral part of the handling of each human H5N1 infection.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030145-st001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030145.st001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Overview of Parameter Estimates for the Models Described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref></title><p>(40 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030145-st002" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030145.st002" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S2</label><caption><title>Overview of Parameter Estimates in Case of an Imperfect Serological Test</title><p>(47 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030145-st003" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030145.st003" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S3</label><caption><title>Overview of Parameter Estimates in the Case That Two Outlier Households Are Excluded from the Analyses</title><p>(45 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030145-st004" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030145.st004" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S4</label><caption><title>Overview of the Estimated Effectiveness of Antiviral Prophylaxis in Households of Size Four and Eight People</title><p>(47 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030145-sd001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030145.sd001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Text S1</label><caption><title>Supplementary Methods</title><p>(66 KB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The research of MvB, DK, CAD, and JAPH was supported by the European Union Sixth Framework Program for research for policy support (SARSTRANS) (contract SP22-CT-2004–511066).
