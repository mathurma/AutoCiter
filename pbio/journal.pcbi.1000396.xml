                <p>T cell populations are regulated both by signals specific to the T-cell receptor
                    (TCR) and by signals and resources, such as cytokines and space, that act
                    independently of TCR specificity. Although it has been demonstrated that
                    disruption of either of these pathways has a profound effect on T-cell
                    development, we do not yet have an understanding of the dynamical interactions
                    of these pathways in their joint shaping of the T cell repertoire. Complete
                    DiGeorge Anomaly is a developmental abnormality that results in the failure of
                    the thymus to develop, absence of T cells, and profound immune deficiency. After
                    receiving thymic tissue grafts, patients suffering from DiGeorge anomaly develop
                    T cells derived from their own precursors but matured in the donor tissue. We
                    followed three DiGeorge patients after thymus transplantation to utilize the
                    remarkable opportunity these subjects provide to elucidate human T-cell
                    developmental regulation. Our goal is the determination of the respective roles
                    of TCR-specific vs. TCR-nonspecific regulatory signals in the growth of these
                    emerging T-cell populations. During the course of the study, we measured
                    peripheral blood T-cell concentrations, TCR<italic>β</italic> V
                    gene-segment usage and CDR3-length spectratypes over two years or more for each
                    of the subjects. We find, through statistical analysis based on a novel
                    stochastic population-dynamic T-cell model, that the carrying capacity
                    corresponding to TCR-specific resources is approximately 1000-fold larger than
                    that of TCR-nonspecific resources, implying that the size of the peripheral
                    T-cell pool at steady state is determined almost entirely by TCR-nonspecific
                    mechanisms. Nevertheless, the diversity of the TCR repertoire depends crucially
                    on TCR-specific regulation. The estimated strength of this TCR-specific
                    regulation is sufficient to ensure rapid establishment of TCR repertoire
                    diversity in the early phase of T cell population growth, and to maintain TCR
                    repertoire diversity in the face of substantial clonal expansion-induced
                    perturbation from the steady state.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Protective adaptive immunity depends crucially on the enormous diversity of the
                    T-cell receptor repertoire, the antigen receptors expressed collectively on
                    T-cell populations. T cells develop from T-cell precursors that originate in the
                    bone marrow and migrate to the thymus, where their T cell receptors are
                    constructed stochastically, and tested for autoreactivity against a host of self
                    antigens. Complete DiGeorge anomaly is a rare congenital disease in which the
                    thymus fails to develop, blocking all T cell development and causing profound
                    immunodeficiency. Thymus transplantation, performed in the first two post-natal
                    years, allows the patient's own T cell precursors to develop in the
                    engrafted thymus tissue into normal, functioning T cells. In addition to saving
                    patients' lives, this procedure provides an extraordinary opportunity
                    to study the <italic>de novo</italic> development of human T cell populations.
                    We have developed a mathematical model to aid in the statistical analysis of the
                    precious data from these patients. In addition to helping elucidate the means by
                    which the size and diversity of T cell populations are jointly regulated, the
                    insights gained from this study hold promise for the development of therapies to
                    promote immune recovery after transplantation.</p>

            <p>An essential characteristic of T lymphocytes is their ability, as a population, to
                recognize an enormous number of peptide antigens. This capability is essential to
                the function of the adaptive immune system and is attributable to the diversity of
                the T-cell receptors (TCR) they express. This diversity in turn comes about through
                the stochastic assembly of TCR from genomic “libraries” of gene
                segments for the TCR alpha and beta chains, the two polypeptides that together make
                up the most common form of the TCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Alt1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Garcia1">[3]</xref>. This rearrangement
                process takes place in the thymus and is the ultimate source of TCR repertoire
                diversity, though many other forces shape the raw materials thus provided <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Bousso1">[4]</xref>. It is
                with these other forces that we are concerned in this study.</p>
            <p>The peripheral T-cell population is maintained at a constant size in spite of
                substantial, continual turnover, ongoing thymic production, and clonal expansion in
                response to immunological challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Jameson1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Marleau1">[8]</xref>.
                Although a detailed understanding of T-cell homeostasis is not yet complete, it is
                clear that the maintenance of T cell population size results from the interplay of
                several mechanisms acting both to enhance population growth at low population
                density and to limit population growth at high population density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Marrack1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Tat1">[10]</xref>. In a
                healthy individual, and in the absence of overt immune activation, the rate of T
                cell division in the periphery is small and is regulated through competition for
                resources including growth signals. In a T cell-deficient host, however, so-called
                lymphopenia-induced proliferation rapidly restores the system to steady-state
                numbers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Marleau1">[8]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Diverse lines of investigation imply that signals delivered, and resources provided,
                through both TCR-specific and TCR-nonspecific channels are essential for the
                establishment and maintenance of the size and diversity of T cell populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Tanchot1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Freitas1">[12]</xref>.
                Experiments performed thus far have been performed in non-human animals and
                represent limiting cases in which one or more of these signals or resources is
                entirely eliminated. We are interested in understanding the phenomena in humans and
                in a more natural setting, in which regulation via both TCR-specific and
                TCR-non-specific mechanisms are intact and in their interplay jointly determine the
                size of the T cell population and the diversity of the TCR repertoire.</p>
            <p>Our intent in this paper is to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to expansion and
                diversification of the TCR repertoire in a recovering T-cell-deficient host: in our
                case, a complete DiGeorge subject that has received an unrelated, unmatched thymus
                transplant. After transplantation, host T-cell precursors migrate from the bone
                marrow to the donor thymus where they develop via thymopoiesis into host T cells
                that then emigrate into the peripheral blood. Here, T cells have the capacity to
                undergo spontaneous clonal expansion, thus leading to restoration of the peripheral
                T-cell pool. The expansion continues until a steady state is reached. Throughout
                this process, selective pressure for survival emerges among and within the clones
                through competition for stimulatory signals.</p>
            <sec id="s1a">
                <title>T Cell Homeostasis</title>
                <p>The steady state T-cell population size arises in the balance among several
                    phenomena, including the rapid and extensive expansion of rare clones through
                    activation-induced peripheral division and their subsequent contraction (which
                    constitute, in part, the T-cell immune response) and the relatively slow
                    turnover of a diverse pool of naive cells through continuous thymic emigration
                    and cell death. The specific memory T cells that arise as the result of clonal
                    expansion appear to be regulated largely independently of the naive cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Tanchot1">[11]</xref>. T
                    cells arising through lymphopenia-induced proliferation acquire markers that
                    ordinarily indicate a memory phenotype and may be regulated as memory cells,
                    though this hypothesis has not been definitively tested.</p>
                <p>Both the size and diversity of peripheral T cell populations are controlled
                    through competition for limiting resources. (In the interest of simplicity, we
                    will use the term “resources” familiar from ecological
                    population studies to refer to all of the factors that mediate growth
                    regulation. We do not intend by this to exclude factors that are more accurately
                    referred to as “signals”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Jameson1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Mahajan1">[13]</xref>,
                    and may also be controlled directly by the activities of regulatory T cells
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Stockinger2">[14]</xref>. It has been shown, for example, that normal
                    T-cell population growth is dependent on stimulation by self-peptide major
                    histocompatibility complex (spMHC) complexes through the TCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Ernst1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Kieper1">[18]</xref>, requiring a TCR
                    that is specific for the spMHC complex. But T-cell population growth also
                    depends on cytokines such as IL7 and IL15 that act independently of TCR
                    specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Jameson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Khaled1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Tan1">[21]</xref>.
                    Furthermore, growth and survival in all cells require adequate space and
                    nutrients, the utilization of which is independent of TCR specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Dummer1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Prlic1">[23]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Our current understanding of lymphopenia-induced proliferation is due to studies
                    in mice demonstrating that T cells divide rapidly after transfer into T
                    cell-deficient (usually due to RAG or CD3 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> deficiency) or irradiated mice, but not after transfer to

                    overall T cell numbers in T cell-deficient animals after transfer and clonal
                    expansion are similar to T cell numbers in normal animals, suggesting control
                    mechanisms acting on total T cell numbers, rather than in a clone-specific
                    manner.</p>
                <p>The importance of TCR specific signals has been studied at length, showing that
                    competition within T cell clones is important in maintaining TCR repertoire
                    diversity. It has been shown, for example, that in a T-cell-deficient host, a T
                    cell must interact with antigen-presenting cells bearing the MHC allele
                    responsible for that cell's thymic selection in order to proliferate
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Kirberg1">[24]</xref>. In a T-cell sufficient host, such TCR-spMHC
                    interaction is necessary for T cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Kirberg1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Brocker1">[25]</xref>.
                    Furthermore, naive polyclonal T cells divide when transferred to TCR-transgenic
                    hosts, as do monoclonal T cells transferred to TCR-transgenic hosts of differing
                    clonotype. T cells do not divide, however, in hosts of identical clonotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Troy1">[26]</xref>. Mice
                    lacking MHC class II expression do not repopulate the periphery with CD4 T cells
                    at all, suggesting that peripheral MHC class II expression is needed for the
                    survival of CD4 T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Brocker1">[25]</xref>. In the present context it is important to
                    note that MHC class II matching in thymic grafts for complete DiGeorge subjects
                    is not necessary for the development of CD4 T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Markert1">[27]</xref>.</p>
                <p>TCR-nonspecific signals include cytokines such as the cytokine interleukin-7
                    (IL7), which is necessary for the survival of nave T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Hassan1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Webb1">[32]</xref>.

                    shown a reduction in T-cell capacity to proliferate upon stimulation, leading to

                    combined immune defects with lack of T lymphocyte maturation and function. This

                    Moreover, in humans, in the absence of of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or of the Jak-3 family, the periphery lacks T cells completely

                <p>To assess the contributions of thymic emigration rate on the steady-state T-cell

                <title>Complete DiGeorge Anomaly</title>
                <p>Complete DiGeorge Anomaly (cDGA) is a congenital condition, the hallmark of which
                    is profound immunodeficiency arising from abnormal development of the third and
                    fourth pharyngeal pouches resulting in thymic aplasia (complete absence of the
                    thymus). This developmental irregularity may also cause various other anatomical
                    abnormalities including heart defects, hypoparathyroidism, and craniofacial
                    malformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Thomas1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Mller1">[42]</xref>. In the absence of a
                    thymus, cDGA subjects lack thymic-derived T cells and are consequently
                    profoundly immunocompromised. Postnatal thymus transplantation can lead to a
                    restoration of T-cell function and the development of a peripheral T-cell
                    population with an apparently normal T-cell receptor repertoire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Markert2">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Markert4">[45]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Thymus transplantation is emerging as a valuable treatment for athymia generally.
                    There is therefore substantial medical interest in elucidating the immunological
                    recovery of thymus transplant patients quite apart from the basic immunology
                    these patients may reveal.</p>
                <p>To illustrate the connection between these alternative homeostatic mechanisms and
                    the observations one might make on the DiGeorge subjects, consider the following
                    two scenarios as a thought experiment. First, suppose that TCR-specific
                    resources such as spMHC are not limiting, either because they are produced in
                    great excess or because they are rendered unnecessary. Under these conditions,
                    homeostasis will be due exclusively to competition for TCR-nonspecific
                    resources. The first T cells leaving the thymus will expand rapidly, consuming
                    the TCR-nonspecific resources required for growth of their own growth and for
                    the growth of all other clones. Subsequent T cells leaving the thymus will
                    encounter a more impoverished environment and will grow more slowly, leading to
                    early dominance of one or a small number of early clones and therefore a limited
                    TCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000396-g001">Figure 1</xref>).
                    Conversely, if TCR-nonspecific resources such as cytokines were not limiting,
                    and that homeostasis therefore depended solely on competition for TCR-specific
                    signaling, the only cellular competition would be among T cells of the same
                    clonotype. In this case, each clone will grow to roughly the same self-limiting
                    size regardless of when its founder emigrates from the thymus. In this case, TCR
                    repertoire diversity will grow at the greatest possible rate, all other things
                    being equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000396-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>Reality will lie somewhere between these two limiting cases: TCR repertoire
                    diversity will be shaped by both TCR-specific and TCR-nonspecific resources. Our
                    goal is to explore, quantitatively, how these two sets of signals interact
                    dynamically to shape the mature functional T cell population.</p>
                <p>The quantitative contributions of different signals in the regulation of T-cell
                    number and the diversity of the TCR repertoire are very difficult to determine
                    experimentally in the context of an intact system. To examine the interplay
                    among the mechanisms responsible for the heterogeneity of the T-cell repertoire,
                    we have developed a mathematical model for the effective interactions among
                    T-cell clones. We model the temporal evolution of T-cell clones and their
                    dynamics under the combined effect of TCR-specific and TCR-nonspecific signals.
                    In particular, we consider competition within clones for spMHC complexes
                    presented by antigen-presenting cells as well as competition among cells in all
                    clones for cytokines, space and other TCR-non-specific resources.</p>
                <p>Such mathematical models have been used extensively to study the dynamical
                    interactions between different branches of the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Wodarz1">[46]</xref> and

                    population development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-DeBoer3">[52]</xref>. In this paper, we develop a model to examine
                    competitive interactions among homo- and heterospecific T cells under limiting
                    spMHC and TCR-nonspecific resources. This model then provides the basis for the
                    analysis of clinical data from complete DiGeorge subjects following thymic
                    transplantation to estimate the extent to which regulatory mechanisms working
                    through these distinct pathways contribute to shaping the T cell population. The
                    distinguishing feature of our model is its explicit representation of individual
                    T cell clones, and the direct focus on the interplay between T-cell population
                    size and TCR repertoire diversity this strategy allows. All model parameters are

            <p>Eq.(1) provides the basis for the numerical data fitting we perform, but analysis of
                the model itself is facilitated by replacing the the Poisson process in Eq.(1) by
                its time-dependent mean value, ie, neglecting the fluctuations due to the
                discreteness of the emigration process. This approximation is valid near steady
                state, where each of the clones is substantially filled. In this approximation, the
                dynamic equations for, eg, the clone proportions <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e026" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is recognized as Simpson's Index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Simpson1">[53]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Using this same approximation, the dynamics of the total T-cell population size is

            <p>At the single stable steady state, which is unique and stable, all clones have the

Therefore, the steady-state solution is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each <italic>i</italic>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by the positive solution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000396.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
            <p>When <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, all growth limitation is due to competition for TCR-nonspecific

                TCR-nonspecific resources are abundant and the effective clones grow independently
                of one another.</p>
            <p>Because the thymic graft is likely to become functional only gradually over time, we
                model the thymic emigration rate as a Hill function,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e036" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula></p>
            <p>This parameterization is atypical, but proves to be practical for performing the
                fitting, as will be described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>  section. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the time in days at which thymic output is half-maximal, and
                the Hill coefficient, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, fixes the steepness of the curve at the half-maximum emigration
                rate.</p>
            <p>Sample paths under the model are generated using software written in C# under Visual
                Studio 2008, and the Troschuetz pseudorandom number generator classes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/Random.aspx" xlink:type="simple">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/Random.aspx</ext-link>). The continuous
                components are integrated numerically using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme with
                adaptive step size. Thymic emigration is implemented as follows. For each time
                interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, used for the numerical integration, we integrated inhomogeneous
                Poisson intensity<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e040" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula></p>
            <p>We then draw a Poisson random variable, call it <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Finally, we add <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> clones of size 1 to the system at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For each new clone, the T-cell receptor beta V (TCRBV) family and
                CDR3 length conditional on TCRBV are assigned at random using multinomial parameters
                estimated using data from several healthy subjects.</p>

                    <p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the
                        Declaration of Helsinki. All subject samples were obtained under protocols
                        approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board
                        (IRB).</p>
                    <p>Between 13 and 17 blood samples per subject were collected over a period of
                        2–3 years following thymus transplantation in three infants with
                        complete DiGeorge anomaly. T cell receptor diversity in CD4 T cells was
                        assessed by obtaining frequencies of TCRBV family usage by flow cytometry,
                        and of complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) length distributions
                        within TCRBV families by spectratyping and using these frequencies to
                        estimate the diversity as described below.</p>
                    <p>Standard flow cytometry on whole blood samples was performed as previously
                        described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Markert3">[44]</xref>. Monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD4,
                        and CD8 were used in conjunction with antibodies specific to 18 TCRBV
                        families (Beckman Coulter and BD Biosciences).</p>
                    <p>Spectratype analysis provided information about CDR3 length diversity within
                        each functional TCRBV family. Briefly, CD4 T cells were isolated from the
                        peripheral blood of subjects and controls. RNA was prepared and used for
                        complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis. The cDNA was used as a template for 23
                        TCRBV-specific primer pairs covering 21 TCRBV families to amplify the
                        complete CDR3 region by PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Pannetier1">[54]</xref>. Each PCR
                        product, representing a different TCRBV family, was size separated by
                        capillary gel electrophoresis and the product lengths were identified using
                        the GeneScan software (Applied Biosciences). Product length distributions of
                        a Gaussian-like profile correspond to a polyclonal T cell repertoire.
                        Variations between spectratype histograms of DiGeorge subjects and those of
                        healthy adult controls provide information about the diversification of the

                    we measure TCRBV family usage by flow cytometry and distributions of CDR3

                <p>The model is based on absolute T-cell numbers, but the data are blood T cell
                    concentrations. We must use a conversion factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that converts total T cell numbers to T-cell blood
                    concentration. This factor is not easy to estimate with any precision, but our
                    results are quite insensitive to large variation in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

The
                    maximum possible rate is set by the minimum cell-cycle time for lymphocytes of
                    about 6 hours, so we likewise used a logistic transformation on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The prior distributions on the parameters were uniform in the

                <p>The maximum-likelihood parameters estimates are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000396-t002">Table 2</xref>, along with the 95%
                    credible intervals. The estimate for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was much larger than the largest observation time, so we
                    subsequently fixed <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, thereby eliminating one modeling degree of freedom and refit
                    the model. We found that this simplification entailed no significant decrease in
                    likelihood for any data set. This result implies that our experimental design is
                    not capable of resolving the full time-course of the grafts' becoming
                    functional, not necessarily that the emigration rate continues to increase

                    and 10<sup>−3</sup> in these three subjects. In subject one, who has
                    the most complete data available and the tightest posterior marginal
                    distribution on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, produces an estimate midway between the other two.</p>
                <p>The parameter governing total thymic emigration, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, does not have a simple direct interpretation, but one can
                    estimate the thymic emigration rate at any time post-transplantation. These
                    rates, estimated for the three subjects at one year post-transplantation, are
                    93, 44, and 198 cells per day, respectively. These rates are several orders of
                    magnitude smaller than those estimated for healthy humans infants.</p>
                <p>We can examine the estimated values of the the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bias and use the known expression for this bias to compare to
                    the actual sample sizes. Where the underlying distribution is multinomial, the
                    theoretical bias is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of classes in the multinomial, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the sample size. Using this formula to estimate the sample
                    size leads to the conclusion that the effective sizes of the samples used to
                    estimate diversity are between 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> cells,
                    consistent with the measured sample sizes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000396-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>In order to gain a deeper understanding of the role of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the dynamics of both T cell population size and diversity,
                    we performed two additional analyses. We use the data from subject one to
                    illustrate these points. Analyses on the other two subjects yielded comparable
                    results and lead to the same conclusions.</p>
                <p>A reasonable concern is that thymic emigration rate and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> may be confounded–that it may be possible to
                    compensate for smaller <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by making <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> larger. We addressed that concern by performing a numerical
                    experiment to determine the impact on the model fit of fixing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> outside the inferred credible bounds. We fix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be 10-fold smaller or larger than its maximum-likelihood
                    estimate for subject 1. The fits are significantly worse (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000396-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000396-g004">4</xref>), with log-likelihood ratios

                <title>Sensitivity Analysis</title>
                <p>A focused analysis of the time-dependent sensitivity of the model trajectories to
                    parameter variation may provide further insight into the mechanisms of
                    regulation. We examined the sensitivity of our model to changes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>

                <p>Define the sensitivity functions <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The sensitivity equations are obtained by differentiating
                    both sides of equation (1) with respect to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are computed as the solutions of<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e147" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for all <italic>i</italic>. The sensitivity function for
                        <italic>D</italic> is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The relative sensitivities are calculated by multiplying the
                    absolute sensitivity by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and dividing by the value of the relevant response variable.</p>
                <p>The sensitivity to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is due largely to the changed timing of discrete events, and
                    so does not lend itself easily to differential sensitivity analysis in the form
                    outlined in Eq(10). Sensitivity to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was therefore estimated directly by generating sample paths
                    under different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
                <p>We know that mean sensitivity to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is transient because the steady-state population size and
                    diversity do not depend on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the deterministic limit (Eqs.2,3). We find, however, that
                    the diversity remains sensitive to changes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> throughout the two-year period of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000396-g005">Figure 5</xref>). It should be noted,
                    however, that this assessment is based on the true diversity rather than the
                    sample diversity, whose resolution is limited by sample size. At the sample
                    sizes available, the sensitivity of the measurable diversity to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vanishes between 6 and 12 months. The population size is very
                    sensitive to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the first 3–4 months, becoming less so rapidly
                    after that time. As <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases, the population size decreases during the sensitive
                    period.</p>

                    noted that diversity at the level of amino acid sequence differences is not
                    resolved by our assays, regardless of sample size. If it were, we would expect
                    the diversity to remain sensitive to both of these parameters for a longer

                <title>Response to Clonal Perturbation</title>
                <p>The model does not account for the micro-environmental perturbations invariably
                    encountered by people, including our study subjects. Infection produces a
                    transient change in the steady state of the T cell repertoire, typified by a
                    decrease in the diversity. Once the infection has been resolved, the T-cell
                    population returns to its steady state, and the diversity relaxes back to its
                    original value. The rate at which the return to steady state values occurs
                    depends on <italic>ρ</italic>. To examine this dependence, we carried
                    out the following numerical experiment.</p>
                <p>We start with a system at steady state, and suddenly increase the size of a
                    single clone by a factor of 10<sup>4</sup>, allowing it to consume the non-TCR
                    specific resources its new size requires. The diversity decreases as a result.
                    Over a few days, the other clones adjust to the new steady state. After ten days
                    we remove the artificial support for the enlarged clone and allow the system to
                    return to steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000396-g006">Figure
                    6</xref>). We ran this experiment using models with four values of
                        <italic>ρ</italic> differing over four orders of magnitude. For high
                        <italic>ρ</italic>, corresponding to a high competition for specific
                    signals, the diversity decreases less than in the absence of intra-clonal
                    competition. Moreover, after the perturbation is resolved, the diversity
                    increases back to its steady-state, pre-perturbation value at a rate that
                    depends very sensitively on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The return to steady-state diversity is more rapid the
                    greater the competition for TCR-specific signals. The estimated values for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> obtained from the DiGeorge patients implies a diversity-return

                        <p>The system was initialized at steady state, and was subjected to the
                            sudden enlargement of a single randomly chosen clone by 10,000-fold.
                            This clone was held artificially high for 10 days, after which the
                            system was allowed to relax back to steady-state. The artificially
                            enlarged clone consumes TCR-non-specific resources at a rate appropriate

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>The functional integration of the manifold processes involved in the development and
                maintenance of the mature T cell repertoire has not yet been fully elucidated. These
                processes include thymic export, competition for TCR ligands, and competition for
                non-specific stimulatory factors. Here, we study T cell homeostasis in complete
                DiGeorge Anomaly patients during the establishment of T cells following thymic
                transplantation.</p>
            <p>To quantify the balance between TCR-specific and TCR-nonspecific factors that act to
                limit T-cell population growth, we developed a mathematical model that accounts for
                intra- and inter-clonal competition. The key parameter in this model for the present
                purpose is <italic>ρ</italic>. This parameter can be given a functional
                interpretation by considering the case of an individual capable of rearranging just
                a single TCR. The size of this hypothetical sole clone, at equilibrium, must be
                larger than the size of the same clone in the presence of a T cell population with a
                complete repertoire. The ratio of these two sizes is
                1∶<italic>ρ</italic>. We have estimated <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000396.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be about 10<sup>−3</sup>; the carrying capacity for a
                single isolated clone is about 1000 times larger that that for the same clone under
                normal heterogeneous conditions. This result suggests that TCR-specific resource
                limitation is relatively unimportant, but this is true only for the total T-cell
                population size near steady state; away from steady state, TCR-specific regulation
                may is crucial to the establishment and maintenance of repertoire diversity.</p>
            <p>At steady-state, TCR diversity is maintained through competition for self peptide MHC
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Grossman1">[60]</xref>, and population numbers are maintained through
                competition for cytokines and other resources not specific to the TCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Jameson1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Khaled1">[19]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Our models fit the data adequately only when the thymic emigration is an accelerating
                function of time through the initial post-transplantation phase, as would be
                expected from the biology of thymus transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Markert5">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Markert6">[62]</xref>. The slices of
                cultured thymus tissue used for transplantation are cultured from 2–3
                weeks prior to transplantation. There is dramatic depletion of thymocytes from the
                tissue, thymic epithelium becomes condensed, and the cortico-medullary distinction
                is lost. In the first months after transplantation, the epithelium differentiates so
                that cortex and medulla again are distinct and the epithelium develops its
                characteristic lacy appearance. During this process, the numbers of thymocytes in
                the transplanted tissue increases dramatically, from small numbers of scattered
                thymocytes to densely packed thymocytes throughout the allograft. Thus, the biology
                predicts an increase in emigration with time after transplantation as normal thymic
                architecture is reestablished.</p>
            <p>The current study was not able to treat naive and memory T cells separately, but
                doing so is clearly of great interest given the indications that these pools are
                regulated independently of each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Tanchot1">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, we were
                not able to measure thymic emigration directly, though these measurements would be
                of significant interest given the surprisingly small rates inferred here, and the
                impact that the reconciliation of this implied inconsistency would have on our
                understanding of the treatment of athymia and thymic dysfunction. Finally, our model
                contains terms for the density-dependent competition among T cells (Eq.1) whose
                forms are commonly accepted in population modeling but do not have direct empirical
                justification in the present context. Although we believe that our conclusions are
                robust against reasonable variation in these terms, it would be of great utility to
                explore this issue explicitly.</p>
            <p>Our aim has been to study T cell homeostasis in a more natural human system than has
                otherwise been available thus far. It remains to be shown just how natural the
                post-transplantation environment is in this regard, and therefore how broadly
                applicable our findings are. We are encouraged, however, by the fact that complete
                DiGeorge patients receiving thymus transplants recover adaptive immune function. It
                is important to note that total T-cell counts in these recovered patients remains
                below normal, typically at about the 10th percentile for children of the same age
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000396-Markert4">[45]</xref>.
                Although specific reasons for this condition have not yet been determined, no
                molecular defects in T-cell function have been reported. We regard it as possible
                that the sole immunological lesion in DiGeorge anomaly is athymia, and that, once
                ameliorated by transplantation, the emergence of the T cell population proceeds as
                it would in a non-affected T-cell lymphopenic subject. We expect, therefore, that
                our findings will be generally applicable.</p>
            <p>Our study enabled us to discriminate between two qualitatively different forms of
                population regulation: TCR-specific regulation and TCR-nonspecific regulation, and
                to elucidate their roles in jointly maintaining the dynamic homeostasis of the T
                cell population. The parameters estimates obtained by analyzing data from three
                DiGeorge Anomaly patients suggest that T-cell population size is maintained by
                TCR-nonspecific mechanisms, and TCR repertoire diversity is maintained by
                TCR-specific mechanisms.</p>
