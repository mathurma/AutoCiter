<abstract>
<p>The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC) is a transmembrane receptor at the cell surface and has been described to work paradoxically both as an oncogene and as a tumor suppressor. We partly solved this paradox in a previous study, demonstrating that TrkC is a double-facet receptor: Upon interaction with its ligand neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), TrkC has a tyrosine kinase activity and induces survival and proliferation of the cell; conversely, in the absence of the ligand, TrkC is cleaved and releases a "killer-fragment" that triggers apoptosis. In this study, we analyze the fate of this fragment and show that TrkC killer-fragment is translocated to the nucleus, where it stabilizes the apoptosis inducer p53. We further find that p53 activates the transcription of cytoplasmic molecular partners, which interact with TrkC killer-fragment and induce apoptosis. We also demonstrate that alteration of this mechanism favors tumor growth in neuroblastoma (NB), an avian tumor progression model for a pediatric cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), NT-4/5, and their respective receptors neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) and tropomyosin receptor kinases (TrkA), B, and C have been notably studied for their critical role in neurodevelopment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref001">1</xref>]. Yet as TrkA, B, and C are tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs), their deregulated functions in cancer have been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref002">2</xref>]. The overall view is that their kinase activity confers them the ability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways known to promote cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation under physiological conditions and to contribute to tumor progression when constitutively activated in cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref002">2</xref>]. The kinase domains of TrkA, B, and C are indeed involved in oncogenic translocations or mutated in cancers (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref002">2</xref>]). In line with the pharmaceutical rush to design antitumoral treatments based on RTK inhibition, drugs targeting TrkA, B, and C have been under development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref003">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, TrkC expression has been paradoxically associated with favorable outcome in pediatric neoplasia, namely neuroblastoma (NB) and medulloblastoma, and was more recently shown to act as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref004">4</xref>] and for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref008">8</xref>]). We and others have indeed proposed that TrkC has a dual functionality: (i) In presence of its ligand NT-3, TrkC behaves as a classical RTK, transducing positive signals; (ii) in absence of NT-3, TrkC does not stay inactive but rather triggers apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref010">10</xref>]. TrkC thus belongs to the functional family of "dependence receptors." These receptors play a crucial role in constraining the adequate number of cells in a tissue in which the ligand is expressed in a limited amount during neurodevelopment but also during tumorigenesis: Cells in excess that carry an unbound dependence receptor undergo apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref011">11</xref>]. It was demonstrated in different types of tumors that (i) the silencing of the dependence receptor by epigenetic mechanisms or genetic alterations or (ii) the overexpression of the ligand confers to the tumor cells a survival selective advantage: The dependence receptor is then no longer able to trigger apoptosis. TrkC expression was indeed shown to be epigenetically silenced in colon tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref006">6</xref>]. Along the same line, we also demonstrated that a large proportion of high-grade NB tumors shows an autocrine production of NT-3 as a mechanism to constitutively block TrkC proapoptotic function. It was thus proposed that interfering with ligand–receptor (NT-3/TrkC) interaction, either by gene silencing or the use of a blocking antibody, is associated in different animal models with the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanism for TrkC proapoptotic activity has been investigated in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]. Upon ligand withdrawal, TrkC appears to be cleaved by caspase-like proteases at 2 sites (D495 and D641) within its intracellular domain, and the released fragment (TrkC 496–641, called the "killer-fragment" [TrkC-KF]) is necessary and sufficient to promote apoptosis. We demonstrated recently that this fragment interacts with cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1), which shuttles TrkC-KF to the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]. Once at the mitochondria, TrkC-KF and COBRA1 activate B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX) and induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, and the subsequent apoptosome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we show that TrkC-KF is not only cytoplasmic as described previously but is also observed in the nucleus. TrkC-KF is translocated to the nucleus by importins. A 2-hybrid screen allowed us to identify that TrkC-KF then interacts with Hey1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor originally described as an effector of the NOTCH pathway. Hey1 and TrkC-KF bind on mouse double minute 2 homolog (<italic>MDM2</italic>) promoter and negatively regulate <italic>MDM2</italic> transcription. This decrease of MDM2 expression favors p53 stabilization, which triggers the transcription of TrkC proapoptotic partners acting at the mitochondria. We finally show in an avian model of NB tumor progression that Hey1- or p53-silencing abrogates TrkC tumor suppressor activity.</p>

<title>Importins mediate the nuclear translocation of TrkC proapoptotic fragment TrkC-KF</title>
<p>We have previously shown that in absence of its ligand NT-3, TrkC is cleaved by caspase at 2 sites (D495 and D641) within its intracellular domain, leading to the release of several intracellular fragments. This caspase-dependent cleavage can be detected both in vitro and in vivo and is required for apoptosis induction, since the mutation of the caspase sites inhibits apoptosis induced by TrkC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]. TrkC cleavage by caspases leads to the generation of 3 fragments: TrkC 1–495, TrkC 496–641, and TrkC 642–825 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In various cell lines, including the murine Neuro2a (N2A) and human SHEP NB cell lines enforced expression of the internal caspase-generated fragment TrkC 496–641 (named TrkC-KF) was associated with cell death induction, while TrkC 1–495 and TrkC 642–825 displayed no proapoptotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition to its mitochondrial localization described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>], the green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged TrkC-KF (TrkC-KF-GFP) was detected in the nucleus of N2A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). As a control, full-length TrkC (TrkC-FL-GFP), the C-terminal cleavage fragment (TrkC-642-825-GFP), and the intracellular fragment of an unrelated receptor—Neogenin (Neo-IC-GFP)—were mostly detected outside the nucleus of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We used GFP-fused fragments as none of the commercial antibodies or antibodies we generated were able to detect endogenous TrkC-KF. We verified that Flag-tagged TrkC-KF was also observed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus upon cellular fractionation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s004">S1A Fig</xref>). In a yeast 2-hybrid screen using TrkC-KF as bait and a mouse embryonic cDNA library as prey, we identified importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s004">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]. Importins are cargo proteins shuttling cytoplasmic proteins into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref015">15</xref>]. A proximity ligation assay (Duolink) using a pan-importin antibody and an anti-GFP antibody allowed us to detect a close interaction between TrkC-KF-GFP and endogenous importins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>), suggesting that TrkC-KF is interacting with importins. We thus treated N2A cells with Ivermectin, a pan-importin inhibitor, and performed a fractionation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s004">S1C Fig</xref>). As a control, we used a version of Neo-IC deleted for its nuclear export sequence (Neo-IC-ΔNES) but with an intact nuclear localization sequence (NLS), which is mostly localized in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref016">16</xref>]. We observed that the amount of TrkC-KF was greatly reduced in the nucleus upon treatment with Ivermectin, while the cytoplasmic pool was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s004">S1C Fig</xref>). As a positive control, Neo-IC nuclear translocation was also affected by Ivermectin treatment. TrkC-KF thus appears to be shuttled in the nucleus by importins. Importins need to first recognize NLSs in the proteins they are supposed to shuttle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref015">15</xref>]. Two putative NLSs could be mapped in TrkC-KF sequence, and we thus generated constructs bearing 1 (KFΔNLS1) or the 2 (KFΔNLS1/2) mutations of these putative sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). While the mutation of NLS1 had no effect on TrkC-KF nuclear translocation, mutation of NLS1/2 greatly reduced the amount of TrkC-KF in the nuclear fraction of transfected SHEP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s004">S1D Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the mutation of NLS1/2 (TrkC-KFΔNLS1/2) is sufficient to partially but significantly inhibit TrkC proapoptotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1H</xref>) without affecting its functionality. Indeed, TrkC-KFΔNLS1/2 is able to bind COBRA1, its cytoplasmic partner, as wild-type TrkC-KF does when overexpressed in cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s004">S1E Fig</xref>), suggesting that this mutant is still functional. TrkC-KF nuclear translocation seems therefore necessary for its proapoptotic activity in SHEP cells. In addition, no nuclear export sequence (NES) could be found in TrkC-KF, suggesting that once in the nucleus, TrkC-KF does not return in the cytoplasm. To monitor the role of TrkC-KF in the nucleus, we investigated whether it is able to transactivate gene transcription. To first assay this, TrkC-KF was fused to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD), and SHEP cells were forced to express TrkC-KF-Gal4DBD together with a construct encoding a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the upstream activating sequence (UAS)-GAL4 promoter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s004">S1F Fig</xref>, TrkC-KF-Gal4DBD is unable to transactivate the UAS-GAL4, unlike deleted in colorectal cancer intracellular domain (DCC-IC), as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref017">17</xref>]. This result suggests that TrkC-KF has no intrinsic transcriptional activity per se.</p>

<title>The transcription factor Hey1 interacts with TrkC-KF in the nucleus and allows its binding to chromatin</title>
<p>As TrkC-KF does not seem to have a transcriptional activity, we looked for putative nuclear interacting partners in the 2-hybrid screen mentioned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g001">Fig 1</xref>, using TrkC-KF as bait. We focused on Hey1, which was identified as a putative partner of TrkC-KF in the screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s004">S1B Fig</xref>). Hey1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the bHLH-Orange (bHLH-O) family of transcriptional repressors, together with Hey2 and HeyL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref018">18</xref>]. NOTCH pathway activation increases Hey1 expression, leading to the transcriptional inhibition of downstream targets. Therefore, Hey1 is a critical effector of the NOTCH pathway, being involved in cardiac and vascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref019">19</xref>]. Hey1 is mostly nuclear but has also been detected in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref020">20</xref>]. We showed by confocal microscopy that TrkC-KF-GFP colocalizes with Hey1 tagged with red fluorescent protein (Hey1-RFP) in the nucleus of N2A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g002">Fig 2AB</xref>). Silencing Hey1 with a designed small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with a strong reduction of Hey1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s005">S2A Fig</xref>) or protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s005">S2B Fig</xref>) without affecting the level of other members of the bHLH-O transcription factor family members Hey2 and HeyL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s005">S2A and S2C Fig</xref>). We further showed in SHEP cells that TrkC-KF-GFP and endogenous Hey1 are interacting, by using an anti-Hey1 antibody in a proximity ligation assay (Duolink) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). No signal of interaction was detected when TrkC 642–825 was used instead of TrkC-KF or when Hey1 was silenced with an siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Furthermore, TrkC-KF-GFP nuclear localization was not affected by invalidation of endogenous Hey1 with the siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s005">S2D and S2E Fig</xref>). Thus, Hey1 specifically interacts with TrkC-KF and does not seem to be required for TrkC-KF nuclear translocation.</p>

<p>We next confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation performed in human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK293T) cells that Hey1 interacts with TrkC-KF-GFP and full-length TrkC (TrkC-FL-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Furthermore, HeyL, a transcription factor closely related to Hey1, fails to interact with TrkC-KF of TrkC-FL, showing that TrkC specifically interacts with Hey1 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, when cotransfected with Hey1, TrkC-KF-GFP was markedly detected in the nucleus in the DNA-bound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Thus, Hey1 interaction with TrkC-KF allows their joint binding to DNA complex.</p>

<title>Hey1 is a TrkC proapoptotic partner</title>
<p>In a previous study, we set up conditions in order to transiently express TrkC-FL without inducing an artefactual dimerization and subsequent activation of the kinase domain, as it may be the case with overexpressed RTKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]. In this setting, we observed in absence of NT-3 that the expression of TrkC-FL or TrkC-KF induces cell death in various cancer cell lines, including N2A NB cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]. We show here that silencing of Hey1 by RNA interference abrogates cell death induced by TrkC-FL or TrkC-KF in N2A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As a control, the apoptosis induced by another dependence receptor, Patched (Ptc), is not affected by Hey1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Rather than forcing TrkC expression, we investigated whether cell death induced upon NT-3 withdrawal is also dependent on Hey1. We have previously shown that SHEP cells are expressing both NT-3 and TrkC and that silencing of NT-3 is associated with TrkC-induced apoptosis in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>]. We therefore silenced Hey1 in NT-3-depleted SHEP cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, caspase-3 activation induced by NT-3 deprivation is similarly abrogated by cosilencing of endogenous Hey1. We had also previously demonstrated that various other NB cell lines overexpress NT-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>]. Among them, CLB-Ga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref021">21</xref>] and LAN6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref022">22</xref>] express NT-3 within the same range as SHEP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s006">S3A Fig</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>]). Despite the fact that LAN6 also expresses another Trk receptor, TrkA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s006">S3A Fig</xref>), we demonstrate that interfering with endogenous NT-3 by RNA interference also triggers caspase-3 activity in LAN6 cells and that this caspase-3 activity can also be abrogated by cosilencing of Hey1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s006">S3B and S3C Fig</xref>). As p75<sup>NTR</sup> has been suggested to mediate TrkC-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref010">10</xref>], we wondered whether its cosilencing could abrogate the apoptosis induced by NT-3 deprivation in SHEP cells as well as Hey1 did. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s006">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>, the caspase-3 activity measured by endogenous NT-3 invalidation is not altered upon treatment with an siRNA targeting p75<sup>NTR</sup>. p75<sup>NTR</sup> may thus be dispensable, at least in our model, for the apoptosis triggered by TrkC via Hey1 in absence of NT-3.</p>

<p>In order to work with cells constitutively knock-out for Hey1, we then invalidated endogenous Hey1 in SHEP cells by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CAS9) editing and obtained 2 independent clones in which Hey1 expression was fully abolished. As a control, we used clones that had undergone the same selection process but without the transfection of the guide RNA (gRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We labeled the various SHEP clones and parental cells with an anticleaved caspase-3 antibody after siRNA NT-3 or siRNA control treatment. Hey1 knock-out clones displayed a much-reduced staining compared to the clones still expressing Hey1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Along this line, in a WB with an anticleaved poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP) antibody, we observed that PARP cleavage (cPARP) is greatly reduced in Hey1 knock-out clones upon siRNA NT-3 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s006">S3F Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Hey1 contributes to TrkC-dependent p53 stabilization</title>
<p>Of interest, Hey1 has been previously identified in a screen aimed at finding new activators of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref023">23</xref>]. This study indeed demonstrated that Hey1 stabilizes p53 by down-regulating the expression of the p53 antagonist, MDM2. Along this line, we were able to detect an increase in the amount of p53 protein in SHEP cells forced to express Hey1, and this increase was more important when Hey1 was coexpressed with TrkC-FL or TrkC-KF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s007">S4A Fig</xref>). Conversely, coexpression of Hey1 with the intracellular uncleavable form of TrkC (TrkC-IC-D495N/D641N [TrkC-IC-DM]) did not increase p53 protein amount in SHEP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s007">S4A Fig</xref>). In order to determine whether p53 could be involved in the apoptosis mediated by TrkC, we silenced p53 by siRNA and assessed whether TrkC-FL or TrkC-KF could still be proapoptotic. Of interest, silencing p53 abrogates TrkC-FL- or TrkC-KF-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s007">S4B Fig</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s007">S4C Fig</xref>, silencing of NT-3 by siRNA is associated with an increased p53 protein level, whereas this is not the case when NT-3 and Hey1 are cosilenced. Similarly, cosilencing of NT-3 and p53 by RNA interference blocked NT-3 deprivation-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that p53 is necessary for TrkC apoptotic signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s007">S4D and S4E Fig</xref>, we also confirmed that Hey1 and p53 are necessary to unliganded TrkC–induced apoptosis in another NB cell line that expresses both NT-3 and TrkC: CLB-Ga cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s006">S3A Fig</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>]).</p>
<p>We then used a chemical inhibitor of p53-dependent transcriptional activation, pifithrin-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref025">25</xref>], and treated SHEP cells with an siRNA targeting NT-3 or an siRNA control. We detected an increased amount of the apoptotic cPARP fragment in siRNA NT-3-treated cells, and this effect was reversed upon treatment with pifithrin-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g004">Fig 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s007">S4F Fig</xref>). This result suggests that p53 transcriptional activation is required to mediate TrkC-induced apoptosis.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to determine whether p53 stabilization is mediated by Hey1 transcription repressor function, we coexpressed TrkC-KF with a mutant version of Hey1 bearing 3 point mutations (Hey1-RK3: R50K, R54K, R62K). This triple mutation has been shown to affect Hey1 DNA-binding basic domain and consequently Hey1 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref026">26</xref>]. We observed that TrkC-KF when expressed with Hey1-RK3 is no longer able to induce p53 stabilization, supporting the view that Hey1 transcriptional activity is required for p53-dependent TrkC-KF proapoptotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g004">Fig 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s007">S4G Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>TrkC-KF and Hey1 cooperate in inhibiting MDM2 transcription by direct binding to <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter</title>
<p>Because we (i) failed to detect any interaction between MDM2 protein and neither Hey1 nor TrkC-KF by proximity ligation assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5A Fig</xref>), (ii) observed that Hey1 DBD appears to be important for TrkC-KF/Hey1-mediated stabilization of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g004">Fig 4G</xref>), and (iii) identified <italic>MDM2</italic> in a chromatin immunoprecipitation sequence (ChIP-Seq) aimed at screening Hey1 binding sites in Hey1 overexpressing cells (Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] accession number GSE60699 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref027">27</xref>]), we hypothesized that Hey1/TrkC-KF may transcriptionally regulate MDM2 expression. We first measured MDM2 expression by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-QPCR) in SHEP cells transfected with various expression plasmids. As described previously by Huang and colleagues, forced expression of Hey1 is able to deregulate MDM2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref023">23</xref>]. Of interest, TrkC-FL itself is also able to deregulate MDM2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). As a control, the TrkC 642–825 fragment, the uncleavable form of TrkC (TrkC-DM), TrkC-FL in presence of caspase inhibitor z-vad, or an unrelated overexpressed receptor Ptc does not significantly alter MDM2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We further assessed the importance of Hey1 in TrkC-mediated MDM2 repression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, silencing of endogenous Hey1 by an siRNA in SHEP cells, forced to express either TrkC-FL or TrkC-KF, restores MDM2 expression. TrkC-FL- and TrkC-KF-mediated down-regulation of MDM2 was also observed at the protein level, as shown by western blot on transfected SHEP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5B Fig</xref>). Again, as a control, TrkC 642–825, TrkC-DM, or Ptc had no effect on MDM2 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5B Fig</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, the <italic>MDM2</italic> gene has 2 promoters and an enhancer box (E-box) described as a putative binding site for various transcription factors, including bHLH-O factors like Hey1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref028">28</xref>]. We designed various primers all along the <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter region and performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on SHEP cells expressing Flag-tagged versions of TrkC-KF and/or Hey1. ChIP with an antibody targeting endogenous Hey1 resulted in a slight enrichment of the promoter region amplified by primers located in close proximity to the E-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). As a negative control, no enrichment was observed after the use of primers designed in 5′ or in 3′ of <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Interestingly, TrkC-KF favors endogenous Hey1 binding to <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter, as observed by the increased DNA enrichment in TrkC-KF-Flag transfected cells when compared to nontransfected cells expressing endogenous Hey1 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). When SHEP cells were forced to express TrkC-KF-Flag or Hey1, a similar enrichment of the same promoter region was observed when chromatin was pulled down with either an anti-Flag antibody (targeting TrkC-KF) or an anti-Hey1 antibody (targeting Hey1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Together, these results support the view that TrkC-KF and Hey1 interact and bind to the same promoter region near the E-box of <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter. To more formally address this question, we silenced Hey1 in TrkC-KF-Flag-expressing SHEP cells. Silencing of Hey1 fully reversed the DNA enrichment observed, indicating that TrkC-KF binding on <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter is dependent on its interaction with Hey1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>). Finally, to assess direct binding of Hey1 and TrkC-KF to the <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter E-box, we proceeded to an oligonucleotide pull-down assay using biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides homologous to the promoter region spanning <italic>MDM2</italic> E-box. Oligonucleotides were mutated (mut) or not (WT) on the E-box sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5I</xref>) and incubated with lysates of SHEP cells expressing Hey1-Flag and TrkC-KF-GFP. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5J and 5K</xref>, we could demonstrate the association of Hey1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5J</xref>) and TrkC-KF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5K</xref>) with the oligonucleotide containing the wild-type E-box and much less with the mutated E-box oligonucleotide control. The number of bound oligonucleotides is increased when both Hey1 and TrkC-KF are expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5J and 5K</xref>). Conversely, silencing of endogenous Hey1 strongly inhibits TrkC-KF binding to the oligonucleotides corresponding to <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g005">Fig 5L</xref>). These data further confirm the association of Hey1 with TrkC-KF in the promoter region spanning <italic>MDM2</italic> E-box. Together, these results show that TrkC-KF and Hey1 interact on <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter and inhibit <italic>MDM2</italic> transcription.</p>
<p>We described in a previous study the shuttling of TrkC-KF at the mitochondria by COBRA1, in which both partners activated BAX and induced MOMP, the subsequent release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, and apoptosome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]. What is then the role of the nuclear pathway and p53 stabilization by TrkC-KF/Hey1 interaction? Are the mitochondrial and the nuclear pathways redundant, or are they sequentially activated? We first expressed TrkC-FL in N2A cells and invalidated Hey1 by siRNA to abrogate cell death. We observed that in this setting, transient overexpression of COBRA1 is sufficient to largely restore apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5C Fig</xref>). Conversely, Hey1 expression does not significantly restore cell death upon COBRA1 silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5D Fig</xref>). These results suggest that the nuclear Hey1/p53 pathway is acting upstream the COBRA1/BAX mitochondrial pathway.</p>
<p>We made the hypothesis that p53 activation may transcriptionally supply the proteins that are essential for the mitochondrial pathway triggered by TrkC. Indeed, COBRA1 promoter has been previously identified as a target of p53 in a genome-wide ChIP assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref029">29</xref>]. We measured COBRA1 expression by RT-QPCR and observed that invalidation of endogenous NT-3 by RNA interference (i.e., the activation of TrkC/Hey1/p53 pathway) increases the amount of COBRA1 mRNA in SHEP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5E Fig</xref>). This effect was reversed upon coinvalidation of NT-3 with Hey1 or p53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5E Fig</xref>). This result suggested that, indeed, p53 is important to allow the expression of COBRA1.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether p53 is responsible for this transcriptional up-regulation of COBRA1, we identified 2 putative p53 binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref030">30</xref>] on the <italic>COBRA1</italic> promoter and designed various pairs of primers spanning different regions of the <italic>COBRA1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5F Fig</xref>). The chromatin of SHEP cells transfected with either control or TrkC-KF and Hey1 was pulled down with an anti-p53 antibody, and the region encompassing the 2 putative p53 sites was more amplified than the 5′ or 3′ region of the promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5G Fig</xref>). These results suggest that p53 indeed binds to the <italic>COBRA1</italic> promoter and contributes to the supply of COBRA1 proteins in the cytoplasm so that a pool of TrkC-KF fragments produced by the caspase cleavage in the cytoplasm can be shuttled at the mitochondria by COBRA1 proteins.</p>
<p>We also showed in our previous study that TrkC-KF and COBRA1, once anchored at the mitochondrial membrane, activate BAX—but not B cell lymphoma 2 killer (BAK)—to trigger MOMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]. BAX is a well-characterized target of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref031">31</xref>], so we also designed pairs of primers among which 1 pair spanned the p53 binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5H Fig</xref>). The chromatin region amplified by this pair of primers was greatly amplified in SHEP cells transfected with TrkC-KF and Hey1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5I Fig</xref>). Conversely, <italic>BAK</italic> promoter, another p53 target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref032">32</xref>], was not amplified when this experiment was repeated with primers spanning the p53 binding site on the <italic>BAK</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s008">S5J and S5K Fig</xref>). These results are consistent with the fact that the TrkC proapoptotic pathway does not require BAK but requires BAX and COBRA1.</p>
<p>Together, these data support the idea that the nuclear apoptotic pathway triggered by TrkC-KF with Hey1 and p53 is essential to provide the adequate number of TrkC proapoptotic partners in the cytoplasm to finally induce MOMP and apoptosome activation.</p>

<title>Hey1/p53-dependent TrkC-induced apoptosis constrains tumor growth in vivo</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that TrkC-mediated apoptosis constrains tumor growth in NB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>] and proposed that some NB cells escape from TrkC-induced apoptosis by up-regulating NT-3. We thus took advantage of an avian model in which we showed that interference with NT-3/TrkC is associated with NB growth inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref033">33</xref>]. SHEP cells were inoculated on the highly vascularized chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of E10 chicken embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Five days later, a primary tumor was formed at the inoculation site. When we inoculated parental SHEP cells or the control clone of SHEP cells, silenced for NT-3 by RNA interference, the size and weight of the tumors were reduced in comparison with tumors generated by scramble siRNA-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). We inoculated 2 independent clones knock-out for Hey1 (CRISPR/CAS9 edited as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The weight of the tumor did not vary significantly in Hey1 knock-out clones upon NT-3 invalidation by siRNA, suggesting that Hey1 is necessary for TrkC to limit tumor progression in absence of NT-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). We also observed that cosilencing of NT-3 with either Hey1 or p53 by RNA interference in SHEP cells also reverses siRNA NT-3-induced tumor suppressive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), as it had previously been demonstrated upon NT-3 and TrkC cosilencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>]. The reduction in size of tumors formed by NT-3-silenced SHEP cells was associated with high apoptosis, as shown by TUNEL staining performed on tumor cryosections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). As expected, this induction of apoptosis triggered by NT-3 silencing is reversed when Hey1 or p53 is invalidated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002912.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). These results demonstrate in vivo that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.</p>

<p>To analyze whether silencing of the proapoptotic pathway induced by TrkC/Hey1 in absence of NT-3 could be associated with patient poor prognosis, we analyzed various transcriptomic analyses performed on human NB tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s009">S6 Fig</xref>). It had previously been shown in a limited number of human samples that TrkC expression is associated with favorable outcome in NB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref034">34</xref>] and that Hey1 expression is greatly reduced in NB when compared with benign tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref035">35</xref>]. We made the same observation on a larger cohort, published by T. Wolf on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GEO, analyzed by Agilent-Microarray 44K (GSE45480, 649 samples) for both TrkC and Hey1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s009">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). TrkC and Hey1 expression is significantly lower in aggressive stage 4 NB tumors than in stage 1–3 NB tumors. We further calculated the intergrade median of expression for NT-3, TrkC, and Hey1. We then selected 3 profiles of tumors based on the mode of action of NT-3 inhibiting the death induced by TrkC and Hey1: (i) tumors which express low levels of NT-3 (beyond the intergrade median of NT-3 expression), high levels of TrkC, and high levels of Hey1—i.e., tumors in which TrkC is prone to induce apoptosis (NT-3<sup>low</sup>, TrkC<sup>high</sup>, Hey1<sup>high</sup>); (ii) tumors in which the 3 genes are expressed at a low level or silenced—i.e., this death pathway is blocked (NT-3<sup>low</sup>, TrkC<sup>low</sup>, Hey1<sup>low</sup>); and (iii) tumors with other profiles. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s009">S6C Fig</xref>, the proportion of tumors in which the TrkC death pathway is "ON" (NT-3<sup>low</sup>, TrkC<sup>high</sup>, Hey1<sup>high</sup>) is high in low-grade NB1–3 tumors but decreases when the grade increases (22% in NB1–3 and 12% in NB4). Conversely, the percentage of tumors in which the death pathway is "OFF" (NT-3<sup>low</sup>, TrkC<sup>low</sup>, Hey1<sup>low</sup>) is limited in low-grade tumors and increases with tumor aggressiveness in NB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s009">S6C Fig</xref>). This result is in agreement with our hypothesis that a functional TrkC proapoptotic pathway is associated with a favorable outcome, whereas the silencing of this pathway confers a selective advantage to NB tumors. We observed the same trend when analyzing 3 microarrays performed on other cohorts (L. Shi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref036">36</xref>], O. Delattre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref037">37</xref>], and R. Versteeg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref035">35</xref>]). Finally, a Kaplan-Meier analysis performed on the survival data of the T. Wolf cohort indicated that tumors having a functional TrkC death pathway (Group A: NT-3<sup>low</sup>, TrkC<sup>high</sup>, Hey1<sup>high</sup>) are significantly associated with a better prognosis than tumors with silenced TrkC proapoptotic pathway (Group B: NT-3<sup>low</sup>, TrkC<sup>low</sup>, Hey1<sup>low</sup>) or other types of tumors (Group C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s009">S6D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these data support the view that TrkC constrains tumor growth via Hey1- and p53-mediated apoptosis in vivo, and this proapoptotic pathway is affected in patients with high-grade tumors.</p>

<p>We previously demonstrated that, upon NT-3 deprivation, TrkC-KF is released and shuttled to the mitochondria by its proapoptotic partner, COBRA1. Once at the mitochondria, TrkC-KF and COBRA1 activate BAX and induce the MOMP and the subsequent activation of the apoptosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s010">S7 Fig</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]). With this work, we decipher the complex upstream mechanisms involved in TrkC-induced cell death. TrkC-KF is translocated in the nucleus via importins and interacts there with Hey1. Hey1 and TrkC-KF interact and jointly bind to <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter E-box, in which TrkC-KF favors Hey1 repressor function on <italic>MDM2</italic> transcription. <italic>MDM2</italic> transcriptional inhibition promotes p53 stabilization and thus apoptosis. p53 target genes include COBRA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref029">29</xref>] and BAX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref031">31</xref>]. We show here that forced expression of TrkC-KF and Hey1 is associated with enhanced p53 binding to <italic>COBRA1</italic>- and <italic>BAX</italic>-respective promoters. Furthermore, we show that COBRA1 expression is enhanced by the activation of the TrkC/Hey1/p53 pathway. When this pathway is altered by Hey1 silencing, the supply of COBRA1 by transient transfection is sufficient to restore TrkC-induced apoptosis. Therefore, the nuclear function of TrkC-KF may not only lead to apoptosis through classic p53 effectors but also through the enhancement of the TrkC mitochondrial pathway by the transcriptional supply of its interactors. Similar fine regulation of proapoptotic protein amounts released in the cytoplasm has indeed already been described for p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>NB tumors derive from the sympathoadrenal lineage originating from the neural crest cells (NCCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref039">39</xref>]. NCCs contribute to the formation of the peripheric ganglia, the sympathetic and sensory ganglia, and the medullary region of the adrenal gland. The adequate number of neuronal precursors in the forming ganglia during peripheric nervous development is tightly regulated by peaks of programmed cell death controlled by neurotrophin amounts in the close proximity of the precursors that express at their surface the corresponding neurotrophin receptors (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref040">40</xref>]). This mechanism of programmed cell death is crucial during gangliogenesis. Indeed, an aberrant number of neuronal precursors in ganglia favors the development of NB, as already observed in mice bearing NB-driving mutations. As a first example, MycN is expressed by migrating NCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref041">41</xref>], and mice having a forced expression of MycN in the sympathetic lineage (TH-MycN) display a hyperplasia of paravertebral ganglia neuroblasts, which are resistant to NGF deprivation–induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref043">43</xref>]. In parallel, mice bearing a mutation identified in sporadic and familial cases of NB, anaplastic lymphoma kinase F1178L (ALK<sup>F1178L</sup>), present a higher number of sympathetic neuroblasts per ganglion than wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref044">44</xref>]. These studies illustrate the crucial need to clearly identify the actors, which define the adequate number of precursors in the peripheric ganglia. It has been well established that NT-3 and TrkC control the adequate number of precursors in the developing sensory ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref045">45</xref>]. We have shown in primary sensory neurons and in the chick embryo model that part of the apoptosis occurring upon NT-3 deprivation during neurodevelopment is actively triggered by TrkC itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref009">9</xref>] via COBRA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref013">13</xref>]. Interestingly, Kessler and collaborators observed that the constitutive up-regulation of Hey1 expression in mutant mice results in a significant loss of TrkC positive sensory neurons. Conversely, Hey1 mutant mice display an increased number of TrkC-positive sensory neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref046">46</xref>]. These observations are consistent with the fact that TrkC may trigger apoptosis via Hey1 in supernumerary neurons in a setting where the amount of NT-3 is limited. We decipher in this study the mechanisms that may underlie this process.</p>
<p>Along this line, Barde and collaborators demonstrated in murine models that TrkA and TrkC constrain the adequate number of peripheric neurons during development by actively triggering apoptosis when deprived of their respective ligands, NGF and NT-3. Conversely, TrkB has no proapoptotic activity in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref010">10</xref>]. Interestingly, TrkA and TrkC expression have long been associated with regressing NB tumors, whereas TrkB expression is a marker of poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref002">2</xref>]. We have demonstrated here and in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref012">12</xref>] that TrkC proapoptotic activity controls NB tumor progression. It would be of interest to determine whether TrkA and TrkC proapoptotic activity also controls NB tumor initiation in eliminating supernumerary neuroblasts or neurons in the peripheric ganglia.</p>
<p>In their study, Barde and colleagues suggested that p75<sup>NTR</sup> intracellular domain mediated TrkA and TrkC proapoptotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref010">10</xref>]. In our N2A cellular model, p75<sup>NTR</sup> is not required by TrkC to trigger apoptosis. Moreover, we were able to trigger apoptosis in 3 independent NB cell lines (SHEP, LAN6, and CLB-Ga) displaying various patterns of expression of neurotrophins and their receptors. Further investigations would be needed to investigate the putative interactions between neurotrophin receptors in the control of NB tumor progression.</p>
<p>With this work, we have confirmed in vivo that the TrkC/Hey1/p53 proapoptotic pathway indeed limits NB tumor growth. p53 and its inhibitor MDM2 have been particularly studied in NB (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref047">47</xref>]). However, while mutations in p53 are generally considered to affect half of human adult cancers, pediatric cancers are characterized by the lack of p53 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref050">50</xref>]. More specifically, in NB, p53 is mutated in less than 1% of the tumors at diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref051">51</xref>]. Tumors with wild-type p53 probably rely on other mechanisms to inactivate p53, and it is thus of interest to note that in pediatric tumors, and more specifically in NB, MDM2 is frequently up-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref052">52</xref>]. In the present study, we analyzed the transcriptomic public data sets available and showed that the silencing of TrkC proapoptotic pathway (NT-3<sup>low</sup>, TrkC<sup>low</sup>, HEY<sup>low</sup>) is also associated with poor patient outcome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002912.s009">S6 Fig</xref>). In parallel, TrkC expression has been shown to be epigenetically controlled in various cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002912.ref006">6</xref>]. It is thus tempting to investigate whether reactivating TrkC proapoptotic activity in these patients with p53 wild-type tumors may constitute an interesting therapeutic strategy.</p>

<title>Schematic representation of TrkC proapoptotic pathway.</title>
<p>When TrkC is deprived of its ligand, its intracellular domain is double cleaved by caspase, and the released fragment is called TrkC-KF. TrkC-KF is shuttled into the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1 bHLH transcription factor. Hey1 and TrkC-KF bind jointly on <italic>MDM2</italic> promoter and deregulate MDM2 expression, consequently stabilizing p53. Among other putative functions, p53 transactivates the expression of COBRA1 and BAX. COBRA1 shuttles TrkC-KF to the mitochondria where it activates BAX, induces MOMP, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> release, and the subsequent apoptosome activation.
