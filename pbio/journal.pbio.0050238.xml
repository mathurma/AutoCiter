				<article-title>How and Why Does a Fly Turn Its Immune System Off?</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The activation of several transcription factors is required for the elimination of infectious pathogens via the innate immune response. The transcription factors NF-κB, AP-1, and STAT play major roles in the synthesis of immune effector molecules during innate immune responses. However, the fact that these immune responses can have cytotoxic effects requires their tight regulation to achieve restricted and transient activation, and mis-regulation of the damping process has pathological consequences. Here we show that AP-1 and STAT are themselves the major inhibitors responsible for damping NF-κB–mediated transcriptional activation during the innate immune response in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. As the levels of dAP-1 and Stat92E increase due to continuous immune signaling, they play a repressive role by forming a repressosome complex with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> HMG protein, Dsp1. The dAP-1–, Stat92E-, and Dsp1-containing complexes replace Relish at the promoters of diverse immune effector genes by binding to evolutionarily conserved <italic>cis</italic>-elements, and they recruit histone deacetylase to inhibit transcription. Reduction by mutation of dAP-1, Stat92E, or Dsp1 results in hyperactivation of Relish target genes and reduces the viability of bacterially infected flies despite more efficient pathogen clearance. These defects are rescued by reducing the Relish copy number, thus confirming that mis-regulation of Relish, not inadequate activation of dAP-1, Stat92E, or Dsp1 target genes, is responsible for the reduced survival of the mutants. We conclude that an inhibitory effect of AP-1 and STAT on NF-κB is required for properly balanced immune responses and appears to be evolutionarily conserved.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>The immune response is designed to target foreign infectious elements, not self, but it can become destructive when it fails to discriminate self from nonself. Therefore, it is important to restrain the magnitude and duration of the immune response by several mechanisms including receptor down-regulation and inhibitor synthesis. Here, focusing on the immune system of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we present a mechanism of control that relies on the transcription factors AP-1 and STAT to prevent the excessive activation of the NF-κB–mediated immune response. Thus, AP-1 and STAT, renowned for their role in activating the NF-κB–mediated immune response, appear also to participate in its attenuation. In their role as negative regulators, AP-1 and STAT form a complex with HMG protein and HDAC. This complex is then recruited to the promoter regions of NF-κB target genes, causing the chromatin structure near the NF-κB target genes to contract and the expression of NF-κB target genes to shut down. Mis-regulation of this negative-feedback process, we found, increased the lethality of bacterial infection in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A similar scenario has been noted in mammals with over-activated NF-κB–mediated immune responses, which has been implicated in autoimmune disease. Thus, feedback inhibition of NF-κB appears to be evolutionarily conserved to maintain properly balanced immune responses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The innate immune response triggered by pathogen infection activates signal transduction pathways and elicits diverse humoral and cellular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b002">2</xref>]. This response requires the activation of several transcription factors to remodel the gene expression pattern of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b003">3</xref>]. NF-κB plays a key role in the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b005">5</xref>], whereas the transcription factors AP-1 and STAT regulate genes involved in phagocytosis and melanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b008">8</xref>]. Nuclear receptors and SMAD proteins also influence the expression of inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b010">10</xref>]. In many cases, the functions of these transcription factors do not appear to be limited to the synthesis of particular effector molecules, but also regulate the activities of other transcription factors involved in such biological processes as immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b012">12</xref>]. For example, AP-1 transcription factors are reported to interact with the histone deacetylase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b013">13</xref>] and to suppress Smad2 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b014">14</xref>]. Stat1 is required for the interferon-γ suppression of c-<italic>myc</italic> expression in mouse embryo fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b015">15</xref>]. In addition, NF-κB–dependent Fas transcription is down-regulated by the suppressive action of c-Jun and STAT3 in human melanoma-derived cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b016">16</xref>], and NF-κB bound to the <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Il12b</italic> promoters is gradually replaced by ATF3, which interacts with AP-1 and STAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b017">17</xref>]. These interactions play key roles in the proper maintenance and termination of immune responses. However, the precise nature of the positive or negative cross-talk between these transcription factors is still unclear, as is the physiological role of such cross-talk in the innate immune response. To address these issues, we examined positive and negative interactions between transcription factors during the response to lipopolysaccharide/peptidoglycan (LPS/PGN). We found that two transcription factors, dAP-1 and Stat92E, which are activated by LPS/PGN-induced signal transduction pathways, form a repressosome complex together with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> HMG protein, Dsp1 (dorsal switch protein) and histone deacetylase, and this then inhibits transcription of diverse immune effector genes activated by Relish. We also found that mis-regulation of negative cross-talk increased the lethality of bacterial infection in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as has been noted in mammals with over-activated NF-κB–mediated immune responses. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of this repressosome complex on NF-κB plays an important role in maintaining properly balanced immune responses and appears to be evolutionarily conserved.</p>

        <title>Requirement for Stat92E and Jra for Down-Regulating Relish Target Genes</title>
        <p>To test for the presence of regulatory cross-talk between the signaling pathways of innate immunity, we examined the involvement of key transcription factors (Relish, Jra, Stat92E, Mad, and EcR) in LPS/PGN-induced immune responses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To this end, we knocked down each transcription factor by RNA interference (RNAi), and examined its effect on the LPS/PGN-induced transcriptional activation of <italic>Attacin-A, Puckered,</italic> and <italic>CG15097</italic>, the known targets of transcription factors Relish, dAP-1 and Stat92E, respectively. LPS/PGN-induced transcriptional activation of <italic>Attacin-A, Puckered,</italic> and <italic>CG15097</italic> was abolished only by depletion of the corresponding transcription factor, and no obvious transcriptional defect was observed as a result of depletion of Mad or EcR (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SMAD and nuclear receptor, respectively). Intriguingly, Relish-dependent transcriptional activation of <italic>Attacin-A</italic> was hyperactivated in the absence of Jra or Stat92E. The repressive effect of Stat92E on Relish-dependent transcription required the activated form of Stat92E, because knock-down of <italic>Hopscotch</italic> resulted in an increase of LPS/PGN-induced <italic>Attacin-A</italic> expression comparable to that in the Stat92E-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050238-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, the Relish-dependent transcriptional activation of <italic>Attacin-A</italic> appears to be down-regulated by activated Stat92E as well as Jra during the innate immune response.</p>

        <title>Recruitment of Stat92E to the Relish-Dependent Promoter</title>
        <p>To examine whether the activated form of Stat92E exerts its repressive role directly by binding to the promoter of <italic>Attacin-A,</italic> we examined the upstream regions of the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> genes of a number of <italic>Drosophila</italic> species to identify evolutionarily conserved Stat92E and other transcription factor binding motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050238-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Sequence alignment revealed several strongly conserved regions: in addition to the core promoter elements (TATA and initiator motifs), we identified a Relish-binding motif (−140 bp), a GATA motif (−130 bp), and a dAP-1–binding motif (−90 bp), along with a highly conserved region (region Y at −45 bp) upstream of the TATA box. Intriguingly, this region contains an Relish-binding motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b018">18</xref>] that overlaps with a sequence showing weak homology to the STAT consensus binding sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b019">19</xref>] in the opposite strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). To test for binding of these motifs by the corresponding transcription factors, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with a probe spanning region Y, and we compared the results with those obtained with a probe for the distal Relish-binding motif. LPS/PGN treatment of SL2 cells led to strong mobility shifts of both probes, and these were competed out by an excess of cold probe (unpublished data). Because the region Y probe contained both the Relish- and Stat92E-binding motifs, the addition of a specific antibody against one or other of these transcription factors resulted in supershifting only a portion of the shifted bands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050238-sg003">Figure S3</xref> and unpublished data). Therefore, we confirmed the identity of the protein(s) bound to each probe by repeating the EMSAs after depleting Relish or Stat92E, or both, by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The LPS/PGN-induced mobility shift of the distal Relish probe (Relish1) was lost when Relish was depleted but not when Stat92E was depleted, whereas the shift of the region Y probe was only abolished when both Relish and Stat92E were depleted, indicating that both transcription factors bind to their putative binding sites in this probe. This interpretation was confirmed by showing that the LPS/PGN-induced mobility shift was not affected by mutations affecting only the Relish or the Stat92E binding sequence, but was abolished when both binding sequences were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Moreover the Stat92E mutant probe was not shifted in Relish-depleted extracts, and the Relish2 mutant probe was not shifted in Stat92E-depleted extracts. These results establish that region Y contains genuine Relish- and Stat92E-binding sites.</p>

        <p>We also generated luciferase reporters under the control of the mutant versions of the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter and examined LPS/PGN-induced luciferase activities after transient transfection of the reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Mutation of either of the Relish-binding motifs inhibited transcription from the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter such that no (Relish1 mutation) or only weak (Relish2 mutation) luciferase activity was detected. In contrast, mutation of the Stat92E- or dAP-1-binding motifs resulted in at least 3-fold higher luciferase activities than obtained with the wild-type promoter. This result, along with the result from EMSAs, demonstrates that the defects in the binding of Relish, Jra, and Stat92E to their binding motifs in the promoter result in altered <italic>Attacin-A</italic> transcription. Therefore, both Jra and Stat92E appear to down-regulate genes activated by Relish in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns.</p>

        <title>Interdependence of Jra and Stat92E for Stable Binding to the Relish Target Promoter</title>
        <p>To test whether similar transcription factor binding occurs in a chromosomal context, we examined the recruitment of transcription factors by means of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. These experiments showed that LPS/PGN treatment induced the synthesis and nuclear translocation of Relish, Jra, and Stat92E and their binding to the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Relish knock-down reduced Relish without affecting the binding of the other transcription factor. On the other hand, depletion of Jra caused the loss not only of its own binding but also of that of Stat92E, and vice versa, indicating that Jra and Stat92E bind synergistically to the Relish target promoter. This co-occupancy of the promoter by Jra and Stat92E may elicit the repressive function of the transcription factors. As shown previously, dHDAC1 is also recruited to the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter after LPS/PGN-treatment, and this also requires concurrent binding of Stat92E and Jra. Knock-down of EcR or Mad had no effect on recruitment of Relish, Jra, Stat92E, and dHDAC1 (unpublished data).</p>

        <p>The recruitment of dHDAC1 to the promoter bound by both transcription factors suggested that some factor, such as an HMG protein, is required to mediate the interactions between the transcription factors and histone deacetylase. We therefore examined the requirement for <italic>Drosophila</italic> HMG proteins (Dsp1, HmgD, and HmgZ) for the Jra- and Stat92E-mediated down-regulation of <italic>Attacin-A</italic> transcription. Depletion of Dsp1 mimicked the effect of Jra knock-down, whereas knock-down of HmgD or HmgZ had no detectable effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In addition, depletion of Dsp1 prevented the LPS/PGN-induced binding of Jra, Stat92E, and dHDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Interestingly, ChIP with antibody to Dsp1 revealed that Dsp1 was recruited to the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter by LPS/PGN treatment, and this was completely dependent on Jra and Stat92E, suggesting that Dsp1 is specifically localized to the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter region in response to LPS/PGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). To test this idea, we performed ChIP assays with antibodies against Dsp1, Relish, and Jra, monitoring the upstream region of <italic>Attacin-A</italic> from −1.2 kb to the coding sequence. The amount of chromatin co-precipitated with anti-Dsp1, anti-Relish, or anti-Jun antibodies reached a peak in the region 150 base pairs (bp) upstream from the transcription initiation site where the canonical Relish and dAP-1 binding motifs are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Moreover we found a putative Dsp1 binding site (GAAAA) within this region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050238-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).

Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Jra, Stat92E, and Dsp1, but not Relish, were co-precipitated from LPS/PGN-treated SL2 cells in a dHDAC1-containing complex by antibody against any one of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). These interactions do not appear to be mediated by DNA, because the addition of a high concentration of ethidium bromide to the extracts did not affect their co-immunoprecipitation (unpublished data). Similar immunoprecipitation experiments with nuclear extracts of non–LPS/PGN-treated SL2 cells brought down only trace amounts of the corresponding transcription factors. We conclude that LPS/PGN treatment induces activation and nuclear transport of Relish, as well as the formation of a complex containing Jra, Stat92E, Dsp1, and dHDAC1.</p>

        <p>The formation of a dHDAC1-containing complex with Stat92E and Jra prompted us to examine the possibility that Jra, Stat92E, or Dsp1 are modified in some way during LPS/PGN signaling. However, we failed to detect any LPS/PGN-induced mobility shift of these factors by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by Western analysis (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>To investigate whether an increase in the levels of Jra, Stat92E, and Dsp1 upon LPS/PGN treatment is instead the major determinant of repressosome formation, we set up a system in which <italic>Attacin-A</italic> transcription was driven by overexpression of the Relish N-terminal domain (Rel-ΔC) without the need for LPS/PGN treatment. We found that in this system, ectopic overexpression of Jra and Stat92E down-regulated <italic>Attacin-A</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), and ChIP with antibody to dHDAC1 revealed that histone deacetylase was only recruited to the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter when Jra and Stat92E were overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).

        <title>Displacement of Relish from the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> Promoter by a Repressosome Complex</title>
        <p>To investigate the relationship between occupation of the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter by the repressosome complex and by Relish, we examined the binding kinetics of these transcription factors to the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). The ChIP results showed that both Relish and the repressosome complex were recruited to the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter by 15 min after LPS/PGN treatment. Sustained incubation with LPS/PGN (8 h) resulted in loss of the Relish binding without loss of Jra and Stat92E binding. To examine whether Relish co-occupies the promoter with the repressosome complex during the early stage of LPS/PGN induction, we analyzed the chromatin fragments precipitated with antibody to Relish for the presence of the repressosome complex by means of a second ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050238-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Sequential ChIPs revealed that the Relish-bound <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter was devoid of Jra, Stat92E, and Dsp1, and that the Jra-associated <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter was devoid of Relish. Therefore, Relish and the Jra/Stat92E/Dsp1 repressosome complex occupy the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter in a mutually exclusive fashion. These results indicate that Relish is displaced from the <italic>Attacin-A</italic> promoter by the repressosome complex, and that this results in the termination of transcriptional activation. Based on these observations, we postulate that at the outset of LPS/PGN-induced activation, only processed Relish is available to activate transcription; but as the newly synthesized and translocated Jra, Stat92E, and Dsp1 accumulate inside the nucleus, they form a repressosome complex and displace Relish from the promoter to terminate transcription.</p>

        <p>The Jra/Stat92E/Dsp1/dHDAC1-mediated down-regulation of Relish-driven transcription does not appear to be limited to the <italic>Attacin-A</italic>.

Although the suppressive effect on the expression of other AMP genes was relatively small, the repressosome complex appears to down-regulate their expression in some degree. Considering that <italic>Drosomycin</italic> is activated mainly by Dif rather than Relish, this result suggests that the repressosome activity may vary depending on the types of NF-κB homologs present at the target gene promoters. Consistently, we found that both Jra and Stat92E binding sites as well as the NF-κB binding sequence exist on the promoter regions of these antimicrobial peptide genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050238-sg004">Figure S4</xref>).

Under conditions of bacterial infection that enabled most wild-type flies to survive but killed most Relish homozygotes within 4 d, the Stat92E RNAi mutant flies, the Jra heterozygotes, and the Dsp1 homozygotes all displayed reduced survival comparable to Relish heterozygotes (50% survived beyond 4 d). The increased mortality of the mutants appears to result from the immune response of the flies against the bacterial infection. No obvious survival defect was observed when phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected instead of bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050238-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). Most importantly, combining Relish heterozygosity with mutations of Stat92E, Jra, or Dsp1 overcame the lethal consequence of bacterial infection rather than aggravating them. Hence, the increased vulnerability to infection of the Stat92E, Jra, and Dsp1 mutants is due to excessive activation of Relish target genes rather than to reduced activation of Stat92E, Jra, or Dsp1 target genes. Therefore, we conclude that down-regulation of NF-κB by the Jra/Stat92E/Dsp1-containing repressosome complex also occurs under physiological conditions and plays an important physiological role.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>An excessive inflammatory response is harmful to the host; it can even be fatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b024">24</xref>] and must be prevented by negative-feedback mechanisms. Several such mechanisms, which mainly function by reducing NF-κB activation, have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b025">25</xref>], but little is known of their underlying mechanisms. Our demonstration that AP-1 and STAT are directly involved in down-regulating NF-κB illustrates the context-dependent use of transcription factors to achieve fine control of gene expression.</p>
      <p>Ligand-induced conformational changes have been implicated in switching nuclear receptors from activators to repressors; however, it is not clear what makes other types of transcription factors act sometimes as activators and other times as repressors. We have shown above that a specific HMG protein functions as a core element nucleating the assembly of a repressor complex of AP-1, STAT, and HDAC1. The mammalian homolog of Dsp1, HMGB1, binds to a negative regulatory element adjacent to the NF-κB binding site in the interferon-beta enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b026">26</xref>], and Dsp1 is a co-repressor that converts Dorsal from activator to repressor by binding to G(A) motifs adjacent to Dorsal binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b027">27</xref>–-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b029">29</xref>]. Dsp1 is also required for correct expression of homeotic genes, and to recruit polycomb group proteins to polycomb and trithorax response elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b030">30</xref>]. Evidently, the role of Dsp1 is to facilitate the formation of repressor complexes on NF-κB–dependent promoters.</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy that a different HMG protein, HMG-Y/I, forms repressosomes with the transcription factors NF-Y and BTEB-1 that represses transcription of a growth hormone receptor gene by recruiting the histone deacetylase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b031">31</xref>]. This suggests that different HMG proteins associate with different transcription factors to regulate particular groups of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b033">33</xref>]. Thus, the role of Dsp1 in forming a repressosome complex with AP-1 and STAT that inhibits specific types of NF-κB target promoters is one instance of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. It may be a key NF-κB pathway regulatory mechanism, assuring an appropriate immune response.</p>
      <p>It is well established that JNK and JAK/STAT signaling are involved in innate <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b035">35</xref>]. Because the JNK pathway is primarily involved in cellular processes such as phagocytosis, wound healing, melanization, and defense against extracellular pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b039">39</xref>], our observation of increased lethality of the Jra mutant upon bacterial infection is unlikely to be due exclusively to malfunction of the repressosome complex. Nevertheless, the repressosome complex may well be an important component of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune responses, since many Stat92E and Dsp1 mutant flies die upon bacterial infection, and this enhanced lethality was reversed by reducing Relish copy number. We propose that JNK participates in cellular immune responses and also forms a repressosome complex with Stat92E, Dsp1, and dHDAC1 that restricts the production of antimicrobial peptides.</p>
      <p>Recently, Delaney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b040">40</xref>] have claimed that JNK is required for the synthesis of antimicrobial peptide genes upon bacterial infection of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This claim conflicts with our results and also with a report that JNK activity is reduced by activation of NF-κB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b011">11</xref>]. In the latter work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b011">11</xref>], it was shown that expression of <italic>Attacin-A</italic> was enhanced by knock-down of JNK. The discrepancy between Delaney's result and ours may be due to differences between the mutants or methods used in the two studies. First, the extent of knock-down of gene activities differed: in our study, we reduced the expression of various genes (Jra, dJNK, and Stat92E) by conditional knock-down or by reducing copy number (Jra), whereas Delaney et al. clonally deleted dJNK and Jra and overexpressed a JNK inhibitor (Puc), and these procedures may have affected an essential function of the JNK pathway required for Relish-mediated transcriptional activation. Another possible explanation of the discrepancy derives from the use of different Jra alleles in the two studies. Unlike flies carrying the <italic>Jra<sup>1A109</sup>/CyO</italic> allele used by us, the heterozygous mutant flies carrying the <italic>Jra<sup>1</sup>/CyO</italic> allele used by Delaney et al. did not show any defect in Relish-dependent transcriptional activation of AMP genes even when they were examined under our experimental conditions. According to FlyBase, the truncated protein is stopped at the 177th amino acid in the <italic>Jra<sup>1</sup>/CyO</italic> allele and at the 72nd amino acid in the <italic>Jra<sup>1A109</sup>/CyO</italic> allele. The reason of the different lesions between two alleles needs further investigation.</p>
      <p>With regard to the role of the JAK/STAT pathway in innate immunity in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> JAK/STAT pathway mutants have only been reported to have defects in antiviral responses and hemocyte function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b035">35</xref>]. Though there have been efforts to identify the role of JAK/STAT in the innate immune response by genome-wide RNAi screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b042">42</xref>], the basis of the precise regulation of immune responses by this essential transcription factor remains unclear. Ours is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that the JAK/STAT pathway regulates the synthesis of antimicrobial peptide genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Intriguingly, Agaisse and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b034">34</xref>] found that expression of <italic>Drosomycin</italic> was enhanced upon bacterial infection in a loss-of- function mutant of Hopscotch. This finding is supported by our observation that functional Stat92E negatively regulates the synthesis of Relish-dependent antimicrobial peptides by forming a complex with Jra and Dsp1.</p>

To examine the effect of Stat92E knock-down in Relish heterozygotes, a Rel<sup>E20</sup> homozygote was crossed with <italic>UAS-shStat92E</italic> homozygous flies to generate <italic>UAS-shStat92E/+; Rel/+</italic> double heterozygous progeny. <italic>UAS-shStat92E/+; Rel/+</italic> double heterozygous females were crossed with <italic>da-Gal4</italic> homozygous males to generate <italic>UAS-shStat92E/+; Rel/da-Gal4</italic> triple heterozygous progeny or exposed to heat shock to generate <italic>UAS-hs-shStat92E/+; Rel/+</italic> mutants. Knock-down of Stat92E expression in the transgenic flies was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis and immunoblotting with Stat92E antibody.</p>
        <p>Jra mutants flies <italic>(Jra<sup>1A109</sup>/CyO)</italic> were obtained from D. Bohmann (University of Rochester Medical Center, United States). Because the Jra mutation was homozygous-lethal, Jra heterozygotes <italic>(Jra<sup>1A109</sup>/CyO)</italic> were crossed with Rel homozygotes <italic>(Rel/Rel)</italic> to generate <italic>Jra<sup>1A109</sup>/+; Rel/+</italic> flies. Dsp1 mutant flies <italic>(Dsp1[EP355]/Dsp1[EP355])</italic> were obtained from the Bloomington stock center. A Dsp1 homozygous female <italic>(Dsp1[EP355]/Dsp1[EP355])</italic> was crossed with a Rel homozygous male <italic>(Rel/Rel)</italic> to generate <italic>Dsp1[EP355]/Y; Rel/+</italic> male flies. Knock-down of Jra or Dsp1 expression in the transgenic flies was confirmed by Western blotting with Jun or Dsp1 antibody.</p>

        <title>Infection experiments.</title>
        <p>The systemic response was triggered by pricking adult flies in the thorax with a thin tungsten needle dipped in a concentrated culture of <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> or by injecting an <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> suspension into adult flies with a pulled glass needle using a Picospritzer III injector (Parker Hannifin; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.parker.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.parker.com</ext-link>). The glass needle was placed on the ventrolateral surface of the anterior abdomen as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050238-b048">48</xref>]. For infection with bacteria, 3- to 4-d-old adult flies (15 males and 15 females) were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and injected with a concentrated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> culture resuspended (1–5 nl; optical density = 200) in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). To study survival after infection, the injected flies were kept at 25 and the number of surviving flies was scored at 1-d intervals. Survival curves were plotted as Kaplan-Meier plots. Statistical significance was tested using log-rank analysis with MedCare software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medcare.be" xlink:type="simple">http://www.medcare.be</ext-link>). To study bacterial clearance, flies after infection were homogenized in 100 μl of LB containing 1% Triton X-100 with a small pestle, and the homogenate was assayed by plating on LB-agar. These experiments were repeated at least four times.</p>
