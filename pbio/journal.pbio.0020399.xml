				<article-title>In Times of Stress, Mutate Early and Often</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>“Adaptive mutation” denotes a collection of processes in which cells respond to growth-limiting environments by producing compensatory mutants that grow well, apparently violating fundamental principles of evolution. In a well-studied model, starvation of stationary-phase <italic>lac<sup>−</sup> Escherichia coli</italic> cells on lactose medium induces Lac<sup>+</sup> revertants at higher frequencies than predicted by usual mutation models. These revertants carry either a compensatory frameshift mutation or a greater than 20-fold amplification of the leaky <italic>lac</italic> allele. A crucial distinction between alternative hypotheses for the mechanisms of adaptive mutation hinges on whether these amplification and frameshift mutation events are distinct, or whether amplification is a molecular intermediate, producing an intermediate cell type, in colonies on a pathway to frameshift mutation. The latter model allows the evolutionarily conservative idea of increased mutations (per cell) without increased mutation rate (by virtue of extra gene copies per cell), whereas the former requires an increase in mutation rate, potentially accelerating evolution. To resolve these models, we probed early events leading to rare adaptive mutations and report several results that show that amplification is not the precursor to frameshift mutation but rather is an independent adaptive outcome. (i) Using new high-resolution selection methods and stringent analysis of all cells in very young (micro)colonies (500–10,000 cells), we find that most mutant colonies contain no detectable <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells, in contrast with previous reports. (ii) Analysis of nascent colonies, as young as the two-cell stage, revealed mutant Lac<sup>+</sup> cells with no <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells present. (iii) Stringent colony-fate experiments show that microcolonies of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells grow to form visible colonies of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified, not mutant, cells. (iv) Mutant cells do not overgrow <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells in microcolonies fast enough to mask the <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells. (v) <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells are not SOS-induced, as was proposed to explain elevated mutation in a sequential model. (vi) Amplification, and not frameshift mutation, requires DNA polymerase I, demonstrating that mutation is separable from amplification, and also illuminating the amplification mechanism. We conclude that amplification and mutation are independent outcomes of adaptive genetic change. We suggest that the availability of alternative pathways for genetic/evolutionary adaptation and clonal expansion under stress may be exploited during processes ranging from the evolution of drug resistance to cancer progression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Adaptive mutation was first brought to wide attention by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Cairns2">Cairns et al. (1988)</xref>, and encompasses a collection of processes whereby cells adapt genetically in response to growth-limiting environments. The phenomenon is reported in several different microbial systems, and appears to occur via different molecular mechanisms (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hersh1">Hersh et al. 2004</xref>). The Lac frameshift assay system of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Cairns1">Cairns and Foster 1991</xref>) is the best understood in terms of mutation mechanism (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Foster3">Foster 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hersh1">Hersh et al. 2004</xref>). In this system, cells carrying a +1 frameshift mutation in <italic>lac</italic> genes on an F′ conjugative plasmid are starved on solid medium with lactose as the sole carbon source, selecting Lac<sup>+</sup> revertants. Lac<sup>+</sup> clones appear over time during selection in a population of cells that shows no net growth (i.e., is in stationary phase). In most clones, Lac<sup>+</sup> is conferred by a compensatory −1 frameshift mutation in the <italic>lac</italic> gene (Lac<sup>+</sup> point mutants). Lac<sup>+</sup> point mutation during stationary phase differs from mutation during rapid growth in that it requires the recombination proteins RecA, RecBC, RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Harris2">Harris et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Harris3">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Foster6">Foster et al. 1996</xref>), and induction of the SOS DNA damage response regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Cairns1">Cairns and Foster 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie1">McKenzie et al. 2000</xref>), particularly error-prone DNA polymerase (Pol) IV (DinB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie2">McKenzie et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie3">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Wolff1">Wolff et al. 2004</xref>). The <italic>lac</italic> frameshift allele is leaky, conferring 1%–2% of the wild-type level of β-galactosidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Foster1">Foster 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>), and Lac<sup>+</sup> colonies can also occur by amplification of the <italic>lac</italic> locus into a tandem array of 20–100 copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Foster1">Foster 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>). Adaptive amplification requires RpoS, the transcriptional activator of approximately 50 stationary-phase/starvation- and general-stress-response-specific genes, which is also required for point mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Lombardo1">Lombardo et al. 2004</xref>). Amplification does not require DinB or induction of other SOS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie2">McKenzie et al. 2001</xref>), and whether or not it requires recombination proteins has not been determined unambiguously (Tlsty et al. 1984; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings1">Hastings and Rosenberg 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Consistent with Darwinian principles of evolution by selection of undirected and random genetic changes, adaptive point mutation in the Lac system is accompanied by a high level of mutation in genes unrelated to lactose catabolism (secondary mutation). Lac<sup>+</sup> point mutants show about 50-fold more secondary mutations than do cells starved on the same plate that did not become Lac<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Torkelson1">Torkelson et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosche1">Rosche and Foster 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Godoy1">Godoy et al. 2000</xref>). This indicates that a subpopulation of the starved cells experiences a transient episode of hypermutation (adaptive point mutants are not mutator mutants; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Torkelson1">Torkelson et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg6">Rosenberg et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosche1">Rosche and Foster 1999</xref>). In keeping with their independence of DinB and SOS, the amplified clones do not show hypermutation of unrelated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>). These differences, together with the finding that cells carrying <italic>lac</italic> amplification (“<italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells”) do not readily yield Lac<sup>+</sup> point mutants when resubjected to selection on lactose medium, led us to propose that amplification reflects a pathway of genetic change wholly or partly separate from point mutation (we suggested an alternative outcome of a branched pathway; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings1">Hastings and Rosenberg 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Two general models for the adaptive point mutation mechanism in this system are currently at odds, each focused on the role of DNA amplification, and each representing a different view of evolution (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg3">Rosenberg and Hastings 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg4">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Roth1">Roth and Andersson 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Roth2">2004b</xref>). In “hypermutation models,” the observed high frequency of Lac<sup>+</sup> point mutants is proposed to result from transient hypermutation as part of a stress response, one consequence of which is acceleration of genetic change (and so potentially of evolution) (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg 2001</xref>, and below, where specific molecular mechanisms are suggested). In this view, amplification is an adaptive pathway alternative to point mutation that allows growth of cells, relieving the stress of starvation, and so deflects them from the point mutation route. This view is compatible with Darwinism, which allows for changing rates of generation of heritable variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Darwin1">Darwin 1859</xref>).</p>
      <p>In an alternative model, called “amplification–mutagenesis,” amplification is an intermediate in the formation of Lac<sup>+</sup> point mutants, and its most important role is to provide more <italic>lac</italic> copies per cell so that point mutation can occur without increase in mutation rate per copy of <italic>lac</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>). This adheres to conservative neo-Darwinist ideas of constant and gradual evolutionary change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Mayr1">Mayr 1982</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we report several experiments that demonstrate that amplification and point mutation are separate adaptive outcomes, compatible with hypermutation models, and not part of a sequential pathway leading to mutation (as in the amplification–mutagenesis model). We also report the first genetic requirement specific to the adaptive amplification pathway, Pol I.</p>

        <title>Colony Phenotypes</title>
        <p>Experiments described below make use of the different colony color phenotypes of point-mutant and <italic>lac</italic>-amplified clones grown on rich medium with the dye 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside (X-gal) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Tlsty1">Tlsty et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We use the word “sectored” to describe the appearance of a colony of cells on X-gal medium (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">1</xref>C). The word “unstable” is used to denote continued sectoring when cells from sectored colonies are replated. This instability has been shown in many examples to reflect tandem amplification of the <italic>lac</italic> region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Tlsty1">Tlsty et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Foster1">Foster 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>). Sectoring that is not unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) may reflect incidental juxtaposition of blue and white colonies on a plate (see below). “Stable” describes the absence of visible sectoring that indicates Lac<sup>+</sup> point mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Tlsty1">Tlsty et al. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p>

        <title>Most Microcolonies Are Pure, Not Mixed</title>
        <p>If most adaptive point mutants arise by mutation in young colonies carrying <italic>lac</italic> amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>), then young colonies should contain both the <italic>lac</italic>-amplified progenitor cells and their point-mutant descendants, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al.

To determine whether a microcolony carries point-mutant or <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells or both, in principle, one picks the microcolony from the lactose-minimal selection medium and replates its cells onto rich X-gal medium to observe whether the resulting colonies are pure blue (point mutant), unstable sectoring (<italic>lac-</italic>amplified), or both. A significant problem in interpreting data from such analyses is that the picked microcolony carries with it many Lac<sup>−</sup> background cells from the selection plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and may contain cells from unrelated microcolonies, because, of necessity, these microcolonies cannot be streaked to purify them before analysis.</p>

        <p>We have improved the sensitivity of microcolony analysis substantially, first, by analyzing all cells in a microcolony (rather than a sample) and, second, by imposing stringent methods to reduce contamination of microcolonies with neighboring cells and microcolonies from the selection plate (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>). First, frameshift-bearing (tester) cells were mixed with 3% each of three or four different derivative testers that carry antibiotic resistance markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), and only microcolonies that carried one of these minority antibiotic resistance markers were analyzed to search for sectored colonies on medium carrying the antibiotic. This reduces, but does not eliminate, accidental overlap with Lac<sup>−</sup> background cells and with unrelated Lac<sup>+</sup> microcolonies accidentally harvested in the same sample (shown below). Second, because some sectored colonies are not unstable (e.g., mixtures of stable, white Lac<sup>−</sup> background cells, and blue colony formers that overlapped), all sectored colonies found were retested by plating a sample on the same X-gal antibiotic medium to determine whether there was continued instability indicative of amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Third, because the sequential model predicts that the younger the microcolony is, the greater the proportion of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells (colony-forming units [cfu]) it should contain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>), and because one might miss the putative <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cfu by not examining enough cfu per microcolony, we analyzed very young microcolonies of 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> cfu/microcolony (as compared with approximately 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/microcolony used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. [2002]</xref>) and analyzed <italic>all</italic> cfu in each of them (rather than a sample) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref> <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The results of analyzing every cell in 18 whole microcolonies of stable cells, isolated on days 3 through 6 of adaptive mutation experiments, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>. Although we found sectored colonies at frequencies of 10<sup>−2</sup>–10<sup>−3</sup> in almost all microcolonies (as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>), these sectored colonies, when replated, were almost all found to consist of cells giving rise to stable white and stable blue colonies only, indicating that these were not from <italic>lac</italic>-amplified clones (also demonstrated below). In general, we looked at 50 to 100 cells from these replated sectored colonies, but, for three of them, we screened 3,000–4,000 cells with the same result: we could find no unstable cfu within them. In contrast, cells from <italic>lac</italic>-amplified colonies, upon replating, again give rise to sectored colonies. Therefore, most of the sectored colonies that we found give no evidence of carrying amplification of the <italic>lac</italic> locus. Sectoring in these colonies may occur by chance juxtaposition of Lac<sup>+</sup> point-mutant cells with non-mutated background cells (which are numerous) during the plating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Other explanations might also be possible; however, these colonies are not <italic>lac-</italic>amplification bearers by this test and also as demonstrated in the following section. An example of such a colony is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>C. Such colonies may account for the report of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. (2002)</xref> that more than 10<sup>−3</sup> of cells in every Lac<sup>+</sup> microcolony are sectored colony formers. These sectored, non-<italic>lac</italic>-amplified colonies have also been reported by another laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Poteete1">Poteete et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
        <p>Of the 18 whole microcolonies examined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>), 16 were pure stable. One day-6 microcolony was found to contain seven unstable cfu. (Another, found on day 5, contained two cfu showing sectors of an extremely pale blue color along with sectors of the same color as the Lac<sup>−</sup> parental cells.) Those unstable cfu might be clonally related to the rest of the microcolony, or might result from chance juxtaposition of two different clones carrying the same antibiotic resistance marker. To determine the frequency at which such chance juxtapositions are expected, we analyzed the cells carried on the agar plugs on which microcolonies were harvested. We did this by plating the microcolony suspensions on medium containing an antibiotic to which cells of the microcolony were sensitive, to ascertain the frequency of marked Lac<sup>+</sup> cells that are unrelated to a microcolony but get harvested with it. The microcolony plugs contained from 900 to 7,000 antibiotic-resistant <italic>lac</italic><sup>−</sup> background cells each. Of eleven such plugs analyzed, one contained three unrelated (different antibiotic resistance) point-mutant Lac<sup>+</sup> cfu, one contained one unrelated unstable cfu, and three contained unrelated cfu of the very pale sectored phenotype described above. The presence on agar plugs of cells giving rise to sectored colonies that are unrelated to the microcolony, but occur at a frequency comparable to the frequency of unstables in a microcolony of the same antibiotic-resistance genotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>, last line), implies that the presence of unstable cfu was independent of the microcolony, and thus not relevant to the origin of the microcolony.</p>
        <p>The very pale sectored colonies that we found were examined further and were shown to be unstable upon retesting but contained no cells capable of forming colonies on lactose medium under the conditions of an adaptive mutation experiment. Presumably they contain too few copies of the <italic>lac</italic> region to allow growth on lactose medium. They might carry <italic>lac</italic> gene duplication, or tandem amplification at a very low level. In support of this possibility, we note that their pale appearance on X-gal medium is similar to known <italic>lac</italic> gene duplications of this frameshift allele that we have constructed (A. Slack and P. J. Hastings, unpublished data). Another possibility is that they contain multiple F′ plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Foster5">Foster and Rosche 1999</xref>). Their failure to form adaptive point-mutant or <italic>lac</italic>-amplified colonies shows that they do not advance to a Lac<sup>+</sup> phenotype efficiently (so are not obvious precursors to point mutation).</p>
        <p>Thus, colonies composed of a mixture of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified and point-mutant cells, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. (2002)</xref>, are not common when stringent methods of scoring are imposed, and such mixed colonies are certainly not every microcolony in which a mutation has occurred. Those apparent mixed colonies that do occur are likely to be unrelated mixtures and not relevant to the origin of the Lac<sup>+</sup> point mutants in the colony.</p>

        <title>Selection for <italic>lac-</italic>Amplified Cells in Point-Mutant Microcolonies</title>
        <p>As an independent test for the presence of rare <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells in point-mutant microcolonies, we devised a genetic selection capable of revealing single <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells among numerous non-amplified cells. The selection depends on the quantitative relationship between the number of copies of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene <italic>(cat)</italic> and the concentration of the antibiotic chloramphenicol that cells resist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Petit1">Petit et al. 1992</xref>). We inserted the <italic>cat</italic> gene into <italic>codA,</italic> about 5 kb from <italic>lac.</italic> Control experiments established that strains with <italic>lac</italic> and <italic>cat</italic> amplification (as shown by unstable phenotypes and Southern blot analyses) could grow on rich Luria-Bertani-Herskowitz medium (LBH) containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol, whereas Lac<sup>+</sup> point-mutant cells, and those amplified at <italic>lac</italic> but not at <italic>cat,</italic> did not form colonies at this concentration. We determined that 61% or more of all <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells are detected by this selection (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>The data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t002">Table 2</xref>. Among 75 Lac<sup>+</sup> point-mutant microcolonies isolated from days 4, 5, and 6 of an adaptive mutation experiment, three (4%) were found to contain a few chloramphenicol-resistant (CamR) cfu (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t002">Table 2</xref>). All of these showed the <italic>lac-</italic>amplified colony phenotype. Correction for those that would not be detected by this selection (above; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) shows that, at most, 6.6% of point-mutant microcolonies contain any <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells (and probably fewer; see below)<italic>.</italic> As discussed above, this contrasts with the report of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. (2002)</xref> that all Lac<sup>+</sup> microcolonies contain <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells. Also, these data verify independently that the high levels of sectored, but not unstable, cfu found among microcolonies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>) were not <italic>lac</italic>-amplification bearers, because most <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cfu would have scored positively in this selection.</p>

        <p>A negative control was performed by plating samples of cells from agar plugs that did not carry a microcolony visible on a dissecting microscope. Five of 70 such samples yielded one or a few cells that were <italic>lac</italic>-amplified and showed CamR. The similarity of this proportion to that for <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells in point-mutant microcolonies suggests that none of the mixtures detected represents an occurrence of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells that arose in the same cell clone as the point mutation. Thus, we conclude that few, if any, point-mutant microcolonies include <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells.</p>

        <title>Nascent Lac<sup>+</sup> Point-Mutant Colonies Do Not Contain <italic>lac</italic>-Amplified Cells</title>
        <p>The selection method described above allowed us to detect amplification in samples of stressed cells that did not include a visible microcolony. This suggested the possibility of analyzing point mutation and amplification in nascent Lac<sup>+</sup> colonies as young as the two-cell stage and up to about 40 cells. The sequential amplification–mutagenesis model demands that all colonies as young as 2–40 cells must consist only of <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells, because these are proposed not to generate Lac<sup>+</sup> point mutations until the number of <italic>lac</italic> copies reaches 10<sup>7</sup> or more (e.g., a colony of 10<sup>5</sup> cells with 100 <italic>lac</italic> copies per cell caused by amplification; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
        <p>Cells from 600 sample plugs, harvested on days 3 to 5 in two experiments, that carried no microcolony visible at 20-fold magnification were analyzed by selecting for CamR in half the sample, and Lac<sup>+</sup> phenotype in the other half.

Many more amplification events were detected by CamR selection than by growth on lactose medium (even though all were <italic>lac-</italic>amplified because of their being selected on lactose medium), implying that the CamR test is more sensitive, and capable of detecting levels of amplification that are too low to allow colony formation on lactose medium.</p>
        <p>Eight samples gave stable Lac<sup>+</sup> cells (cfu), ranging in number from one to 20 cells from half the sample (implying colonies ranging in size from 2–40 cells). None of these eight contained amplified cells, as determined by CamR, or by rescoring the lactose plates after 7 d, by which time any pre-existing <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells would have formed colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>). Thus, we see that, even at the 2- to 40-cell stage of colony growth, we are unable to detect a correlation between mutation and amplification events, and we conclude that these are independent processes. These results are incompatible with the idea that Lac<sup>+</sup> adaptive point mutants result from point mutation events in young colonies of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>).</p>

        <title><italic>lac-</italic>Amplified Microcolonies Arise Later than Point-Mutant Microcolonies</title>
        <p>If point-mutant colonies arose from <italic>lac</italic>-amplified microcolonies, the majority of microcolonies of sufficiently small size would be expected to consist of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells. For example, in the sequential model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. (2002)</xref>, Lac<sup>+</sup> point mutation is expected to occur when a colony of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells grows to 10<sup>5</sup> cells (with a mutation rate of 10<sup>−8</sup> mutations per cell per generation that is enhanced 35-fold by SOS induction and acts on an additional 30 copies of <italic>lac;</italic> 35 × 30 × 10<sup>5</sup> × 10<sup>−8</sup> = 1 mutation per microcolony of 10<sup>5</sup> cells). This model predicts that <italic>lac</italic>-amplified microcolonies of approximately 10<sup>5</sup> cells should precede point-mutant colonies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g003">Figure 3</xref>, the microcolonies harvested in the course of these experiments, all much smaller than 10<sup>5</sup> cells, show a very distinct pattern that conflicts with this expectation. Only 5% of microcolonies isolated on day 3 consisted of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells (the rest were stable point mutant). The proportion of unstable microcolonies increases on later days. This is the pattern of arising of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified visible colonies, which are rare in the first few days of an experiment and increase in frequency later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The proportion of unstable microcolonies appears to reflect the proportion of visible colonies that would consist of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells 1 to 4 d later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g003">Figure 3</xref>), as expected if <italic>lac</italic>-amplified microcolonies produce <italic>lac</italic>-amplified (not point-mutant) visible colonies.</p>

Growth of the point-mutant cell clone is proposed to overtake the <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells to give a visible colony consisting mainly of point-mutant cells. We looked for this change from <italic>lac</italic>-amplified to point-mutant phenotype by removing a few cells from microcolonies to determine which microcolonies consisted of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells, and sampling them again after they had grown to form visible colonies (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).

        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. (2002)</xref> reported a seemingly similar experiment that gave the opposite result. They scored small (presumed young) and large (old) colonies and found many more unstable cfu in small colonies than in larger colonies. We note that they did not follow the same small colonies to score later, when those small colonies had grown larger, as we have done. Their result is probably caused by the slow growth rate of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells, which causes microcolonies of <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells to remain at the microcolony size for longer than do microcolonies of point-mutant cells, such that many more small colonies are <italic>lac</italic>-amplified. We have found that point-mutant microcolonies stay small for a much briefer period of time than do <italic>lac</italic>-amplified ones (data not shown). We overcame this problem by scoring <italic>the same</italic> colonies as microcolonies and found that these small <italic>lac</italic>-amplified colonies do not grow to become point mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g004">Figure 4</xref>). An additional explanation for why the small colonies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. (2002)</xref> contained more <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cfu is that, in most of their experiments, these authors did not employ the stringent methods that we devised to avoid scoring unrelated mixtures of cells in microcolony samples. These include the antibiotic-resistant-minority-scoring method outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Thus, when they picked small colonies in a fixed volume of agar, a greater fraction of the cells in their sample would be unrelated background cells than when they picked larger colonies (same number of background cells each time, but fewer or more cells from the colony they intended to sample). This, too, should result in the appearance of more mixtures of <italic>lac-</italic>amplified and point-mutant cfu in the small colony samples and more pure point mutant in the large colony samples; but the mixtures in the small colony samples would be unrelated. We conclude that when stringent colony-fate experiments are performed, <italic>lac-</italic>amplified microcolonies are seen to produce <italic>lac</italic>-amplified and not point-mutant visible colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Point Mutants Do Not Overgrow <italic>lac</italic>-Amplified Cells in Competition Experiments</title>
        <p>We tested experimentally whether point-mutant cells occurring in a <italic>lac</italic>-amplified microcolony would be able to overgrow and mask the <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells on the timescale of adaptive mutation experiments, as is postulated in sequential models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>). Cultures of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells were seeded with Lac<sup>+</sup> point-mutant cells in various proportions and grown for a known number of cell generations, as spots on lactose plates, to form pseudocolonies. The proportion of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified and point-mutant cells was determined after 3 d, by which time the pseudocolony had reached 8 × 10<sup>7</sup> to 1.6 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t004">Table 4</xref>). This is three to four more generations than are needed to form a visible colony (approximately 0.5–1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>). These experiments were performed with two different <italic>lac</italic>-amplified isolates that have 2.0 and 4.2 times the generation time on lactose medium of the point-mutant Lac<sup>+</sup> strain used. That is, these strains can produce 2 and 4.2 times fewer generations than point mutants, and so might, in principle, be overtaken by point mutants during colony growth. However, this was not observed under the real-life conditions of growth in colonies under selective conditions. Only when point-mutant cells were introduced at a ratio of one to ten was the proportion of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells reduced to below 1% (the level reported in mixed colonies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al.

        <p>The possibility that amplification occurs in the Pol I–deficient strain but that the Lac<sup>+</sup> colonies are unable to grow to visibility in the time-span of an adaptive mutation experiment is ruled out by reconstruction experiments, in which three independent <italic>lac-</italic>amplified isolates carrying <italic>polA</italic>(Ts) or <italic>polA<sup>+</sup></italic> formed visible colonies in 5.25 ± 0.17 d and 5.39 ± 0.24 d, respectively (mean of three strains ± standard error of the mean [SEM]). Another possibility that we considered is that the <italic>polA</italic> mutation, which causes an increase in SOS induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Bates1">Bates et al. 1989</xref>), might channel amplified DNA into the point mutation pathway by increasing SOS-induced mutagenesis, so that there is an increase in mutation concomitant with a decrease in amplification. We were unable to test this directly by preventing SOS induction, because the non-inducible allele of <italic>lexA</italic> confers low viability in combination with <italic>polA</italic>(Ts) (data not shown)<italic>.</italic> However we tested this possibility using <italic>dinB</italic>-defective cells. DinB/Pol IV accounts for most, if not all, of the requirement of adaptive mutation for SOS induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie2">McKenzie et al. 2001</xref>).

By contrast, hypermutation models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg1">Rosenberg 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hersh1">Hersh et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg3">Rosenberg and Hastings 2004a</xref>) suggest that a hypermutable state, possibly an SOS response, is induced only transiently in a subpopulation of starved cells, and that this condition will not persist for long in cells that are able to utilize lactose because they no longer experience the stress of starvation. To determine whether the involvement of SOS in adaptive point mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Cairns1">Cairns and Foster 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie1">McKenzie et al. 2000</xref>) is a consequence of amplification, we constructed a strain in which the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is expressed under the control of the SOS-regulated <italic>sulA</italic> promoter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">1</xref>F). <italic>sulA</italic> is one of about 40 SOS (DNA damage inducible) genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Courcelle1">Courcelle et al. 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g006">Figure 6</xref>A shows that about 2% of cells in the growing cultures showed spontaneous SOS induction, as revealed by GFP fluorescence.

            <p>(A) Known <italic>lac</italic>-amplified and point-mutant (control) derivatives of SMR6039 were grown in liquid M9 medium containing either lactose or glycerol. Mid-logarithmic phase cells were harvested and scored microscopically for GFP fluorescence, using an Olympus BL51 microscope mounted with a mercury lamp UV source and a High Q Endow GFP emission fluorescence filter cube. Some 1,000–2,000 cells from each of 4–10 fields were scored per determination. Error bars indicate one SEM for 8–13 cultures as indicated.</p>
            <p>(B) Microcolonies were harvested and suspended in 500 μl of buffer, 50 μl of which was spread on LBH X-gal rif solid medium to determine sectoring in resulting colonies. The remainders were concentrated and examined microscopically for GFP fluorescence, counting 60–400 cells per microcolony. These experiments were plated at very low cell density to avoid significant numbers of background Lac<sup>−</sup> cells being harvested with the microcolonies. Open bars, fraction of stable Lac<sup>+</sup> isolates (32 microcolonies); black bars, fraction of sectored isolates (11 microcolonies). The two distributions do not differ (<italic>p</italic> = 0.8 by Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). These experiments were repeated, giving similar results.</p>

          <title>Significance and predictions of amplification–mutagenesis</title>
          <p>The experiments reported test the amplification–mutagenesis model for the mechanism of adaptive mutation in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> Lac system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>). The model's significance lies in its apparent explanation of adaptive mutation phenomenology without invoking an environmentally induced increase in mutation rate, in adherence to conservative neo-Darwinist ideas about constant, gradual evolutionary change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Mayr1">Mayr 1982</xref>). In the model, spontaneous amplification of <italic>lac</italic> allows growth of cells into microcolonies on lactose medium; replication of the multiple <italic>lac</italic> copies generates a point mutant at about the 10<sup>5</sup>-cell stage; and the point-mutant cell overgrows the <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells, leading to colonies consisting mostly of point-mutant cells with a few (10<sup>−2</sup>–10<sup>−3</sup>) <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells. This model derives most of its support from the observation of sectored-colony-forming cells in colonies of point-mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>).</p>

          <title>Independent point mutation and amplification mechanisms supported</title>
          <p>By contrast, we found, first, that when stringent scoring methods are applied, and all cells in very young microcolonies analyzed, most point-mutant Lac<sup>+</sup> colonies are not mixtures of stable point-mutant cells with 10<sup>−2</sup>–10<sup>−3</sup> unstable (amplification bearing) cells, but rather are pure (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>). This was verified with sensitive genetic selection methods that can detect single <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells among microcolonies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t002">Table 2</xref>), and was found to be true even at the two- to 40-cell stage of colony growth (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t003">Table 3</xref>). We conclude that adaptive point mutants arise directly from <italic>lac<sup>−</sup></italic> single cells without an intermediate stage involving colonies of <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells, and that the <italic>lac-</italic>amplified cells are a separate adaptive outcome.</p>
          <p>Previous observations of mixed colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Andersson1">Andersson et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>) seem likely to have arisen from accidental overlap of point-mutant and Lac<sup>−</sup> colonies that were not related, which would cause sectored, but not unstable colonies. We observed these, recapitulating the previous results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Poteete1">Poteete et al. 2002</xref>), only when we failed to apply stringent criteria for identification of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells. Such colonies might also have arisen from overlap of stable with unrelated unstable microcolonies, which were not screened out stringently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. 2002</xref>), as done here (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
          <p>Second, we found that microcolonies smaller than 10<sup>5</sup> cells are not mostly <italic>lac</italic>-amplified, as the amplification–mutagenesis model demands, but rather that microcolonies carrying amplification are rare initially and frequent later, with kinetics that anticipate the arising of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified visible colonies (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Third, when sampled early and late, young microcolonies with <italic>lac</italic> amplification give rise to <italic>lac</italic>-amplified, not point-mutant, visible colonies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Fourth, artificial mixtures of point-mutant with <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells do not show the predicted takeover of the amplification carriers by the point mutants (one point mutant overtaking 10<sup>5</sup> <italic>lac</italic>-amplified, as predicted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hendrickson1">Hendrickson et al. [2002]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Roth3">Roth et al. [2003]</xref>) unless the point mutants comprise a very large fraction (10%) of the total (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t004">Table 4</xref>). Fifth, we show that DNA Pol I is required for <italic>lac</italic> amplification and not point mutation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g005">Figure 5</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>lac</italic> amplification is not a prerequisite for point mutation. We conclude that amplification is an independent outcome that adapts cells, not a transient intermediate en route to point mutation.</p>

This copy could be on another DNA molecule (a sister chromosome) or the same one (a duplication), but either way it is required for error-prone repair leading to mutation, and its counter-selection would decrease point mutation, even though amplification is not an intermediate in the process.</p>

Point mutants, but not <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>), carry high levels of mutation of genes throughout their genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Torkelson1">Torkelson et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosche1">Rosche and Foster 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Godoy1">Godoy et al. 2000</xref>). Because these levels of mutation are not found in most Lac<italic><sup>−</sup></italic> cells starved on the same plates, we infer that only a subpopulation of the starving cells experiences this transient hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Torkelson1">Torkelson et al. 1997</xref>), perhaps those that are induced for the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie1">McKenzie et al. 2000</xref>) or the SOS and RpoS stress response (which is required, discussed below) (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Foster4">Foster 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg3">Rosenberg and Hastings 2004a</xref>). Mismatch repair, which corrects replication errors, also becomes limiting specifically during adaptive mutation, leading to increased mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Harris4">Harris et al. 1997</xref>); this might occur by titration of mismatch repair proteins by excess DNA polymerase errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Harris4">Harris et al. 1997</xref>) made by Pol IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-McKenzie2">McKenzie et al. 2001</xref>).

          <title>Amplification mechanism and the role of Pol I</title>
          <p>Amplification, on the other hand, could be formed by non-homologous repair of the DSEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g007">Figure 7</xref>), leading to a gene duplication or rolling-circle replication, either of which might amplify rapidly to produce the 20–100 copies of <italic>lac</italic> that allow growth without a point mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings1">Hastings and Rosenberg 2002</xref>). Alternatively, homologous DSE repair might produce replication forks that lack some of the control of origin-initiated replication and stall in the nucleotide-depleted milieu of starvation. We suggest that template switching can occur at a stalled fork and produce a duplicated-DNA segment or a rolling-circle intermediate from which amplification results. This is similar to template-switching recombination models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Bzymek1">Bzymek and Lovett 2001</xref>).

The authors found that the vast majority of 787 natural isolates from diverse habitats worldwide produced random, unselected mutations in response to starvation. Multiple mechanisms of mutation in the natural isolates are implied, but at least one of them has similarities to that of the Lac system, and to a different stationary-phase-mutation model system (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg2">Rosenberg and Hastings 2003</xref>), in that these mutation responses require RecA, an SOS-regulated DNA polymerase, and RpoS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Bjedov1">Bjedov et al. 2003</xref>). Moreover, in the eukaryote <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> a new study of mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Denver1">Denver et al. 2004</xref>) suggests that cellular stress responses might provoke hypermutation generally, and also lead to a mismatch-repair-compromised transient state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Rosenberg5">Rosenberg and Hastings 2004c</xref>) similar to that suggested here. These systems support the idea that evolution might be hastened during stress. They promise to reveal mutation mechanisms that are likely to pertain to cancer formation and progression, acquisition of drug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and many processes in which clonal expansion under stress or growth limitation follows from an adaptive genetic change.</p>

          <title>Adaptive mutation experiments</title>
          <p>Adaptive mutation experiments were performed as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Harris3">Harris et al. (1996)</xref>, with the following variations for microcolony experiments: lactose plates were prescavenged by plating 5 × 10<sup>9</sup> FC29 “scavenger” cells on them and incubating at 37 °C for 24 h, then washing the cells off with M9 buffer; plating of frameshift-bearing cells was not in top agar, but on the plate's surface; growth of Lac<sup>−</sup> cells throughout the experiments was monitored either by sampling the lawn as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Cairns1">Cairns and Foster 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Harris2">Harris et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Harris3">1996</xref>) or by microscopic examination. Microscopic examination used 50-fold magnification on a dissecting microscope. The lawn was seen to be smooth at this magnification when less than about 2-fold growth had occurred (number of viable cells relative to starting viable cell measurement). Plates on which growth occurred acquired a punctate appearance. This method was validated by using the two methods in parallel in two experiments, the largest of which involved 24 plates from two cultures. The correlation between growth detected as a doubling in cell number obtained from an agar plug, and the appearance of puncti was complete. No growth (≤ 2-fold) was detected during the relevant times in the experiments reported.</p>
          <p>For quantitative measure of mutation and amplification, three or four parallel cultures of each genotype were scored for Lac<sup>+</sup> colonies each day. Cells from 20 colonies from each culture, or 40 colonies in the case of SMR3491, were plated on LBH rif X-gal to determine the proportion amplified.</p>

          <title>Whole microcolony analysis</title>
          <p>Frameshift-bearing (tester) cells were mixed with 3% each of three or four different derivative testers that carried antibiotic-resistance markers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Microcolonies were found by use of a dissecting microscope, and harvested on a plug of agar with a capillary tube (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Working at 25× magnification on a dissecting microscope, we were able to find and harvest very young colonies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), down to a size of 10<sup>2</sup> cells. The cells were suspended in 500 μl M9 buffer. One percent of the suspension was plated on LBH plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Torkelson1">Torkelson et al. 1997</xref>) containing 40 μg/ml X-gal and 100 μg/ml rif (to prevent growth of scavenger cells). The remainder of the suspension was diluted with glycerol (to 12.5%) and stored at −80 °C. Many of the cells in any plating of a harvested microcolony were background (white colony forming) Lac<sup>−</sup> tester cells that were on the agar plug (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The cells from the microcolony either formed solid blue colonies on LBH X-gal rif plates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), indicating a point-mutant colony, or sectored blue colonies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), indicating an unstable <italic>lac</italic>-amplified colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020399-Hastings2">Hastings et al. 2000</xref>). The colonies were scored for sectoring, counted, and patched from the LBH X-gal rif plates onto plates containing antibiotics. Those microcolonies that showed a stable Lac<sup>+</sup> point-mutant phenotype, had a suitable cell number, and carried one of the minority antibiotic-resistance markers were then plated in toto from the frozen suspension onto LBH X-gal rif medium with the appropriate antibiotic, to search for sectored colonies. Because some sectored colonies are not unstable (e.g., mixtures of stable white and blue colonies that overlap; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">see Results/Discussion</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020399-t001">Table 1</xref>), all sectored colonies found were retested by plating a sample on the same LBH X-gal antibiotic medium to determine whether there was continued instability indicative of amplification.</p>
          <p>Harvesting the microcolony on a plug of agar with a 25-μl capillary pipette also picks up many Lac<sup>−</sup> tester cells. The number of these that form colonies during the analysis is reduced by use of antibiotics (as described above) because most cells are not resistant, but the background of tester cells may still be equal in number to those in the microcolony (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020399-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Use of a smaller caliber tube was found to risk losing microcolony cells on the wall of the tube.</p>

          <title>Selection for <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells</title>
          <p>Microcolonies of PJH220 were harvested as above and suspended in 200 μl of buffer. One microliter (0.5%) of the suspension was spread on LBH X-gal rif medium to determine cell number and which microcolonies were point mutant. Point-mutant microcolonies were then plated to select CamR on LBH plates containing X-gal, rif, and 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Plates were scored after 15 to 20 h at 37 °C.</p>
          <p>To analyze background cells without microcolonies, plugs of agar were taken from areas of the plates where no microcolony was visible at 20× magnification and the cells suspended in 200 μl of buffer. Half of each suspension was plated on chloramphenicol-containing medium as above, and the other half was plated with scavenger cells onto lactose-minimal medium. Chloramphenicol plates were scored between 15 and 18 h, and lactose plates were scored at 2 d, and again at 7 d. Colonies appearing on lactose medium were scored for amplification by plating a sample of the cells on LBH X-gal rif medium. Colonies appearing on chloramphenicol-containing medium were scored for <italic>lac</italic> amplification (blue and white sectoring) directly on that plate. All CamR colonies were seen to be <italic>lac</italic>-amplified.</p>
          <p>The fraction of <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells detectable by CamR selection was determined as follows. There are two reasons why <italic>lac</italic> amplification might fail to be detected with the CamR selection: first, because some <italic>lac</italic> amplifications have not co-amplified the neighboring <italic>codA</italic>::<italic>cat</italic> gene, and, second, because some <italic>cat-</italic>amplified microcolonies obtained from the lactose plates (grown selectively for Lac<sup>+</sup> and not for CamR) might have too few <italic>cat</italic> copies for growth on 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol. We determined each of these separately. We found that 59 of 77 <italic>lac</italic>-amplified microcolonies were CamR (at least 77% had co-amplified <italic>cat</italic>), and that 84% of cells from CamR (<italic>cat</italic>-amplified) isolates grown on lactose without chloramphenicol were then able to form colonies on chloramphenicol medium. The cells that did not form colonies on chloramphenicol presumably had lost or reduced their amplification of <italic>cat</italic> and <italic>lac.</italic> This would indicate that 77% of 84% (65%) of all <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells should be detected by the CamR selection. An independent determination of the number of <italic>cat</italic>-amplified cells that grow on chloramphenicol after growth on lactose was obtained in a reconstruction experiment in which a few CamR cells were plated with a 10<sup>4</sup>-fold excess of Lac<sup>+</sup> point-mutant cells, mimicking more closely the conditions of the experiments in which microcolonies are obtained. A total of 79% of the <italic>cat-</italic>amplified cells formed colonies on chloramphenicol medium, so 77% of 79% (61%) of all <italic>lac</italic>-amplified cells should be detected. The selection for CamR is actually a more sensitive assay for <italic>lac</italic> amplification than is selection for Lac<sup>+</sup>, as shown by the fact that only 60% of cells from the cultures that showed CamR were able to form colonies on lactose medium under the conditions of an adaptive mutation experiment, though all carried<italic>lac</italic> amplification (indicating that 40% had too few <italic>lac</italic> copies for growth on lactose), whereas 79% were detected on chloramphenicol medium.</p>

          <p>Microcolonies were touched with the point of a needle, and cells were transferred to LBH X-gal rif plates, where they were spread by streaking for scoring. Control experiments (not shown) showed that this procedure removed, on average, 5% of the microcolony from the plate. About 50 separate colonies from each microcolony were scored for sectoring. The remainder of the colony was left for 1 to 4 d to form a visible colony in situ. The visible colony was then sampled, plated, and scored for sectoring (see “whole microcolony analysis” above).</p>
