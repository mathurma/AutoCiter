This spontaneous activity takes the form of spreading patches of synchronized bursting that slowly advance across portions of the retina. These patches are non-repeating and tile the retina in minutes. Several transmitter systems are known to be involved, but the basic mechanism underlying wave production is still not well-understood. We present a model for retinal waves that focuses on acetylcholine mediated waves but whose principles are adaptable to other developmental stages. Its assumptions are that a) spontaneous depolarizations of amacrine cells drive wave activity; b) amacrine cells are locally connected, and c) cells receiving more input during their depolarization are subsequently less responsive and have longer periods between spontaneous depolarizations. The resulting model produces waves with non-repeating borders and randomly distributed initiation points. The wave generation mechanism appears to be chaotic and does not require neural noise to produce this wave behavior. Variations in parameter settings allow the model to produce waves that are similar in size, frequency, and velocity to those observed in several species. Our results suggest that retinal wave behavior results from activity-dependent refractory periods and that the average velocity of retinal waves depends on the duration a cell is excitatory: longer periods of excitation result in slower waves. In contrast to previous studies, we find that a single layer of cells is sufficient for wave generation. The principles described here are very general and may be adaptable to the description of spontaneous wave activity in other areas of the nervous system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Neurons from the immature retina extend axons that make connections in the visual centers of the brain. Chemical markers provide guidance for these axons, but patterned neural activity is necessary to refine their connections. Much of this activity occurs in a distinctive pattern of waves before the retina is responsive to light, but it is not known how these waves are generated. In this study, we describe a simple mechanism that can explain the production of retinal waves. We use the knowledge that immature retinal cells are spontaneously active and show that waves will result if cells that receive more input when they are spontaneously active have longer intervals between activity. The resulting model reproduces experimentally observed waves in a variety of species, including ferret, chick, mouse, rabbit, and turtle, both at the level of individual cells and of the entire retina. The behavior appears intrinsically chaotic and the model is not tied to the properties of any particular biochemical pathway. We suggest that this mechanism could underlie not only the spontaneous patterns of activity that are generated in the retina but other areas of the developing brain as well.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Godfrey KB, Swindale NV (2007) Retinal wave behavior through activity-dependent refractory periods.

They have been shown to refine retinotopy in the LGN, superior colliculus, and cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b025">25</xref>], to drive segregation of the LGN into eye-specific layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b022">22</xref>], and to drive responses in V1 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b026">26</xref>]. While the physiological mechanisms underlying retinal waves have been studied extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b027">27</xref>], there have been few attempts at modeling them. The first model was based on extracellular diffusion of potassium driving RGC activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b028">28</xref>]. Experimental evidence contradicted this premise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b013">13</xref>] and another model was put forward, based on random amacrine cell activity and long refractory periods where amacrine cells are non-responsive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b014">14</xref>]. Subsequent physiological evidence has shown these assumptions to be invalid, as amacrine cells regularly depolarize during waves and release excitatory transmitter when doing so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b030">30</xref>]. Other limitations are that the model produces non-uniform net coverage of the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b031">31</xref>], that it has only been demonstrated to produce waves similar to postnatal day 2 (P2) to P4 ferret, and that the properties of the generated waves, including wave size, frequency, and velocity, can be very sensitive to small changes in network state or parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b032">32</xref>].</p><p>In this study we describe a retinal wave model that is robust to parameter variation and generalizes across species. We make use of the findings that amacrine cells receive input and depolarize during local wave activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b030">30</xref>], that they have variable periods between spontaneous depolarizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b030">30</xref>], and that the period between depolarizations appears to be a function of recent local excitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b030">30</xref>]. These observations lead to the central principle behind the model, that the refractory period, or the period between spontaneously occurring bursts in cells, is a function of the amount of excitatory input recently received by the cell. The resulting model produces waves with randomly distributed initiation points and non-repeating borders across a wide range of parameter settings. The velocity, domain size, and interwave interval (IWI) of the generated waves can be configured to match those seen in ferret, rabbit, mouse, turtle, and chick retinas. We show that a single homogenous group of cells can produce these wave behaviors, in contrast to claims that such behavior requires two independently functioning cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b014">14</xref>]. We also show that the model exhibits chaotic behavior, producing seemingly random patterns of waves in the absence of stochastic input. The uniformity of retinal coverage provided by the model and the realistic spatio–temporal patterns of activity should also make it useful as an input to developmental models of the retino–geniculo–cortical pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b033">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ferret Waves (P2–P4)</title><p>The waves produced by the model are qualitatively comparable to published images of physiological waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b035">35</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows two examples of wave activity and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030245-sv001">Video S1</xref> shows 4 min of simulated wave behavior.

If a sufficiently high density of depolarized amacrine cells is present, a wave develops. The wave continues to propagate in all directions where there is a high enough density of amacrine cells capable of depolarizing as a function of the excitatory input from their neighbors.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030245-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030245.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Examples of Wave Behavior</title><p>(A,B) Left circles show the instantaneous states of amacrine cells at two different times in the same retina.

The threshold plot (R<italic>:</italic> black lines) shows slow, linear decay with periodic increases coinciding with the depolarization of the cell (vertical blue lines). The magnitude of threshold increase varies as a function of input received by the cell when it is depolarized. Large threshold increases generally indicate that the cell is in a central and fast-moving portion of a wave. Smaller threshold increases occur when a cell is in a slow-moving part of a wave or near a wave boundary, or when it depolarizes in the absence of a wave. The excitation plot (X) shows input to the cell due to nearby wave activity. This input is sometimes enough to overcome threshold and cause the cell to depolarize. The third graph (X-R) shows the difference between excitation and threshold levels. The cell fires when excitation exceeds threshold (red line segments). This plot resembles voltage recordings in amacrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b030">30</xref>], consistent with an AHP playing a large but not exclusive role in the threshold change. Peak levels of excitation are small compared to threshold levels. Most amacrine cell depolarizations are the result of nearby wave activity with approximately 10% occurring “spontaneously” (*).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030245.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>The non-repeating wave behavior occurs because amacrine cells receive differing amounts of input during wave activity, resulting in some cells becoming more refractory than others. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g001">Figure 1</xref>C shows the threshold and excitation of a cell over time. Amacrine cells near the central regions of a wave receive more input during a wave, and hence become more refractory, than amacrine cells near the wave boundaries. This provides a deterministic and destabilizing force that inhibits the production of repeating wave domains as subsequent waves will more readily “invade” the border areas of a previous domain than central areas. Observations have shown that both the form of the original domain and the timing of these “invasions” determine the extent of the invasion and the subsequent increase in refractoriness for the amacrine cells involved. This turns the largely coherent refractoriness of amacrine cells in the original domain into several incoherent subgroups, inhibiting generation of a subsequent wave capable of following the boundaries of a predecessor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows 40 sequential waves passing through a randomly selected spot on the retina, giving an example of the variability and non-repeating quality of the waves.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030245-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030245.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>History of Waves Passing through a Single Point</title><p>Snapshots of 40 successive waves that passed through a randomly selected point on the retina (identified by gray cross-hairs).

We repeated this with ten different amacrine cells selected from around the simulated retina and then compared the behavior of a single amacrine (the center cell) across each of these simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). The timing and intensity of bursting activity for the observed amacrine cell was different in all tested cases.

Similar behavior occurs when the model is perturbed while it is running.</p><p>To analyze sequential waves and determine if there were any cyclic patterns, we took snapshots of the retina when a wave passed an arbitrarily chosen point and compared sequences of successive waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g002">Figure 2</xref>). No patterns were apparent on the short time scales observed (up to 3 h). To explore the possibility of very long cycle times, we ran several very long simulations (2 or 3 y simulated time) and analyzed model output. To do this, we chose 19 amacrine cells uniformly distributed across the retina, and stored the activity pattern of these cells in a list. For each time step that three or more amacrine cells were active, we created a 19 bit integer, one bit for each cell, with a bit set to “1” if the cell was depolarized and “0” otherwise, and stored this value. After the simulation, we took the final 30 patterns and searched for this sequence in the list. For simulations run this way (<italic>n</italic> = 3), no match was found, indicating that any cycle behavior is longer than biologically relevant time scales. We used a small model retina for this search (0.65 mm<sup>2</sup>, d<italic>T</italic> = 100 ms) on the presumption that a small retina would show shorter cycle times than a large retina. Wave behavior was similar at the beginning and end of this interval both qualitatively and quantitatively (spatiotemporal properties of waves varied by &lt;5%).</p><p>The activity-dependent refractory period is critical for the production of non-repeating and apparently random behavior. Analysis showed that the model produced non-repeating wave behavior so long as there was a differential in input received by cells during a wave, and hence a variable increase in their refractory periods. Extending the period where this input was summed (i.e., when the cells refractoriness increased regardless of whether or not it was active) or by reducing the parameter <italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub> to very low values produced stable waves which covered the entire retina and eliminated realistic wave behavior. Such changes also eliminate realistic wave behavior when the model is run with stochastic input (i.e., randomly varying <italic>P</italic>).</p><p>The observations that the model shows sensitivity to small changes in initial conditions and produces apparently random waves that are non-periodic and with randomly distributed initiation points suggest that it has a deterministically chaotic regime. However, we did not carry out strict mathematical tests for the presence of chaos (calculation of Lyapunov exponents or a complexity analysis of cellular automata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b043">43</xref>]), and therefore we do not claim to have demonstrated chaos in a mathematical sense. The model's behavior is consistent with “chaotic aperiodic behavior” as described for cellular automata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b043">43</xref>] and is present for all time steps tested (ranging from 5 ms to 200 ms). The biological relevance of this behavior is not that the model is chaotic in a mathematical sense, which would be interesting, but that it is chaotic in a practical sense. It uses a simple mechanism which does not rely on underlying stochasticity to reproduce the non-repeating and random waves that are observed in many species and are mediated by different chemical pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b011">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Variable Depolarization Intervals</title><p>The model is framed in a simple form in order to focus on general principles behind wave production.

These assumptions are supported by data in a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b030">30</xref>] which showed that amacrine cells have slowly decaying afterhyperpolarizing potentials (AHPs), and they have very short refractory periods when pharmacologically isolated, longer refractory periods when they are spontaneously active while connected to neighbors, and even longer refractory periods when they depolarize during a passing wave.</p><p>The model presented here differs significantly from previous models of retinal waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b028">28</xref>]. The most recent and related model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b014">14</xref>] was based on the assumption of random depolarization of amacrine cells and it required a second layer of RGCs to filter sparse amacrine cell activity to produce wave-like behavior. The present model is based on deterministic activity-dependent refractory periods and produces spatially dense patterns of depolarized amacrine cells. The principle of activity-dependent refractory periods is very general and is not constrained by the properties of any particular neurotransmitter pathway or cell type. It produces waves with a large range of spatiotemporal properties and could underlie the production of waves at many different stages of development, in different species, and even in different brain area. A further difference is that only a single cell layer is required to produce waves, something that was previously not thought to be possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b014">14</xref>]. It should be stressed however, that while the principles we describe are very general, our model only addresses basic wave behavior that occurs in early development and ignores the emerging complexity of the retina as it matures.</p><p>There are several ways to implement the basic principles of the model, and we explored some of the possibilities. As described above, amacrine cells were allowed to have both fixed and variable depolarization durations, and the model was run with and without stochastic input. Other strategies that we tested included: producing excitations at random points in the network, as might occur if amacrine cells, or other cells present later in development, were to depolarize spontaneously or to spontaneously release vesicles; using a layer of RGCs to filter amacrine cell activity, similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b014">14</xref>]; varying the connectivity radius and the connectivity strength; and using continuous (periodic) boundary conditions. None of these variations resulted in significantly different behavior, suggesting that the underlying principles of the model are more important for wave generation than their particular implementation.</p><p>In the model, the magnitude of the threshold regulates the refractory period, and this magnitude depends on recent input to the cell, with cells receiving more input during their periods of activity having higher thresholds. The rate of threshold decay was largely constant, resulting in longer refractory periods in cells that contributed to a wave compared to those that depolarized in isolation. Biologically, this refractory period results from a calcium-dependent potassium current [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b030">30</xref>] and possibly other factors, such as an activity-dependent variation in intracellular chloride, which has been proposed to drive spontaneous activity in the developing spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b047">47</xref>]. The model does not differentiate between mechanisms contributing to the refractory period and only predicts characteristics of the resulting behavior. More physiologically detailed and species-specific models of the retina will be necessary for understanding the finer dynamics of retinal waves, and more experimental data will be required to adequately constrain such models. Given that calcium imaging appears to not detect all wave activity, and the spatial extent of electrode studies is limited, one experiment that would be very helpful would be simultaneous electrode and calcium imaging recordings over retinal areas sufficiently large to discern waves and their boundaries, as this would determine the frequency of very small patches of activity, how much activity is required before Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal detection is possible, and how focused or extensive actual wave activity is in relation to the calcium imaging responses.</p><p>The model produces output that should be useful in computational studies of the developing retino–geniculate pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b033">33</xref>], since the parameters can be adjusted to produce retinal waves with a wide range of size, velocity, and IWI. The output provides a relatively uniform net retinal coverage and it is simple to convert it to RGC spike trains by using amacrine cell activity as input to integrate and fire neurons. However, there are at least two significant ways in which this model does not conform to experimental observation. First, the duration of RGC bursting is weakly explained by the present model, as during a wave amacrine cell activity at a given location in the retina typically lasts 1–3 s. We have made no attempts to reproduce or account for the burst variability seen between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b012">12</xref>], including the seconds-long oscillations of excitation observed in turtle retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b015">15</xref>] or the longer burst times observed in older ferret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b011">11</xref>]. The behavior of the model suggests that additional factors are behind the long duration bursts seen physiologically, possibly involving input from additional cell types (e.g., bipolar cells) and the use of metabotropic ion channels and/or additional neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA). Second, simple spiking patterns, as would be produced by integrate and fire neurons, are only seen during early development (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b048">48</xref>] for integrate and fire neurons which produce various burst patterns). As development proceeds, alpha, beta, and gamma RGCs develop distinct firing patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b011">11</xref>] and ON and OFF RGCs begin to fire at different rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b049">49</xref>]. Computational studies using the output of this model as input to higher levels of the visual pathway will need to address these factors, as appropriate, according to the particular species and age being modeled.</p><p>Wave behavior is stable across a wide range of parameter settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Using <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g007">Figure 7</xref> as a guide, model parameters can be manipulated to produce waves quite different from those described here, including waves that slowly progress across all cells, or that produce small groups of excitation that propagate very little. Analysis of the effects of changing different parameters show that the duration an amacrine cell is excitatory (parameter <italic>D</italic>) is the most important factor in regulating the velocity of waves, particularly at slower velocities. When simulating mouse waves, it was necessary to increase <italic>D</italic> above 2 s to achieve velocities near the 110 um/s reported physiologically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b034">34</xref>]. This suggests that the excitatory mechanism used in these mice involves either a slower excitation, such as would be produced by extracellular diffusion of transmitter, or a reduced rate of transmitter degradation, compared to what occurs in other species. Alternatively, mice may have extended durations of amacrine cell depolarization and/or periods of vesicle release. Wave velocity was similarly affected in simulations where amacrine cells were allowed to depolarize for variable durations. Slowing the onset of the AHP, thus prolonging depolarization, reduced average wave velocity. Increasing the speed of AHP onset increased wave velocity.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030245-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030245.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Effects of Parameter Variations on Wave Properties</title><p>IWI (I), wave size (S), and velocity (V) for different parameters.

Extremely short duration excitations can produce waves this fast, but the calcium imaging response from such brief depolarizations is greatly attenuated, often below the threshold of detectability. A more natural explanation for the increase in wave velocity is that the excitation time constant (<italic>K</italic>) approaches zero, causing the excitatory influence from one cell to be quickly realized in others. Physiologically, the adenosine/cAMP pathway may be related to the time constant. Adenosine has been shown to enhance transmitter release and to modulate neuronal excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b050">50</xref>], and both adenosine and cAMP have strong influences on wave velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b045">45</xref>]. These results suggest that adenosine/cAMP might play a decreasing regulatory role in retinas with higher wave velocities, such as chick.</p><p>The model makes several experimentally testable predictions. One is that wave behavior is the result of activity-dependent refractory periods in spontaneously active amacrine cells—normalizing threshold changes, such as by making AHP responses nearly uniform across cells, should eliminate non-repeating waves. Related to this, induction of an activity-dependent refractory period in cells which are recurrently connected and spontaneously active should produce non-repeating wave behavior. A second prediction is that wave velocity should be a function of the duration of excitatory influence of an amacrine cell. Manipulating this interval through genetic or pharmacological means should influence wave velocity. Third, wave behavior, as measured by RGC activity, should spatially extend beyond waves detected through large-scale calcium imaging, meaning that waves as defined by spike activity should be bigger than those seen by calcium imaging.</p><p>The commonalities of retinal wave behavior across species and different anatomical and neuropharmacological pathways suggest an underlying mechanism that is robust and capable of being implemented in many ways. Our model displays this flexibility and has been framed to focus on mechanisms likely to be common among species and not to be constrained by specific physiological implementations or specific neural cell types. Hence the principles that we describe may be applicable to the description of activity in other parts of the brain such as auditory system, spinal cord, neocortex, and hippocampus which, like the retina, also exhibit patterns of coordinated spontaneous activity during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b051">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods</title><p>The model focuses primarily on waves mediated by ACh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b017">17</xref>]. However, the principles behind the model, namely that wave behavior results from spontaneous activity and that refractory periods are a function of recent input, are intentionally general so as to be unconstrained by specific biophysical implementations. Hence, the model is adaptable to the description of waves in several developmental stages and species even though different physiological and pharmacological mechanisms might be responsible for their generation.</p><p>The model relies on a single cell type, cholinergic amacrine cells, which are responsible for mediating early (Ach-mediated) retinal waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b027">27</xref>]. Amacrine cells in the model are spontaneously active and form excitatory connections with other nearby amacrine cells. Here, “active” means depolarized and/or actively exciting its neighbors. These cells have a varying threshold for activation which is high immediately after depolarization and gradually decays, similar to, but slower than, the change in spike threshold following a spike in a normal neuron. The magnitude of the threshold change is a function of recent input to the cell: a cell receiving more input has a higher threshold immediately after depolarization. When the cell's threshold decays to zero, or when its level of excitation exceeds its current threshold, it depolarizes and becomes active, exciting neighboring amacrine cells. When a sufficient density of amacrine cells becomes active, local excitation brings other nearby amacrine cells to threshold, producing a wave of excitation. Amacrine cell activity propagates as long as there is an adequate density of nearby amacrine cells close enough to threshold to depolarize from the excitation of the advancing wave front.</p><p>The model retina is circular and its amacrine cells are arranged in a triangular lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

All dendrites passing through a point on the retina contribute to the calcium response, with the soma generating a stronger response than the dendrite. Because of the short dendritic spread of RGCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b052">52</xref>], the addition to the calcium signal due RGCs should have minimal effect on the spatial dynamics of the signal. This transformation is a coarse approximation and was not required for the model to produce wave behavior. It was primarily used to smooth wave progression and wave boundaries, assisting in automated wave tracking, and also to make model output resemble the experimental results more closely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g010">Figure 10</xref>). The wave propagation images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g005">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030245-g006">6</xref> are based on simulated calcium imaging.

The pixel was considered to be part of a wave until its value fell below a lower threshold (<italic>L</italic> &lt; 0.25). This threshold range was used to minimize pixels near threshold from repeatedly joining a wave when oscillating near threshold. The initialization point of this wave was the centroid of all connected pixels which exceeded the lower detection threshold (0.25) on the first frame the threshold was crossed. Wave velocity was calculated by measuring the distance between the centroid and the farthest point reached by the wave and dividing by the time required to reach that point. The velocity of each wave was stored, and the average of these values calculated. When two waves collided, both were omitted from the calculations as there was no longer an unambiguous starting or most distal point. Analysis did not demonstrate any significant difference between these joined waves and waves which remained independent, so their exclusion should not significantly bias the measurements. Wave size was calculated using the number of connected pixels that crossed threshold during the lifespan of the wave (each pixel was counted only once).</p><p>To reduce border effects in IWI and retinal coverage calculations, pixels associated with amacrine cells within one dendritic radius of the retinal boundary were omitted from the analysis. The IWI distributions were calculated by measuring the inter-wave interval of all analyzed pixels and storing these values in a histogram.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Variable duration depolarization.</title><p>The model is framed in the simplest form we found that produced robust wave behavior. One simplification involved the duration of amacrine cell depolarizations, which was constant in the model, although studies show that it varies, depending on whether the cell depolarizes in isolation or contributes to a wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030245-b030">30</xref>]. To explore if our simplified amacrine cell behavior affected wave production, we modified amacrine cells by allowing them to depolarize for brief fixed intervals and remain depolarized as long as sufficient excitation was present. This was done by (a) slowing the onset of threshold increase, where the factors governing the refractory period, such as the AHP, take seconds to be fully realized, thus allowing prolonged depolarizations to occur, and (b) not resetting the excitation level (<italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic>), allowing it to always reflect current input to the cell. As long as excitation was greater than the threshold, the amacrine cell was depolarized and excitatory to its neighbors. A 3 s refractory period was imposed after each fixed depolarization interval to prevent multiple triggerings during a single wave. In these simulations, <italic>D</italic> was set to 0.45 s and the maximum change of threshold (<italic>ΔR<sub>i</sub></italic>) per second was limited to 4.0. Larger threshold changes took more than 1 s to be fully realized. Other values for <italic>D</italic> and threshold onset rates were explored and produced similar results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030245-sv001" mimetype="application/x-msvideo" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030245.sv001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Video S1</label><caption><title>Four Minutes of Wave Activity on a Retina with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title><p>Depolarized amacrine cells are white.
