                <p>Amyloids and prion proteins are clinically and biologically important
                    β-structures, whose supersecondary structures are difficult to determine
                    by standard experimental or computational means. In addition, significant
                    conformational heterogeneity is known or suspected to exist in many amyloid
                    fibrils. Recent work has indicated the utility of pairwise probabilistic
                    statistics in β-structure prediction. We develop here a new strategy for
                    β-structure prediction, emphasizing the determination of
                    β-strands and pairs of β-strands as fundamental units of
                    β-structure. Our program, BETASCAN, calculates likelihood scores for
                    potential β-strands and strand-pairs based on correlations observed in
                    parallel β-sheets. The program then determines the strands and pairs
                    with the greatest local likelihood for all of the sequence's potential
                    β-structures. BETASCAN suggests multiple alternate folding patterns and
                    assigns relative <italic>a priori</italic> probabilities based solely on amino
                    acid sequence, probability tables, and pre-chosen parameters. The algorithm
                    compares favorably with the results of previous algorithms (BETAPRO, PASTA,
                    SALSA, TANGO, and Zyggregator) in β-structure prediction and amyloid
                    propensity prediction. Accurate prediction is demonstrated for experimentally
                    determined amyloid β-structures, for a set of known
                    β-aggregates, and for the parallel β-strands of
                    β-helices, amyloid-like globular proteins. BETASCAN is able both to
                    detect β-strands with higher sensitivity and to detect the edges of
                    β-strands in a richly β-like sequence. For two proteins
                    (Aβ and Het-s), there exist multiple sets of experimental data implying
                    contradictory structures; BETASCAN is able to detect each competing structure as
                    a potential structure variant. The ability to correlate multiple alternate
                    β-structures to experiment opens the possibility of computational
                    investigation of prion strains and structural heterogeneity of amyloid. BETASCAN

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Amyloid is a highly ordered form of protein aggregation that a wide variety of
                    proteins can form. While the earliest discovered amyloids were associated with
                    systemic and neurodegenerative diseases, recent findings indicate amyloids may
                    have myriad roles and functions ranging from learning and memory, to yeast
                    epigenetics, to biofilm and melanin production. In this study, we expand the
                    range and flexibility of our ability to understand how amyloid properties arise
                    from their polypeptide sequence. By taking advantage of the intrinsic properties
                    of a characteristic amyloid structure—parallel
                    β-strands—and data from available protein structures, we
                    construct and test an algorithm to predict the probability that particular
                    portions of a protein will form amyloid. Our method has the advantage of more
                    accurate detection of the edges of such zones, as well as the ability to
                    consider and evaluate the likelihood of multiple folding patterns.</p>

            <p>“Amyloid” is a term used to describe a particular type of protein
                structure that can be adopted by a very wide variety of proteins with completely
                unrelated primary amino acid sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Dobson1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Selkoe1">[2]</xref>. It is a form of protein
                aggregation, but of a distinct and highly ordered type. It has recently been
                realized that, given the right conditions, a great many, perhaps most, proteins have
                the potential to form amyloids. This appears to be due to intrinsic properties of
                the peptide backbone, a finding of great importance for understanding the evolution
                of protein folds. A much smaller fraction of proteins, and protein fragments,
                assemble into amyloid under normal physiological conditions, and these are of great
                interest in diverse aspects of biology and medicine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Dobson2">[3]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Many amyloids first came to our attention because they were associated with a wide
                variety of diseases, from systemic amyloidoses to neurodegenerative diseases such as
                    Alzheimer's<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Prusiner1">[4]</xref>. It had initially been assumed, therefore, that
                amyloids were toxic species. This indeed may be the case in peripheral amyloidoses,
                where the massive accumulation of amyloid fibers may physically disrupt normal
                tissue function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Bucciantini1">[5]</xref>. Increasingly, however, evidence suggests that the
                formation of amyloids may more commonly be a protective mechanism which, especially
                in the case of the neurodegenerative amyloidoses, acts as to sequester misfolded
                polypeptides that would otherwise dwell in more toxic, and more highly interactive,
                oligomeric species. It has also recently been realized that amyloids serve important
                biological functions in a number of different situations. For example, in
                melanocytes, amyloid fibers formed by Pmel17 play a role in the production of
                    melanin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Fowler1">[6]</xref>, and in bacteria extracellular amyloids are a key
                feature of the biofilms that are so difficult to eradicate in various infectious
                    processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Chapman1">[7]</xref>. In fungi, a special class of self-templating amyloids
                serve as elements of inheritance: these bi-stable proteins can persist as soluble or
                amyloid species and the change in function that occurs when with the switch to the
                amyloid form, is passed from generation to generation as mother cells faithfully
                pass amyloid (prion) templates through the cytoplasm to their daughter cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Wickner1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Uptain1">[9]</xref>. Such
                self-perpetuating prion-like switches in state also appear to play a role in
                neuronal learning and memory, by maintaining a translation factor involved in the
                maintenance of synapses in an active and highly localized state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Si1">[10]</xref>. There is, therefore, great
                interest in deciphering the structures that underlie amyloid states.</p>
            <p>Several methods have established that amyloids are generally rich in

            <p>Given the difficulty of direct observation of supersecondary structure, computational
                modeling of amyloid folding has been attempted. Unfortunately, barriers exist to the
                effective application of sequence-based computational analysis. Several homologous
                prion-forming domains, while functionally conserved over evolutionary time, have
                sequence identities of under 25%, with sufficient additional
                rearrangement as to preclude multiple sequence alignment via standard algorithms

                many amyloid- and prion-forming domains as random coil without structure. The
                amyloid-forming domains of these sequences are removed by the low-complexity filters
                of local sequence alignment tools such as BLAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Altschul1">[39]</xref>, rendering another
                family of methods ineffective.</p>
            <p>The strong evidence for β-structure in amyloid suggests that, as an alternate
                means of secondary structure prediction, computational methods designed to predict
                globular β-structure should be assessed. BETAWRAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Bradley1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-McDonnell1">[41]</xref> was the first
                program to incorporate the important long-range pairwise interactions into a
                computational method to predict β-structure. In doing so, BETAWRAP was the
                first program to predict <italic>strand-pairs</italic>, defined as any two
                β-strands connected by the hydrogen bonds of a β-sheet. The program
                is restricted by a template of strand lengths to predict only one sub-family of the
                parallel β-helices, a fold widely cited as similar to amyloid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Wetzel1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Perutz2">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Wille1">[43]</xref>. BETAPRO

                a general method that incorporates pairwise properties into a neural net to learn
                globular β-strands and strand-pairs.</p>
            <p>A variety of other approaches have been implemented in the search for a reliable
                detector of protein aggregation. TANGO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-FernandezEscamilla1">[45]</xref> utilizes a
                statistical mechanics approach to make secondary structure predictions, including
                differentiation of beta-aggregation from beta-sheets. The TANGO algorithm presumes
                that all residues of an aggregate will be hydrophobically buried. Zyggregator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Tartaglia1">[46]</xref>
                models aggregation propensity per residue as a combination of four factors intrinsic
                to a sequence: charge, hydrophobicity, secondary structure propensity, and the
                “pattern” of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues.
                Zyggregator derives its statistical basis from a study of effects of mutation on
                aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Chiti1">[47]</xref> and calculates its scores based on a sliding window
                of 21 residues. SALSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Zibaee1">[48]</xref> uses a sliding window to sum the cumulative
                Chou-Fasman parameter score, then selects the 400 best scores and sums each
                residue's contribution. Finally, PASTA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Trovato1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Trovato2">[50]</xref> calculates singleton
                and pairwise propensities for individual residues and residue-pairs by calculating a
                weighted average of the contribution of that residue or pair to β-strand
                formation. The pairwise scores, in turn, were calculated according to a Boltzmann
                energy function derived from the adjacencies in a database of 500 annotated
                structures.</p>
            <p>We introduce a program, BETASCAN, to predict prions and amyloids as well as other
                forms of parallel β-structure. Like PASTA, BETASCAN relies on calculation of
                strand propensities. However, BETASCAN makes use of a novel hill-climbing algorithm
                to find the most preferred β-strands and strand-pairs. Our hypothesis is
                that BETASCAN will be able to determine the location and length of the
                β-strands present in the amyloid and prion protein sequences. Coupled with a
                more statistically robust method to estimate pair propensities and the consideration
                of the amphipathic environment of amyloid β-sheets, the hill-climbing method
                leads to favorably comparable performance by BETASCAN compared to previous methods,
                as determined by existing experimental data.</p>

            <p>BETASCAN was designed, in principle, to predict parallel β-structure in all
                cases where the two surfaces of the β-sheet have significant environmental
                differences. Our strongest subset of interest within this area of competence was the
                set of prion and amyloid proteins. We therefore tested BETASCAN on five amyloids
                with known structures and a set of aggregating proteins. In order to verify the
                accuracy of BETASCAN predictions, we ran BETASCAN on a non-redundant set of
                crystallized parallel β-helix proteins. This set of structures provided the
                closest analogue to prion and amyloid proteins with detailed crystal structures

                <p>In addition to testing BETASCAN and competing programs on amyloids, we also test
                    them on their ability to detect β-strands in a superfamily of parallel
                    β-folds with solved crystal structures, namely the parallel

                    maximum β-strand length is equal or greater to the average
                    β-strand length, BETASCAN achieved 80% or greater
                    sensitivity, measured residue-by-residue, for this data set. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g002">Figure 2b</xref>, the error in the
                    predicting the left and right edges of each strand was between one and two
                    residues each. The error in edge localization was minimized when the maximum
                    β-strand length was closest to the average β-strand length, and
                    increased considerably when longer strands were considered. The
                    residue-by-residue sensitivity is thus reflective of the error in edge
                    localization.</p>

                <p>Our hypothesis that pairwise probabilities reflect the occurrence of
                    β-strands in structures necessarily implied that the scores discriminate
                    between β-forming subsequences and sequences that form loops or other
                    structures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g002">Figures 2c, 2d, and
                    2e</xref> describe the sensitivity and specificity or positive predictive value
                    of BETASCAN scores for residues and for strands. Sensitivity and specificity,
                    measured by residue, were markedly reduced if strands of sufficient length are
                    not considered, while additional strand length had little or no effect. However,
                    strand-by-strand sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were slightly improved. For
                    all lengths and scores examined, negative predictive value (NPV) was
                    95% or higher.</p>
                <p>While portions of a loop may be found in β-conformation without the
                    distinctive hydrogen bonds of a β-sheet, the majority of
                    β-strands are found in β-sheets. Therefore, the scores of the
                    predicted pairwise contacts may indicate whether a given postulated
                    β-strand is present in native or amyloid structures. With this
                    hypothesis in mind, a filter was devised to exclude strands without significant
                    associated pairwise contacts from the BETASCAN single-strand maxima results. A
                    strand was considered to have poor pairwise contacts if the summed scores of
                    pairwise contacts with the strand as the first element was less than some
                    threshold value. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g002">Figures
                        2f–2h</xref> reveal the effect of increasingly filtering
                    pairwise-poor strands on sensitivity, specificity, and strand-by-strand PPV for
                    the β-helix test set. The best results for this set, as determined by
                    the receiver-operating characteristic method, were at a pairwise filter
                    threshold score of 17. For strands with summed pairwise scores above this value,
                    91–94% sensitivity and 84–94%
                    specificity was observed, with the longest allowed strand lengths yielding the
                    best statistics. Measured residue by residue, 72–83%
                    sensitivity and 74–81% specificity were achieved, with the
                    best statistics observed at a maximum length of four residues. PPVs achieved
                    were 68–70% for strands and 70–73% for

                <p>Comparisons were also made between the BETASCAN β-helix results and the

                    Since the BETAWRAPPRO algorithm incorporates structural information specific to
                    β-helices, comparison of BETASCAN and BETAWRAPPRO indicates the relative
                    utility of structure-specific knowledge.</p>
                <p>BETAWRAPPRO predicted 276 strands in its top results for each of the
                    β-helices studied. When compared to the 631 β-strands in the
                    crystal structures, 189 were found to correspond, for a sensitivity of
                    30% and a positive predictive value of 68.4%. Of these 189
                    strands, 183 strands were considered matched by BETASCAN under the same
                    conditions used for matching in the BETASCAN analysis above. These results were
                    unchanged by changes in maximum β-strand length. Thus, BETASCAN
                    effectively reproduces the correct results of BETAWRAPPRO without
                    structure-specific knowledge. While markedly increasing sensitivity to
                    β-strands, especially to those outside the canonical β-strand
                    pattern, BETASCAN also maintains the positive predictive value achieved by
                    BETAWRAPPRO.</p>

                    strands 2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g003">Figure 3b</xref>).
                    The results of Wasmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Wasmer1">[21]</xref> indicated breaks in each of these four
                    β-strands, thus predicting a total of eight closely spaced strands. In
                    addition, the new results indicated a reversal of orientation at the breaks in
                    strands 1 and 3. PASTA predicted two strands and the possibility of a third,
                    corresponding to Ritter's strands 2, 3, and 4. The BETASCAN algorithm
                    strongly predicted Ritter's strands 2, 3, and 4 at their full length.
                    While BETASCAN's prediction matched only the C-terminal half of
                    Ritter's strand 1, it matched both strands 1a and 1b of the Wasmer
                    model at lower probability. Wasmer strands 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, and 4a were all

                    strand 1a. Each of the strand-pairs observed by Ritter and by Wasmer was found
                    in the strand-pair set predicted by BETASCAN, although the signal was not
                    clearly distinguishable from other potential pairings.</p>
                <p>α-synuclein has been analyzed by Heise et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Heise1">[51]</xref> to contain a total
                    of seven strands. The two highest-scoring, the third and sixth strands, were
                    detected by both PASTA and BETASCAN with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g003">Figure 3c</xref>). SALSA predicted the first two,
                    with a large and vague prediction of amyloid propensity covering the remaining
                    strands. While some predictions were low-scoring, only BETASCAN indicated the
                    possibility of the seven strands detected by experiment.</p>
                <p>Amylin, also known as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), was modeled by Kajava et
                    al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Kajava2">[53]</xref> to be an in-register amyloid composed of three
                    strands. PASTA predicted an amyloidogenic region from 15–32. BETASCAN
                    results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g003">Figure 3d</xref>)
                    suggested two of the three strands predicted by Kajava, part of the third strand
                    (30–33), and an additional strand at residues 3–7. This
                    potential strand may be related to the intrachain cysteine bond between residues
                    3 and 8.</p>

                    Trovato and colleagues only analyzed the PHF43 domain itself, verifying the

                    region between residues 205 and 441 is analyzed. A more extensive run of the
                    PASTA algorithm finds strands at 258 and 338. SALSA weakly detects strands at
                    about 235, as well as at 390 and 410. The more expansive BETASCAN analysis

                        BETAPRO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Cheng1">[44]</xref> is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000333-t001">Table 1</xref>. As a control, the results of JPRED
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Cuff1">[37]</xref>
                    and PSIPRED<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-McGuffin1">[57]</xref> are included to represent traditional
                    secondary structure prediction. Because of the difficulty in translating one
                    program's scores to another's, predictions were indicated as
                    ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ depending on relative
                    internal scoring and extent of prediction. For IAPP, Het-s, and
                    α-synuclein, our program BETASCAN was the only program to detect the
                    correct number of strands. All algorithms successfully predicted the strands of
                    A-β, although some did not detect all of strand 2. All algorithms were
                    also able to detect the strongest strands for the tau protein, except that
                    BETAPRO and TANGO did not detect the first strand near residue 235. BETAPRO
                    tended to miss strands, while PASTA, SALSA, and Zyggegator had difficulty
                    separating strands. TANGO tended to miss strands at the edges of β-rich
                    regions.</p>

            <p>We have introduced the program BETASCAN and showed its improved performance over
                previous methods for identifying β-strands in parallel β-structures,
                most importantly amyloid structures. The BETASCAN approach depends upon the idea
                that, while all sequences display some tendency towards the β conformation,
                sequence details determine the relative likelihood of β-strand and
                strand-pair formation at all scales. Thus, sequence has a broad effect not only on
                secondary structure, but also on the supersecondary structural assembly of
                β-strands into a β-sheet. This concept is the driving force of both
                the scoring and maxima-finding algorithms in BETASCAN. The score is designed to
                allow unbiased comparisons between β-strands differing not only in sequence,
                as in BETAWRAP, but also by length and orientation. Correspondingly, the
                maxima-finding algorithm uses these comparisons to explore strand and pair space for
                locally optimal β-strands and strand-pairs.</p>
            <p>In addition, BETASCAN may owe some of its strong performance, compared to PASTA, to
                its ability to distinguish strands of different lengths in relation to their rate of
                occurrence in nature. PASTA scores are generated for residues and residue pairs
                based upon the weighted-sum scores of every potential β-strand that could be
                formed using that residue or residue pair. In contrast, the emphasis in BETASCAN is
                placed upon finding specific high-scoring strands. Any region with a high PASTA
                score will also contain high-scoring BETASCAN predictions, which supply additional
                information about where strands are likely to begin, end, and pair. The
                concentration on the strand as the fundamental unit of β-structure also
                improves residue-by-residue detection of β-structure.</p>
            <p>BETASCAN is highly sensitive for potential strands and excellent at determining when
                sequences will not contribute to β- and amyloid structure (high negative
                predictive value). However, the effort to identify all potential β-structure
                variants can cause significant over-prediction of β-structure, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g003">3</xref> all reflect. While the highest-scoring strands
                consistently reflect real structures, only some of the lower-scoring strands are
                found in experimental data. The low-scoring strand at residue 146 in the 2PEC
                structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) is an
                example of a low-scoring strand extant in crystal structure. By synthesizing the

                strands with better performance than exclusion by low score alone, and retains

                β-strands are contributors to either amyloid or native structures. However,
                the knowledge that amyloid structures include multiple
                ‘strains’, may be heterogeneous even within a single fibril, and
                frequently include β-strands not found in the native fold of the parent
                protein, argues for the inclusion of hypothetical β-strands in analysis
                until excluded by evidence.</p>
            <p>Most interestingly, BETASCAN is capable of revealing details and variants of protein
                structure previously inaccessible to computational methods. For instance, two
                solid-state NMR studies of A-β protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Petkova1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Luhrs1">[19]</xref> produced conflicting
                results in the region between residues 30 and 42. However, each result is reflected
                in the BETASCAN results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g003">Figure
                3a</xref>), where both short strands corresponding to the Petkova results and long
                strands corresponding to the Luehrs results are high-scoring maxima. Likewise, two
                solid-state NMR studies of Het-s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Ritter1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Wasmer1">[21]</xref> were differentiated by the presence or absence of
                interruptions in the β-strands. Both the elongated and truncated versions of
                these strands were isolated by the maxima-finding subroutine of BETASCAN. Thus,
                BETASCAN can distinguish the local attractor states that the two pairs of
                experimental samples occupied, opening the possibility of understanding the
                influence of environmental conditions and/or folding kinetics on “prion
                strains” and other amyloid folding variations.</p>
            <p>BETSACAN forms part of a synergistic strategy for the evaluation of all-β
                structure. Additional β-strand specificity may be found using experimental
                contextual clues, such as discernment of physical attributes, specific links between
                residues such as cysteine bonds and side-chain ladders, and constraints on the
                conformational space of the amyloid. The variants indicated by BETSACAN may also be
                distinguished <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in</italic> vivo by additional
                exterior factors, such as pH, osmolarity, and the presence of seeding factors or
                chaperone proteins. By distinguishing folding variants and providing specific
                location and likelihood data, BETASCAN thus boosts to the efficacy of both
                experimental and computational efforts to understand the parallel β-sheets
                of amyloids and prions.</p>

                <p>BETASCAN calculates likely β-strands and strand-pairs for an input

                    length of the longest parallel β-strand in our source database.) For
                    each pair of possible strands, a score is determined corresponding to a
                    prediction of how likely their pairing would be (see <bold>Strand state
                        propensity</bold> and <bold>Pair state propensity</bold> below). This
                    probability is based on the observed preferences for each pair of residues in
                    the strands to be hydrogen-bonded (see <bold>Probability tables</bold> below).
                    Maxima-finding algorithms, also known as “hill-climbing”
                    algorithms, are then used to detect all local maxima of formation propensity
                    across strand-pair space (see <bold>Maxima finding</bold> below). The outputs of
                    BETASCAN are score-ordered lists of all locally optimal strands and
                    strand-pairings.</p>

                <p>The maxima finding subroutine of BETASCAN extracts the most likely strands and

                    result in a higher probability of formation. Not all transitions between strand
                    states or strand-pair states are physically realizable in one step. The
                    constraints on the strand and pair spaces may be described as lattices, with
                    nodes corresponding to each potential strand or strand-pair and edges
                    corresponding to the conformational changes required to form one potential
                    strand from another. Edges may be formed by the addition or removal of residues
                    at either end, by the reversal of strand orientation (180° rotation
                    around the long axis of the strand), and for strand-pairs, the shearing of the

                    identified using STRIDE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Frishman1">[60]</xref> as described in McDonnell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-McDonnell1">[41]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The all-β secondary structures of the input sequences were verified. For
                    the β-helix sequences, 3-D X-ray crystallography was available to
                    guarantee secondary structure details <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Bradley1">[40]</xref>. In addition, the
                    sequences were analyzed by the secondary structure prediction program DSSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Kabsch1">[62]</xref> to
                    localize α-helical content.</p>

                <p>BETASCAN, BETAWRAPPRO, BETAPRO, and PASTA were run on the 34 β-helix
                    structures listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000333.s001">Table S1</xref>. Because β-helix strands
                    are, on average, just over four residues in length, BETASCAN runs were executed
                    using maximum β-strand lengths of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, as well as with the
                    default length of 13. A single consistent set of predicted strands was selected
                    from the set of all predicted strands by repeatedly selecting the strand with
                    the highest positive score that failed to overlap either any previously selected
                    strand or any α-helix (as observed in crystal structure by DSSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Kabsch1">[62]</xref>.
                    The set of predicted strands was compared to the β-strands calculated
                    from crystal structures by the program STRIDE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-Frishman1">[60]</xref> according to the
                    settings of McDonnell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000333-McDonnell1">[41]</xref>. The STRIDE predictions were taken as the
                    true positive β-strands for this class.</p>
                <p>For each real strand, if at least one predicted strand overlapped more than
                    50%, a match was recorded. In addition to the fraction of matching
                    crystal and predicted strands, statistics were collected on the number of
                    matching residues and on the predictions of β-strand
                    ‘edges’. The N- and C-terminal ends of the crystal strand
                    were compared, respectively, to the N- and C-terminal ends of the N- and C-most
                    matching predicted strands. In most cases, only one predicted strand matched the
                    crystal strand, and so the ends compared were the N- and C-terminal ends of the
                    prediction.</p>
                <p>To generate ROC and sensitivity/PPV curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g002">Figures 2c–2e</xref>), the output of
                    BETASCAN was repeatedly analyzed with a lower-bound score cutoff, which was
                    varied from 0 to +2 units. For the poor-pairwise-contact filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000333-g002">Figures 2f–2h</xref>), ROC
                    and sensitivity/PPV curves were generated as follows. For each strand in the
                    BETASCAN singleton results, the scores of all strand-pairs sharing the first
                    residue of the first pair (parameter <italic>p</italic>) with the predicted
                    β-strand were summed. The β-strand was removed from the
                    prediction if the summed score was less than the summed-score cutoff, which was
                    varied from 0 to +40 units to produce the curves shown.</p>

                    structures; this yielded a set of 276 strands predicted by BETAWRAPPRO. A

                <p>BETAPRO, PASTA, SALSA, TANGO, PSIPRED, and JPRED were executed using all default
                    settings. Zyggregator was used in fibrillar mode. To avoid bias and in keeping
                    with author suggestions, no additional secondary structure descriptions or
                    alignments were input to BETAPRO or JPRED. To overcome differences in scoring
                    methods, predictions in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000333-t001">Table

                    ‘weak’ (w), ‘no prediction’ (n), or no
                    data available (x). A prediction was rated as ‘strong’ if
                    more than 2/3 of the strand's length was predicted and if the internal
                    rating system of the program (if present) scored any portion of the strand as
                    greater than 50% of the peak prediction for that sequence. The
                    prediction was rated ‘weak’ if the above conditions were not
                    satisfied, but more than two residues of the strand were predicted at any
                    confidence level. A prediction was indicated as (+) if the requirements
                    for a weak prediction were met, but no separation existed between strand
                    predictions.</p>
