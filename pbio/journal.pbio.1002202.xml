<abstract>
<p>Lactate has long been considered a “waste” by-product of cell metabolism, and it accumulates at sites of inflammation. Recent findings have identified lactate as an active metabolite in cell signalling, although its effects on immune cells during inflammation are largely unexplored. Here we ask whether lactate is responsible for T cells remaining entrapped in inflammatory sites, where they perpetuate the chronic inflammatory process. We show that lactate accumulates in the synovia of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Extracellular sodium lactate and lactic acid inhibit the motility of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively. This selective control of T cell motility is mediated via subtype-specific transporters (Slc5a12 and Slc16a1) that we find selectively expressed by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> subsets, respectively. We further show both in vitro and in vivo that the sodium lactate-mediated inhibition of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell motility is due to an interference with glycolysis activated upon engagement of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 with the chemokine CXCL10. In contrast, we find the lactic acid effect on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell motility to be independent of glycolysis control. In CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells, sodium lactate also induces a switch towards the Th17 subset that produces large amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17, whereas in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, lactic acid causes the loss of their cytolytic function. We further show that the expression of lactate transporters correlates with the clinical T cell score in the synovia of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Finally, pharmacological or antibody-mediated blockade of subtype-specific lactate transporters on T cells results in their release from the inflammatory site in an in vivo model of peritonitis. By establishing a novel role of lactate in control of proinflammatory T cell motility and effector functions, our findings provide a potential molecular mechanism for T cell entrapment and functional changes in inflammatory sites that drive chronic inflammation and offer targeted therapeutic interventions for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Acidity is a feature of inflammatory sites such as arthritic synovia, atherosclerotic plaques, and tumor microenvironments and results in part from the accumulation of lactate as a product of glycolysis under hypoxic conditions. Recently it has emerged that lactate may be more than just a bystander and might act to modulate the immune-inflammatory response. Here we report just such activity: lactate inhibits T cell motility by interfering with glycolysis that is required for T cells to migrate, it causes T cells to produce higher amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17, and it triggers loss of cytolytic activity. These phenomena are hallmark features of T cells in chronic inflammatory infiltrates. The functional changes depend on the expression of specific lactate transporters by different subsets of T cells, namely the sodium lactate transporter Slc5a12 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the lactic acid transporter Slc16a1 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We propose that T cells entering inflammatory sites sense high concentrations of lactate via their specific transporters. Loss of motility leads to their entrapment at the site, where through their increased production of inflammatory cytokines yet decreased cytolytic capacity, they add detrimentally to chronic inflammation. Targeting lactate transporters and/or metabolic pathways on T cells could deliver novel, invaluable therapeutics for the treatment of widespread chronic inflammatory disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent studies have shed light on the interconnection between metabolism and immunity in multicellular organisms and their functional coordination for an effective establishment and resolution of immune responses. Imbalance of this delicate signaling network might lead to nonresolving inflammation and consequently to the development of chronic inflammatory disease (CID) [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
<p>T cells play a major role in the inflammatory process via both their cytolytic activities and the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which regulate immune responses. Upon antigen recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR), downstream signaling events in naïve T cells lead to activation, proliferation and differentiation into effector T cells. To maintain adequate supply of macromolecules (e.g., amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids) during growth, T cells undergo a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis that is driven by signaling events generated by the TCR and the costimulatory molecule CD28 [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The metabolic machinery is also likely to directly affect T cell migratory events, as T lymphocytes continuously recirculate between different microenvironments (e.g., blood, lymphoid tissues, and peripheral tissues), which might in turn modulate T cell metabolism. In these “milieus”, they are exposed to different nutrient availability and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) tension and must adapt their metabolic pathways to effectively mediate immune responses. The direct effect of metabolism on the trafficking ability of T cells, however, is yet to be investigated [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>A metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis comprises the up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters to the membrane, leading to an increase in glycolytic flux and the concomitant production of lactate [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This carbon molecule has long been considered a metabolic “waste” by-product of highly proliferating cells. Recently, this view has been challenged by the observation that lactate can act as a signaling molecule and provide a “danger” signal [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Findings that endothelial cells and human cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) can take up extracellular lactate [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], that lactate inhibits phosphofructokinase (Pfk) [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and that exposure to lactate leads to a dramatic change in gene expression in L6 muscle cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have shed light on the complexity and scope of lactate as an active metabolite driving signaling pathways that modulate cell functions.</p>
<p>Proinflammatory chemokines such as chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)10 are produced in response to inflammatory stimuli and attract effector T cells to the site of inflammation to fulfill their effector functions [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Inflammatory sites, however, are “harsh” microenvironments enriched with factors released by cellular components of the inflammatory infiltrates and the injured tissue itself that might affect the behavior of effector T cells and influence the outcome of the immune response [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A key feature of the inflammatory microenvironment is the accumulation of lactate, a by-product of the glycolytic pathway. Depending on the pH, lactate exists as the protonated acidic form (lactic acid) in a low pH environment or as sodium salt (sodium lactate) at basic pH [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In physiological conditions (pH 7.2), most of the lactate is deprotonated and is present in the negatively charged, biologically active form as lactate anion [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we have investigated, both in vitro and in vivo, the role of lactate in the regulation of metabolic and inflammatory circuits in control of T cell migration and functions and its relevance to the physiopathology of CID.</p>

<title>Lactate Inhibits Activated T Cell Motility</title>
<p>To assess whether T cell motility is affected by lactate, we performed assays whereby chemotaxis of T cells activated for 5 d with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, and interleukin (IL)-2 was induced by the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10 in the presence of 10 mM lactic acid or sodium lactate, a concentration of lactate we measured in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) and found in a number of inflammatory sites [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell chemotaxis was inhibited by sodium lactate whereas that of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was inhibited by lactic-acid but not vice versa (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As T cell migration is activated by several chemokines, leading to different responses [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we also tested the effect of lactate on chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)5-induced chemotaxis. CCL5-induced motility of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was decreased in sodium lactate–rich but not lactic acid–rich environments (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>), suggesting a broader action of lactate in chemokine-induced signaling and downstream effects than we had anticipated in our experiments shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002202.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>. Motility of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upon sodium lactate treatment decreased with increasing concentration of sodium lactate with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of about 10 mM sodium lactate (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). These concentrations of sodium lactate and lactic acid did not affect cellular viability (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>As acidification “per se” could affect cellular motility [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we performed additional chemotaxis assays to discriminate the effects of lactic acid on the motility of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from the effects of pH reduction in the culture media due to the addition of 10 mM lactic acid. Lactate is present in solution either as the acid in its undissociated form (i.e., lactic acid) at low pH or as the ion salt (i.e., sodium lactate) at higher pH. We found that progressive acidification of medium containing sodium lactate (10 mM)—which increases the availability of lactic acid—reduced the motility of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Importantly, neither the presence in the culture media of sodium lactate (10 mM) alone nor acidifying the culture media to pH 4.5 with HCl alone had any effects on the motility of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). In line with recently reported findings in macrophages [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], our data show that inhibition of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell motility by lactic acid cannot be simply ascribed to its effect on the acidification of the culture media; rather simultaneous availability of lactate and H<sup>+</sup> is necessary to regulate the motility of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This effect did not apply to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells since their migration was not affected in lactic acid–rich medium (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>The Effects of Lactate Action on Different T Cell Subsets Are Mediated by Distinct Transporters</title>
<p>We next investigated the molecular basis of the differential and mutually exclusive responsiveness of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to sodium lactate or lactic acid, respectively.

Slc5a12 is a sodium-coupled lactate transporter [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

<p>We subsequently sought to confirm that the differently expressed lactate transporters were functional in T cell chemotaxis inhibition.

<title>Sodium Lactate Limits Basal and Chemokine-Induced Aerobic Glycolysis in CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells</title>
<p>The lactate transporters specificity (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and the T cell insensitivity to lactate upon transporter inhibition (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B–2D</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002202.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>) suggest that the effects of lactate are mediated by intracellular signaling, possibly interfering with the cell metabolic machinery, and specifically with the glycolytic pathway [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], engaged downstream of chemokine receptor triggering.</p>
<p>We started by investigating the effect of CXCL10 treatment in the presence or absence of lactate on the induction of glycolysis in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated for 3 d with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies and IL-2. Glycolytic enzymes are expressed in naive T cells and their expression is markedly increased upon T cell activation [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; nevertheless, we found that CXCR3 engagement with CXCL10 was able to cause a further significant up-regulation of two rate-limiting enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, Hk1 (NM_00114100.1) and pyruvate kinase (Pk)M1/2 (NM_011099.3) (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Specifically, data quantification across independent experiments revealed significant up-regulation of Hk1 at 2 h and PkM1/2 at 4 h post-CXCL10 treatment, as compared to the levels expressed by activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells left untreated (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> right). Although Hk1 appears to be up-regulated also at 4 h post CXCL10 treatment as compared to the untreated control in the western blot shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> left, statistical analysis across independent experiments showed a slight down-regulation of Hk1 at this point as compared to the untreated control (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> right). Similarly, <italic>Hk1</italic> and <italic>PkM2</italic> mRNA levels were up-regulated after 6 h of treatment with CXCL10 (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). These data suggest the existence of multiple levels of regulation of the glycolytic pathway downstream of CXCR3 triggering, being both post-translational and transcriptional. In addition, activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell exposure to CXCL10 led to increased gene expression of glucose transporters (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Remarkably, data quantification across independent experiments also revealed that activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells treated with CXCL10 in the presence of sodium lactate had significantly reduced levels of Hk1 as compared to cells treated with CXCL10 alone (both at 2 and 4 h) or left untreated (only at 4 h; although a reduction appears also at 2 h in the western blot shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> left as compared to the untreated control, this down-regulation did not reach statistical significance across independent experiments [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> right]). In contrast, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells did not undergo major changes in the expression of glycolytic genes and proteins upon exposure to CXCL10 (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Since glycolysis is selectively activated in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upon CXCR3 triggering, we then tested the effects of sodium lactate on the glycolytic energy metabolism of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells under basal conditions by measuring the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in the cell culture media of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in real time via the use of the Seahorse analyzer. We found that sodium lactate decreased the ECAR of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from an average of 14 mpH/min in the untreated control to a level of less than 5 mpH/min (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), indicating a decrease in glycolytic flux. In support of these data, we treated CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with the fluorescent analogues of glucose, 6-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (6-NBDG), and 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (2-NBDG), in the presence or absence of sodium lactate or lactic acid [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We found lower 6-NBDG-fluorescence and higher 2-NBDG-fluorescence in sodium lactate–treated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as compared to lactic acid–treated or untreated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells suggesting that sodium lactate but not lactic acid selectively blocks glucose uptake and glycolytic flux in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; the opposite was observed in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002202.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C Fig</xref>). As expected, the inhibitor of glycolysis 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) showed similar effects on 2-NBDG and 6-NBDG fluorescence in both T cell subsets (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002202.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C Fig</xref>), further indicating the specificity of the effects of sodium lactate and lactic acid in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively.</p>
<p>We next investigated whether sodium lactate was able to diminish glycolysis also upon CXCR3 engagement by CXCL10. Exposing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to CXCL10 raised the ECAR value for several time points, indicating that the glycolytic flux is increased in these conditions (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Adding sodium lactate to the CXCL10-stimulated cells shut down glycolysis, as reflected by a drastic fall in ECAR (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>

<title>Basal and Chemokine-Induced Aerobic Glycolysis Is Required for CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cell Migration Both In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
<p>The down-regulation of glycolysis and the inhibitory effect on migration upon sodium lactate exposure—lactate being a direct and indirect inhibitor of glycolysis [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]—suggest that glycolysis is required for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell migration. To test this hypothesis, we treated activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with inhibitors or activators of glycolysis and assessed their chemotactic responses to CXCL10. Direct or indirect inhibition of glycolysis with the glucose analogue, 2-DG, or mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D Fig</xref>), caused a decrease in chemotaxis in vitro and in a well-established in vivo model of T cell recruitment to the peritoneum (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>, and <xref rid="pbio.1002202.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3E Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Conversely, activation of glycolysis via the use of the electron transfer chain Complex I inhibitor, metformin (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], increased chemotaxis towards CXCL10 both in vitro and in vivo (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F and 3G</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002202.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3E Fig</xref>). Accounting for the specificity of our glycolytic measurements, etomoxir, an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, had only minor effects on glycolysis (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Metabolic drugs interfering with glycolysis had similar effects on T cell motility in spontaneous transendothelial migration assays (i.e., independent of any proinflammatory chemokine stimulus), implying the role of this pathway in steady-state control of T cell migration (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). Importantly, exposure to the various metabolic drugs at the concentrations used did not affect the T cell surface molecule phenotype (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002202.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> Figs).</p>
<p>The importance of aerobic glycolysis in activation and function of T cells has been shown previously [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], yet its potential impact on T cell migration is still unexplored; thus we assessed the impact of glycolysis on migration of naïve T cells, which mainly rely upon oxidative metabolism for their homeostasis [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Similar to what we had observed in activated T cells, inhibition of glycolysis via 2-DG and rapamycin resulted in a decrease in naïve T lymphocyte motility (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3F Fig</xref>), suggesting a general control of T cell migration via the glycolytic pathway. In contrast to activated T cells, however, exposure to metformin reduced naïve T cell migration (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3F Fig</xref>), indicating the existence of different metabolic checkpoints between naïve and activated T cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
<p>Overall, metabolic drugs did not affect T cell survival at the concentrations and in the experimental conditions we used (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Lactate Modulates Effector T Cell Functions</title>
<p>To investigate whether sodium lactate could affect CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell effector functions, we induced polarization of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells towards Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets in the appropriate cytokine “milieus” [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

We then tested the effect of the presence of sodium lactate on the release of cytokines by the different Th subsets in the same polarizing conditions. Gene expression analysis showed that treatment with sodium lactate caused a significant up-regulation of <italic>Il-17</italic> (NM_010552.3) in all the Th subsets (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).

<title>Inhibition of Lactate Transporters Promotes the Release of T Cells from the Inflamed Tissue</title>
<p>We have shown that in humans the synovial fluid of RA contains elevated levels of lactate compared with noninflammatory types of arthritis (e.g., osteoarthritis [OA], <xref rid="pbio.1002202.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The rheumatoid synovial environment is paradigmatic of all the lactate-induced changes in T cells, including entrapment, IL-17 secretion and loss of antigen responsiveness [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We therefore investigated the expression and cellular localization of Slc5a12 and Slc16a1 within the synovial tissue of 16 patients suffering from RA (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>, demographical data). We first stratified RA patients for the amount of CD3<sup>+</sup> infiltrating T cells using a semiquantitative score (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) as we previously described [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Next, we performed gene expression analysis and found that <italic>Slc5a12</italic> mRNA expression significantly increased in correlation with the T cell score of the samples tested (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Albeit not significant, a trend towards increased <italic>Slc16a1</italic> expression could also be observed in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). In order to confirm our in vitro data that Slc5a12 is expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> but not CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), we performed double immunofluorescence for Slc5a12 and either CD4 or CD8. As shown in <xref rid="pbio.1002202.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>, within the RA synovial tissue Slc5a12 is abundantly and selectively expressed by CD4<sup>+</sup> but not CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Enhanced expression of the Slc5a12 transporter by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the RA synovia opens the possibility that this transporter might be mediating the migratory and functional changes that we have previously described and that correlate with key features of T cell infiltrates in RA. In support to this, we found that CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of human healthy donors responded in vitro to sodium lactate and lactic acid similarly to their murine counterparts in terms of migration (i.e., activated human CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells; <xref rid="pbio.1002202.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>) and expression of IL-17 protein (i.e., activated human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upon exposure to sodium lactate as compared to cells left untreated; <xref rid="pbio.1002202.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>

<p>Prompted by these results, we sought to assess whether lactate promotes the retention of T cells into inflammatory sites in vivo and whether inhibitors of the lactate transporters favor the release of T cells from the inflamed site. We used a well-established mouse model of zymosan-induced peritonitis, in which T cells are recruited to the inflamed site 5 d after zymosan injection [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. C57BL/6 mice were injected in the peritoneal cavity with zymosan (1 mg/mouse) on day 0 or left untreated. On day 5, phloretin, an anti-Slc5a12 antibody or an isotype control antibody were injected into the peritoneal cavity. 24 h later, mice were killed and the peritoneal lavage was harvested. Lactate levels and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were increased significantly in the peritoneum of recipient animals (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CIDs are a major public health concern in the western world. The nonresolving nature of inflammation in CID, associated with excessive and inappropriate activation of the immune system, is pivotal to the disease process and represents a treasure trove for drug discovery via the identification of novel processes and molecules that could be targeted for the design of new therapeutics.</p>
<p>In this study, we have identified a key role for the glycolytic pathway and its metabolite, lactate, in the regulation of T cell migration and functions in inflammation. Lactate can be imported into the cell through specific transporters and acts as a potent inhibitor of two of the rate-limiting enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, Hk (catalyzing the first reaction) and Pfk (the key enzyme in setting the pace of glycolysis, which catalyzes the third reaction), but does not affect Pk (the third rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, which catalyzes the tenth and last reaction) [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consistently, our data show lactate-induced down-regulation of Hk1 but not PkM1/2 protein levels. Unlike Hk1 and PkM1/2, we did not find any significant regulation of Pfk upon CXCL10 stimulus. Nevertheless, our data shows that lactate down-regulates Hk1, which is sufficient to reduce the glycolytic flux and in turn causes reduced T cell migration. In recent years, aerobic glycolysis has been associated with cell division in a number of physiological (e.g., immunity, stem cell compartment) [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and pathological (e.g., cancers) processes [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Very recently, however, a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis has been linked to more specialized–independent of proliferation–cell functions, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production in T cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and vessel sprouting in endothelial cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the latter study, glycolysis has been directly linked to cytoskeleton reorganization and migration of endothelial cells during neoangiogenesis via the glycolytic activator 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). Up to date, a direct link between T cell migration and intracellular metabolic pathways had not been established [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our study provides direct evidence that intracellular metabolism, specifically glycolysis, is required for chemokine-induced T cell migration. Further studies will be required to identify specific factors and pathways to causally link the induction of aerobic glycolysis that happens during T cell migration in response to the chemokine stimulus to actin and cytoskeleton reorganization as well as its physiological impact.</p>
<p>The effect of lactate on T cells is exerted via transporters, which are differentially expressed by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This is a previously unknown feature that differentiates these two subsets. As T cells are likely to be exposed to lactate as a consequence of the high proliferation rates in the thymus, it is possible that the expression of either transporter is determined and functional during development and might be regulated by other developmental signals, such as TCR engagement. The physiological significance of distinct lactate transporter expression by CD4<sup>+</sup>- and CD8<sup>+</sup>-activated T cells might dictate their functional and migratory responses depending on the nature of the inflammatory exudate (i.e., more lactic acid versus sodium lactate) and underlay the differential distribution of these T cell subsets in the inflamed tissue, as it has been described in tumours and CIDs [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Clarifying the molecular mechanisms and physiological significance of this differential expression will require further investigations.</p>
<p>The effect of lactate on T cells recapitulates key features of T lymphocytes found in chronic inflammatory infiltrates, including their entrapment and production of high levels of IL-17 and loss of cytolytic activity by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We show that sodium lactate induces all CD4<sup>+</sup> Th subsets to increase their production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17, which is prevalent in the inflamed tissue and is known to drive forward the chronic inflammatory process in many CIDs [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Previous reports have shown that HIF-induced glycolysis is necessary to promote the differentiation of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells toward the Th17 subset [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We have analyzed memory T cells already committed to a specific subset, similar to T cells in the inflammatory site. After in vitro incubation with sodium lactate, these cells acquire a mixed phenotype whereby they continue to express their own signature cytokines but at the same time increase the expression of Rorγt and IL-17. In this context, it has recently been suggested that increased salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) concentrations found locally under physiological conditions in vivo markedly boost the induction of murine and human Th17 cells in autoimmune conditions [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Our results expand this observation to a broader range of salts, including sodium lactate. In keeping with the in vitro data, we also show that in the chronically inflamed synovial tissue of patients with RA, a disease associated with high levels of IL-17<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the joints [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup>, but not CD8<sup>+</sup>, T cells almost invariably displayed high expression of Slc5a12. This suggests that the expression of Slc5a12 on the CD4<sup>+</sup> subset may be involved in the entrapment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the chronically inflamed “milieu” of the RA synovia (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). In this context, we show that targeting the lactate transporters Slc16a1 and Slc5a12 re-establish T cell migration away from the inflammatory site and block the production of high amounts of IL-17, with potential therapeutic implications in the management of CIDs (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). The mechanisms for lactate-mediated induction of IL-17 production are at present unclear; further studies will be required to assess whether such control occurs at metabolic level. These findings also suggest the idea that elevated lactate concentrations within an inflamed site might sustain persistent inflammation by reducing T lymphocyte cytolytic killing activity (<xref rid="pbio.1002202.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>

<p>In summary, our observations suggest that lactate-induced signaling in the inflammatory “milieu” may promote many of the pathogenic features and persistence of the T cell infiltrates. Importantly, we show that pharmacologic targeting of lactate transporters in T cells might provide a novel and viable approach to resolve chronic T cell–mediated inflammation in CIDs.</p>

<title>Measurement of Lactate, Glycolysis, Glucose Uptake/Flux and Cell Death</title>
<p>Lactate concentration was measured in the synovial fluid or peritoneal lavage using the Lactate assay Kit (Biovision), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Glycolytic metabolism was measured with a Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Briefly, T cells were grown in high glucose RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. One hour before the experiment, 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> T cells were seeded in a 24-well microplate in XF Assay Modified DMEM, and CXCL10, sodium lactate, metabolic drugs, or PBS were injected during measurement. For glucose uptake and flux assays, 6-NBDG and 2-NBDG (Life), two fluorescent analogues of glucose that are taken up by cells via glucose transporters, were used. Their fate differs upon cellular uptake. 6-NBDG cannot be phosphorylated by hexokinase, the enzyme that initiates glycolysis, and accumulates in the cytoplasm in its fluorescent form. 2-NBDG instead is phosphorylated by hexokinase and transformed in nonfluorescent intermediates of the glycolytic pathway with kinetics dependent on the pace of the glycolytic flux in the cell [<xref rid="pbio.1002202.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Therefore, parallel measurements of 6-NBDG and 2-NBDG fluorescence provide a read out of glucose uptake and glycolytic flux in cells.
