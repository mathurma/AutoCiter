                <p>Cysteine (Cys) residues often play critical roles in proteins, for example, in
                    the formation of structural disulfide bonds, metal binding, targeting proteins
                    to the membranes, and various catalytic functions. However, the structural
                    determinants for various Cys functions are not clear. Thiol oxidoreductases,
                    which are enzymes containing catalytic redox-active Cys residues, have been
                    extensively studied, but even for these proteins there is little understanding
                    of what distinguishes their catalytic redox Cys from other Cys functions.
                    Herein, we characterized thiol oxidoreductases at a structural level and
                    developed an algorithm that can recognize these enzymes by (i) analyzing amino
                    acid and secondary structure composition of the active site and its similarity
                    to known active sites containing redox Cys and (ii) calculating accessibility,
                    active site location, and reactivity of Cys. For proteins with known or modeled
                    structures, this method can identify proteins with catalytic Cys residues and
                    distinguish thiol oxidoreductases from the enzymes containing other catalytic
                    Cys types. Furthermore, by applying this procedure to <italic>Saccharomyces
                        cerevisiae</italic> proteins containing conserved Cys, we could identify the
                    majority of known yeast thiol oxidoreductases. This study provides insights into
                    the structural properties of catalytic redox-active Cys and should further help
                    to recognize thiol oxidoreductases in protein sequence and structure
                databases.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Among the 20 amino acids commonly found in proteins, cysteine (Cys) is special in
                    that it is present more often than other residues in functionally important
                    locations within proteins. Some of these functions include metal binding,
                    catalysis, structural stability, and posttranslational modifications.
                    Identifying these functions in proteins of unknown function is difficult, in
                    part because it is unclear which features distinguish one Cys function from the
                    other. Among proteins with functionally important Cys, a large group of proteins
                    utilizes this residue for redox catalysis. These proteins possess different
                    folds and are collectively known as thiol oxidoreductases. In this work, we
                    developed a procedure that allows recognition of these proteins by analyzing
                    their structures or structural models. The method is based on the analyses of
                    amino acid and secondary structure composition of Cys environment in proteins,
                    their similarity to known thiol oxidoreductases, and calculations of Cys
                    accessibility, reactivity, and location in predicted active sites. The procedure
                    performed well on a set of test proteins and also selectively recognized thiol
                    oxidoreductases by analyzing the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>
                    protein set. Thus, this study generated new information about the structural
                    features of thiol oxidoreductases and may help to recognize these proteins in
                    protein structure databases.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Compared to other amino acids in proteins, cysteine (Cys) residues are less frequent,
                yet often more conserved and found in functionally important locations.
                Protein-based Cys thiols can be divided into several broad categories wherein these
                residues (i) are engaged in structural disulfide bonds, (ii) coordinate metals,
                (iii) carry out catalysis, (iv) serve as sites of various posttranslational
                modification, or (v) are simply dispensable for protein function.</p>
            <p>Structural disulfide bonds are typically observed in oxidizing environments such as
                periplasm in prokaryotes, and extracellular space and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
                in eukaryotes. Structural disulfides are formed by designated systems for oxidative
                protein folding, for example DsbA and DsbB in bacteria and protein disulfide
                isomerase and Ero1 in the eukaryotic ER. In addition, disulfides as stabilizing or
                regulatory elements may occur intracellularly. However, there are also situations
                when the introduced intraprotein disulfide leads to a decreased protein stability
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Wouters1">[1]</xref>.
                Structural stability may also be achieved when Cys residues are linked by metal
                ions, such as zinc and iron. In addition, Cys-coordinated metal ions may serve
                catalytic functions; for example, when the metal is zinc, copper, nickel, molybdenum
                or iron. Metal-coordinating thiols are typically found intracellularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Kadokura1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Maattanen1">[3]</xref>, but
                may also occur in the extracellular space.</p>
            <p>Another important functional category of Cys residues involves catalytic Cys that act
                as nucleophiles. This situation occurs, for example, in Cys proteases and tyrosine
                phosphatases where Cys does not change redox state during catalysis, and in
                thioredoxins and glutaredoxins where Cys undergoes reversible oxidation and
                reduction. In the latter case, thiol oxidation may result in the formation of an
                intermediate disulfide bond with another protein thiol. In the absence of nearby Cys
                residue, thiol oxidation may lead to sulfenic acid (-SOH), sulfinic acid
                (-SO<sub>2</sub>H), S-nitrosothiol (-SNO), or S-glutathionylation (-SSG). In the
                majority of these intermediates (with the exception of sulfinic acids), the oxidized
                forms of Cys can be reduced by thiol oxidoreductases, such as thioredoxin and
                glutaredoxin, by glutathione, or by other protein and low molecular weight
                reductants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Ghezzi1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Berndt1">[5]</xref>. Even sulfinic acids can be reduced in a select
                class of proteins, for example, in peroxiredoxins by a protein known as sulfiredoxin
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Biteau1">[6]</xref>.
                Since these oxidized thiol forms are often reversible, they constitute a facile
                switch for modulating protein activity and function.</p>
            <p>Reversible thiol oxidation has received considerable attention in recent years due to
                its ability to regulate proteins, protect them against stress and influence
                signaling. For example, sulfenic acid formation is often an intermediate step in
                generating disulfides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Poole1">[7]</xref>. Recent work has analyzed Cys-SOH formation in a
                set of test proteins by examining their functional sites and electrostatic
                properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Salsbury1">[8]</xref>. The authors characterized several features of these
                proteins including significant underrepresentation of charged residues and
                occurrence of polar uncharged residues in the vicinity of modified Cys.
                Nevertheless, at present little is known about the sequence or structural features
                that can be employed to predict these proteins in sequence or structure databases.
                Much recent work has focused on S-glutathionylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-DalleDonne1">[9]</xref>, but common features
                of these modification sites are also unclear, especially as tools to identify other
                glutathionylation sites. Similarly, the determinants of S-nitrosylation are poorly
                understood. In the latter case, previously reported features include the presence of
                acid-base motifs flanking the modified Cys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Greco1">[10]</xref>, and, in contrast to the
                Cys-SOH-containing proteins, higher frequency of charged residues.</p>
            <p>In addition, attempts have been made to examine sites of Cys oxidation at a
                structural level. One study evaluated simple structural properties and aimed at
                identifying common features of the environment in the vicinity of Cys residues that
                undergo reversible redox changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Sanchez1">[11]</xref>. Parameters that positively correlated with the
                occurrence of these Cys included (i) proximity to another Cys residue; (ii) low pKa
                (lower than ca. 9.06); and (iii) significant exposure (greater than 1.3
                    Å<sup>2</sup>) of the sulfur atom to solvent. Additional parameters
                reported were spatial proximity of both proton donor and proton acceptor to the
                redox Cys. However, this generic approach combined the analysis of catalytic and
                regulatory Cys, which by nature, are different. In addition, with this approach,
                almost all protein tyrosine phosphatases, ubiquitin-activating E1-like enzymes,
                thymidylate synthases and other enzymes with catalytic non-redox Cys could be
                detected, mainly because of their reactive (i.e., low pKa and high exposure)
                catalytic Cys.</p>
            <p>Although Cys residues often serve roles critical to protein function and regulation,
                the presence of a Cys <italic>per se</italic> by no means implies any of these
                features. Analyses of Cys conservation may help identify some catalytic and
                functional Cys, but mostly for proteins with already known functions. Nevertheless,
                at present, sequence-based methods provide the most straightforward approach to
                analyze Cys function. For example, many catalytic redox Cys can be efficiently
                identified by searching for Cys-selenocysteine (Sec) pairs in homologous sequences
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Fomenko1">[12]</xref>.
                This idea stems from the observations that known functions of Sec are limited to
                redox functions and that most selenoproteins have homologs in which Sec is replaced
                with a conserved Cys (implicating this Cys in redox catalysis).</p>
            <p>We hypothesized that identification of Cys function may be assisted by examining
                unique features of each Cys function in proteins. In this work, we analyzed general
                features of catalytic redox-active Cys via functional profiles of active sites and
                structural analyses of reaction centers. When integrated with the tools for enzyme
                active site prediction and titration properties of active site residues, this
                approach allowed efficient prediction of thiol oxidoreductases in protein structure
                databases.</p>

                <p>To examine common features of thiol oxidoreductase active sites, we first built a
                    protein dataset containing previously described thiol oxidoreductases. It
                    included representative members of protein families with known three-dimensional
                    structures. We paid particular attention to balance the representation of
                    thioredoxin fold (which is the most common fold found in thiol oxidoreductases)
                    and non-thioredoxin fold oxidoreductases.</p>
                <p>The resulting dataset consisted of 75 structures in which none of the protein
                    domains, as defined by SCOP classification, was represented by more than 7
                    structures. Of these 75 proteins, 40 had thioredoxin-fold, including homologs of
                    glutathione peroxidase (10 representatives), thioredoxin (7),
                    glutaredoxin/thioltransferase (13), protein disulfide isomerase (3), DsbA (2),
                    C-terminal domain of DsbC/DsbG (2), selenoprotein W (2) and ArsC (1). The
                    non-thioredoxin fold proteins of our redox dataset included 35 proteins
                    organized in 10 structural folds (thirteen protein families), including
                    FAD/NAD-dependent reductase (9 representatives), Ohr/OsmC resistance protein
                    (6), methionine-S-sulfoxide reductase (3), reductase with the protein tyrosine
                    phosphatase fold (3), GAF-domain methionine sulfoxide reductase fRMsr (2),
                    FAD-dependent thiol oxidase (2), methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase (2),
                    antioxidant defense protein AhpD (2), Ero1 (1), and thiol-disulfide interchange

                    from other catalytic Cys residues. Clearly, these two Cys types share
                    active-site location and high reactivity (e.g., both redox and non-redox Cys are
                    often strong nucleophiles). To ascertain differences between these protein
                    classes, we built a separate control dataset of proteins containing catalytic
                    non-redox Cys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s008">Table S2</xref>). This set was composed of 36 proteins (organized in the
                    form of 17 families/9 folds) including papain-like (9 representatives),
                    penta-EF-hand (2), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase UCH-13 (1), FMDV leader
                    protease (1), caspase catalytic domain (3), gingipain R (1), adenain-like (2),
                    pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (1), hedgehog C-terminal autoprocessing domain
                    (1), high molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (4), dual
                    specificity phosphatase-like (2), thymidylase synthase/dCMP hydroxymethylase
                    (2), low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase (1), calpain large
                    subunit, catalytic domain (domain II) (1), dipeptidyl peptidase I (cathepsin C)
                    domain (1), viral Cys protease of trypsin fold (2), Ulp1 protease family (1),
                    and ubiquitin-activating enzyme (1).</p>
                <p>The method further presented in this work is divided into two parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g001">Figure 1A</xref>): the first employs
                    knowledge-based information for detection of thiol oxidoreductases by analyzing
                    structural and compositional similarity to the active sites of known thiol
                    oxidoreductases; and the second makes use of energy-based methods to assess
                    properties of the catalytic redox-active Cys. For simplicity we refer to the
                    first part as Active Site Similarity, and to the second as Cys Reactivity.</p>

                    acid composition of active sites at two distances from the catalytic Cys; (ii)

                <p>To analyze amino acid composition of the region surrounding catalytic Cys in
                    known thiol oxidoreductases, we determined the occurrence of amino acids within
                    a sphere centered at the sulfur atom of the catalytic Cys with two radii, 6
                    Å and 8 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). For this, we separately examined thioredoxin-fold,
                    FAD-containing, and other non-thioredoxin fold thiol oxidoreductases.</p>
                <p>For comparison, we analyzed two sets of randomly chosen Cys-containing proteins
                    (800 and 1000 proteins, respectively), from which any proteins present in the
                    thiol oxidoreductase and control datasets were excluded. Cys residues present in
                    randomly chosen proteins represented an average composition of amino acids in
                    the vicinity of Cys in protein structures. For each of the six so-defined groups
                    of proteins (i.e., three groups of thiol oxidoreductases, a group containing
                    catalytic non-redox Cys, and two groups of randomly chosen proteins) an average
                    amino acid composition was calculated for 6 Å and 8 Å
                    distances from the sulfur atom of Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, each group of
                    proteins with catalytic Cys showed unique amino acid occurrence that was also
                    different from those of the two sets of randomly chosen proteins. This was
                    particularly evident in the 6 Å datasets.</p>

                    Nevertheless, these data can be used, in a multi-parameter approach like the one

                <p>We further employed the average occurrences of each amino acid in the vicinity of
                    Cys as profiles (or dictionaries, to avoid confusion with the structural
                    profiles described later on), specific for each set, in which every amino acid
                    had its protein function-specific occurrence. The use of these dictionaries as
                    predictive tool is straightforward: for a given protein, occurrences of amino
                    acids located within 6 Å and separately within 8 Å of each
                    Cys sulfur atom are calculated, compared with the dictionaries of each reference
                    protein class, and scored.</p>
                <p>The occurrence that receives the highest score is assigned to the corresponding
                    protein class. For example, when a score is closest to those of thiol
                    oxidoreductase dictionaries, it is considered positive, and in all other cases
                    it is considered negative. In the former case, a positive value (0.375 from each
                    of the 6 Å and 8 Å distance calculations) is given to the
                    final SF while in other cases a null value is given. Thus, the dictionary
                    component of the Compositional analysis can give an overall contribution of up
                    to 0.75 to the SF.</p>
                <p>These analyses detected differences in amino acid occurrence around catalytic Cys
                    between thiol oxidoreductases and proteins containing catalytic non-redox Cys
                    residues. In addition, within thiol oxidoreductases, the amino acid composition
                    of FAD-containing enzymes was unique. For example, thioredoxin-fold thiol
                    oxidoreductases showed an overall high representation of aromatic residues near
                    the catalytic Cys, whereas FAD-containing thiol oxidoreductases showed lower
                    occurrences of these residues. Thus, for this step of the procedure,
                    FAD-containing thiol oxidoreductases were not considered. It should be noted
                    that this did not affect the overall analysis as other steps of the method
                    performed well with these enzymes and they could still be identified by the
                    overall method. With this restriction, we found that several amino acids,
                    including Pro, Cys, Trp, Tyr and Phe, were overrepresented in thiol
                    oxidoreductases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g002">Figure 2</xref>).
                    At the same time, Met, His, Gly, and Glu were found to be less frequent in these
                    proteins.</p>
                <p>Based on this information, we empirically defined the following formula that
                    allowed separation of thiol oxidoreductases and other Cys-containing proteins:
                    (W+Y+F+1.5C+0.5P)/(G+H+Q+2M),
                    where letters correspond to abundances of amino acids (in single letter code)
                    and the numbers are coefficients. In developing this formula, we sampled
                    different coefficients and applied the formulae to true positive and control (S1
                    and S2) datasets. The coefficients most efficiently separating thiol
                    oxidoreductases from other proteins were kept.</p>
                <p>The ratio in the formula reflected common features of thiol oxidoreductases,
                    distinguishing them from enzymes containing non-redox catalytic Cys. For
                    example, active sites of thiol oxidoreductases preferred non-polar aromatic
                    residues. While all aromatic amino acids were overrepresented (compared to their
                    average values in control sets, see Random Cys in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g002">Figure 2</xref>), histidine was less frequent (but
                    it had high frequency in non-redox proteins with catalytic Cys). Consequently,
                    all aromatic residues appeared in the numerator of the formula, but histidine
                    was placed in the denominator. Other features of catalytic Cys were also
                    included in the formula such as the well known preference for a second Cys
                    (often a resolving Cys) in the proximity of the catalytic Cys, while the enzymes
                    containing non-redox catalytic Cys showed a significant underrepresentation of
                    additional Cys in the active sites. Proline is also often observed in thiol
                    oxidoreductases, but is less frequently found in other enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>Although the chemical basis for differences in the use of amino acid in the
                    vicinity of Cys is not fully clear, the application of this formula was found to
                    be quite effective. Generally, values higher than 1.0 corresponded to thiol
                    oxidoreductases. For example, 79% thiol oxidoreductases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s007">Table S1</xref>)
                    had scores higher than 1.0, whereas in the control dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s008">Table S2</xref>),
                    88% proteins had a score lower than 1.0.</p>
                <p>When representatives of the Random Cys sets were screened with the formula, the
                    ratio of false positive prediction (i.e., non thiol oxidoreductases scoring
                    higher than 1.0) somewhat increased, e.g., among 100 analyzed proteins from the
                    Random Cys set 1, 22% scored above 1.0. Interestingly, many of these
                    scoring proteins contained metal-binding Cys. This was mainly because Cys
                    residues clustered in these proteins (e.g., in zinc finger or iron-sulfur
                    cluster-containing proteins). Thus, the contribution to the SF from this last
                    component of the Compositional analysis was lower than that of the dictionaries,
                    adding a value of up to 0.25 to the SF. Finally, when the three components of
                    the Compositional analysis (analysis of dictionaries for 6 Å and 8
                    Å and the application of the formula) were considered, the
                    contribution to the SF ranged from 0 to 1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

                    alignments (i.e., relative weights for similarities, gaps and identities) were
                    empirically optimized to achieve the best separation of thiol oxidoreductases
                    and reference datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s002">S2</xref>). The
                    optimized parameters for equation 1 are described in detail in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> section.</p>
                <p>The ability of this procedure to separate thiol oxidoreductases from other
                    proteins is remarkable; using an appropriate cut off for the output of equation
                    1 (for example, 0.4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s001">Figure S1</xref>) as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> section, no false positives were
                    detected. This feature (i.e., very low false positive rate) opened up an
                    opportunity, based on the structural profile analysis, to assign a wider range
                    of values as contributing to the SF. In particular, values higher than 1.0 could
                    be given to the SF when the output of equation 1 is sufficiently high. However,
                    values higher than 1.0 were appended to the SF only under the conditions where
                    the probability of false positive predictions was either null or very low. The
                    contribution of this procedure to the SF ranged from 0 to 2.5 with the latter
                    occurring only when the profile of a putative protein under examination was
                    almost identical to that of a known thiol oxidoreductase. Further details on
                    this part of the procedure are given in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> section.</p>

                    A marked preference for alpha helical and loop geometries around the Cys was
                    found in thiol oxidoreductases. In turn, beta strands were infrequent (with
                    notable exception of MsrBs).</p>
                <p>We implemented these observations with a simple function requiring helical
                    composition exceeding 35% and loops exceeding the composition of
                    strands. As alluded above, some thiol oxidoreductases (MsrBs, fRMsrs and
                    arsenate reductases) were missed at this step of the analysis. Since this
                    procedure could potentially miss other candidate thiol oxidoreductases, its
                    contribution to the SF ranged from 0 to 0.5.</p>
                <p>When the three steps of the procedure (i.e., amino acid composition, structural
                    profile and secondary structure composition of the active sites) were applied
                    together to thiol oxidoreductase and control datasets, a nearly complete
                    separation of thiol oxidoreductases and other proteins was achieved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s004">Figure S4</xref>).
                    Each thiol oxidoreductase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s007">Table S1</xref>) received scores higher

                    tyrosine phosphatase (PDB code 1D1P) scored as high as some of the low scoring
                    thiol oxidoreductases. However, this phosphatase showed marked analogy to thiol
                    oxidoreductases (e.g., some proteins annotated as low molecular weight tyrosine
                    phosphatases are in fact arsenate reductases). We discuss this feature in

                <title>Cys Reactivity</title>
                <p>We hypothesized that properties of redox-active catalytic Cys could also be
                    suitable for distinguishing thiol oxidoreductases from proteins with other Cys
                    types. In addition, proteins with catalytic Cys could potentially be
                    distinguished from those with non-catalytic Cys by virtue of thiol
                    oxidoreductases being enzymes. Thus, we examined available active site
                    prediction programs with respect to recognition of Cys active sites in thiol
                    oxidoreductases. These programs included Q-site finder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.modelling.leeds.ac.uk/qsitefinder/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.modelling.leeds.ac.uk/qsitefinder/</ext-link>), Pocket finder

                    programs are freely accessible via web service, but some calculations could be
                    slow (e.g., THEMATICS).</p>
                <p>For each program, we examined randomly chosen 15 thioredoxin fold and 15
                    non-thioredoxin fold thiol oxidoreductases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Two programs, FOD and SARIG, were
                    ineffective in predicting catalytic sites of thiol oxidoreductases. Pocket
                    Finder performed slightly better but still clearly missed many active sites with
                    catalytic redox-active Cys. The best methods for thiol oxidoreductase prediction
                    proved to be Q-site finder and THEMATICS. The use of THEMATICS is limited by its
                    speed. Thus, Q-site finder was further employed. Scoring of this method is
                    detailed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> section. Briefly,
                    if a catalytic Cys ranked within the first 3 sites, a positive value (1.0) was
                    given to the SF, and a zero value was given if the sulfur atom of Cys was not
                    predicted in any of the 10 ranked sites. Intermediate situations resulted in the
                    contributions to the SF, declined in the range between 0 and 1, as detailed in

                <p>The final step of our algorithm examined Cys titration curves. As discussed in
                    the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>, pKa and exposure have
                    recently been proposed as parameters that distinguish redox-regulated Cys from
                    other Cys types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Sanchez1">[11]</xref>. However, when applied to our dataset, they
                    proved to be ineffective in detecting differences between redox and non-redox
                    catalytic Cys residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This is indeed not surprising, as
                    sulfur exposure and a reasonably low Cys pKa should be necessary features for
                    both thiol oxidoreductases and enzymes with other nucleophilic catalytic Cys.</p>
                <p>Thus, we examined other properties and methods that could account for
                    accessibility and reactivity of catalytic redox Cys. While Q-site finder may
                    possibly account for effective accessibility of Cys to small molecular probes
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Laurie1">[14]</xref>, it provides no information on Cys chemistry. An
                    alternative was to directly employ theoretical titration curves of active site
                    Cys residues. Indeed, the main idea of THEMATICS is based on the observation
                    that theoretical titration curves and their deviation from standard
                    Henderson-Hasselbach (HH) behavior can inform on the location of active site
                    residues (if they are titrable). Analysis of the theoretical titration curve of
                    a titrable residue is often more informative than simple calculations of its pKa
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Bashford1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Ondrechen2">[18]</xref>.</p>
                <p>In this work, we employed the web accessible H++ server <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Gordon1">[19]</xref> to
                    calculate Cys titration curves and developed in-house tools for analyzing the
                    output (details are in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>
                    section). Briefly, we examined theoretical titration curves of each candidate
                    Cys and compared them with the standard HH behavior. The two curves were
                    superimposed and numerically compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Greater deviation between the two
                    curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) implied a
                    higher probability of the Cys being part of the active site and was given a
                    positive contribution (up to 1.0) to the SF, whereas small deviation or no
                    deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) was
                    given a zero contribution. We combined the methods discussed above in a single

                    Several Test Case proteins were homology models. We deliberately included them

                            separation of the dataset. Starting from the optimized weights described

                            0–4 (X-axis values). The graph should be read as follows: each
                            parameter is represented by a curve, and each point represents the
                            TPR-FPR value (the higher the better) for a specific weight. Maxima
                            represent the best scoring values (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Decreased values to the
                            right of the maximum reflect a tendency of the parameter to give False
                            Positive predictions when over-weighted, while when on the left, it
                            corresponds to a tendency to underestimate the number of True Positives
                            when the parameter is under-weighted. This analysis provides insights
                            into variability introduced in the performance when the parameter
                            weights are changed, in particular showing that the optimized parameters

                            contribution (1÷1.25). For all other parameters, clear maxima
                            (corresponding to the optimized values described in the text) were

                <p>To validate the algorithm on a genome-wide level, without any bias in the

                    proteins by including (i) all known thiol oxidoreductases found by literature
                    search and detected by PSI-BLAST searches using known thiol oxidoreductases as
                    queries; and (ii) all other proteins in the yeast proteome containing at least
                    one highly conserved Cys (conserved in ≥90% homologs). From
                    this set, proteins containing metal-binding Cys residues were filtered out using
                    Prosite patterns. The resulting set of 292 proteins was subjected to homology
                    modeling via Swiss Model (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swissmodel.expasy.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://swissmodel.expasy.org/</ext-link>) or HOMER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://protein.cribi.unipd.it/Homer/" xlink:type="simple">http://protein.cribi.unipd.it/Homer/</ext-link>), which generated 149

                <p>Among these proteins, 42 were predicted by our algorithm as thiol oxidoreductases

                    these proteins are not known, the first three are worth a comment. GAPDH
                    proteins are known to have a catalytic nucleophilic Cys in the active site which
                    is highly sensitive to redox regulation by both thiols and reactive oxygen
                    species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Fermani1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Hook1">[22]</xref>. Oxidized GAPDHs were
                    also found to recover full activity in the presence of thioredoxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Spector1">[23]</xref> or
                    DTT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Xing1">[24]</xref>. It appears that these proteins share properties
                    with thiol oxidoreductases, and their active site Cys showed common features
                    with catalytic redox Cys in other enzymes.</p>
                <p>Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatases (lwPTP) share the
                    phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase I-like fold with arsenate reductase (ArsC)
                    of gram-positive bacteria and archaea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Messens1">[25]</xref>, which are thiol
                    oxidoreductases. These enzymes (lwPTP and ArsC) belong to the same superfamily
                    (phosphotyrosine protein phosphatases I). In our original dataset, there were
                    two ArsC proteins (PDB coded 1LJL and 1Y1L), and recognition of their
                    nucleophilic catalytic Cys as redox-active residues may reflect such similarity.
                    With regard to other predictions, no strong evidence to support or reject them
                    as thiol oxidoreductases was obtained, so at least some of these proteins could
                    indeed be thiol oxidoreductases.</p>
                <p>Finally, one known thiol oxidoreductase among the 149 modeled yeast proteins was
                    not correctly detected by our method. This protein was a monothiol glutaredoxin
                    (&gt;gi|6319488, GRX7), which corresponds to the single green circle in
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g008">Figure 8</xref> located
                    slightly below the cut off value. However, the only contribution to the score
                    for this protein came from the Active Site Similarity method, whereas the Cys
                    Reactivity contribution was zero: Q-site finder did not predict its catalytic
                    Cys in any one of the 10 ranked sites, and the Cys titration curve strictly
                    followed HH behavior. We also submitted the protein to the THEMATICS server, but
                    its catalytic Cys was not predicted as an active site residue. The fact that
                    these independent structure-based calculations, which proved to be quite
                    effective in other analyses, did not recognize the active site and its catalytic
                    Cys could potentially be explained by poor quality of the homology model.</p>
                <p>It can be argued, that the Similarity part of our algorithm should work better
                    than the Cys reactivity part with scarcely refined (but still reasonable)
                    structural models, due to its lesser dependence (especially for secondary
                    structure and compositional analysis) on the accuracy of predicted atomic
                    positions; these, in turn, determine titration curves and all types of
                    docking-like calculations (e.g., Q-site finder predictions). Therefore, poorly
                    refined structural models should affect predictions of the energy-based
                    calculations of the Cys reactivity part of the method to a greater extent.
                    Finally, it should be noted that all other glutaredoxins and glutaredoxin-like
                    proteins could be confidently predicted, which is consistent with the idea that
                    the low score for Cys reactivity in GRX7 may be related to the quality of the
                    structural model rather than inability of the procedure to detect this specific
                    protein. Overall, the method presented in this study showed very good
                    selectivity and specificity. It should find applications in examining protein
                    structures and identifying new thiol oxidoreductases and catalytic redox-active
                    Cys residues in these proteins.</p>
                <p>During the review of our study, another paper was published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Tong1">[26]</xref> that analyzed
                    performance of active site prediction and employed multiple and independent
                    parameters. The authors observed improved performance when the analyses included
                    theoretical titration curves, residue exposure and sequence alignment-based
                    conservation scores. This study and our work suggest that implementing different
                    chemical (e.g., titration curves), physical (e.g., solvent accessibility), and
                    biological (e.g., sequence alignment) parameters offers a promising approach to
                    develop efficient tools for protein structure-function predictions. Such
                    approaches may allow the user to achieve specific biologically meaningful
                    insights, a feature often missing in predictive bioinformatics tools. Finally,
                    we suggest that the use of similar approaches may address the challenging issue
                    of prediction of Cys-based modification sites in proteins.</p>

                <p>To analyze the relative weight distribution for each parameter of the algorithm
                    and how the algorithm performance depends on them, we carried out calculations
                    of a set of proteins (Test Case, described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> section) not belonging to the dataset. This analysis
                    supported the arrangements of parameter weights shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g001">Figure 1A</xref> (values in brackets). Details of
                    these calculations are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s006">Figure S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g006">Figure 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g007">Figure 7</xref>. The analysis of the Test Case also
                    allowed us to identify a cut-off value for the scoring function (described later
                    on in this section) to efficiently discriminate thiol oxidoreductases form other
                    proteins. The final scoring function, SF, was made up of contributions from each
                    part of the method, as detailed further in this section. The overall method was
                    divided into 2 parts: the first, Active Site Similarity, analyzed structural
                    similarity of test proteins to known thiol oxidoreductases. The second, Cys
                    Reactivity, employed external software for energy-based calculations of Cys
                    properties. Both parts were further subdivided into subparts, as shown in the
                    scheme of the algorithm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g001">Figure
                    1</xref>, and each is further discussed separately here in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> section.</p>

                <title>Active Site Similarity: Compositional Analysis</title>
                <p>Analysis of amino acid composition around Cys was carried out with in-house tools
                    written in Python (v2.4). Detection of amino acids within a cutoff distance (6
                    Å or 8 Å) from the catalytic Cys sulfur was made considering
                    all residues with one or more of their atoms at a distance equal or lower than
                    the cutoff. A simple graphical representation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. We employed this procedure for all
                    proteins in the dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s007">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s008">Table S2</xref>),
                    divided into 4 categories: (i) thioredoxin fold thiol oxidoreductases (Trx OxR);
                    (ii) non-thioredoxin fold thiol oxidoreductases (Non Trx OxR); (iii) FAD-binding
                    thiol oxidoreductases (FAD OxR); and (iv) proteins with catalytic non-redox Cys
                    (Non OxR). For each protein category, we computed an average amino acid
                    composition. This is shown in graphical form in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Frequency of amino acid occurrence
                    was associated with each amino acid (the Y value in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Consequently, four separate sets
                    of amino acid compositions were built for Trx OxR (blue bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g002">Figure 2</xref>), Non Trx OxR (pink
                    bars), FAD OxR (red bars), and Non OxR (green bars). We stored information for
                    each protein category in the form of specific dictionaries (after the Python 2.4
                    datatype actually employed), wherein each amino acid received a value of its
                    frequency.</p>
                <p>In addition, two other sets of non-overlapping randomly selected proteins, one
                    made of 800 PDB structures and the other of 1000 structures, were built. These
                    sets were designated Random Cys set 1 and Random Cys set 2 and represented an
                    average composition of amino acids in the vicinity of Cys in protein structures.
                    Combined together these two sets made up the Random Cys set (bright yellow bars
                    in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We required
                    that these sets have no overlap with datasets S1 and S2. Also for these two
                    sets, two specific dictionaries were built to store the set-specific amino
                    acidic composition. The use of the six dictionaries to carry out compositional
                    analysis is illustrated with the following example. Given the following short
                    structural profile, i.e., the amino acid sequence in the active site,
                    Cys-Ala-Val-Glu, and the following dictionaries,</p>

                    are received, each obtained by appending the average set-specific frequency
                    value corresponding to an amino acid of the profile:</p>
                <list list-type="simple">

                </list>
                <p>In this example, the highest score is obtained with the
                    “Set3” dictionary. If “Set3”
                    corresponds, for instance, to the Trx OxR dictionary, the putative sequence
                    resembles the composition of thiol oxidoreductases. In this case, a value of
                    +0.375 is added to the final scoring function, SF. The same happens if
                    the best scoring dictionary is that of Non Trx OxR. If instead the best scoring
                    dictionary is one of non-thiol oxidoreductases, then a zero contribution is
                    given to the SF. These dictionary-based calculations were done with 6
                    Å and 8 Å distance profiles, thus contributing a maximum
                    value of 0.75 to the SF (0.375 for the 6 Å profile and 0.375 with the
                    8 Å profile).</p>
                <p>Another evaluation formula, limited in this case to the 6 Å distance
                    (because this distance shows the most significant difference among proteins in
                    the dataset, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g002">Figure 2</xref>)
                    was based on the following ratio
                    (W+Y+F+1.5C+0.5P)/(G+H+Q+2M),
                    where letters correspond to the single letter code for amino acids and numbers
                    are coefficients. This empirical ratio was chosen as discussed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> session. We sampled different
                    coefficients (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) for the amino acid composition in this formula: in
                    each case the same datasets (S1 and S2) were used. The coefficients most
                    efficiently separating thiol oxidoreductases from other proteins were kept. When
                    the formula was applied to a profile for a putative active site, the result (x)
                    was analyzed as follows. If x≥1.5, a value of 0.25 was given to the SF.
                    If it was between 1.5 and 1.1, a value of 0.125 was given. Otherwise a zero
                    value was given.</p>

                <p>For this step in the procedure, we followed a previously published procedure of
                    functional site profiling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Cammer1">[13]</xref>. Accordingly, we employed ClustalW (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html</ext-link>) standalone

                    S1</xref>).

                    identities in the alignment), Ss strongly conserved residues (m is the total
                    number of Ss in the alignment), Sw weakly conserved residues (K is the total
                    number of Sw ), Sg gaps (j is the total number of Sg) and N is the number of
                    paired residues in the alignment.</p>
                <p>Modified parameters were used for Equation 1 (in parenthesis are the original
                    values, also derived empirically): SI = 1.0
                    (1.0), Ss = 0.3 (0.2),
                    Sw = 0.1 (0.1),
                    Sg = 0 (−0.5). Starting from the
                    original parameters, we sampled different values to determine if it was possible
                    to improve the performance of Equation 1 against our datasets (S1, S2 and
                    representatives of the Random Cys sets). An example of the performance with
                    modified parameters is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s002">Figure S2</xref>. We found that an improvement can
                    be reached by underweighting the gaps, and we obtained the best results when the
                    gaps were treated like “non similar” paired residues. Our
                    parameters were more permissive than the original parameters, which were
                    developed and optimized to address a different biological question. It must be
                    stated that the original parameters performed better if the purpose was to
                    detect similarities between more related protein sets (for example, functional
                    families). For the analysis of distantly related proteins, a relaxation of
                    parameters was necessary, and we obtained the best results with our more
                    permissive <italic>ad hoc</italic> optimized parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000383.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
                <p>The flow of our structural profile analysis was as follows: given a putative
                    active site, pairwise alignments were made with ClustalW between the putative
                    profile and each of the profiles extracted from the known thiol oxidoreductases
                    in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).
                    Each pairwise alignment was evaluated with Equation 1. The highest scoring
                    alignment was selected and its score value (x) was kept for further analysis. If
                    the best result (x) of Equation 1 was lower than 0.35, a null value was given to
                    the SF. If 0.35≤x&lt;0.4, a value of 0.5 was given. If
                    0.4≤x≤0.5, a value of 1 was given. If 0.5&lt;x≤0.6, a
                    value of 1.5 was given. If 0.6&lt;x≤0.75, a value of 2 was given.
                    Finally, if x&gt;0.75, a value of 2.5 was given to the SF. In the latter
                    case, a x value higher than 0.75 actually meant that this profile was almost
                    identical to that of a known thiol oxidoreductase.</p>

                <p>We analyzed the secondary structure content of active sites of each thiol
                    oxidoreductase in our dataset and then compared them with proteins in the
                    control sets. A three-state secondary structure classification (helix, strand,
                    or coil) was assigned to each amino acid within 6 Å from the Cys
                    sulfur atom. The evaluation was made as following: (i) if the helical content
                    was higher or equal to 35% and the coil content was higher than the
                    strand content, a value of +0.5 was given to the SF. (ii) If helical
                    content was equal to or higher than 10% and both the coil content and
                    the helix content were higher than the strand content, a value of +0.25
                    was given to the SF. In all other cases, this part of the method received a zero

                    set to 20 while the solution dielectric constant was set to 75. Salinity (sodium

                    sulfur atom. Equation 3 is valid for acidic residues, which acquire negative
                    charge upon titration (e.g., Cys). Substituting H++
                    pKa-calculated value in Equation 3 and varying the pH between 0 and 18, the HH
                    behaving curve for an acidic residue was then obtained. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows two examples of
                    superimposition of theoretical titration curves obtained by the
                    H++ server (red curves) and the corresponding HH behavior
                    curves (blue curves). The HH behavior curves were viewed as standard behavior of
                    the residue if no perturbations due to other nearby titrable residues occurred
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Bashford1">[15]</xref>. Thus, deviation of the red curve from the blue
                    curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g005">Figure 5</xref> (in the
                    titrable range around the pKa) pinpointed the active site residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Sampogna1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Ondrechen1">[17]</xref>. Automatic
                    evaluation of the deviation between the two curve behaviors could be a challenge
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000383-Ko1">[27]</xref>.
                    In the present work, we were only interested in a simple way to perform a quick
                    quantification of the deviation between the two curves. Thus, point by point
                    subtraction (for each pH value) between the two curves was carried on. These
                    values were integrated over the entire pH range, resulting in the overall
                    difference absolute value (Σ Δ) for the deviation between the
                    two curves.</p>
                <p>Σ Δ was next evaluated to give a contribution to the SF. Cutoff
                    values employed were as follows: if |Σ Δ|≥2.0, then a
                    value of 1.0 is given. If 2.0&gt;|Σ Δ|≥1.5, a value
                    of 0.75 is given. If 1.5&gt;|Σ Δ|≥1.0, a value of 0.5
                    is given. If 1.0&gt;|Σ Δ|≥0.5, value of 0.25 is
                    given. Values below 0.5 correspond to a small or null deviation from the typical
                    HH titration behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g005">Figure
                    5B</xref>), and consequently a zero value is given to SF. The overall
                    contribution of the Cys Reactivity method to the SF ranged from 0 to 2.0.</p>
                <p>Finally, in the complete algorithm, the resulting value of the SF ranged from 0
                    to 6.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We found
                    that a value of 2.75 was a minimum cutoff value that positively discriminated
                    catalytic redox-active Cys residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000383-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

                        (shown by blue circles) from other proteins in the dataset was achieved
                        (green squares correspond to non-thiol oxidoreductases of Dataset S2, and
                        yellow squares show a set of randomly chosen proteins). Only one protein of
                        the non-redox catalytic Cys dataset (S2) showed a score comparable to that
                        of thiol oxidoreductases: this protein is a low molecular weight
                        phosphotyrosine phosphatase with PDB code 1D1P. Enzymes of this family are
                        known to contain a nucleophilic catalytic Cys which is subject to redox
                        regulation. The score obtained for 1D1P is due to a good structural profile
                        pairwise alignment (profile score 0.55, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> section and the main text) with the wild type S. aureus

                        our analysis, after which we changed each parameter to optimize for
                        separation of thiol oxidoreductases and other proteins. (B) The following
                        parameter weights were used: secondary structure
                        (IIstr) = 1, compositional analysis

                        (H++) = 1. Increasing
                        considerably the weight of the profile scoring proved to be important for
                        the improved performance. (C) Further improvement of the performance is
                        shown obtained by decreasing the secondary structure weight to 0.75 and
                        increasing the profile scoring weight to 2.25. Variation of other parameter
                        weights in the range 0.5–2.0 did not improve performance. (D) We
