<abstract>
<p>The number of mRNA and protein molecules expressed from a single gene molecule fluctuates over time. These fluctuations have been attributed, in part, to the random transitioning of promoters between transcriptionally active and inactive states, causing transcription to occur in bursts. However, the molecular basis of transcriptional bursting remains poorly understood. By electron microscopy of single <italic>PHO5</italic> gene molecules from yeast, we show that the “activated” promoter assumes alternative nucleosome configurations at steady state, including the maximally repressive, fully nucleosomal, and the maximally non-repressive, nucleosome-free, configuration. We demonstrate that the observed probabilities of promoter nucleosome configurations are obtained from a simple, intrinsically stochastic process of nucleosome assembly, disassembly, and position-specific sliding; and we show that gene expression and promoter nucleosome configuration can be mechanistically coupled, relating promoter nucleosome dynamics and gene expression fluctuations. Together, our findings suggest a structural basis for transcriptional bursting, and offer new insights into the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and the kinetics of promoter nucleosome transitions.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In eukaryotes, such as plants, fungi, and animals, the DNA is wrapped around basic protein cores called nucleosomes at more or less regular intervals. This wrapping discourages transcription, the first step in gene expression. By isolating <italic>PHO5</italic> gene molecules from yeast cells and analyzing their structure by electron microscopy, we provide evidence that the “nucleosomes” completely unwrap and then re-wrap in an intrinsically stochastic manner. Only nucleosomes that wrap the regulatory sequences of the gene (promoter) were observed to unspool; no such unspooling was found across the body of the gene. Random unwrapping and re-wrapping generates an ensemble of alternative promoter nucleosome configurations, some conducive to transcription, others not. Mounting evidence suggests that transcription occurs in bursts, where transcripts are released in close succession, interrupted by intervals of transcriptional inactivity; this may lead to significant stochastic fluctuations in gene expression. Although the mechanism of this behavior is not understood, our findings now provide a structural basis for it, suggesting that spooling and unspooling of promoter DNA from the nucleosomes determines the fundamental frequency of transcriptional bursting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
    <p>The number of gene product molecules fluctuates over time and between cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Elowitz1">[1]</xref>. The magnitude of such fluctuations (“expression noise”) is generally expressed in terms of variance over the mean of gene expression (“Fano factor”), or variance over mean squared (“coefficient of variation” [<italic>CV<sup>2</sup></italic>]). Gene expression may be viewed as a sequence of molecular transitions; two noise components are then distinguishable: “intrinsic noise,” which derives from the random choice between alternative transitions and the statistical distribution of dwell times between transitions, and “extrinsic noise,” which arises from fluctuations in the cellular concentrations of the biochemical factors that promote the transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Swain1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Stochastic models have been proposed to account for the intrinsic noise of gene expression. An essential component of such models is the assumption that genes randomly transition between states that are either transcriptionally active (“ON state”), or inactive (“OFF state”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Munsky1">[3]</xref>. In the ON state a “burst” of transcripts is released, whose magnitude both depends on the rate of transcription and the average life-time of the ON state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The notion of transcriptional bursting contrasts with the conventional (“deterministic”) model of a transcriptionally active gene, which assumes continual competence for transcription, and where regulation of mRNA synthesis is limited to changes in the rate of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In the stochastic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), transcriptional activators may stimulate transcription by either modulating the frequency of transcriptional bursting, burst size, or both. Which of these possible mechanisms is employed may be tested by measurements of intrinsic noise as a function of the average gene product abundance, for model calculations indicate that the intrinsic noise changes in characteristic ways depending on the identity of the steps that are tuned to alter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Raser1">[4]</xref>. However, the molecular basis for transcriptional bursting is not understood, and alternative mechanisms, such as random partitioning of mRNAs at cell division, have been proposed to account for the observed variability in gene product abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Huh1">[5]</xref>.</p>

<p>(A) The “two-state model” of stochastic gene expression. The model simplifies promoter state dynamics into the stochastic transitioning between two states, ON (transcriptionally active), and OFF (inactive). Transitions→<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indicate degradation of the gene product. Greek letters refer to transition probabilities per unit time and molecule (“kinetic parameters”); below, a typical time trace (black curve) for the fluctuation in single cell mRNA molecule number about the steady state mean (dashed gray line). (B) “Deterministic model” of a transcriptionally active gene. The black curve beneath the model represents a typical time trace of mRNA fluctuation about the same mean (dashed gray line) as in (A). (C) Steady-state Fano factor values (Fano) were calculated as a function of a single kinetic parameter (the “regulatory parameter”), with all other kinetic parameters held constant. The coloring of the resulting noise profiles refers to the identity of the kinetic parameter that was allowed to float to vary the mean abundance of protein molecules (mean abundance). Thus, blue refers to the bursting frequency α, see (A), etc. The dashed green line indicates the expected Fano profile for the modulation of ε for the deterministic model B. Noise profiles were determined by analytical calculations as described in Materials and Methods.</p>

<p>The wrapping of DNA into nucleosomes limits access of activators and general transcription factors to promoter DNA and impedes the transcribing RNA polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Hodges1">[9]</xref>. Consistently, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies support the notion that nucleosomes are general repressors of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Han1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Kaplan1">[11]</xref>. The inducible <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter of yeast has served as a classical paradigm for studies of the relationship between promoter chromatin structure and transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Almer1">[12]</xref>. Structural studies of the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter pointed at the possibility of alternative nucleosome configurations for the induced <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter, however, without directly demonstrating their existence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao2">[15]</xref>. These and other observations have given rise to the notion that fluctuations in promoter chromatin structure might underlie transcriptional bursting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Raser1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Dadiani1">[16]</xref>. Critical testing of this theory calls for the analysis of promoter chromatin structure at the level of single gene molecules, rather than molecule ensemble averages after endonucleolytic cleavage, the conventional experimental approach.</p>
<p>Here, we report the analysis of the promoter nucleosome configuration of single <italic>PHO5</italic> gene molecules by electron microscopy (EM). Our data demonstrate the existence of alternative promoter nucleosome configurations at steady state <italic>PHO5</italic> expression, including the maximally repressive, fully nucleosomal, and maximally non-repressive, nucleosome-free configuration. We show that the observed configurational probability distribution of <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter nucleosomes is obtained by a simple stochastic process of nucleosome assembly, disassembly, and position-specific sliding. Our analysis thus provides a molecular basis for transcriptional bursting; and we confirm that <italic>PHO5</italic> expression indeed bears the signature of such bursting, with bursting frequency, rather than burst size, as the parameter that responds to transcriptional activators. We demonstrate the possibility of an integrated model of promoter chromatin dynamics and gene expression that quantitatively accounts for measurements of gene expression noise and EM data. The model allows us to predict the life times of microscopically observable promoter nucleosome configurations under repressing and activating conditions, and identifies specific promoter nucleosome transitions as essential for activated transcription.</p>

<title>Single Molecule Analysis of <italic>PHO5</italic> Chromatin Structure</title>
<p>To analyze the nucleosome configuration of single <italic>PHO5</italic> gene molecules, we isolated chromatin rings encompassing the promoter nucleosome positions N-3 to N-1 and the open reading frame of the yeast <italic>PHO5</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Chromatin rings were formed <italic>in vivo</italic> by induction of site-specific recombination between recombination sequences (RS) flanking the <italic>PHO5</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger2">[14]</xref>. A cluster of lexA operator sequences allowed for ring purification by expression of an adaptor protein that contained LexA fused to a tandem affinity tag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Griesenbeck1">[17]</xref>. The promoter DNA of purified chromatin rings and isolated nuclei exhibit closely similar sensitivities to restriction endonucleases, suggesting essentially identical chromatin structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Griesenbeck2">[18]</xref>; and <italic>PHO5</italic> is fully inducible after ring formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001621.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

<p>Purified chromatin rings were incubated with trimethylpsoralen and exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, resulting in inter-strand crosslinking of the DNA double helix in nucleosomal linkers, but not core particle DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Cech1">[20]</xref>, thus “etching” nucleosome configurations into the DNA. Purified ring DNA was denatured, spread onto ethidium-coated carbon grids, stained with uranyl acetate, and rotary metal shadowed prior to EM. Positions previously occupied by nucleosome core particles thus appear as single-stranded DNA bubbles, connected by double stranded linker DNA that resisted denaturation due to crosslinking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Cech1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Single-stranded DNA bubbles were densely spaced on <italic>PHO5</italic> rings isolated from repressed cells, separated by only short segments of crosslinked double stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Larger than expected bubbles suggested fusion of nucleosome bubbles due to failure of crosslinking of the intervening linker DNA, which is rather short in the open reading frame of the gene (Materials and Methods). In contrast, the majority of <italic>PHO5</italic> rings isolated from activated cells exhibited larger contiguous segments of crosslinked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). To determine whether these continuously crosslinked regions coincided with promoter sequences, we linearized rings by NcoI restriction enzyme digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g003">3</xref>). Larger nucleosome-free segments were found only at or close to one end of linearized rings, and not in their interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g003">Figure 3</xref>). At the opposite end, which bears the lexA operator cluster, molecules were forked, suggesting that the binding of LexA adaptor proteins at the cluster prevented its crosslinking. Consistently, forked ends were not observed in control experiments with naked DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001621.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The fork thus oriented molecules, and enabled us to identify the promoter nucleosome bubbles on all <italic>PHO5</italic> gene molecules.</p>

<p>Eight promoter nucleosome configurations were observed, representing all combinations of occupied and unoccupied positions N-1 to N-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To assign nucleosome bubble identities and thus determine the relative frequency of each promoter nucleosome configuration, we determined for each linearized ring the positions of upstream activation sequences 1 (UASp1) and 2 (UASp2; position N-2), and the transcription start site (position N-1) by measuring their expected distance from the proximal DNA end. Both upstream activation sequences bear a binding site for the transcriptional activator Pho4, which is essential for <italic>PHO5</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Vogel1">[21]</xref>. The relative frequencies of promoter nucleosome configurations for <italic>PHO5</italic> rings isolated from <italic>PHO4</italic> wild type cells is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4A</xref>.

For instance, micrococcal nuclease and restriction endonuclease analysis of position N-1 indicated an occupancy of position N-1 between 0.5 and 0.6 for the “active” promoter, closely similar to the occupancy of 0.52 inferred by EM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001621.s002">Figure S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001621.s005">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Model of Promoter Nucleosome Dynamics</title>
<p>How can the observed configurational probability distributions of the promoter nucleosomes be explained? In the following we shall demonstrate that the observed probability distributions can be explained as the result of an intrinsically stochastic process, i.e., a process where the future configuration and the configuration's life-time can be predicted only probabilistically. Specifically, we assume that the probability of finding the promoter in state <italic>j</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>+<italic>h</italic>, given that the promoter was in configuration <italic>k</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>, equals <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><italic>h</italic> for sufficiently small time intervals <italic>h</italic>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the transition probability per time and molecule, depends only on <italic>j</italic> and <italic>k</italic> (assumption of a time homogeneous Markov process). The steady state probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub>,…, <italic>p</italic><sub>7</sub> of nucleosome configurations 0,…, 7 of such a process obey the following matrix equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao2">[15]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001621.e013"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(<italic>i</italic>)</label></disp-formula>with diagonal elements <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We refer to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s as the “kinetic parameters” of the process. Experimentally, steady state was achieved by isolating chromatin rings from <italic>pho80</italic>Δ cells (see above). The task at hand is to find <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s that are consistent with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio.1001621.e013">equation (<italic>i</italic>)</xref>, or more precisely, a matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with diagonal elements as above whose kernel is spanned by the observed steady state distribution (<italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub>,…, <italic>p</italic><sub>7</sub>), or a vector very similar to it.</p>
<p>Transitions between nucleosome configurations may be due to assembly, disassembly, or sliding of a nucleosome. Accordingly, we may distinguish three different kinds of transitions. We call the stochastic process “simple” if transitions of the same kind have the same kinetic parameter value, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for assembly, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for disassembly, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for sliding transitions; the term “transition topology” refers to the set of all possible transitions.</p>
<p>The assumption of a simple process reduces the task of finding the desired matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to drawing the “correct” transition topology. A transition topology that is limited to transitions between configurations that differ by one nucleosome, and that has therefore only two kinds of transitions—nucleosome assembly and disassembly—may serve as a starting point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>This topology, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on some appropriate time scale and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> determined by maximum likelihood analysis (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), accounted well for the observed probabilities of nucleosome number, but not the probabilities of individual configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The discrepancy between prediction and experimental observation could thus be attributed to a redistribution of probability mass between nucleosome configurations with equal nucleosome number, and hence to the sliding of nucleosomes between promoter positions. With <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> similar, but lower than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> similar, but higher than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), the observed distribution suggested sliding of nucleosomes out of position N-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4D</xref>; “unidirectional sliding topology”). Indeed, observed probabilities and probabilities calculated on the basis of the transition topology of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4D</xref> were closely similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> determined by maximum likelihood analysis. Remarkably, the assumption that disassembly of nucleosomes in position N-1 requires a nucleosome-free position N-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), suggested by nucleosome accessibility analysis over the time course of <italic>PHO5</italic> induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Jessen1">[22]</xref>, led to a virtually perfect agreement between measurements and predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, other conceivable topologies, for instance for “stable nucleosome retention” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4G</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger1">[13]</xref>, “all-or-none removal” of promoter nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4H</xref>), and “cyclical deterministic” processes, such as the topology of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4I</xref>, were refuted by our data.</p>
<p>To further test our topological hypotheses, we analyzed the configurational probability distributions in the <italic>PHO5 tata</italic> box mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">Figure 5A–5C</xref>) and strains that bore mutations in <italic>PHO4</italic> or <italic>PHO2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">Figure 5B–5D</xref>). (The latter two genes encode the transcriptional activators of <italic>PHO5</italic>.) All observed distributions were well explained by the unidirectional sliding topologies of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4D and 4F</xref>; our data generally supported topology 4D over 4F, except for the <italic>pho4</italic>[85–99] mutant, where topology F enjoyed greater statistical support (see legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, all observed configurational probability distributions were well explained by a simple stochastic process of nucleosome removal and reformation with no more than two degrees of freedom. Our findings support the hypothesis that the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter stochastically transitions between alternative nucleosome configurations at steady state.</p>

<title>Pho4 Accelerates Nucleosome Removal</title>
<p>If burst frequency is the regulatory parameter for <italic>PHO5</italic> expression, then the observed net loss of promoter nucleosomes upon <italic>PHO5</italic> induction is due to accelerated nucleosome removal, and not inhibition of nucleosome assembly; the former changes the frequency of transcriptional bursting, the latter burst size. Comparison of <italic>PHO5</italic> molecules isolated from the TATA box wild type and <italic>tata</italic> box mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">5A</xref>), and the <italic>PHO2</italic> wild type and <italic>pho2</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">Figure 5D and 5E</xref>) allowed for additional testing of this implication. Pho2 binds to several binding sites at position N-2 following nucleosome removal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao1">[6]</xref> and might thus sterically exclude nucleosomes from position N-2. The same argument applies for the TATA box binding protein (TBP) and the TATA box. However, neither mutation resulted in an increase in nucleosome occupancy at N-2 or N-1, respectively. Our results thus argue against steric exclusion of nucleosomes by transcription factors, and suggest that nucleosome formation does not compete with transcription factor binding. Thus, both noise analysis and EM data corroborate the hypothesis that the net loss of promoter nucleosomes upon transcriptional induction is due to the acceleration of nucleosome removal, and not inhibition of nucleosome assembly, supporting the notion of activator-mediated recruitment of chromatin remodeling factors.</p>

<title>Which Nucleosome Configurations Are Conducive to Transcription?</title>
<p>Our data show that the majority of “active” <italic>PHO5</italic> molecules exhibited promoter nucleosome configurations between the two extremes of the fully nucleosomal and the nucleosome-free configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The fundamental problem of defining the relationship between promoter chromatin structure and transcription here presents itself again at the single molecule level: which promoter nucleosome configurations, if any, beside the naked configuration might be conducive to transcription? The following considerations show that our data restrict the number of possible answers to this problem (“fundamental problem”).</p>
<p>The transcriptionally active molecules constitute a subset of the transcriptionally conducive ones. It follows that the probability of the ON state, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, provides a lower bound for the combined probabilities of all nucleosome configurations that are conducive to transcription, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<p>A stochastic process based on the transition topology of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g008">Figure 8A</xref> integrates our findings: Beside the transitions between nucleosome configurations according to the topology of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, the model encompasses transitions between transcriptionally active and inactive promoter states.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The chromatin structure of eukaryotic promoters is subject to poorly understood “remodeling” upon transcriptional activation. To clarify the relationship between the structural dynamics of promoter chromatin and gene expression, we here proposed a stochastic model for the <italic>PHO5</italic> gene of yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). This model has the following essential properties: (<italic>A</italic><sub>R</sub>) Assumption of a random process: At steady state, the promoter stochastically transitions between alternative nucleosome configurations; allowed transitions include nucleosome assembly and disassembly transitions between configurations that differ by one nucleosome, and sliding transitions that move nucleosomes out of, but not into, the central N-2 position of the promoter. (<italic>A</italic><sub>S</sub>) Assumption of a simple process: Nucleosome transition probabilities per time and molecule depend only on the kind of transition—assembly, disassembly and sliding—rather than nucleosome position or configuration. (<italic>A</italic><sub>C</sub>) Conduciveness hypothesis: Removal of nucleosome N-2 is necessary for transcription. This specifies the nucleosome configurations that are conducive to transcription. (<italic>A</italic><sub>D</sub>) Assumption of nucleosomal dominance: Nucleosomes exclude transcription factors from promoter DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao1">[6]</xref>, but not vice versa. (<italic>A</italic><sub>F</sub>) Regulatory assumption: The transcriptional activator of <italic>PHO5</italic>, Pho4, stimulates promoter nucleosome disassembly and sliding and, following nucleosome removal, assembly of a scaffold complex of general transcription factors that supports transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Murakami1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>Together, <italic>A</italic><sub>R</sub>, <italic>A</italic><sub>C</sub>, and <italic>A</italic><sub>D</sub> imply that transcription occurs in the form of stochastic “bursts” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g001">Figure 1A</xref>); the fundamental bursting frequency is determined by the dynamics of promoter nucleosome fluctuations. The essential effect of “chromatin remodeling” is a shift of probability mass from promoter configurations with more to those with fewer nucleosomes. Loss of promoter nucleosomes by accelerated removal (<italic>A</italic><sub>F</sub>), rather than steric exclusion (<italic>A</italic><sub>D</sub>), means that nucleosomes are an integral part of the regulatory mechanism for transcription, and not passive repressors whose inhibitory effect is overcome by mass action. However, activated transcription is not explained by accelerated nucleosome removal alone (<italic>A</italic><sub>F</sub>).</p>
<p>This model has withstood our critical testing, while plausible alternatives could be refuted. Importantly, our findings provide direct structural support for the hypothesis of transcriptional bursting, a concept that has proved useful to account for and mechanistically interpret measurements of gene expression noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Munsky1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Raser1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Zenklusen1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-So1">[32]</xref>. Other, previous findings may also be explained on our theory, as detailed below.</p>
<p>A critical test of the random process assumption <italic>A</italic><sub>R</sub> required the establishment of methods that allowed us to investigate the nucleosome configuration of single <italic>PHO5</italic> gene molecules. Previous analyses of <italic>in vivo</italic> chromatin remodeling relied on endonucleolytic cleavage and averaging over large numbers of gene molecules; both averaging and DNA cleavage erased the information necessary to provide a test of our hypothesis: the probability distribution of promoter nucleosome configurations.</p>
<p>Remarkably, a simple stochastic process in accordance with assumptions <italic>A</italic><sub>R</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>S</sub>, and hence two degrees of freedom only, predicted each of the experimentally observed probability distributions with surprising accuracy when based on either the topology of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4D or 4F</xref>. Both topologies were overwhelmingly supported by our data against conceivable alternatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4G–4I</xref>, for instance).</p>
<p>It may be argued that the observed configurational probability distributions of promoter nucleosomes are the product of a deterministic process driven by an extrinsic oscillation, such as the cell cycle, with randomly distributed phase difference between cells, rather than an intrinsically random process, as claimed by <italic>A</italic><sub>R</sub>. The topology of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4I</xref> represents such an alternative process, where transitions between configurations are deterministic, and only the life times of configurations are assumed to be statistically distributed. Our analysis does not exclude the possibility of such an explanation; but it suggests that it would require many more degrees of freedom (kinetic parameters). The model with fewer degrees of freedom is to be preferred, however, not because it might be considered more likely, but because it has greater predictive power and is, therefore, more easily falsifiable.</p>
<p>Some data support the assumption that Pho4 binding stimulates disassembly of only the most proximal nucleosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Jessen1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Dechassa1">[33]</xref>; accelerated disassembly of nucleosomes in position N-1 would thus require prior removal of nucleosomes in position N-2, which renders UASp2 accessible to activator binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao1">[6]</xref>. This assumption may explain the statistical support for the transition topology of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4F</xref> against its rival of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4D</xref> by some (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figures 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">5B</xref>), but not all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), datasets for “activated” gene molecules. In contrast, analysis of “repressed” molecules consistently and strongly supported the topology of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4D</xref> over 4F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">Figure 5C–5E</xref>), as expected in the absence of accelerated disassembly. In any case, both topologies provide rather similar statistical predictions for “active” molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4C, 4E</xref>), complicating their distinction by statistical means.</p>
<p>The regulatory hypothesis <italic>A</italic><sub>F</sub> implies that loss of promoter nucleosomes is a cause of activated transcription, rather than its consequence. Nucleosome disassembly can be strongly dependent on Swi2, the catalytic subunit of the ATP-dependent remodeling enzyme SWI/SNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Brown1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Reinke1">[35]</xref>. Similar observations of genetic dependence, and of activator-remodeler interactions are frequently invoked in support of this assumption. This argument overlooks, however, that the same observations are equally consistent with the opposite assumption—that nucleosome loss is a consequence of promoter activation, possibly due to steric exclusion by transcription factors. Indeed, our data support the notion of continual disassembly of promoter nucleosome even in the absence of activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">Figure 5C–5E</xref>); this may explain the rapid binding of newly synthesized histones to transcriptionally “inactive” promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Dion1">[36]</xref>. A critical test of <italic>A</italic><sub>F</sub>, therefore, requires the distinction between cause and effect of nucleosome loss. The two-state promoter model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) provided a means for this distinction. Given <italic>A</italic><sub>R</sub>, <italic>A</italic><sub>C</sub>, and <italic>A</italic><sub>D</sub>, <italic>A</italic><sub>F</sub> predicts an increase in the frequency of transcriptional bursting, whereas its rival hypothesis implies an increase in burst size. Noise analysis bore out the former expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g006">Figure 6</xref>), refuting nucleosome loss by mass action.</p>
<p>Additional support for <italic>A</italic><sub>F</sub> was provided by our experimental test of <italic>A</italic><sub>D</sub> (hypothesis of nucleosomal dominance). Neither mutation of the TATA box, nor absence of the Pho2 transcription factor caused an increase in promoter nucleosome occupancy (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">5A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g005">Figure 5D</xref> with 5E, respectively)—again refuting the hypothesis of nucleosome loss by mass action, however corroborating both <italic>A</italic><sub>D</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>F</sub>. <italic>A</italic><sub>D</sub> may explain the poor correlation between the dwell time of activators at their DNA recognition sequences <italic>in vivo</italic> and their binding affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Lickwar1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic><sub>F</sub> furthermore implies that activated transcription encompasses accelerated assembly of a scaffold of general transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Murakami1">[28]</xref> following nucleosome removal. Alternatively it may be assumed that nucleosome removal is either sufficient for activated transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Adkins1">[38]</xref>, or that Pho4 stimulates other steps than scaffold assembly, such as the rate of transcription in the active state, ε. The first of these alternatives is refuted by our finding that nucleosome loss did not quantitatively account for activated transcription. The second alternative implies that <italic>PHO5</italic> transcription is regulated, at least in part, by changes in burst size. For this latter assumption the integrated model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g008">Figure 8A</xref> predicted a noise profile that was inconsistent with experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), refuting this second alternative, too. The same observations, however, corroborated <italic>A</italic><sub>F</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>The discovery of a stalled RNA polymerase at transcriptionally inactive promoters in other eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Nechaev1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Guenther1">[42]</xref> does not contradict the notion that steps prior to the release of stalling are rate-limiting to transcription. The <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter assumes the active state even in the absence of Pho4, releasing bursts of transcripts at low frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This may explain the need for additional mechanisms of regulation, such as stalling, to suppress bursting, which in the case of genetic regulators of embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Zeitlinger1">[41]</xref> are likely to have deleterious consequences. A low probability per time of forming a stalled polymerase-promoter complex under repressing conditions may lead, eventually, to complex formation with near certainty when integrated over a sufficiently long time.</p>
<p>The integrated model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g008">Figure 8A</xref> allowed us to infer the time scale of promoter nucleosome transitions from measurements of cell cycle time and mRNA half life, suggesting an average life time for unoccupied promoter nucleosome positions, (1/<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001621.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), of ∼1 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001621.s009">Text S2</xref>). This estimate is minimally affected by possible error margins for cell cycle time or mRNA half life (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001621.s004">Figure S4</xref>). An experimental test of this implication of our theory will have to await the development of independent methods for determining the kinetic parameters of nucleosome transitions <italic>in vivo</italic>. We note however that the short half life of unoccupied nucleosome positions may explain the rapid association of newly synthesized histones with promoter DNA, observed on a genome-wide scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Dion1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>The central role for transcription of the nucleosome in position N-2 (<italic>A</italic><sub>C</sub>), was imposed by our finding, from noise analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), that the total probability of active promoter states is 0.6 under fully activating conditions (<italic>PHO4 pho80</italic>Δ cells), providing a lower bound for the total probability of conducive nucleosome configurations. Our EM data indicated that the only set of configurations consistent with this lower bound, and united by a common structural feature, was the set of configurations with a nucleosome-free position N-2, and not N-1, contrary to previous conjectures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao2">[15]</xref>. While this conclusion provides a functional explanation for the lower nucleosome occupancy at position N-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), it raises the questions of how the requirement for nucleosome removal from position N-2 may be mechanistically explained, and why removal of nucleosomes from position N-1 is not required?</p>
<p>The <italic>PHO5</italic> TATA box resides at the 5′-edge of nucleosomes in position N-1 and, under inducing conditions, is freely accessible in a subset of promoter molecules due to a 3′-directed shift in the position of nucleosomes in this position by about 30 base pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger2">[14]</xref>, which was also discernable by EM (analysis not shown). This positional shift and spontaneous partial unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Polach1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Li1">[43]</xref>, together with high local concentrations of TBP due to activator-mediated recruitment to the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao1">[6]</xref>, might allow for efficient binding of TBP at the TATA box. Subsequent assembly of the transcription machinery might provide the free energy for further unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA to eventually render the transcription start site accessible, without complete disassembly of the nucleosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Adams1">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>Loss of nucleosomes from position N-2 enables Pho4 binding at UASp2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao1">[6]</xref>, and may thus render removal or remodeling of the nucleosome in the proximal N-1 position more effective (see above). However, loss of Pho4 binding at UASp2 by mutation of UASp2 did not abolish activated <italic>PHO5</italic> expression; the UASp2 mutant retained ∼25% of its wild type <italic>PHO5</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001621-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Kim1">[45]</xref>. In contrast, inhibition of N-2 nucleosome removal by replacement of the N-2 sequence with a strong nucleosome positioning sequence abolished activated transcription entirely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Straka1">[46]</xref>, as predicted by <italic>A</italic><sub>C</sub>. Together, these findings point to an inhibitory effect of this nucleosome beyond blocking access to UASp2. A possible explanation is that loss of nucleosome N-2 allows general transcription factors, such as TBP, to slide along the DNA toward the core promoter, following their recruitment by Pho4 to promoter DNA at UASp1. Consistently, bacterial transcription factors find their operator sequence <italic>in vivo</italic> by a combination of three-dimensional diffusion and DNA sliding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Hammar1">[47]</xref>. This provides a possible explanation for the observation that tethering of a bacterial repressor protein between upstream activation sequences and the TATA box of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter of yeast severely inhibits <italic>GAL1</italic> transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Brent1">[48]</xref>. Nucleosomal inhibition of “promoter scanning” by general transcription factors might also explain the occurrence and position of a “nucleosome free region” at many promoters from yeast to human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Jiang1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Thurman1">[50]</xref>, analogous to the N-2 region of the <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter.</p>

<title>Trimethylpsoralen Crosslinking and Denaturing</title>
<p>Crosslinking was performed essentially as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Sogo1">[52]</xref> with the following modifications. Following chromatin ring elution from the IgG column, samples were pooled and placed onto a 10 cm petri dish that was floating on an ice water slurry, and positioned 5 cm away from five 366 nm UV bulbs in a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene); 0.05 volumes of 400 µg/ml trimethylpsoralen was added and the sample was then incubated in the dark on ice for 5 min. Samples were then irradiated by UV for 5 min. Addition of psoralen, incubation in the dark, and crosslinking were performed a total of seven times for each sample. Following crosslinking, the sample was treated with RNaseA for 2 h at 37°C followed by a Proteinase K/SDS treatment for 4 h at 55°C. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated. DNA was resuspended, digested with NcoI, purified using a DNA Clean and Concentrator kit (ZymoResearch), and eluted from the column with 8 µl of TEN (30 mM TEACl, 20 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl). Denaturing, spreading, staining with uranyl acetate, and rotary metal shadowing was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Sogo1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>Heterogeneous bubble sizes were due, at least in part, to the sequence specificity of psoralen intercalation, as psoralen preferentially intercalates into dinucleotides TA and AT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Esposito1">[53]</xref>—resulting either in bubbles that were larger than the expected nucleosome size, when linker DNA failed to crosslink, or in bubbles that were smaller than the expected nucleosome size where no nucleosomes had been present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001621.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Because of longer linker lengths, fused nucleosome bubbles occurred seldom on promoter DNA. Smaller than expected bubbles may also have been due to crosslinking of DNA that transiently unspooled from the histone octamer. Bubbles on naked control DNA added to chromatin ring preparations measured 90 base pairs in length, on average. We therefore excluded bubbles smaller than 90 base pairs when counting promoter nucleosome bubbles. (Bubbles attributable to preinitiation complex formation are on the order of ∼60 base pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Murakami1">[28]</xref>.) To determine promoter nucleosome positions, we determined the positions of UASp2 (N-2 position), the TATA box, and the transcription start site (N-1 position) for every gene molecule, converting base pair distances into contour length by relating the measured contour length of the entire gene molecule (average over both strands) to the known length of the gene molecule in base pairs. Promoter nucleosome occupancies thus determined were in good agreement with the results of restriction nuclease accessibility assays in nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001621.s002">Figure S2</xref>), and isolated chromatin rings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger1">[13]</xref>. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that smaller than expected bubbles were also due to intermediate structures of nucleosome assembly and disassembly, the paucity of sub-nucleosome size DNA fragments in previous micrococcal nuclease digestions of <italic>PHO5</italic> promoter chromatin suggests that the number of such intermediates is small <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger2">[14]</xref>.</p>

The <italic>R</italic>-Value Loss was then calculated by taking the (average) difference in single stranded DNA between molecules isolated from <italic>pho4</italic>Δ <italic>pho80</italic>Δ cells (in base pairs) and dividing it by the average bubble size of the repressed promoter (153 bp). The difference of 1.89 nucleosomes between repressed and activated gene rings thus determined closely matched the average linking difference between activated and repressed TATA-less <italic>PHO5</italic> rings of +1.85 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Boeger2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao2">[15]</xref>, indicating that nucleosome disassembly was associated with a linking change of about +1 per nucleosome <italic>in vivo</italic>, in accord with earlier observations for the SV40 chromosome and synthetic chromatin rings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Prunell1">[54]</xref>. Likewise, the difference of 0.89 nucleosomes between repressed rings and rings isolated from <italic>pho4</italic>:Δ85-99 cells determined by EM was closely similar to the previously determined linking number difference of +0.92 between rings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001621-Mao2">[15]</xref>.</p>
