<abstract>
<p>The kinetics of recirculation of naive lymphocytes in the body has important implications for the speed at which local infections are detected and controlled by immune responses. With a help of a novel mathematical model, we analyze experimental data on migration of <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDLs) via major lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues of rats in the absence of systemic antigenic stimulation. We show that at any point of time, 95% of lymphocytes in the blood travel via capillaries in the lung or sinusoids of the liver and only 5% migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, or the spleen. Interestingly, our analysis suggests that lymphocytes travel via lung capillaries and liver sinusoids at an extremely rapid rate with the average residence time in these tissues being less than 1 minute. The model also predicts a relatively short average residence time of TDLs in the spleen (2.5 hours) and a longer average residence time of TDLs in major lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (10 hours). Surprisingly, we find that the average residence time of lymphocytes is similar in lymph nodes draining the skin (subcutaneous LNs) or the gut (mesenteric LNs) or in Peyer's patches. Applying our model to an additional dataset on lymphocyte migration via resting and antigen-stimulated lymph nodes we find that enlargement of antigen-stimulated lymph nodes occurs mainly due to increased entrance rate of TDLs into the nodes and not due to decreased exit rate as has been suggested in some studies. Taken together, our analysis for the first time provides a comprehensive, systems view of recirculation kinetics of thoracic duct lymphocytes in the whole organism.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>It is has been well established that lymphocytes, major cells of the adaptive immune system, continuously recirculate between secondary lymphoid tissues in the body such as lymph nodes, spleen, and Peyer's patches. Yet, the kinetics of lymphocyte entrance into and more importantly, residence times in these tissues still remain incompletely determined. Using previously published experimental data and a novel mathematical model we address this problem and estimate the rates of lymphocyte entrance into and exit from major secondary lymphoid tissues. We find that lymphocytes on average must pass via vasculature of the lung or liver 20 times before they migrate to one of the secondary lymphoid tissues. Despite small size of capillaries in the lung and liver, we predict that on average lymphocytes spend less than 1 minute in the vasculature of these organs. Furthermore, we estimate that lymphocytes spend on average 2.5 hours in the spleen and 10 hours in the lymph nodes or Peyer's patches. Our mathematical modeling for the first time provides a quantitative, systems view of lymphocyte recirculation in the whole organism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lymphocytes, cells of the adaptive immune system, continuously recirculate between multiple tissues in the body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-FordW1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MarelliBergF1">[3]</xref>. Naive, antigen-unexperienced lymphocytes are traditionally thought to recirculate mainly between blood, lymph, and secondary lymphoid organs such as spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MackayC1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann5">[5]</xref>. Effector and memory lymphocytes can access nonlymphoid tissues such as the brain, skin, lung, vaginal tract, salivary gland, and gut epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann2">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Jiang1">[15]</xref>. Although receptors and their ligands regulating entrance of lymphocytes into various lymphoid or nonlymphoid tissues have been thoroughly studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-PribilaJ1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-IslamSA1">[20]</xref>, how quickly lymphocytes can enter a particular tissue and how long they will stay in that tissue remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, how lymphocyte recirculation kinetics depends on the cell type (naive, memory, or effector T or B lymphocyte), the tissue (e.g., lymphoid or nonlymphoid), localization in the tissue (e.g., vasculature or parenchyma), and status of the host (e.g., uninfected or infected) remains understudied.</p>
<p>The number of lymphocytes found in a particular tissue results from several different processes: entrance of lymphocytes in the tissue, lymphocyte proliferation in the tissue, lymphocyte death in the tissue, and lymphocyte exit from the tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann2">[6]</xref>. Change in either of these processes, for example, during an infection, will change the number of lymphocytes residing in the tissue. Yet, which of these four processes actually regulate cell abundances in various tissues under different conditions is incompletely understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SchwabSR1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Jennrich1">[22]</xref>. For example, it has been suggested that naive T cells have the ability to enter peripheral tissues such as gut lamina propria or the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-KrakowskiML1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Cose1">[24]</xref> but what regulates low recovered numbers of naive T cells in these tissues (e.g., a low entrance rate into the tissue or a high death rate in the tissue) remains unclear.</p>
<p>Patterns and kinetics of lymphocyte migration via secondary lymphoid tissues have been studied extensively several decades ago using various <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental techniques including lymph node or thoracic duct cannulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Pabst1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-DiRosa1">[27]</xref>. Yet, interpretation of the experimental data obtained in such kinetic studies remained semi-quantitative. Transit times via a particular lymph node (e.g., popliteal or inguinal) have been estimated in large animals such as sheep or pigs by transferring labeled lymphocytes intravenously into the animal and measuring the rate of exit of labeled lymphocytes into efferent lymph of the cannulated node <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-FordW1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MackayC1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Frost1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Thomas1">[33]</xref>. These experiments showed that the peak of labeled cell exit during cannulation occurs 20–30 hours post lymphocyte transfer with many lymphocytes exiting the lymph node for several days after the transfer. It has been implicitly assumed that the mode (or the average) of this distribution represents the average residence time of lymphocytes in lymph nodes. Very recently, a novel mathematical model has been developed to estimate the average transit time of labeled lymphocytes via individual lymph nodes from such cannulation experiments suggesting that blood-derived lymphocytes spend on average 30 hours in sheep lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Thomas1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Thoracic duct cannulation has been used in mice and rats to study kinetics of lymphocyte migration from the blood to the lymphatic duct lymph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Gowans1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann4">[40]</xref>. Such experiments reported the change in the rate of exit of adoptively transferred labeled lymphocytes via the thoracic duct over time. Depending on the study, the animal species, and the type of lymphocytes used for transfer, the peak of lymphocyte exit from the thoracic duct ranged from 15 to over 24 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Pabst1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-FordW2">[35]</xref>. Similarly to the data on cannulation of individual lymph nodes, the mode or the mean of the distribution of exit rates of labeled lymphocytes during thoracic duct cannulation has been interpreted to represent the average residence time of lymphocytes in lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Cyster1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Girard1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-YoungA1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Bajnoff1">[41]</xref>. Mathematical models that assumed that lymphocytes spend 6 hours in the spleen and 20 hours in lymph nodes of rats could explain kinetics of exit of adoptively transferred labeled lymphocyte during thoracic duct cannulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-StekelD1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-StekelD3">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>More recently, the average residence time of naive and memory T lymphocytes in major lymph nodes in mice has been estimated using mathematical models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJ1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MandlJ1">[46]</xref>. In these studies naive or memory T lymphocytes were adoptively transferred into syngenic hosts and later, lymphocyte entry into lymph nodes was blocked using antibodies against specific receptors such as L-selectin or LFA-1 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The rate of decline of the number of donor lymphocytes in various lymph nodes was used to calculate the average residence time of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJ1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MandlJ1">[46]</xref>. In particular, Mandl <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MandlJ1">[46]</xref> estimated the average residence time of naive CD4 T cells in peripheral and mesenteric LNs to be 12.2 and 9.6 hours, respectively, and that of naive CD8 T cells to be 21.2 and 17.0 hours respectively. In comparison, Harp <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJ1">[45]</xref> found that both naive and memory CD8 T cells specific to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) spend on average 8.4 hours in lymph nodes. Another recent study using photoconvertable protein-expressing mice (KikGR) estimated the half-life time of naive B cells in Peyer's patches of mice to be 10 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SchmidtT1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>Only a few studies investigated lymphocyte migration via other secondary lymphoid tissues such as the spleen. One study used <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated rat spleens perfused with labeled lymphocytes. Based on the kinetics of lymphocyte loss from and return in the artificial circulation the average residence time of lymphocytes in the spleen was proposed to be around 5–6 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-FordWL1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Ford2">[51]</xref>. A mathematical modelling study provided estimates of lymphocyte migration via the red and white pulp but did not estimate the overall lymphocyte transit time via the spleen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HammondB1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>The kinetics of migration of lymphocytes via vasculature of nonlymphoid organs such as the lung and liver remain poorly understood. Several lines of indirect evidence suggests that lymphocytes may spend tens of minutes to hours in the lung vasculature. First, the diameter of the capillaries in the lung (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in humans) is similar to or smaller than the size of a lymphocyte (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in humans), suggesting that many lymphocytes may be delayed while migrating via the lung vasculature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-DoerschukC1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Shirai1">[55]</xref>. Second, recent studies found that the majority of memory CD8 T lymphocytes isolated from a perfused murine lung following LCMV infection are in fact associated with lung capillary bed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-AndersonK1">[56]</xref>. Third, transfer of <italic>in vitro</italic> activated lymphocytes to syngenic animals (mice and monkeys) leads to a long retention of transferred cells in the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SprentJ1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MinangJ1">[59]</xref>. Finally, studies perfusing <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated swine lungs demonstrated a relatively long average residence time of leukocytes in the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Pabst2">[60]</xref>. Studies on migration of radioactively labeled neutrophils in several mammalian species suggest that the majority of neutrophils are retained during passage via the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-ThommasenH1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HoggJ3">[63]</xref>. A recent study also suggested that naive CD4 T lymphocytes are retained in the lung for substantial periods of time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-CaucheteuxS1">[64]</xref>. Overall, previous studies indicate that under normal, uninflammatory conditions lymphocytes may spend substantial amount of time while traveling via the capillary bed of the lung. We have found no studies on the migration kinetics of lymphocytes via sinusoids of the liver.</p>
<p>Taken together, there is a wealth of experimental data on migration of lymphocytes via major secondary lymphoid and some nonlymphoid tissues. Unfortunately, the most often cited estimates of lymphocyte residence times in such tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Cyster1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Girard1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-YoungA1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Bajnoff1">[41]</xref> have been obtained by qualitative techniques without the use of mathematical modeling. Such implicit calculations make it difficult to judge which assumptions have been made during calculations and whether provided estimates should be trusted. There are more recent mathematical modeling-based estimates of the lymphocyte residence times in lymph nodes but it remains unknown if these estimates can be used to provide a comprehensive view of recirculation kinetics of lymphocytes via all the major organs in mammals. In addition, such estimates have been obtained using different experimental systems and are for different types of lymphocytes. In this paper we analyze data from experiments involving transfer of <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled thoracic duct lymphocytes and measurements of accumulation and loss of the labeled cells in most tissues of rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref>. Using a novel mathematical model of lymphocyte recirculation in the whole organism we, for the first time, provide estimates of the migration kinetics of thoracic duct lymphocytes to all major murine organs/tissues and average residence times of lymphocytes in these tissues in one modeling study.</p>

<title>Experimental data</title>
<p>Data on lymphocyte recirculation have been collected by Smith and Ford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref> in a series of experiments with AO rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Lymphocytes were collected overnight from male donor rats by thoracic duct cannulation and labeled with sodium-[<sup>51</sup>Cr] chromate (16 hours, cells kept at 0°C). Prior work has demonstrated that long handling of thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDLs) at low temperatures influences ability of lymphocytes to migrate to lymphoid organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-FordW4">[66]</xref>. Therefore, <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled lymphocytes were passaged from blood to lymph <italic>in vivo</italic> by thoracic duct cannulation in an intermediate male rat with minimal handling at room temperature for approximately 1 hour. Total radioactivity in collected lymphocytes was measured and then these lymphocytes were injected into female recipient rats. Thirteen organs of the recipients were removed at the following intervals after cell transfer: 1, 2, 5, 10 and 30 minutes, and 1, 2.5, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 hours and the fraction of labeled cells recovered from a given organ was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The average percent of labeled TDLs was calculated from at least 5 rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref>.</p>

Collected lymphocytes were injected into female recipient rats and the percent of injected donor lymphocytes was measured in major lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs of the recipient rats. In the second set of experiments (cannulation data, panel B), TDLs were passaged via an intermediate host and then injected into the final recipients. Donor lymphocytes were counted during the thoracic duct cannulation of the recipient rats over the period of 45 hours.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.g001" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>The following organs were removed for counting of the <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled TDLs: six superficial cervical LNs, two to four deep cervical LNs, two to three coeliac LNs, the mesenteric LN chain excluding the ileocaecal LNs, the right popliteal LN (stimulated 3 days previously with 0.10 ml of a 10% suspension of sheep erythrocytes 3 days prior to cell transfer), the left popliteal LN (unstimulated), Peyer's patches, three samples of the small intestines with the Peyer's patches removed, the spleen, the left lung with large hilar vessels removed, samples of the liver, the right tibia and the mononuclear cells in the blood samples. Percent of labeled lymphocytes in all major lymph nodes except of mesenteric LNs were pooled together and denoted as subcutaneous LNs (SCLNs).</p>
<p>In a separate set of experiments the tempo of recirculation of TDLs from blood to the thoracic duct was evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled TDLs were were passaged through an intermediate host as described above and then injected into final recipients. Thoracic duct lymphocytes were collected from the recipient rats at 90 minute intervals over a 45 hour period and the percent of labeled TDLs exiting lymph nodes per hour via the thoracic duct was calculated.

<title>Basic assumptions</title>
<p>In the mathematical model we assume that the blood is the major compartment that delivers lymphocytes into other tissues and by exiting these tissues, lymphocytes return to the blood. The only exception to this rule is Peyer's patches as it is known that from Peyer's patches lymphocytes migrate into mesenteric lymph nodes ([67, p. 470]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g002">Figure 2</xref>). It is important to mention that measurements of transferred cells in various organs included cells found in the vasculature (capillaries) and parenchyma (tissue). Therefore, our analysis delivers estimates of the average kinetics of TDLs via both vasculature and parenchyma. The model assumes that exit from nonlymphoid tissues and the spleen follows first order kinetics, and therefore, residence times in these tissues are exponentially distributed. Analysis of the data using models in which TDL residence times in these tissues are not exponentially distributed will be presented elsewhere.</p>

<title>Migration via lymph nodes</title>

These different compartments 1) could be represented by different lymph nodes as it is known that lymph nodes often form chains and lymphocytes exiting from one lymph node enter another lymph node without returning to the blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Kawashima1">[68]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Frster1">[72]</xref>; or 2) different subcompartments within a given lymph node (e.g., cortex, paracortex, and medulla, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-GoldsbyR1">[69]</xref>).

<title>Rapid recirculation of lymphocytes between blood, lung, and liver</title>
<p>To study recirculation kinetics of thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDLs), Smith &amp; Ford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref> adoptively transferred <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>Cr-labeled TDLs and measured the percent of transferred lymphocytes in different organs of the recipient rats including the blood, lung, liver, spleen, skin-draining (subcutaneous) and gut-draining (mesenteric) lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To estimate rates at which these TDLs migrate into different tissues of rats from the blood and the average residence times of TDLs in the tissues we developed a novel mathematical model. The model is based on a system of ordinary differential equations; the model takes into account recirculation of lymphocytes between lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues via blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003586.e045">eqn. (1</xref>) – (6)). We fit this mathematical model to experimental data on the recirculation kinetics of TDLs in rats using nonlinear least squares. Despite its relative simplicity the model describes extremely well both the short and long term dynamics of TDLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g003">Figure 3A &amp;B</xref>). In particular, the model accurately predicts a rapid drop in the percent of TDLs in the blood and concomitant increase in the percent of transferred TDLs in lung and liver within the first several minutes post transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Over time, the percent of transferred cells residing in the blood, lung, and liver declines while transferred cells accumulate in the secondary lymphoid organs such as spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The early decline in the fraction of labeled TDLs was similar in blood, lung, and liver suggesting a rapid recirculation of lymphocytes between these compartments.</p>
<p>In the first 30 minutes of the experiment the spleen accumulated slightly more transferred lymphocytes than all lymph nodes and Peyer's patches together (55 vs 45%). The percent of TDLs in the spleen started to decline in about 1.5 hours after cell transfer suggesting that residence time of TDLs in the spleen is relatively short. By the end of the 24 hour experiment the majority of the transferred cells (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) were found in subcutaneous lymph nodes (SCLNs). The model also captures well the dynamics of the total percent of TDLs in animals after transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g002">Figure 2</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>). Nearly 90% of transferred lymphocytes were recovered from the seven murine organs at 24 hours post-transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g002">Figure 2</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Using our mathematical model we estimated that TDLs exit the blood very quickly at a rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> min<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which corresponds to the average residence time of TDLs in the blood of 26 seconds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t001">Table 1</xref>). The majority of lymphocytes leaving the blood enter the lung (78%) and liver (17%) with only 5% of all lymphocytes in the blood migrating to the secondary lymphoid organs. Even though there is a rapid migration of lymphocytes from the blood vessels into lung and liver there is no accumulation of lymphocytes in the latter tissues. According to our model TDLs that entered the lung and liver return back to the blood after, on average, only 28 and 53 seconds, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t001">Table 1</xref>). Such rapid migration via these tissues suggests that TDLs found in the lung and liver are most likely located in the vasculature of these organs (capillaries of the lung and sinusoids of the liver). These data in combination with our mathematical model suggest that migration of lymphocytes via lung and liver vasculature in normal, noninflammatory conditions is very rapid. The combined rapid exit of TDLs from the blood into vasculature and rapid return back to the blood results in a relatively long average residence time of TDLs in the blood as has been observed in this and many other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Pabst1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann4">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Schick1">[80]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HusbandA1">[83]</xref>. Thus, our modeling reveals a highly dynamic nature of recirculation of thoracic duct lymphocytes between blood, lung capillaries, and liver sinusoids in rats.</p>

<title>Migration kinetics of lymphocytes via spleen and major lymph nodes</title>
<p>While there is a rapid recirculation of TDLs between the blood, lung, and liver, the percent of TDLs found in the blood declines slowly over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The decline cannot be due to cell death because the total percent of TDLs recovered from all major tissues declines very little (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g002">Figure 2</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>). This decline in the percent of TDLs found in the blood is due to lymphocyte migration to secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches. While migration into secondary lymphoid organs is slow and only 5% of lymphocytes found in the blood migrate into spleen, LNs, and PPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t001">Table 1</xref>), because of long average residence times of TDLs in these tissues, spleen, LNs, and PPs act as sinks for lymphocytes: whichever lymphocyte enters these tissues it does not leave for an extended period of time. We estimate that the average residence time of TDLs in the spleen is 2.4 hours while it takes on average 10 hours for TDLs to leave lymph nodes or Peyer's patches (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the average residence time of TDLs in different lymph nodes and Peyer's patches was found to be the same (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t001">Table 1</xref>). Allowing for different rates of lymphocyte egress from SCLNs, MLNs, and PPs did not improve the quality of the model fit to data (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The result of similar average residence times of lymphocytes in LNs and PPs was strongly dependent on the assumption that lymphocytes leaving Peyer's patches migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes. If we let lymphocytes from PPs migrate directly to the blood, we found different residence times of lymphocytes in SCLNs, MLNs, and PPs (results not shown).</p>

<p>The rate of lymphocyte exit into the blood via the thoracic duct depends strongly on the fraction of lymphocytes exiting into blood via left (thoracic) and right lymphatic ducts and on the time lymphocytes spend in lymph nodes. Thoracic duct collects lymphocytes exiting mesenteric lymph nodes and lymphocytes exiting subcutaneous lymph nodes on the left side of the body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Kawashima1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-ORahilly2">[84]</xref>. Assuming that around <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of lymphocytes from SCLNs enter the blood via the thoracic duct, the model prediction on thoracic duct output rate of labeled cells depends strongly on the distribution of residence times of lymphocytes in LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The model in which residence times are exponentially distributed (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) does not predict the shape nor the total number of lymphocytes exiting LNs into the thoracic duct. Models with gamma-distributed residence times (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) explain well the general shape of the cannulation data such as initial increase, peak, and long tail but also fail to explain the total number of cells recovered during cannulation which is given by the area under the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, dashed lines). In particular, in the data only 55% of lymphocytes exit the lymph nodes into the thoracic duct in 45 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g004">Figure 4</xref>) while the model at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> predicts that 78% of lymphocytes should exit lymph nodes by that time. This result suggests that cannulation influences the kinetics of lymphocyte migration via lymph nodes. We tested a previously suggested mechanism that reduction in cellularity of lymph nodes leads to increased retention of lymphocytes in the nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-StekelD3">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJ1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-BellEB1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Fossum2">[85]</xref>. Specifically, previous work suggested that it takes longer for lymphocytes to pass from blood to efferent lymph in irradiated or nude recipients which have reduced lymphocyte numbers in spleen and LNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-StekelD3">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-BellEB1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Fossum2">[85]</xref>. Furthermore, in a recent study where lymphocyte entrance into lymph nodes was blocked with anti-CD62L antibodies, the rate of lymphocyte loss from LNs was predicted to decrease with time since blockage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJ1">[45]</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g003">Figure 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>In our model, cannulation leads to an exponential decrease in the total number of lymphocytes in all tissues (results not shown), and therefore, we let the rate of lymphocyte migration via the lymph nodes and Peyer's patches to decline exponentially over time during cannulation due to loss of LN cellularity. Under the assumption that the exit rate from LNs and PPs declines exponentially with the time since cannulation, the model with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (not shown) matches well the kinetics of migration of labeled TDLs via the thoracic duct predicting both the shape and total magnitude of the cannulation data. The model suggests that in 24 hours of thoracic duct cannulation, the average residence times of lymphocytes in the LNs increases 2 fold, from 10 to 23 hours, and this in part explains long time that would be required to collect all transferred lymphocytes via the thoracic duct. Importantly, the model in which residence times of lymphocytes in LNs are exponentially distributed failed to explain the cannulation data even at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (results not shown).

Because it has been difficult to simultaneously measure the rate of lymphocyte entrance into and the rate of lymphocyte exit from a given lymph node, it remains unresolved whether both processes (reduced exit rate and increased entrance rate) contribute to the LN enlargement. We address this question by analyzing an additional set of data from experiments performed by Smith &amp; Ford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref>. The authors stimulated popliteal LN (pLN) of rats with sheep erythrocytes 3 days prior to transfer of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>Cr-labeled thoracic duct lymphocytes, and another pLN was left unstimulated. More labeled lymphocytes accumulated in the antigen-stimulated pLN than in the control pLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g005">Figure 5</xref>). By fitting the mathematical model to these data we find that a larger percent of labeled lymphocytes in the antigen-stimulated pLN was due to almost 4 fold increase in the rate of entrance of lymphocytes from the blood into the LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The rate of lymphocyte egress from stimulated and unstimulated pLNs 3 days after antigen delivery was the same (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Importantly, the model did not match well the data on lymphocyte migration via the antigen-stimulated lymph node suggesting that rates of lymphocyte entry into and exit from such lymph nodes may be time-dependent. Indeed, allowing for the entry and/or exit rates to change exponentially with time since TDL transfer improved the model fit to these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t001">Table 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>). However, the predicted changes in the exit/entrance rates with time appeared to be biologically unrealistic (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g004">Figure 4</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>). Further work is needed to understand whether and how rates of lymphocyte entrance into and exit from antigen-stimulated LNs change over the course of infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study for the first time provides quantitative estimates of migration rates of thoracic duct lymphocytes into and the average residence time of TDLs in major murine organs in one modeling framework. Several results are particularly interesting. We find very rapid recirculation of TDLs between major blood vessels and vasculature of the lung and liver, which can also be readily seen in the data. In 1 minute the percent of TDLs in the blood drops from 100% to 40% which already implies that half-life time of lymphocytes in the major blood vessels is less than one minute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In the same time period, the lung receives 35% and liver 17% of transferred TDLs. This suggests that migration of TDLs into the lung and liver is extremely rapid. The percent of TDLs in these two organs does not accumulate dramatically over time suggesting rapid exit of lymphocytes from these organs into the circulation. Relatively rapid migration of thoracic duct and blood lymphocytes via the vasculature of the lung was also noticed in previous studies in rats or pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann4">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-PabstR2">[82]</xref>. Previous studies on migration of neutrophils found that although the majority of neutrophils are delayed during their passage via the lung vasculature, the average transit time of neutrophils via the vasculature in humans is only around 3 minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HoggJ1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SchwabA1">[94]</xref>. This is well consistent with our proposed estimate for the average residence time of TDLs in the murine lung vasculature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In our experimental data measurements of transferred cells in the lung tissues included both cells in vasculature (capillaries) and cells in parenchyma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref>. Consequently, our model describes TDL migration via the lung as migration via a one compartment organ. Predicted by the model rapid migration of TDLs via the lung suggests that lymphocytes pass the lung via the lung capillaries. However, it is possible that some lymphocytes may gain access to lung parenchyma and may reside in the tissue for substantial time before migrating to the lung-draining lymph nodes via afferent lymphatics. Indeed, Caucheteux <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-CaucheteuxS1">[64]</xref> recently observed that some naive CD4 T cells may be recovered from lung parenchyma after adoptive transfer into naive mice. In their experiments, Caucheteux <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-CaucheteuxS1">[64]</xref> transferred naive P25 TCR transgenic CD4 T cells, specific to pigeon cytochrome C protein, into naive recipient and 24 hours later, treated the recipient mice with the drug FTY720. FTY720 binds to S1P receptor on lymphocytes, thus preventing their egress from lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Cyster1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Chiba1">[95]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HonigS1">[96]</xref>. Following FTY720 treatment, Caucheteux <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-CaucheteuxS1">[64]</xref> observed a rapid decline in the density of donor T cells in the blood and a much delayed decline of donor cells in the lung parenchyma suggesting that donor T cells in the blood and the lung parenchyma are not in equilibrium. We extended our mathematical model to include migration of TDLs from the lung vasculature to parenchyma and then to lung-draining medistinal lymph nodes (SCLNs in our model). If lymphocytes reside in the lung parenchyma for over 10 hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-CaucheteuxS1">[64]</xref>, our model can well describe the dynamics of lymphocytes via the whole lung (vasculature and parenchyma) if a small percent (e.g., 0.01%) of lymphocytes exiting vasculature migrate to the lung parenchyma (results not shown). Taken together, our results and work of Caucheteux <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-CaucheteuxS1">[64]</xref> suggest that the bulk of naive T cells travel rapidly via the lung vasculature while a small fraction of lymphocytes may enter lung parenchyma and may remain the tissue for an extended period of time. Detailed understanding of lymphocyte migration via lung vasculature and parenchyma can be obtained when kinetic data on the lymphocyte distribution between these compartments become available.</p>
<p>By considering migration of lymphocytes via lung/liver or secondary lymphoid organs (SLO such as spleen, LNs, and PPs) as a Bernoulli trial we can estimate the average number of times a lymphocyte in the blood will pass via lung or liver vasculature before migrating into the SLO. Given that the probability of migrating via vasculature is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and via SLO is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t001">Table 1</xref>), the average number of “failures” (travel via lung or liver) before first success (travel via SLO) is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Such a large number of passes via lung or liver before lymphocyte enters a lymph node or spleen may explain why during some pulmonary infections many lymphocytes can be recovered from the lung. If inflammation in the lung increases the time that lymphocytes require to pass via the lung vasculature, many lymphocytes are expected to accumulate in the lung without an often postulated specific antigen-dependent recruitment of effector T cells to the lung vasculature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>It is useful to compare the estimated residence times of lymphocytes in vasculature of the lung and liver with the kinetics of recirculation of the blood. Given that the total volume of blood in 170 gram rats is about 11 ml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-LeeHB1">[97]</xref>, the volume of the heart is about 1 mL, heart beat rate is 300 per min, and that about 30% of the heart volume is pumped by heart per beat, we find that in 1 minute, rat heart will pump <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mL of blood. This suggests the average turnover rate of the blood is approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sec which is 5 to 10 fold smaller than the time it takes for lymphocytes to travel via lung and liver vasculature, respectively. Why it takes longer for lymphocytes to migrate via liver sinusoids than via lung capillaries remains to be determined.</p>
<p>By fitting our mathematical model to two sets of data simultaneously (migration data and cannulation data) we confirmed our estimates of the average residence times of TDLs in the spleen and lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g006">Figure 6</xref>). While our estimates of the average residence time in the spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches provide a consistent ranking of lymphoid tissues in terms of their lymphocyte retention potential (e.g., lymphocytes stay longer in the LNs than in the spleen), our estimates for lymphocyte residence times in LNs are smaller than previously suggested values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Pabst1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-FordW2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-OttawayC1">[98]</xref> including estimates obtained in recent studies utilizing mathematical modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Thomas1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJ1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MandlJ1">[46]</xref>.

In the data, 55% of transferred TDLs were collected during 45 hours of the thoracic duct cannulation. The model also predicts the contribution of lymphocytes exiting SCLNs (short dashed line in panel B) and MLNs (long dashed line in panel B) via the thoracic duct.

<p>It remains unclear why our estimates of the average residence time of lymphocytes in LNs are shorter than recently published values obtained using adoptive transfer of naive or memory T cells in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJ1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MandlJ1">[46]</xref>. There could be several explanations.</p>
<p>First, it could be the type of lymphocytes. Lymphocytes used in our experimental data have been passaged through an intermediate host from blood to thoracic duct lymph prior to final transfer (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>). It has been argued that long handling of lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and isolation of lymphocytes from lymphoid tissues such as spleen and LNs can drastically influence their migration kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-FordW4">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithME1">[100]</xref>. In particular, thoracic duct lymphocytes transferred to intermediate hosts and then isolated from lymph nodes have drastically reduced ability to migrate to lymph nodes of new recipients within first 30 min post transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithME1">[100]</xref>. It is interesting to note that TDLs used in our experimental data migrate much quicker to the spleen as compared to spleen-derived lymphocytes (splenocytes). Previous studies estimated that splenocytes injected intravenously into recipient mice migrate to the spleen at a rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> min<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Regoes1">[101]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-GanusovVVDe1">[102]</xref> while in our data, TDLs migrate from the blood to the spleen at a rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> min<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t001">Table 1</xref>). Such a large difference is unlikely to arise due to different types of lymphocytes used in experiments - spenocytes are mostly B cells while TDLs are mostly T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithME1">[100]</xref>. The slow predicted rate of splenocyte migration to the spleen in previous experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Regoes1">[101]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-GanusovVVDe1">[102]</xref> could be due to the assumption that all transferred splenocytes (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are capable of migrating to and suriving in the spleen. If only 10% of transferred cells have this ability, the difference in estimated migration rates between splenocytes and TDLs would be only 4 fold.</p>
<p>Second, it could be due to assumptions made in the previous mathematical models used to analyze the data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJ1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MandlJ1">[46]</xref>. Both studies used adoptive transfer of lymphocytes into syngenic hosts and added antibodies after the cell transfer to block entry of donor lymphocytes into lymph nodes. In the mathematical models the authors assumed that the residence times of lymphocytes in LNs are exponentially distributed and that efficacy of antibodies at blocking entry of cells into the nodes is 100%. Changing both of these assumptions may influence the observed decline of the donor cells in the LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g005">Figure 5</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref> and result not shown). In particular, if antibody blocking efficacy is not 100% then the rate of decline of the density of donor cells will underestimate the true lymphocyte egress rate from LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g005">Figure 5</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>), and thus will provide a higher estimate of the average residence time.</p>
<p>Third and finally, differences in estimates could arise due to different experimental techniques used in different studies. In particular, it is not known if death could be contributing to the loss of cells from LNs during the antibody blockade experiments. In these experiments lymphocytes exiting LNs were never counted back in other places to make sure that cell loss due to death does not play an important role in these experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJ1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MandlJ1">[46]</xref>. Inclusion of cell death in the models will likely increase the estimates of the average residence times of lymphocytes in LNs.</p>
<p>Our estimates of TDL residence times in LNs are also shorter than recently calculated residence times for blood lymphocytes migrating via individual lymph nodes in sheep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Thomas1">[33]</xref>. There could be species-specific differences in residence times between rats and sheep. Importantly, however, the mathematical model of Thomas <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Thomas1">[33]</xref> did not incorporate a continuous input of lymphocytes from the blood into the lymph node and that assumption likely led to overestimation of the lymphocyte residence time in the nodes (McDaniel and Ganusov, unpublished work).</p>
<p>Our mathematical model correctly predicts the exit rate of labeled lymphocytes into the circulation via the thoracic duct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g004">Figure 4</xref>) when 1) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of lymphocytes in the subcutaneous LNs enter the blood from lymph nodes via the thoracic (left lymphatic) duct, 2) distribution of residence times of lymphocytes in lymph nodes follows a right-tailed gamma distribution (with the shape parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and 3) the rate of lymphocyte exit from lymph nodes declines exponentially with the time since cannulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Assuming that lymphocyte residence times in lymph nodes follow an exponential distribution as has been recently suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MandlJ1">[46]</xref>, we were unable to explain the kinetics of exit of transferred lymphocytes during thoracic duct cannulation. This model predicted a much earlier peak in the rate of lymphocyte exit into the thoracic duct than that observed in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Analysis of the data for migration of lymphocytes via individual lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Frost1">[28]</xref> also suggested that the residence times in lymph nodes cannot be given by the exponential distribution because there is always a substantial delay before the majority of labeled lymphocytes is detected in efferent lymph (McDaniel and Ganusov, unpublished observations). The conclusion that residence times of naive T lymphocytes in lymph nodes are exponentially distributed came from the observation that blocking entrance of lymphocytes into LNs leads to an exponential decline in the number of adoptively transferred T cells recovered in LNs. Using parameter estimates in our model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t001">Table 1</xref>) we simulated these experiments assuming different levels of the efficacy of blocking lymphocyte entry into LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g005">Figure 5</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>). The results of the simulations suggest that even if the distribution of residence times in LNs is not exponential, the number of transferred cells after blockade may still decline exponentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g005">Figure 5</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>). Therefore, the observation of exponential-like behavior should not be taken as evidence that the underlying probability distribution of residence times is exponential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Zilman1">[99]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-DowlingM1">[103]</xref>.</p>
<p>In our mathematical model we assumed that lymphocytes exiting LNs appear instantaneously in the blood. This is clearly a simplification since lymphocytes must travel with lymph via lymphatic ducts before they enter circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g001">Figure 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>). We were unable to find direct estimates of the time of lymphocyte migration via right lymphatic or thoracic ducts in rats. However, knowledge of the basic dimensions of the ducts and the rate at which lymph can be collected during thoracic duct cannulation can be used to make a reasonable estimate. The length of the thoracic duct varies with the weight of the rat between 3 and 7 cm [104, and unpublished observations of Michael D. Karlstad UT Medical Center]; the largest duct we found was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cm (M.D. Karlstad). The internal diameter of the thoracic duct varies from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to 1 mm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-GashevA1">[105]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Li1">[106]</xref>, and this makes the internal volume of the thoracic duct to be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cm<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mm. Finally, the rate of lymph flow during thoracic duct cannulation in rats varies between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to 10 ml per hour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-GowansJ1">[107]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Ionac1">[108]</xref>. Assuming that lymphocytes in the thoracic duct move with the lymph, the average residence time of lymphocytes in the thoracic duct is then <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> min for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ml/h. These calculations suggest that migration via the thoracic duct (and likely via the right lymphatic duct) is extremely rapid as compared to migration via lymph nodes, and this supports our assumption that TDLs exiting LNs enter the circulation nearly instantaneously.</p>
<p>Using our mathematical model we can predict the long term distribution of labeled TDLs in different murine organs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t002">Table 2</xref>). We predict that at the steady state 2.6% of lymphocytes will be found in the blood, 21% in the spleen, and 65% in the LNs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t002">Table 2:column</xref> 2). This is in perfect agreement with actual observations at 24 hours post transfer [65 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g003">Figure 3</xref>]. The model also can be used to predict how changes in the rates of migration of lymphocytes to lymphoid or nonlymphoid tissues (or changes in residence time) may influence the distribution of lymphocytes in the body (columns 3–5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g006">Figures 6</xref>–8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003586.s004">Text S1</xref>). The analysis demonstrates that increasing the average residence time of lymphocytes in the lung to only 9 minutes will result in predominant accumulation of TDLs in the lung vasculature. This result suggests that accumulation of lymphocytes in the lung in some (e.g., inflammatory) conditions may simply result from a slightly longer residence time of lymphocytes in the lung capillaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Frost1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJ1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SprentJ1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-BoltonD1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Odoardi1">[109]</xref>. Indeed, recent work suggested that activated CD8 T cells may accumulate in the lung before traveling to the site of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Odoardi1">[109]</xref>. Such accumulation can be simply due to increased residence time in the vasculature of the lung and not because of directed migration of activated lymphocytes to the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-AndersonK1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Similarly, blocking entrance of lymphocytes into LNs or egress of lymphocytes from LNs will dramatically change composition of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and circulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003586-t002">Table 2:columns</xref> 4 and 5). Our simulations suggest that blocking entrance of lymphocytes into LNs has the major influence on the number of lymphocytes in nonlymphoid organs such as lung and liver and blocking exit of lymphocytes from LNs leads to only a moderate increase in lymphocyte numbers in LNs. This is in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-HarpJR1">[110]</xref>.</p>
<p>There are a number of potential limitations with the experimental data of Smith &amp; Ford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref> and the assumptions made in our mathematical model. First, TDLs in these experiments were labeled with a radioactive label and after cell transfer, radioactivity from a given tissue was used as an indication of the percent of the initially transferred TDLs. Previous studies have established that in most cases labeling with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>Cr does not induce excessive cell mortality and does not strongly influence their migration patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann2">[6]</xref>, . Furthermore, dying cells tend to accumulate in the liver and kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann2">[6]</xref> and this has been often used to judge the quality of preparation of labeled cells. Measuring radioactivity from a relatively intact tissue has its advantages in comparison with flow cytometry from tissue-derived single cell suspensions since the former method does not involve any cell loss. Recently it has been shown that preparation of single cell suspensions from peripheral tissues may be associated with severe (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003586.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) loss of memory T lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Masopust2">[112]</xref>.</p>
<p>Second, in experimental data of Smith &amp; Ford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref>, the precise location of transferred lymphocytes within a given tissue is not known. Estimation of the rates of lymphocyte migration to parenchymal tissues of the lung and liver will require additional levels of experimental data, e.g., measurement of cells in the vasculature vs. parenchymal tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Galkina1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-TeijaroJ1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Jennrich1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-AndersonK1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Third, in our model we assumed that lymphocytes enter LNs and PPs via the blood. It is well known that lymphocytes can leave the circulation into tissues and then accumulate in lymph nodes via afferent lymphatics. It appears, however, that to describe these experimental data there was no need to make this extra assumption although we cannot exclude that some labeled TDLs did enter lymph nodes and Peyer's patches via the afferent lymph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Frster1">[72]</xref>. How lymphocyte migration to lymph nodes via afferent lymph may influence parameter estimates for lymphocyte recirculation kinetics remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Fourth, our mathematical modeling only provides estimates of migration of lymphocytes via a collection of lymph nodes or Peyer's patches and not transit times via individual nodes. This is because accumulation and loss of labeled cells in individual lymph nodes was not available in the original publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref>. Experimental data that track migration of labeled cells in individual lymph nodes will be important to determine if lymphocytes migrate at different rates via lymph nodes that are organized in chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Kawashima1">[68]</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, cellular composition of the thoracic duct lymphocytes used by Smith &amp; Ford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithM1">[65]</xref> is not entirely clear. Previous work established that in naive animals, TDLs consist of mainly naive B and T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann4">[40]</xref>, and in rats, T to B cell ratio in TDL suspensions are 70%/30% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithME1">[100]</xref>. Because naive T cells appear to migrate faster from the blood to lymph as compared to naive B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Westermann4">[40]</xref>, and CD4 T cells may have a shorter residence time in LNs than CD8 T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MandlJ1">[46]</xref>, a passage via an intermediate host may have led to enrichment of naive CD4 T cells in the population of TDLs used in migration experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003586-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, it was noted that passaging of TDLs via an intermediate host increases the relative abundance of T cells in the thoracic duct lymph from 70% to 80–85% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithME1">[100]</xref>. Thus, our results are most likely applicable to migration kinetics of naive T cells (and possibly naive CD4 T cells).</p>
<p>Given our prediction that the distribution of residence times of lymphocytes in lymph nodes is unlikely to be exponential, different approaches could be used to model lymphocyte migration. We opted for a simpler approach using ordinary differential equations with several sub-compartments for lymph nodes. We should stress, however, that such subcompartments need not represent actual physiological entities. Rather they should be viewed as a mathematical method to allow for non-exponentially distributed residence times of lymphocytes in tissues. An alternative approach may involve the use of standard structured population models which, however, often involve more parameters and are more difficult to fit to experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-DowlingM1">[103]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Diekmann1">[113]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our model predictions on the hierarchy of lymphocyte recirculation kinetics in the whole organism are highly robust. We have fitted several alternative models to the migration data and all of these fits resulted in quantitatively similar parameter estimates (results not shown). We believe that this result comes from the strong constrains put in our model by the physiology of lymphocyte recirculation in rats and by experimental data. Yet, the average residence time of lymphocytes in the LNs and PPs did depend on the number of sub-compartments in these lymphoid tissues which is defined by the shape parameter of the gamma distribution (results not shown). Development of more realistic models of lymphocyte migration via lymph nodes should improve our estimates of the average residence time in these secondary lymphoid tissues.</p>
<p>Our analysis illustrates the power of mathematical modeling in quantifying lymphocyte migration kinetics, raises a number of important questions, and opens up avenues for future research. It is unclear if our results hold for lymphocytes isolated from other tissues such as blood, bone marrow, spleen, lung, or different LNs. Previous work suggested minimal differences in accumulation of lymphocytes isolated from the thoracic duct, LNs, or spleen in different lymphoid tissues at 24 hours after cell transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SmithME1">[100]</xref> but more research is needed. Furthermore, quantitative estimates of the rates of migration of different types of lymphocytes (B vs. T cells) or different subsets of lymphocytes (naive/memory/effector) to spleen or nonlymphoid organs such as gut or skin are missing. There is now evidence for memory T cells residing in many nonlymphoid tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-WakimL1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Masopust1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Gebhardt1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Jiang1">[15]</xref> including resident T cells in LNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-SchenkelJ1">[114]</xref>. There is yet no direct evidence for spleen-resident lymphocytes. It also remains unclear whether tissue-resident T cells are true residents or they simply have a relatively long residence time in a given tissue. We now know that other cells such as dendritic cells and CD4 T cells are able to control entrance of lymphocytes into LNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Kumamoto1">[93]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-MoussionC1">[115]</xref>. It remains to be determined whether lymphocyte entrance into and more importantly exit from nonlymphoid tissues is similarly controlled by immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003586-Jennrich1">[22]</xref>. Our study illustrates that transfer lymphocytes from syngenic animals and recording the percent/number of lymphocytes in multiple organs/tissues at different times after transfer is a powerful method to study lymphocyte migration patterns especially when it is combined with mathematical modeling.</p>
