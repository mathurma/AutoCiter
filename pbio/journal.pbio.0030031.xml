				<article-title>Unique Double-Barreled Enzyme Makes Methionine the Hard Way</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (MetE) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to <sc>L-</sc>homocysteine (Hcy) without using an intermediate methyl carrier. Although MetE displays no detectable sequence homology with cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MetH), both enzymes require zinc for activation and binding of Hcy. Crystallographic analyses of MetE from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. maritima</named-content> reveal an unusual dual-barrel structure in which the active site lies between the tops of the two (βα)<sub>8</sub> barrels. The fold of the N-terminal barrel confirms that it has evolved from the C-terminal polypeptide by gene duplication; comparisons of the barrels provide an intriguing example of homologous domain evolution in which binding sites are obliterated. The C-terminal barrel incorporates the zinc ion that binds and activates Hcy. The zinc-binding site in MetE is distinguished from the (Cys)<sub>3</sub>Zn site in the related enzymes, MetH and betaine–homocysteine methyltransferase, by its position in the barrel and by the metal ligands, which are histidine, cysteine, glutamate, and cysteine in the resting form of MetE. Hcy associates at the face of the metal opposite glutamate, which moves away from the zinc in the binary E·Hcy complex. The folate substrate is not intimately associated with the N-terminal barrel; instead, elements from both barrels contribute binding determinants in a binary complex in which the folate substrate is incorrectly oriented for methyl transfer. Atypical locations of the Hcy and folate sites in the C-terminal barrel presumably permit direct interaction of the substrates in a ternary complex. Structures of the binary substrate complexes imply that rearrangement of folate, perhaps accompanied by domain rearrangement, must occur before formation of a ternary complex that is competent for methyl transfer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Methionine synthases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from N5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate) to <sc>L</sc>-homocysteine (Hcy), the terminal step in the biosynthesis of methionine. Two apparently unrelated families of proteins catalyze this reaction: cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MetH; EC 2.1.1.13) and cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (MetE; 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate–homocysteine methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.14) Organisms that synthesize or transport B<sub>12</sub> encode the cobalamin-dependent enzyme whereas organisms that cannot obtain B<sub>12</sub> encode only the cobalamin-independent enzyme. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> and many other species of bacteria express both enzymes, but mammals utilize only cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase while plants and yeasts utilize only the cobalamin-independent enzyme.</p>
      <p>MetH and MetE both face the same mechanistic challenge. They must catalyze the transfer of a very poor leaving group from the tertiary amine, CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate, to a relatively poor nucleophile, the sulfur of Hcy. MetH facilitates this transfer by using cobalamin as an intermediate methyl carrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b01">1</xref>]. Cobalamin accepts a methyl group from CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate at one active site and donates it to Hcy at a second site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b02">2</xref>]. In contrast, MetE appears to catalyze the direct transfer of the methyl group from CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate to Hcy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b03">3</xref>]. This latter strategy seems to offer a less satisfactory answer to the mechanistic problems: measured k<sub>cat</sub> values for MetE are smaller than those for MetH by a factor of approximately 50–100.</p>
      <p>MetE and MetH both activate Hcy by binding the thiolate form of the substrate to Zn<sup>+2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b04">4</xref>]. A similar strategy for alkylation of thiol groups is employed in protein farnesyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b05">5</xref>], geranylgeranyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b06">6</xref>], methanol:CoM methyltransferase (MtaA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b07">7</xref>], the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> DNA repair Ada protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b08">8</xref>], and betaine–Hcy methyltransferase (BHMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b09">9</xref>]. However, the sets of zinc ligands and the structures that house the zinc-binding sites are not conserved within this functional family. In particular, the metal ligands and their positions in the sequence are not the same in MetH and MetE. Three cysteines bind the essential zinc in MetH; the first cysteine ligand resides at the end of strand 6 of a (βα)<sub>8</sub> barrel, and the remaining vicinal cysteine ligands follow strand 8. A histidine and two cysteines have been identified as metal ligands in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> MetE by a combination of mutagenesis experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b11">11</xref>] and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b12">12</xref>]. The relative positions of these residues in the sequence led to the prediction that in a (βα)<sub>8</sub> MetE barrel the histidine and cysteine ligands would reside at the ends of strands 5 and 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b04">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>In contrast, the sequences of MetE enzymes give few if any clues to the strategy for binding and activation of folate by MetE. Thus, the mode of folate binding is a key question to be addressed by structure analysis. In both MetE and MetH, activation of the leaving group is thought to involve the protonation of CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate in a ternary complex, E·Hcy·CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate in MetE, or E·cob(I)alamin·CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate in MetH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b04">4</xref>]. However, the residues that may facilitate protonation have not been identified for either enzyme.</p>
      <p>MetE appears to have evolved through gene duplication of a sequence encoding a domain of approximately 340 residues that binds and activates Hcy. Within the family of MetE enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the N- and C-terminal halves exhibit significant sequence homology. The C-terminal half is more highly conserved than the N-terminal half and has homologs in archae and elsewhere. Among these thiol methyltransferases are several enzymes that are approximately half the size of MetE and utilize corrinoid proteins, rather than folates, as methyl donors. Taken together, these observations suggested that the MetE gene arose as the result of a primordial gene duplication event followed by loss of zinc- and Hcy-binding determinants from the duplicated sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b11">11</xref>]. If this hypothesis is correct, the two halves of the MetE sequence should display structural homology, and the N-terminal domain should be more closely related to the C-terminal domain than to any other protein in the database.</p>

      <p>To determine how MetE has assembled an active site for catalysis of direct methyl transfer from CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate to Hcy, we have solved the crystal structure of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Thermotoga maritima</named-content> MetE at 2.0 Å resolution, along with structures of the binary substrate complexes with Hcy and folate. Difficulties in crystallization of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> enzyme were circumvented by analyzing the MetE from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. maritima</named-content>. This thermophilic bacterium encodes orthologs of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> MetH and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> MetE. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. maritima</named-content> MetE (TM1286) is 41% identical to the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> enzyme and is only 19 residues shorter than <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> MetE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g001">Figure 1</xref>), making it an excellent prototype for the MetE family. MetE comprises two (βα)<sub>8</sub> barrels. To our knowledge, it is the first example of a dual-(βα)<sub>8</sub> barrel enzyme in which the active site is located between barrels arranged in a head-to-head orientation. MetE also provides a rare example of a catalytic zinc site in which four residues serve as metal ligands. Repetition of features within the structure supports the idea that MetE evolved through gene duplication of a primordial zinc/Hcy (βα)<sub>8</sub> barrel.</p>

            <p>(A) MetE folds into two (βα)<sub>8</sub> barrels. The N-terminal barrel (aqua) is joined to the C-terminal barrel (yellow) by a 35-residue inter-domain linker (gray) that spans 65 Å. Except for the α1 helix (at the right), the linker residues are in extended conformations. This view is along the approximate 2-fold axis that relates the two barrels. The drawing is based on coordinates for zinc-replete MetE in complex with CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030031-t001">Table 1</xref>). The zinc ligands, zinc, and CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate are shown in ball-and-stick representation. This figure and all subsequent figures were prepared using RIBBONS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b43">43</xref>].

            <p>(B) A side-by-side view of the barrels of MetE, arranged to show the similarities of the β–α loop extensions. Major extensions that follow the first four β strands of the barrels are shown in cyan and gold for the N-terminal and C-terminal barrels, respectively. The drawing is based on coordinates for the zinc-replete binary complex with folate (not shown). The active site is located in the C-terminal barrel (on the right) between the extra-barrel β hairpin of the β2–α2 loop and the C-termini of the barrel strands. Zinc is gray and the zinc ligands, His618, Cys620, Glu642, and Cys704, are shown in ball-and-stick mode.</p>

        <p>In (βα)<sub>8</sub> (triose phosphate isomerase [TIM]) barrel enzymes, the active site is usually located near the C-termini of the inner barrel strands, with catalytic residues contributed by the β–α segments (loops) that join these strands to the outer helices. These barrels are topologically polar with their “tops” decorated by insertions that extend the β–α loop segments. MetE is the first example of a dual-(βα)<sub>8</sub> barrel in which the decorated tops of the two barrels face each other to form a single active site that lies between the domains. A deep cleft between the barrels permits entry of the substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). As a result of the arrangement of the barrel domains, residues 352–386 of the inter-barrel linker must span approximately 65 Å to connect the bottoms of the two barrels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p>
        <p>The N- and C-terminal barrels share a number of strikingly similar features that provide structural evidence for gene duplication. Both barrels incorporate long extensions in the first four β–α loops but, with the exception of α8AF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), lack insertions in the last four loops. A pseudo 2-fold axis superimposes these similar extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The helical extension at the start of β1–α1, α1AH, augments the side of the C-terminal barrel and is repeated in the N-terminal barrel. The β2–α2 loops that appear in both barrels are the longest extensions in the structure, and we refer to them as the “long hairpin loops.” In the C-terminal barrel that binds Hcy and Zn<sup>+2</sup>, the long β2–α2 loop begins with helix α2AH and then forms an antiparallel excursion that harbors a number of conserved residues, some of which are involved in binding folate. The β3–α3 loops both include a short helix, α3A, that carries folate-binding determinants in the Hcy (C-terminal) barrel. The β4–α4A segments of both barrels incorporate a conserved sequence, identified by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g001">Figure 1</xref>. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> MetE, this sequence, Gln-Ile-Asp-Glu-Pro-Ala, is identical in both barrels.</p>
        <p>Despite the pseudosymmetry that relates the β–α loops of the two barrels, there are significant differences in the sequences and conformations of these connecting loops that distinguish the functional roles of the two barrels. The major binding determinants for the folate substrate lie primarily in the second, third, and fourth β–α loops of the C-terminal barrel. The equivalent binding site in the duplicated N-terminal barrel has been obliterated. Although the long β2–α2 hairpin of the N-terminal barrel resembles the corresponding hairpin of the C-terminal (Hcy) barrel, the potential binding groove for the folate tail is closed by extensive hydrophobic contacts between α1AF, α1F, and α2CF and by interaction with the long hairpin of the C-terminal barrel. The positioning the long β2 hairpin significantly closer to the barrel top than in the C-terminal barrel occludes the pterin-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Several other adaptations enhance the barrel–barrel interface and appear to influence the relative orientations of the barrels. The β8–α8 loop containing helix α8AF is 16 residues longer than the corresponding loop in the C-terminal domain and makes numerous inter-barrel contacts. Likewise, loop β4–α4 in the C-terminal domain is extended by six residues, increasing contacts with the N-terminal barrel. The single-domain archaeal Hcy methyltransferases that are homologous to the C-terminal domain are missing these six residues, supporting the notion that this insert evolved to enlarge the inter-domain interface.</p>

        <title>The Zinc Site</title>
        <p>The zinc-binding site of MetE is distinguished from most catalytic zinc sites by the presence of four protein ligands to zinc. Mutagenesis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> MetE had previously shown that zinc is bound by a histidine and two cysteines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b11">11</xref>] that are equivalent to residues His618, Cys620, and Cys704 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. maritima</named-content> MetE. EXAFS studies of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> enzyme indicated a fourth oxygen or nitrogen coordinated to zinc that seemed likely to be a water oxygen. However, the structure of zinc-replete enzyme with folate bound (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030031-t001">Table 1</xref>) clearly reveals the presence of a fourth protein ligand to zinc. A carboxylate oxygen of the invariant Glu642, which had not previously been identified as a metal ligand, is coordinated to zinc.</p>
        <p>In the zinc-replete complexes of MetE with folate that provide resting-state structures of the zinc site, the metal–ligand cluster adopts tetrahedral geometry. EXAFS measurements on substrate-free <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> MetE are also consistent with tetrahedral coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b11">11</xref>] with bond lengths of 2.31 Å for two Zn–S bonds and 2.04 Å for two nitrogen or oxygen ligands. The observed Zn–S bond lengths in our structure are 2.30 Å, Zn–N is 2.07 Å, and Zn–O is 2.14 Å, in good agreement with the EXAFS measurements.</p>
        <p>The residues that bind zinc are located near the ends of barrel strands 5, 6, and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g003">Figure 3</xref>). His618 is the C-terminal residue of β5 and Cys620 is located on the following β–α loop. Glu642 is at the C-terminus of β6, and Cys704 resides on the loop following strand β8. The β–α loops that contain the two cysteine residues are drawn together to form the metal-binding site, distorting the barrel (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">see Discussion</xref>).</p>

The amino group of Hcy is bound by hydrogen bonds to Asp577, Glu462, and the backbone carbonyl of Ile409; the Hcy carboxyl group interacts with the backbone amide and side chain hydroxyl of Ser411.

Upon Hcy binding, zinc and His618 move away from Glu642 and closer to Hcy, and the zinc site adopts trigonal bipyramidal geometry with three strong equatorial ligands (Zn–N<sub>His618</sub>, 2.07 Å; Zn–S<sub>Cys620</sub>, 2.23 Å; Zn–S<sub>Cys704</sub>, 2.24 Å) and two distant axial ligands (Zn–O<sub>Glu642</sub>, 2.90 Å; Zn–S<sub>Hcy,</sub> 3.13 Å).

        <p>Hcy binding induces significant changes at the metal site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Binding of the substrate sulfur to zinc does not proceed by a simple dissociative reaction in which sulfur is substituted for the oxygen of Glu642. Instead, Hcy approaches the metal ion from the side opposite the Glu642 ligand. This mode of association is unusual; in most catalytic zinc sites the incoming substrate replaces a dissociable fourth ligand without inversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b13">13</xref>]. In the structure of the binary complex determined at pH 5.2, displacement of Glu642 and inversion at Zn<sup>+2</sup> are incomplete. Zinc coordination changes from tetrahedral to distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>), and the substrate sulfur and glutamate oxygen both exhibit unusually long ligand–metal distances: 3.15 Å and 2.9 Å for Zn–S and Zn–O, respectively. Comparison with the zinc-replete complex with folate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) shows that zinc and His618 have moved 0.76 Å and 0.98 Å toward the substrate while Cys620, Glu642, and Cys704 remain essentially fixed. The Zn–S(Cys) and Zn–N distances are not significantly altered, but the zinc and these three ligands become more nearly coplanar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Complete inversion would result in geometry resembling the Hcy complex of MetH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p>
        <p>The geometry at the metal site in the Hcy complex has been confirmed by omit refinement and by tests with restrained models. The density around the zinc atom in omit maps is well resolved from Hcy but continuous with that of the cysteine ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>D), consistent with a Zn–Hcy distance that is significantly longer than the Zn–Cys bond distances. Imposing tetrahedral restraints in refinements with Hcy as the fourth ligand results in large difference Fourier peaks that also indicate a long Zn–Hcy distance.</p>
        <p>Cysteinyl tRNA-synthetase incorporates an active-site zinc with the same set of ligands as MetE and provides a precedent for an inversion at the metal center induced by substrate binding. Cysteinyl tRNA-synthetase uses this zinc ion not for catalysis, but to discriminate against serine, exploiting the strong zinc-thiolate interaction with its substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b15">15</xref>]. In the absence of substrate the zinc site displays geometry that is intermediate between tetrahedral and trigonal bipyramidal. As in MetE, the cysteine substrate binds opposite a glutamate residue and does not displace the glutamate ligand directly. Upon cysteine binding, zinc moves away from glutamate and forms a 2.5 Å bond to cysteine.</p>

        <title>Folate Binary Complex</title>
        <p>Structures of CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate bound to MetE from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. maritima</named-content> have been determined in both the reduced (zinc-replete) enzyme and the oxidized (disulfide-bonded) form (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0030031-t001">Table 1</xref>). CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate is bound in identical fashion in both structures. The novel feature of these structures is that the MetE·folate complex fails to comply with the classic picture of substrate binding in a TIM barrel. The folate substrate binds in a deep cleft between the two barrels, with its glutamate tail accommodated by a groove in the enzyme surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The pterin is displaced from the top of the N-terminal barrel, and simultaneously shifted away from the axis of the C-terminal barrel that binds zinc and Hcy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). It is thus inappropriate to call the N-terminal barrel the “folate-binding domain.” An animation, in which <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g005">Figure 5</xref> is rotated about its vertical axis, provides a more complete view of the structure and its bound ligands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>The pterin ring of CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate is positioned by stacking and by hydrogen bonding with conserved residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Glu583 makes a bidentate interaction with the 2-NH<sub>2</sub> and N3 groups of CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate, an arrangement found in several other folate-binding sites. Interaction of N3 with an acidic group has been shown to be important for catalytic activity in dihydrofolate reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b16">16</xref>], thymidylate synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b17">17</xref>], and MetH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b18">18</xref>]. In the binary complexes with MetE that we report here, the pterin ring of the folate is stacked against Trp539, Lys104 hydrogen bonds to O4, and the folate N5 is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule. However the N8 and N1 positions of the pterin are exposed to solvent.</p>
        <p>The subsite that binds the glutamate tail is a groove lined by conserved basic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Arg15, Lys18, Arg493, and Arg496 interact with the first glutamyl residue, which is the only one of the three γ-linked glutamate residues that is ordered in the binary complex. Weak binding of the other tail residues is surprising for an enzyme that exhibits an absolute requirement for polyglutamylated folate, but glutamate tails have displayed disorder in other structures where they also contribute to strength of binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b19">19</xref>].</p>
        <p>The orientation of bound folate in the binary complexes does not allow transfer of the methyl group to Hcy. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g005">Figure 5</xref>, the N5-methyl carbon faces away from zinc and Hcy; it is 11 Å from the sulfur of Hcy when the binary complexes are superimposed. A rotation about the folate N10–C4′ dihedral angle, with the interactions of the <italic>para</italic>-amino benzoyl moiety and glutamate acting to anchor the substrate, would position the methyl group correctly with respect to Hcy, decreasing the distance between groups that react to 6.0 Å. This distance is still long, and additional protein or substrate rearrangements would be necessary to close the gap between the sulfur of Hcy and the methyl carbon. An alternative route to a ternary complex that supports methyl transfer would be complete dissociation and reassociation of the CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate. However, because so many interactions with conserved residues are observed in this binary complex, it seems likely to represent an initial intermediate rather than a dead-end complex (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">see Discussion</xref>).</p>

        <title>The <sup>467</sup>Asp-Met-Val Sequence Mediates Interaction between the Substrate-Binding Sites</title>
        <p>One of the fascinating features of the binary substrate complexes is the evidence for communication between the substrate-binding sites, mediated by the invariant <sup>467</sup>Asp-Met-Val (DMV) sequence, which forms the N-terminal turn of helix α2AH. When Hcy binds, the side chain of Met468 alters its position in concert with backbone displacements of the aspartic acid and methionine residues that start the helix. Comparison of the substrate-free structure with the Hcy binary complex shows how the DMV region moves toward the zinc center when Hcy binds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These changes in turn affect the interactions and orientation of Trp539, favoring the conformation in which Trp539 can stack against the pterin ring.

        <p>In the binary complex with CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate, the DMV loop is also recruited to the position it occupies when Hcy is bound. The changes that are induced by binding of folate are reproduced in the complex of folate with the oxidized enzyme. Thus, binding of either substrate favors a conformation that would be expected to increase the affinity of MetE for the other substrate. These small but significant conformation changes observed in the binary complexes precede larger rearrangements that must be induced by binding of both substrates to form a competent ternary complex. Cooperativity in substrate binding could increase the concentrations of the ternary complex and thereby increase turnover in a system that is already plagued by slow chemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b04">4</xref>].</p>

In the complexes of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> MetE with Hcy or methionine, the distances between zinc and substrate or product sulfur are long, as is the case in the Hcy complex of MetE from <italic>T. maritima,</italic> but water rather than glutamate has been assigned as the ligand opposite to Hcy or Met. In contrast, the electron density in omit maps of the Hcy complex of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. maritima</named-content> MetE shows no evidence for a water intervening between glutamate and zinc (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). In substrate-free <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> MetE, the metal–ligand bonds are all very long and the geometry is highly distorted, suggesting some disordering or partial oxidation of the metal site under the conditions used for crystallization.</p>

Although the occupancy of the reduced folate appears to be low, it is estimated that the methyl group of the CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>5</sub> is about 7 Å from the sulfur of Hcy, too distant for transfer to Hcy. Thus, both structure analyses suggest that additional conformation changes must occur to form a reactive ternary complex.</p>

These homologous barrels both bind the CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate substrate at the top of the folate barrel and use similar interactions with residues contributed by the C-termini of the inner barrel strands. In MetE, CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate is displaced from the N-terminal barrel and bound primarily by residues in the long extra-barrel β hairpin of the C-terminal Hcy domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g002">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g005">5</xref>).

        <p>Major differences in the connecting loops β1–α1 and β8–α8 displace the zinc and Hcy sites in MetE relative to MetH by approximately 6 Å so that the sulfur of Hcy is no longer on the barrel axis but is shifted toward one wall of the barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The altered positions of the ligands and the binding of zinc by Glu642 lead to inversion of the zinc center relative to its configuration in MetH. Displacement of the Zn<sup>+2</sup>/Hcy site and the unusual mode of folate binding seem to have evolved to allow methyl transfer in a ternary E·Hcy·CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate complex.</p>
        <p>Despite the translation and inversion of the metal and its ligands, the orientation and local interactions of Hcy are almost identical in MetE and MetH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Both enzymes use conserved carboxylate residues to interact with the amino group of Hcy, forming salt bridges (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In both MetH and BHMT, the carboxyl group of Hcy is bound by a pair of backbone amides located at the beginning of the β1–α1 extension. In MetE the corresponding interactions of COO<sup>−</sup> are made by the backbone amide and the side chain hydroxyl of Ser411, again located on the extension following β1.</p>
        <p>Curiously, it appears that distortions of the barrel strands and connecting loops need not be undone when metal binding is lost through evolution. Distortions of the barrel strands and their downstream loops are retained in the N-terminal barrel of MetE despite loss of metal and Hcy binding, and similar distortions were first observed in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b22">22</xref>], which is also not a metalloenzyme. Despite the lack of detectable sequence homology, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase is the closest structural relative of the Hcy domain of MetE in the current protein database: alignment using DALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b23">23</xref>] matches the two folds with a similarity score that is higher than that for the Hcy barrels from MetE and MetH. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase may have evolved from a Zn<sup>+2</sup>/Hcy barrel, despite the fact that it is no longer a zinc-dependent thiol alkyltransferase.</p>

        <title>Substrate Binding and Activation: Inferences from the Structures</title>
        <p>In the structure of the MetE·Hcy complex, the zinc site adopts distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry with long bonds from the metal ion to glutamate and Hcy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, EXAFS measurements on the Se–Hcy complex of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> MetE at pH 7.2 are best fit to a tetrahedral ligand environment with two sulfurs (2.33 Å), one nitrogen or oxygen (2.02 Å), and one selenium (2.433 Å), in which the longer Zn–Se distance reflects the increased radius of selenium relative to sulfur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b03">3</xref>]. EXAFS studies of the related methyltransferase MT2-A, which has the same set of zinc ligands as MetE, also indicate tetrahedral geometry in the binary complex with coenzyme M (2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b07">7</xref>]. Both of these studies concluded that the geometry at zinc does not change appreciably upon binding of the thiolate substrate.</p>
        <p>Because the crystals of the Hcy binary complex of MetE were equilibrated at pH 5.2, it is possible that Hcy may be protonated in the X-ray structure. Thus, the long S–Zn bond and partial inversion at zinc might be explained by the relatively weak interaction between the thiol and the metal ion, as documented for thiol and thioether ligands in model compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b26">26</xref>]. X-ray studies of Hcy binding at neutral pH and EXAFS measurements at lower pH will be necessary to determine whether pH is a key parameter that affects the metal–ligand geometry. It is possible that complete inversion of zinc geometry will be observed in the structure of the MetE·Hcy complex at neutral pH.</p>
        <p>A long Zn–S<sup>−</sup> bond may be functionally important. It has been suggested that a long bond and/or distorted geometry would optimize the reactivity of zinc-dependent thiol alkyltranferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b27">27</xref>] by increasing the charge on the thiolate sulfur, and would avoid trapping of a lower-energy tetrahedral species. Since zinc is known to have flexible coordination geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b28">28</xref>], a five-coordinate state seems plausible, and the observed structure of MetE·Hcy may indeed afford a glimpse of an intermediate or transition-like state that is poised to attack the N5 methyl group of the folate substrate.</p>
        <p>The motion of Zn<sup>+2</sup> that accompanies Hcy binding to MetE is unique among the Hcy methyltransferases with known structures. There is no evidence for inversion of configuration at zinc in MetH, and inversion is precluded in BHMT, where a leucine occupies the position analogous Glu642 of MetE. Zinc motion provides a novel way to alter the distribution of charge among the zinc and its ligands, thereby modulating thiolate reactivity. The effects on the electronic structure could be larger than those resulting from the changes in bond lengths observed in other zinc-dependent alkyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b30">30</xref>]. By analogy with a proposal for the reaction cycle of protein farnesyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b30">30</xref>], reassociation of Glu642 could promote dissociation of the methionine product following methyl transfer.</p>
        <p>An unexpected feature of the MetE structures is the binding mode of CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate, with the pterin ring incorrectly oriented for methyl transfer. It is possible that folate binds initially in this manner to avoid blocking access to the Hcy binding site, which lies between zinc and CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate. Space-filling models show that the Hcy-binding site remains accessible in the MetE·CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate binary complex. The observed binding mode thus permits random addition of substrates but does not rule out a kinetically preferred order of binding.</p>
        <p>In both MetH and MetE, protonation of methyltetrahydrofolate is thought to occur in the ternary complexes but not in the binary folate complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b04">4</xref>]. The immediate proton donor has not yet been identified by enzymatic or biochemical studies of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> MetE. Formation of the binary Hcy complex results in release of a proton to solvent (Z. S. Zhou and R. G. Matthews, unpublished data). Thus Hcy is not a likely proton donor. It is more likely that an active-site residue may serve as an acid catalyst. Structures of the binary complexes do not implicate a particular residue as a general acid catalyst, but suggest possible candidates. His111 could serve as a proton donor through water if protonation were to occur before folate rearrangement. His672, part of a conserved <sup>670</sup>Asp-Ile-His-Ser-Pro sequence, or Asp467, located in the DMV loop, may be positioned to serve as donors if protonation occurs after folate rearrangement. All three of these candidate residues are invariant in multiple sequence alignments.</p>

        <title>Gene Duplication of a Sequence Encoding the Hcy Barrel</title>
        <p>Earlier comparisons of sequences had suggested that MetE evolved by gene duplication. The two domains of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> MetE share a conserved Gln-Ile-Asp-Glu-Pro-Ala repeat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b31">31</xref>], and the sequences display 39% identity (50% similarity) within the regions now seen to span β3 to α4A of the two barrels. The pseudosymmetry of the structural features decorating the barrels provides compelling evidence for a close relationship between the two halves of MetE, verifying the inferences based on sequence alignments. The cores of (βα)<sub>8</sub> barrels, though they display characteristic distortions and can be classified into subgroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b32">32</xref>], do not provide as strong evidence for relatedness as do the similarities of regions inserted in intervening loops. It is difficult to ascertain whether the regions responsible for folate binding were inserted before or after gene duplication. The long β2–α2 loop in the N-terminal barrel and corresponding sequences in archaeal relatives of MetE favor the notion that precursors of folate-binding segments were present before duplication. In any case, folate-binding determinants have developed or been retained primarily in the C-terminal Hcy barrel but not in its N-terminal replicate.</p>
        <p>The idea that the zinc/Hcy barrel is the ancestral fold is based on several lines of evidence. This barrel shows significant structural homology to a broad family of zinc-dependent thiol methyltransferases, including not only MetH and BHMT but also the single-domain archaeal transferase enzymes that react with methylcobalamin. Indeed it seems likely that the three enzymes that convert Hcy to methionine, MetE, MetH, and BHMT, are all descended from a primordial zinc/Hcy barrel. In contrast, DALI searches that assess structural similarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b23">23</xref>] reveal that the N-terminal barrel is more similar to the C-terminal barrel of MetE than to any other known protein, suggesting that its immediate precursor is the Hcy barrel of MetE.</p>
        <p>Gene duplication of a Zn<sup>+2</sup>/Hcy barrel would have replicated the sites that bind Zn<sup>+2</sup> and Hcy, but these sites have been disabled in the N-terminal barrel of contemporary MetE. Disruption of zinc and Hcy binding is effected by both residue mutations and backbone conformational changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030031-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Mutation of the equivalent of Cys620 in the Hcy barrel to Tyr232 leads to stacking with the adjacent Tyr233 (phenylalanine in most MetE sequences) and results in a major backbone conformational change. The hydroxyl group of the Tyr232 forms a hydrogen bond to Asn199 of the conserved Leu-Val-Asn-Glu-Pro-Ala sequence at the β4–α4 loop and thus removes a crucial Hcy-binding determinant. Although Cys309, the equivalent of Cys704 of the C-terminal barrel, is retained in most MetE sequences, mutation of the other zinc ligands and many of the Hcy-binding residues leads to a complete overhaul of the binding site for Hcy.</p>

The competent Zn/Hcy site from the C-terminal barrel is at the left; the remodeled site from the N-terminal barrel is at the right. Important substitutions that disable Hcy and zinc binding are Trp146, Phe230, Tyr232, and Asp253 (see text).</p>

        <title>Why Is a Second Barrel Recruited for a Ternary Complex Mechanism?</title>
        <p>Although an entire barrel domain is recruited to elicit direct methyl transfer from folate to Hcy, the structure reveals that the functional groups of this domain are mostly disabled. The binding determinants and potential catalytic residues are located primarily in extensions and excursions of the C-terminal Zn<sup>+2</sup>/Hcy barrel rather than in the “new” N-terminal domain. Duplication and divergence of an entire barrel is an elaborate strategy to accommodate a second relatively large substrate at a single active site, and MetE provides the first instance of the face-to-face barrel construction that is required to build such an active site. A more common strategy to accommodate a ternary complex is exemplified by the related Hcy methyltransferase, BHMT. In this enzyme the site for the rather small second substrate, betaine, is constructed in part from β–α barrel extensions and in part from a dimerization arm that is appended to the barrel and contributes to the active site of the partner chain of the functional dimer.</p>
        <p>The N-terminal domain of MetE may nevertheless be essential for ternary complex formation and catalysis. In the family of thiol alkyltransferases, quenching of opposite charges on Hcy and the alkyl donor is believed to drive the reactions, and a hydrophobic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b33">33</xref>] and desolvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b34">34</xref>] of reactants may be critical for reactivity. Rearrangement of folate to form a viable ternary complex may be accompanied by rearrangement or closure of domains around the substrate-binding cleft that would reposition key residues and isolate the active site from solvent. Hcy binding is accompanied by a contraction of the top of the C-terminal barrel that alters the relative positions of the N- and C-terminal barrels. This small domain shift clearly gives hints of inter-domain flexibility. On the other hand, the commissioning of the N-terminal domain may reflect an evolutionary strategy in which gene duplication is utilized as the most facile way to recruit additional sequences. Structures of ternary complexes, obtained using mutant enzymes and/or substrate analogs, should provide further insights into the methyl transfer reaction and the functional roles of the N-terminal domain.</p>

          <p>Experimental phases to 2.8 Å were derived from selenium SAD measurements at the selenium peak using heavy atom sites located by a three-wavelength selenium MAD experiment at lower resolution. Thirty of the 36 expected selenium sites were found and phases were determined using SOLVE version 2.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b37">37</xref>], and statistical density modification was performed in RESOLVE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b38">38</xref>]. The initial model from RESOLVE was rebuilt in MI-fit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b39">39</xref>] and partly refined, and was used with the molecular replacement program EPMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030031-b40">40</xref>] to determine the higher resolution structure of oxidized MetE at 2.00 Å. A search model derived from the refined oxidized structure was subsequently used to solve the substrate complexes with EPMR.
