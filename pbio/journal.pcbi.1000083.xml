The BriX fragment database, consisting of fragments from 4 to 14 residues long, was realized through identification of recurrent backbone fragments from a non-redundant set of high-resolution protein structures. BriX contains an alphabet of more than 1,000 frequently observed conformations per peptide length for 6 different variation levels. Analysis of the performance of BriX revealed an average structural coverage of protein structures of more than 99% within a root mean square distance (RMSD) of 1 Angstrom. Globally, we are able to reconstruct protein structures with an average accuracy of 0.48 Angstrom RMSD. As expected, regular structures are well covered, but, interestingly, many loop regions that appear irregular at first glance are also found to form a recurrent structural motif, albeit with lower frequency of occurrence than regular secondary structures. Larger loop regions could be completely reconstructed from smaller recurrent elements, between 4 and 8 residues long. Finally, we observed that a significant amount of short sequences tend to display strong structural ambiguity between alpha helix and extended conformations. When the sequence length increases, this so-called sequence plasticity is no longer observed, illustrating the context dependency of polypeptide structures.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Large-scale DNA sequencing efforts produce large amounts of protein sequence data. However, in order to understand the function of a protein, its tertiary three-dimensional structure is required. Despite worldwide efforts in structural biology, experimental protein structures are determined at a significantly slower pace. As a result, computational methods for protein structure prediction receive significant attention. A large part of the structure prediction problem lies in the enormous size of the problem: proteins seem to occur in an infinite variety of shapes. Here, we propose that this huge complexity may be overcome by identifying recurrent protein fragments, which are frequently reused as building blocks to construct proteins that were hitherto thought to be unrelated. The BriX database is the outcome of identifying about 2,000 canonical shapes among 1,261 protein structures. We show any given protein can be reconstructed from this library of building blocks at a very high resolution, suggesting that the modelling of protein backbones may be greatly aided by our database.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>LB was funded by a PhD grant from the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen), Belgium.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>High-resolution structure determination of proteins and protein complexes via experimental methods occurs at a significantly slower pace than the collection of novel protein sequences. As a result, less than 30% of human proteins have a known structure in the Protein Data Bank and the percentage for other species is significantly lower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Liu1">[1]</xref>. In addition, structures mostly cover one or a small number of protein domains, thus covering only a fraction of the total sequence of the protein. Homology modeling improves this coverage using related proteins with known structures to build a model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Sali1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Wallner1">[5]</xref>. The construction of an adequate homolog can be divided into two related tasks: the placement of the amino acid side chains on a given backbone template and the detection of changes in backbone conformations that are required to accommodate the new sequence. For proteins that are relatively close in terms of sequence identity, the backbone-modeling problem is usually ignored, but in many cases the best homology template shows less than 50% homology with the target, and small compensatory changes to the backbone are likely to be required to obtain an accurate model. Recent advances in protein backbone modeling are based on the observation that protein structures are built from a finite repertoire of structural folds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Kolodny1">[6]</xref>. Structural redundancy allowed the classification of protein folds such as in the SCOP database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Murzin1">[7]</xref>, the CATH database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Orengo1">[8]</xref> or the FSSP classification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Holm1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Holm2">[10]</xref>. The unit of fold classification is usually a protein domain, since large proteins are generally composed of multiple domains. As a consequence, the classification comprises a hierarchical organisation of protein domains that embodies evolutionary and structural relationships. By creating more categories and thus refining the secondary structure descriptions, it has been proposed that a set of discrete backbone conformational states can be derived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Pauling1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Pauling2">[12]</xref>. Different research groups demonstrated the usefulness of such fragment libraries when reconstructing protein structures by generating sets of protein decoys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Sippl1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Bystroff1">[17]</xref>. In the latest editions of CASP, prediction approaches that assemble fragments of known structures into a candidate structure have proven to be successful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Bystroff1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Benros1">[20]</xref>. In fragment assembly methods, the assumption is made that local interactions create a particular conformational bias, but do not uniquely define local structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Floudas1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Tsai2">[24]</xref>. Instead, environmental constraints will determine the overall compact protein conformation. The construction of a final model is composed of three steps: The first step involves a selection of fragment candidates based on their stability that can be measured by a simplified scoring function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Haspel2">[25]</xref>. In the second step the fragments are assembled combinatorially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Inbar1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Lee1">[27]</xref>. In the final step the obtained structure is optimized through the employment of a force field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Lee1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Maupetit1">[28]</xref>. This method works well for small <italic>all</italic> <italic>α</italic> class proteins, and reasonably well for <italic>α</italic>/<italic>β</italic>, <italic>α</italic>+<italic>β</italic> and <italic>all</italic> <italic>β</italic> class proteins. The fragment approach has been successfully applied in the structure prediction algorithm Rosetta of Baker and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Simons1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-YarovYarovoy1">[31]</xref>, which also proved to be successful in accurately designing new folds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Kuhlman1">[32]</xref>. Publicly accessible libraries however are limited; they are typically small and consider lengths between 4 and 7 residues. For instance, by examining fragments of 5 residues, Kolodny and Levitt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Kolodny1">[6]</xref> created a library of 20 fragments, while Etchebest found only 16 building blocks of this length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Etchebest1">[33]</xref>. The alphabet of Camproux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Camproux1">[34]</xref> consists of 27 structural classes and is based on motives of 4 residues. By employing their hypercosine method on a set of 150,000 length-7 protein fragments, Hunter and Subramaniam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Hunter1">[35]</xref> discovered 13 minimal centroids or representative fragment shapes found in proteins at a resolution of 0.80 Angstrom. As such low resolution approaches, restricted to a single fragment length and thus resulting in a limited set of building blocks, might constitute an advantage in terms of computational efficiency for <italic>ab initio</italic> structure prediction methods, it will also lead to a significant loss of information. Wainreb et al made it possible to cluster variable sized fragments, consisting of at least 15 residues, through the implementation of their SSGS algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Wainreb1">[36]</xref>. By allowing more variability in the alignment of loop locations, they created a library of 8,933 building blocks. An alternative approach, as implemented by DePristo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-DePristo1">[37]</xref>, uses an ensemble of artificially generated small polypeptide conformations instead of sampling conformations from known protein structures. By constraining the chemical properties such as the idealized geometry, phi/psi angles and excluded volume they constructed ensembles of near-native conformations consistent with a surrounding fixed protein structure. Our strategy focuses on obtaining a comprehensive set of high-resolution structural fragments without using artificial data or restricting fragment lengths. We decided to partition a non-redundant set of high-resolution protein structures into fragments that consist of 4 to 14 residues, because preliminary tests indicated the lack of high structural similarity for more than 50% of all fragments when larger lengths were considered. Subsequently, clustering techniques were employed to identify structural motifs that are recurrent in different protein structures. Over 1,000 recurrent fragment structures or classes were found for each considered peptide length when a structural variation proportional to the length of the fragment (0.1 Angstrom per residue) was allowed. As suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Kolodny1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Holmes1">[38]</xref>, it is important to determine how well the classes of the fragment library cover fold space in order to estimate its value. When applied to protein structures not used in the construction of the database, this coverage turned out to be 99% on average using a 1 Angstrom RMSD threshold. The latter implies that in the majority of the cases studied the so-called irregular regions or loops can also be reconstructed from recurrent building blocks. Through the employment of a global fit reconstruction algorithm, backbone traces were generated having an average accuracy of 0.48 Angstrom RMSD.</p><p>Additionally, the ability to use BriX for local secondary structure prediction was examined by looking at the sequence-structure relationship within classes. According to previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Haspel2">[25]</xref>, the sequence conservation within classes was rather low because of the large number of determined building blocks originating from different families. Nonetheless, this analysis led to a quantitative illustration of the context-dependence of polypeptide structure. A significant amount of small sequences tend to display strong structural ambiguity: for fragments of length 5, 14% of the fragment pairs with identical sequences have structural difference within the range of a helix-to-sheet jump. These so-called plastic sequences, i.e. sequences that display diverse structural conformations, display a strong preference for the aliphatic residues Alanine, Valine, and Leucine. For fragments of more than 5 residues sequence plasticity is no longer observed, showing that the need for additional context to determine secondary structure is much reduced for longer fragments.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>By sliding a window of varying length (4–14 amino acids) over a non-redundant set of 1,261 high quality protein structures retrieved from the WHAT IF software package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Vriend1">[39]</xref>, about 260,000 protein fragments of each length were obtained. Using a multi-step clustering approach (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> section), these fragments were clustered into more than 1,000 up to approximately 2,000 structural classes, for each length ranging from 4 to 14 residues. Furthermore, we distinguished different degrees of variation inside the classes, by performing the clustering with 6 different distance thresholds. For instance, the considered RMSD thresholds for fragments consisting of 7 residues were 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0 Angstrom. Clustering with varying RMSD thresholds was performed to provide degrees of structural diversity that are suited for a wide range of modeling requirements. Particularly for homology modeling, the threshold variation is a useful parameter for modeling structures with varying sequence identity. Lower thresholds yield more accurate fits for high identity regions, while larger thresholds enable the modeling of loops or other regions with lower sequence identity. Larger thresholds often result in fanlike shapes at the end of the fragments and at local loop positions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the structural variation within equivalent classes comprising 7 residues constructed at different. Increasing the distance threshold used to cluster the fragments resulted in a decrease in the number of classes being identified as regular structures. The number of classified fragments, i.e. fragments belonging to a fragment class, increased with larger thresholds applied in the clustering process (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). A larger threshold implies a wider radius around the class centroids, and thus larger and fewer classes with more internal variation. Monitoring the number of classes in function of the length of fragments classified at a fixed threshold (RMSD of 0.9 Angstrom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), we observed an increase in the number of classes with length until a fragment length of 11 residues, after which the number of classes dropped steeply (length 12–14). This turning point at fragment length 11 was not observed when plotting the percentage of fragments classified at RMSD threshold 0.9 versus the fragment length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Here a smooth decline of the number of classified fragments for increasing fragment lengths was observed. When the same analysis was performed on clustering results for RMSD thresholds proportional to fragment length (0.1 Angstrom variation per residue), thus allowing more variation for larger fragment lengths, a similar pattern applied. Although less steep, we still observed a decrease of the percentage of classified fragments with increasing fragment length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Again, a turning point (at fragment length 9) after which the number of classes dropped was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), albeit at a different fragment length then when a fixed threshold was applied. These results indicate that increasing the clustering threshold for longer fragments did not suffice to construct the same number of fragment classes as at shorter lengths. Increasing fragment length results in a larger conformational space and variability of classes, impairing the clustering of fragments into well-defined classes.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000083-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000083.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Effect of varying RMSD on structural variation within a class.</title><p>The plot shows the fragment content of equivalent BriX classes of length 7 created with fixed RMSD thresholds from 0.6 to 1 Angstrom.

Shown is the number of BriX classes (circles) and the percentage of classified fragments (squares) in function of the RMSD threshold (0.5–1.0 Angstrom) used during the clustering for fragments containing 7 residues. As expected, higher thresholds result in fewer fragment classes and more identified recurrent fragment structures as the variation within a class is higher and a class thus contains more elements. A threshold of 0.6 Angstrom is sufficient to classify more than half of all fragments of length 7. (B) Number of classes for varying fragment lengths.

In both figures, the number of classes increases with the length until a turning point is reached, after which the number of classes drops steeply. When a fixed RMSD is applied, this turning point clearly occurs at fragment length 11, reaching the level of 2,740 classes. (C) Percentage of classified fragments for varying fragment lengths.

In this way, the fragment space is rebuilt by grouping the BriX classes into <italic>superclasses</italic> based on root mean square distances between the class centroids. For reasons of simplicity only the largest classes (i.e. superclasses that contain more than 1% of BriX classes) are shown on each level. At the top of the classification, one branch is shown that comprises 98.6% of all classes and 87.9% of all fragments allowing a maximal distance of 1.8 Angstrom RMSD between the class centroids. At the second level the clustering method is capable of separating the two principal secondary structure elements: strands and helices. These segregrate further into smaller, more specific conformations. A counterintuitive result is that the clustering method does not differentiate between <italic>turn</italic> and <italic>helix</italic> secondary structure elements on the top level. Instead we find them at different levels in the tree (see Superclasses <italic>i</italic>, <italic>m</italic>, <italic>n</italic> and <italic>q</italic>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows the percentage of fragments that were found to be recurrent regarding an increasing distance threshold. Clearly shown is the difficulty to classify <italic>sheets</italic> and <italic>loops</italic>, despite an increasing distance threshold. This is because they do not exist in well-defined conformations, but instead occupy a wide range of geometries. As a consequence, only a few recurring structures could be identified, resulting in a low number of classes and a large number of unclassified <italic>sheet</italic>- and <italic>loop</italic> fragments. This was also observed by Du et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Du1">[40]</xref> when determining the probability of finding a short protein fragment back among non-homologous structures in the Protein Data Bank. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, the authors perceived a nearest neighbor RMSD distribution for β fragments close to that for loop fragments.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000083-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000083.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Structural hierarchy of classes based on RMSD distance.</title><p>The nodes are represented by means of a DSSP logo (generated using WebLogo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Crooks1">[47]</xref>) and a denotation of the percentage of BriX classes (in black) and fragments (in red) it contains.

The data selection was based on the fragments or fragment classes having an overall DSSP content of more than 80% in these 4 structural elements.

Although the vast majority of <italic>helical</italic> fragments were found to be recurrent (A), the number of respective structural classes is low compared to the number of <italic>strand</italic> classes (B). Because of the stabilizing hydrogen bonds, helices do not allow a lot of variation, resulting in few large BriX classes. The variable character and infrequent occurences of loops and turns are the main reason for the small number of recurrent structures and poor classification results. (C) Classification results for the Astral40 validation test. The BriX fragment classification obtained from the WHAT IF globular structure set was used to classify fragments generated from the Astral40 structures. Experiments evaluating the effect of increasing threshold on the percentage of classified fragments were repeated for the full Astral40 set (open circles) and for the Astral40 structures of the major SCOP classes (all α [diamonds], all β [triangles], α/β [closed circles], and α+β [squares]). The initial classification results for the WHAT IF generated fragments (open squares) are shown for reference.

The first measure determines how well each fragment of a protein structure can be locally approximated by the best corresponding fragment class. Note that in this test it is not required to assemble the fragments to obtain a unique backbone trace. In addition, we calculated the total percentage of the structure that could be covered by the fragment classes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> section). For reasons of generality, the validation test considered a representative set of human proteins, extracted from the PDB database (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> section). This relatively small set contained 935 structures, equivalently balanced over the existing folds (as is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000083-t001">Table 1</xref>).

By employing a depth-first search algorithm (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> section) backbone traces for the human proteins were generated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). To avoid ambiguity we repeated this experiment on the Park &amp; Levitt set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Park1">[44]</xref>, which has also been considered during previous reconstruction attempts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Kolodny1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Camproux1">[34]</xref>. Although the calculation of the best global fit approximation was computationally too expensive, we achieved an average accuracy of 0.48 Angstrom RMSD for the resulting backbone reconstructions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000083.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). In order to obtain this accuracy, the fragment classes from all lengths were considered. On the same protein set, Camproux et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Camproux1">[34]</xref> managed to obtain an average accuracy of 0.64 Angstrom RMSD, while Kolodny et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Kolodny1">[6]</xref> achieved 0.92 Angstrom RMSD. Interesting observations were made during the different validation tests. As larger fragment lengths can describe regular secondary structure elements more accurately, loop/turn regions were best approximated by shorter fragments, containing 8 residues and less. This result was most pronounced for the all-α SCOP class (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000083.s002">Figure S2B and S2C</xref>). This illustrates the benefit of using a fragment library not restricted to one fragment length. One of the bottlenecks in predicting protein structures is the relative spatial organization of regular secondary structure elements.</p><p>To address the applicability of our fragment library, we looked more in detail into the bridging region between those regular secondary structure elements and the loop/turn region. In previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Du1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Fidelis1">[45]</xref> loop structures were considered as seven-residue fragments with less than four continuous α-helical or β-strand residues as defined by DSSP. In this experiment loops are defined as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Du1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Fidelis1">[45]</xref>. As loops occur in a wide range of lengths, we slightly adapted the loop definition into a part of a protein structure consisting of at least 4 residues without 4 continuous α-helical or β-strand residues. The experiment consisted in finding local matches for the regions between a regular secondary structure element and a loop region. A special focus was directed towards the fragment length of these matches when forcing the search process to include two residues from the regular side. The search algorithm was able to find at least one match for each region by considering a threshold of 1.0 Angstrom RMSD, According to our previous results, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000083.s003">Figure S3A and S3B</xref> show that these regions are best approximated by smaller building blocks.</p><p>The various results obtained in this second validation step suggest that although not every short sequence in a protein encodes a regular structure, the total protein structure is built with small building blocks. The size of the building block needs to describe a small region is dependent on the type of secondary structure elements present in that region. Hypervariable regions such as loops are composed of multiple smaller regular building blocks, while a single longer BriX class can often describe entire helices and strands.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Plastic Sequences</title><p>When considering part of a protein structure, the possibility was examined to predict the corresponding BriX class from sequence information. However, exceptions aside, the overall sequence conservation within the classes was rather low, precluding sequence to structure prediction. This is to be expected due to the large number of classes resulting from the high-resolution clustering. In addition, an analysis was carried out to identify the magnitude of structural variance in conformations that a single sequence can adopt. The experiment, from which the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g006">Figure 6</xref>, consisted of calculating the pairwise RMSD between fragments with an identical sequence (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> section). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g006">Figure 6A</xref> shows the normalized distribution of the obtained RMSD values, for three different fragment lengths. Two peaks were observed: the first peak at 0.2 Angstrom revealed that the majority of the fragments, containing an identical amino acid sequence, adopt a similar conformation. A smaller yet significant second peak was recognized at an RMSD of 1.6–2 Angstrom. The idea arose that, certainly for smaller fragment lengths (smaller than 7 residues), a drastic structural switch can occur. This idea was verified through a thorough cluster analysis on nearly 40,000 sequences where this second peak was recognized. For each sequence, the analysis consisted in carrying out the hierarchical agglomeration process on the fragments sharing this sequence. The resulting histogram, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, confirms that for the vast amount of these sequences two structural groups could be observed. As the sequence length increases, the second peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g006">Figure 6A</xref> gradually disappears, indicating that additional structural context information is required to remove structural ambiguities.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000083-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000083.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Presence of structural switches within groups of fragments containing identical residue sequences.</title><p>(A) The effect of the fragment length on the structural variation.

The smaller plot is the result of carrying out the Hierarchical Agglomeration process on nearly 40,000 sequences where this variation was recognized. The clustering considered two different distance thresholds: 1.5 Angstrom (red) and 2.0 Angstrom (blue) RMSD.

Three groups can be distinguished: amino acids promoting (1) a single-well defined regular structure (such as Tryptophan, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Cysteine, Asparagine, and Methionine), (2) several regular structures or structural jumps (such as Alanine, Leucine, and Valine), and (3) irregular structures (such as Glycine and Proline).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000083.g006" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>A closer look at the residues that take part in these structural switches revealed the propensity of smaller hydrophobic residues, such as Alanine, Leucine and Valine, to be involved in ambiguous sequences.

Interestingly Proline and Glycine tended to occur in fragments that are not represented in BriX, due to their irregular nature. These so-called structure breakers are inclined to disrupt secondary structures and often give rise to loop or turn-regions. Consequently, three groups could be distinguished with amino acids promoting: 1) a single-well defined regular structure (such as Tryptophan, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Cysteine, Asparagine and Methionine), 2) several regular structures or structural ambiguity (such as Alanine, Leucine and Valine) and 3) irregular structures (such as Glycine and Proline).</p><p>Another observation was the magnitude of the structural ambiguity: a switch from a perfect α helix to a β strand was recurrently seen.

Loop regions that appear irregular at first glance could be entirely reconstructed from smaller building blocks, between 4 and 8 residues long.

For each length, a clustering process was employed to identify equivalent structures. To avoid performance problems, this process incorporated a pre-clustering stage by grouping the fragments by their secondary structure assignment according to the DSSP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Kabsch1">[41]</xref>. A fragment was described as a sequence of the three-dimensional coordinates of the backbone atoms (<italic>N</italic>, <italic>C</italic><sub>α</sub>, <italic>C</italic><sub>β</sub>, <italic>O</italic>) of each residue. Applying the fast RMSD calculation method of Wolfgang Kabsch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Kabsch2">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Bruschweiler1">[50]</xref>, distance matrices were constructed for each DSSP group.

At any time, the algorithm considers a determined position inside the protein structure, and attempts to identify a similar class centroid for that position. The selection procedure involves iteration over the possible fragment lengths. Large fragments that have a sufficiently small RMSD difference (resolution &lt;1 Angstrom) compared to the original structure are favored. Whenever an appropriate centroid could not be found within the iteration, the fragment length was decreased by one residue. Otherwise, the respective BriX class was accepted as a solution and the procedure repeated for a following position in the protein structure. If a solution could not be obtained, the location in the structure was marked and the procedure repeated for the neighbouring position.

Therefore a strategy was necessary to prevent examining all sequences to output the best global-fit approximation. However, at any time, the algorithm should be able to backtrack to a previous solution when it gets stuck in a local minimum. Our algorithm follows a depth first search approach for memory-efficiency reasons. At any time, a solution queue keeps track of candidate structures created so far. These candidate structures, representing a partial approximation of the protein's backbone, are ordered in a way that the closest solutions are in front. In general terms, solutions with a longer candidate structure are favored over those with shorter reconstructions. To avoid a bias towards fragment length, the last fragment addition is not considered. When two candidate structures have the same size, the solution with the smallest distance between the last added fragment and the target structure is preferred. As long as the queue contains solutions and no solution has been found, the algorithm pops out the front candidate structure and tries to extend this structure using the best fragments matches in BriX. The selection of a good match is a two-step procedure: First, there is searched for local matches between the consecutive backbone segment, having an overlap of three residues with the already constructed candidate, and the BriX class centroids. Second, for every class match, a more specific search is carried out considering the fragments within this class after superimposing them on the target structure. For each class fragment that is in conformity with the preceding backbone reconstruction, i.e. when the RMSD between the overlapping residues is minimal (RMSD &lt;0.3 Angstrom), a new extended candidate structure is put in the solution queue. When no viable fragment can be found, the algorithm tracks back to the second closest candidate in the solution queue.</p><p>We analyzed the efficiency of our algorithm on an Opteron (TM) Dual Core Processor 2.0 GHz. The execution time of this algorithm is inherently dependent on the size of the protein. For an average sized protein like the α G25K GTP-binding protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000083-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), for instance, the algorithm is able to output a solution within 5 minutes time.</p><p>All protein graphics in this article were generated with the YASARA software package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-Krieger1">[52]</xref> and PyMOL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000083-DeLano1">[53]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Validation Datasets</title><p>For the creation of the BriX library, we used a list of 1,261 PDB chains downloaded from the WHAT IF website.
