Nodule-specific cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides (NCR AMPs) and the bacterial BacA protein are essential for bacteroid development.

We investigated the hypothesis that BacA is critical for the bacterial response towards NCR AMPs.

Instead, BacA was critical to reduce the amount of NCR AMP-induced membrane permeabilization and bacterial killing in vitro. Within <italic>M. truncatula</italic>, both wild-type and BacA-deficient mutant bacteria were challenged with NCR AMPs, but this resulted in persistence of the wild-type bacteria and rapid cell death of the mutant bacteria. In contrast, BacA was dispensable for bacterial survival in an <italic>M. truncatula dnf1</italic> mutant defective in NCR AMP transport to the bacterial compartment. Therefore, BacA is critical for the legume symbiosis by protecting <italic>S. meliloti</italic> against the bactericidal effects of NCR AMPs. Host AMPs are ubiquitous in nature and BacA proteins are essential for other chronic host infections by symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. Hence, our findings suggest that BacA-mediated protection of bacteria against host AMPs is a critical stage in the establishment of different prolonged host infections.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Certain bacterial species have the unique capacity to enter into eukaryotic host cells and establish prolonged infections, which can be beneficial (e.g. bacterial-legume symbiosis) or detrimental (e.g. chronic disease) for the host. However, the mechanisms by which bacteria persist in host cells are poorly understood. Legume peptides and the bacterial BacA membrane protein play essential roles in enabling bacteria to establish prolonged legume infections. However, the biological function of BacA in persistent legume infections has eluded scientists for nearly two decades. In this article, we investigated a potential relationship between legume peptides and BacA in the establishment of prolonged bacterial-legume infections. We found that BacA was critical to protect bacteria against the antimicrobial action of legume peptides, thereby allowing the peptides to induce bacterial persistence within the legume rather than rapid bacterial death. Mammalian hosts also produce peptides in response to invading microorganisms and BacA proteins are critical for medically important bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> to form prolonged mammalian infections. Therefore, our results suggest that BacA-mediated protection against host peptides might be a conserved mechanism used by both symbiotic and pathogenic bacterial species to establish long-term host infections.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The alpha-proteobacterium <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> forms a symbiosis within specialized root organs, called nodules with <italic>Medicago</italic> species of leguminous plants, including the agriculturally important alfalfa and the model legume <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Jones1">[1]</xref>. The bacteria induce the organogenesis of nodules and infect the host plant via tubular structures called infection threads from which they are delivered into the nodule cells by an endocytosis-like process. The internalized bacteria are encapsulated within a plant-derived membrane, forming an organelle-like symbiosome compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Jones1">[1]</xref>. Within the symbiosome, <italic>S. meliloti</italic> differentiates into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids, which persist resulting in a chronic intracellular infection and symbiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Gibson1">[2]</xref>. <italic>S. meliloti</italic> bacteroids formed within <italic>M. truncatula</italic> have elongated morphologies, undergo extensive genome amplification, have a decreased cytoplasmic membrane integrity, and lack reproductive capacity (i.e., terminal differentiation) relative to their free-living, bacterial form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Mergaert1">[3]</xref>. Bacteroid differentiation is mediated within the host compartments by a large family of several hundred legume nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides, which are transported into these compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-VanDeVelde1">[4]</xref>. A subset of NCR peptides (here called NCR AMPs) exhibits antimicrobial activity in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-VanDeVelde1">[4]</xref>. NCR AMPs are structurally and functionally similar to plant and mammalian defensins, as they have conserved cysteine residues, which are predicted to form defined disulfide (S-S) bridges, and are cationic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Mergaert2">[5]</xref>. Defensins are a widespread class of AMPs, which are key effectors of innate immunity in both animals and plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Marti1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Ganz1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite knowledge of the critical role of <italic>Medicago</italic> NCR AMPs in mediating bacteroid development, the bacterial factors central to this response are unknown. Nearly two decades ago, the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> cytoplasmic membrane BacA protein was discovered to be essential for bacteroid development within <italic>Medicago</italic> legumes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Glazebrook1">[8]</xref>. <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient mutant bacteria infect nodule cells and enter into the host symbiosome compartments but were unable to develop into the typical elongated bacteroids, which persist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Glazebrook1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Maunoury1">[9]</xref>. Mammalian pathogens such as <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> also have BacA homologs, which were found to be critical for prolonged murine infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Domenech1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-LeVier1">[11]</xref>. Therefore, BacA proteins are essential for bacterial symbionts and pathogens to establish prolonged intracellular infections of plants and mammals, respectively.</p>
      <p>The precise in vivo function of BacA proteins is unknown. <italic>S. meliloti</italic>, <italic>B. abortus</italic>, and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> produce unusual fatty acid-modified lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Domenech1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Ferguson1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Haag1">[13]</xref>. BacA proteins of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> and bacterial pathogens are involved in the modification of lipids with these unusual fatty acids in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Ferguson1">[12]</xref>. However, these unusual lipid modifications were found to be important but not essential for <italic>S. meliloti</italic> bacteroid development during the legume symbiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Haag2">[14]</xref>. It was recently discovered that BacA proteins are critical for rhizobial bacteroid development in other legume hosts producing NCR peptides such as <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> (pea) and <italic>Astragalus sinicus</italic>, but they are dispensable for this process in <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> (bean), <italic>Vigna unguiculata</italic> (cowpea), and <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>, which are legume hosts naturally devoid in these peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001169.s009">Table S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Karunakaran1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Kereszt1">[19]</xref>. The presence of NCR peptides and the requirement of BacA for an effective symbiosis also correlate with the formation of elongated, terminal bacteroids in nodules. In contrast, bacteroids are morphologically undifferentiated and can de-differentiate (i.e., reversible differentiation) in legumes that lack NCR peptides and do not require a functional BacA for symbiosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001169.s009">Table S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Mergaert1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Mergaert2">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Alunni1">[20]</xref>.

        <p>A subset of NCR peptides possesses antimicrobial activity in vitro and reduces the colony forming ability of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-VanDeVelde1">[4]</xref>.

The 2–4 µM concentrations were found to be sub-lethal (unpublished data), indicating that the effects on cell size and DNA content at low NCR247 concentrations were uncoupled from the killing, which is only observed at higher concentrations. Importantly, an <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient mutant was more sensitive towards the antimicrobial action of NCR247 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001169-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), showing that BacA was critical to prevent hypersensitivity of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> towards this host peptide.

We found that NCR247 treatment increased the PI fluorescence of the BacA-deficient mutant to a greater extent than the wild-type strain and the presence of p<italic>SmbacA</italic> restored the PI fluorescence of the BacA-deficient mutant to that of the wild-type strain with control plasmid in the presence of NCR247 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001169-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings demonstrated that the hypersensitivity of the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient mutant towards the NCR247 peptide in vitro was due to an increase in NCR247-induced loss of cytoplasmic membrane integrity. We also found that the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient mutant was hypersensitive to another <italic>M. truncatula</italic> NCR AMP, NCR035, in vitro relative to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001169.s003">Figure S3A,B</xref>).

        <title>An <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-Deficient Mutant Is Challenged with NCRs In Vivo</title>
        <p>The hypersensitivity of the BacA-deficient mutant to NCRs in vitro suggested a scenario for the inability of this strain to develop into bacteroids within the legume. Upon entry into the host compartment, <italic>S. meliloti</italic> is confronted with NCRs leading to bacteroid differentiation in the case of a wild-type strain, which has a sufficient level of resistance to NCRs. In contrast, the BacA-deficient mutant would be killed by NCR AMP challenge, preventing bacteroid differentiation. This scenario required that NCRs be transported into the symbiosome containing the BacA-deficient mutant as well. Using RT-PCR in combination with <italic>NCR</italic> specific primers, we analyzed <italic>NCR</italic> gene expression in roots and nodules induced by wild-type <italic>S. meliloti</italic> and a BacA-deficient mutant strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001169.s005">Figure S5</xref>). <italic>NCR084</italic>, <italic>NCR247</italic>, and <italic>NCR035</italic> were expressed to similar levels in nodules induced by both strains while <italic>NCR001</italic> was only weakly expressed in the nodules of the BacA-deficient mutant. This is in agreement with the previously described two consecutive transcriptome waves that characterize the transcriptional changes during nodule development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Maunoury1">[9]</xref>. <italic>NCR084</italic>, <italic>NCR247</italic>, and <italic>NCR035</italic> are induced during the first wave, which is still activated in nodules of the BacA-deficient mutant while <italic>NCR001</italic> is expressed during the second transcriptome switch, which is not activated anymore in nodules of the BacA-deficient mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Maunoury1">[9]</xref>. Thus, at least a subset of <italic>NCR</italic> genes is still expressed in nodules of the BacA-deficient mutant.</p>
        <p>To test whether NCRs were also transported to symbiosomes, transgenic <italic>M. truncatula</italic> roots expressing translational fusions of either the NCR035 or NCR084 peptide with the mCHERRY red fluorescent protein, under the control of their own promoter, were inoculated with either the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> wild-type or BacA-deficient mutant. In agreement with our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-VanDeVelde1">[4]</xref>, the fluorescently labelled NCR peptides co-localized entirely with the wild-type strain bacteroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001169-g002">Figure 2A–D</xref>), consistent with their trafficking to the bacterial compartment. Likewise, we found that the NCRs also co-localized with the BacA-deficient mutant-bacteria within the symbiosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001169-g002">Figure 2E–H</xref>), demonstrating that the mutant bacteria were challenged with NCRs within their host compartment. However, in contrast to the wild-type strain-infected nodules, a proportion of the NCR peptides were secreted to the exterior of the plant cell in nodules infected with the BacA-deficient mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001169.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Combined, these findings showed that BacA is important for NCR peptide trafficking to the symbiosomes but also demonstrated that an <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient mutant is challenged with NCR peptides in vivo.</p>

        <title>BacA Is Dispensable for Bacterial Survival in a Legume Mutant Defective in NCR Trafficking</title>
        <p>To provide further evidence in support of our hypothesis that the rapid death of the BacA-deficient bacteria within the host compartment was the result of NCR peptide challenge, we took advantage of the <italic>M. truncatula dnf1</italic> mutant, which is defective in a nodule-specific signal peptidase complex involved in the trafficking of NCR peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Wang1">[25]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we showed that (i) the cytoplasmic membrane protein BacA protects <italic>S. meliloti</italic> from being hypersensitive to NCR AMPs in vitro by reducing the degree of peptide-induced inner membrane permeabilization, (ii) BacA is essential for survival of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> in wild-type <italic>M. truncatula</italic> symbiosomes, and (iii) BacA is dispensable for <italic>S. meliloti</italic> symbiosome survival in an <italic>M. truncatula dnf1</italic> mutant legume, which is defective in trafficking NCR peptides to the symbiosome compartment. Therefore, our findings have shown that there is a strong correlation between the presence of symbiosome NCR AMPs and the requirement of BacA for <italic>S. meliloti</italic> symbiosome survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001169-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These findings are also consistent with previous studies whereby BacA proteins were found only to be critical for the rhizobium-legume symbiosis in hosts such as <italic>Medicago</italic>, peas, and <italic>Astragalus</italic>, which produce NCR AMPs, but non-essential in legumes naturally devoid of NCR AMPs such as bean, cowpea, or <italic>Lotus</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001169.s009">Table S1</xref>). Based on these findings, we propose a model whereby BacA is critical to minimize the antibacterial action of NCR AMPs on <italic>S. meliloti</italic>, thereby enabling proper bacteroid development.

In contrast, the BacA-deficient mutant is hypersensitive towards the host NCR AMPs and is killed by them rather than forming the chronic infection (2). (B) The <italic>M. truncatula dnf1</italic> mutant is defective in a nodule-specific signal-peptidase complex (SPC) and as a result the NCR peptides are no longer transported to the bacterial compartment but are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-VanDeVelde1">[4]</xref>. The <italic>S. meliloti</italic> wild-type strain and BacA-deficient mutant enter into the symbiosomes (1) and remain viable due to the absence of NCR peptide challenge (2).

      <p>We found that the difference between the wild-type and BacA-deficient strain in their response to the in vitro treatments was relatively modest compared to the <italic>in planta</italic> observations, where the difference in viability between both strains was substantial. However, a major difference between the in vitro and <italic>in planta</italic> conditions is that a highly complex cocktail of several hundred different NCR AMPs are produced <italic>in planta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Mergaert2">[5]</xref>.

      <p>Although the BacA-deficient mutant bacteria were challenged with NCR peptides in vivo, a significant proportion of these peptides were transported to the plant cell surface rather than to the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient-containing symbiosome compartment. Since the BacA-deficient mutant bacteria are killed within the symbiosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Glazebrook1">[8]</xref>, a reduced amount of target symbiosome compartments for NCR transport could lead to secretion of excess NCR peptides to the exterior of the plant cell.

      <p>Our data showed that the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA protein is critical to reduce the amount of cytoplasmic membrane damage as a result of NCR AMP challenge in vitro. At present, we do not know the precise mechanism by which BacA limits NCR-induced cytoplasmic membrane damage. An <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient mutant has ∼50% reduction in the content of an unusual outer membrane lipid relative to the wild-type strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Ferguson1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Ferguson2">[26]</xref>. Since this unusual lipid is important in outer membrane stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Ferguson3">[27]</xref>, one possibility is that NCR AMPs are more effective at disrupting the outer membrane of the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient mutant relative to the wild-type strain leading to the increased damage to the inner membrane. However, an <italic>S. meliloti</italic> mutant, which completely lacks this unusual lipid, still forms persistent legume infections and can survive in NCR AMP-containing symbiosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Haag2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Ferguson3">[27]</xref>, suggesting that BacA must have an additional role in the response of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> towards host NCRs. Since an <italic>S. meliloti acpXL</italic> mutant, which is completely defective in the biosynthesis of the unusual lipid A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Haag2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Ferguson3">[27]</xref>, was osmotically unstable and lysed in the low osmolarity buffer used to test NCR peptide sensitivity in vitro (unpublished data), we were unable to determine the role of this unusual lipid in the bacterial response to the NCR AMPs. Moreover, BacA could affect the bacterial envelope in other ways, for example in its protein composition as suggested by transcriptome analysis in the <italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum bacA</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Karunakaran1">[15]</xref>, which in turn may be related to the hypersensitivity towards NCR peptides in the <italic>bacA</italic> mutants. In addition, BacA is predicted to be a cytoplasmic membrane subunit of an ABC transporter and our previous studies found that it plays a key role in the uptake of structurally diverse, non-membrane disrupting peptides in <italic>S. meliloti</italic> in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Karunakaran1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Marlow1">[28]</xref>, suggesting that BacA may be a peptide transporter. At present it is not known if BacA is directly involved in peptide transport in bacteria or whether it indirectly influences the uptake of those peptides. If BacA is directly involved in peptide transport, BacA-mediated uptake of NCR peptides might reduce their ability to induce membrane damage. Alternatively, BacA might confer protection by being involved in the efflux of NCR peptides. However, further studies will be necessary to understand whether NCR AMPs have intracellular targets in <italic>S. meliloti</italic> and therefore whether their efflux would confer resistance.</p>
      <p>BacA proteins are also critical for prolonged intracellular mammalian infections of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>B. abortus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Domenech1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-LeVier1">[11]</xref>. A <italic>B. abortus</italic> BacA-deficient mutant establishes an acute infection but was specifically defective upon entering the chronic phase of the infection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-LeVier1">[11]</xref>. Mammalian hosts produce a cocktail of different AMPs depending upon the cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Ganz1">[7]</xref>. The legume NCR peptides used in our in vitro experiments are cationic and defensin-like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Mergaert2">[5]</xref>. Mammalian defensins are primarily produced by epithelial cells and neutrophils as part of the innate immune response and invading pathogens encounter these early in their infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Ganz1">[7]</xref>. AMPs are also produced as part of the innate immune response by mammalian macrophages and pathogens such as <italic>B. abortus</italic> are challenged with these peptides within their phagosome compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Roop1">[29]</xref>. We showed previously that the <italic>B. abortus</italic> BacA protein complements the chronic infection defect of the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient strain within <italic>Medicago</italic> legumes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Wehmeier1">[23]</xref>. In this study, we were able to demonstrate that the <italic>B. abortus</italic> BacA protein complements the hypersensitivity of the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient mutant towards the antimicrobial action of NCR247 in vitro. It is well established that bacterial protection against host AMPs is important for the establishment of acute bacterial pathogen-host infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Marti1">[6]</xref>. For example, the two-component PhoPQ system protects <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium against AMPs and is essential for macrophage survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Prost1">[30]</xref>. Our findings suggest that BacA-mediated protection of pathogens against host AMPs is also key for the establishment of chronic pathogen-host infections.</p>
      <p>Since there are over three hundred different NCR peptides produced by <italic>M. truncatula</italic> root nodules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Mergaert2">[5]</xref>, we took advantage of the <italic>M. truncatula dnf1</italic> mutant as a means to completely block NCR peptide trafficking into the symbiosome compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001169-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, since the <italic>M. truncatula dnf1</italic> mutant is defective in a nodule-specific signal peptidase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Wang1">[25]</xref>, it could also be affected in transport of other proteins to the symbiosomes. Therefore, at this stage, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that survival of the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> BacA-deficient mutant in the <italic>dnf1</italic> mutant might be more complex than just the absence of NCRs and might also be due to the absence of one or more of these DNF1-dependent symbiosome proteins. We found, consistent with the published work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-VanDeVelde1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Wang1">[25]</xref>, that <italic>S. meliloti</italic> eventually dies in the <italic>M. truncatula dnf1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001169-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). It is thought that the ultimate death of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> in this mutant legume might simply be due to a senescence process initiated in non-functional nodules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-VanDeVelde2">[31]</xref>. However, it is also possible that the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> bacteroid features induced by the NCR peptides in the wild-type legume hosts are key for their ability to form prolonged infections in the host compartment. Therefore, since these bacterial changes would not occur in the <italic>M. truncatula dnf1</italic>, the bacteria could only form shorter term infections. Indeed, mammalian AMPs induce changes in bacterial pathogens permitting prolonged infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001169-Bader1">[32]</xref>. However, due to the complexity of AMP genes in mammalian hosts, the precise roles of these peptides on invading pathogens are not fully understood. For example, no such model system exists that can prevent the expression/trafficking of all mammalian AMPs. Future studies, blocking the trafficking of mammalian AMPs, in a similar way to the <italic>M. truncatula dnf1</italic> mutant, hold potential to uncover their precise role during mammalian infections.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have shown that BacA plays a key role in the protection of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> against the antimicrobial action of host NCRs. Since there are over three hundred different NCR peptides and these peptides are expressed in different locations within the root nodules, the future study of different effects of the peptides on <italic>S. meliloti</italic> during the legume symbiosis has the potential to reveal further important findings into prolonged bacterial-host interactions.</p>

        <p>NCR247 was assembled on a peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystem), using the stepwise solid phase Fmoc method on Fmoc-Rink-Amid AM resin on a 0.1 mmol scale. The N-9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl amino acid used for the synthesis had the following side-chain protecting groups: trityl for cysteine at positions 1–2 and acetoamidomethyl for cysteine at positions 3–4, trityl for asparagine and glutamine, tert-butyl for aspartic acid, and 2,2,4,6,7,-pentamethyl-dihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl for arginine. For each coupling step, the Fmoc-protected amino acid and coupling reagent were added in 5-fold molar excess with respect to resin substitution. Couplings were carried out with O-Benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate (HBTU). Cleavage from the resin and side chain de-protection of the synthesized peptides were carried out by treatment with a solution of 80% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 5% (v/v) water, 5% (v/v) phenol, 5% (v/v) thioanisole, 2.5% (v/v) ethandithiol, and 2.5% (v/v) triisopropylsilane for 2 h.

Whole nodule transversal sections are shown in (A,B) and symbiotic nodule cells in (C–F). In wild-type strain-infected nodules, NCR035 or NCR084 co-localize with bacteroids. NCRs also co-localize with the rhizobia in the BacA-deficient mutant infected cells, but a proportion of the peptides are secreted to the outside of the nodule cells. The green fluorescence in (A,B) originates from the <italic>rolD</italic>::eGFP-ER reporter cassette which is present on the binary vector and used to select transgenic roots/nodules. Scale bars are 100 µm (A,B) or 10 µm (C–F).</p>
