<p>Unisexual and heterosexual reproduction in the pathogenic yeast <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> enables <italic>de novo</italic> phenotypic and genotypic plasticity with frequent aneuploidy and rapid adaptation.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Aneuploidy is known to be deleterious and underlies several common human diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders such as trisomy 21 in Down's syndrome. In contrast, aneuploidy can also be advantageous and in fungi confers antifungal drug resistance and enables rapid adaptive evolution. We report here that sexual reproduction generates phenotypic and genotypic diversity in the human pathogenic yeast <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, which is globally distributed and commonly infects individuals with compromised immunity, such as HIV/AIDS patients, causing life-threatening meningoencephalitis. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has a defined <bold>a</bold>-α opposite sexual cycle; however, &gt;99% of isolates are of the α mating type. Interestingly, α cells can undergo α-α unisexual reproduction, even involving genotypically identical cells. A central question is: Why would cells mate with themselves given that sex is costly and typically serves to admix preexisting genetic diversity from genetically divergent parents? In this study, we demonstrate that α-α unisexual reproduction frequently generates phenotypic diversity, and the majority of these variant progeny are aneuploid. Aneuploidy is responsible for the observed phenotypic changes, as chromosome loss restoring euploidy results in a wild-type phenotype. Other genetic changes, including diploidization, chromosome length polymorphisms, SNPs, and indels, were also generated. Phenotypic/genotypic changes were not observed following asexual mitotic reproduction. Aneuploidy was also detected in progeny from <bold>a</bold>-α opposite-sex congenic mating; thus, both homothallic and heterothallic sexual reproduction can generate phenotypic diversity <italic>de novo</italic>. Our study suggests that the ability to undergo unisexual reproduction may be an evolutionary strategy for eukaryotic microbial pathogens, enabling <italic>de novo</italic> genotypic and phenotypic plasticity and facilitating rapid adaptation to novel environments.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Aneuploidy refers to increases or decreases in the copy number of individual chromosomes (rather than of the entire haploid or diploid genome). In humans, aneuploidy is well known to be deleterious, causing genetic disorders such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21), and frequently occurring during mitosis in the genesis of cancer. By contrast, aneuploidy in fungi can be advantageous, conferring antifungal drug resistance and enabling rapid adaptive evolution. <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is a globally distributed human pathogen that often infects patients with compromised immunity. It accounts for significant morbidity and mortality associated with HIV/AIDS and is linked to more than one million infections and &gt;600,000 deaths per year world-wide. Although <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has a defined heterosexual cycle involving <bold>a</bold> and α cells, more than 99% of clinical and environmental isolates are α. Interestingly, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> α cells undergo α-α unisexual reproduction to generate diploid intermediates and infectious haploid spores. Sex is costly, though, and the question therefore arises as to why <italic>C. neoformans</italic> would undergo selfing unisexual, meiotic reproduction as opposed to more efficient asexual, mitotic reproduction. We show here that unisexual, meiotic reproduction <italic>in C. neoformans</italic> results in aneuploidy, creating advantageous genetic diversity <italic>de novo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition in which cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes, can cause deleterious effects in organisms throughout the eukaryotic tree of life. Aneuploidy underlies several common human genetic diseases, including trisomy 21 in Down syndrome and trisomy 13 in Patau syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Patterson1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Patau1">[2]</xref>, and is detected in more than 90% of solid tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Weaver1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Gordon1">[4]</xref>. The presence of even a single extra chromosome in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) results in proliferative defects and metabolic aberrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Williams1">[5]</xref>. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, aneuploidy is often lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lindsley1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Hodgkin1">[7]</xref>, and in budding and fission yeasts, aneuploidy can inhibit cellular proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Torres1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Cetin1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, aneuploidy can be advantageous in fungi by conferring antifungal drug resistance and enabling rapid adaptive evolution. Aneuploidy evokes transcriptomic and proteomic changes in the model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Torres1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Pavelka1">[10]</xref>. Mutations in a deubiquitinating enzyme of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which arose during the evolution of an aneuploid isolate, leads to improved proliferation of many aneuploid strains, likely by promoting degradation of aberrant proteins produced in perturbed stoichiometric ratios <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Torres2">[11]</xref>. Rancanti et al. found that aneuploidy facilitated adaptive evolution in yeast cells lacking the conserved motor protein Myo1 involved in cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Rancati1">[12]</xref>. Moreover, it has been found that chromosomal duplication may confer a selective advantage to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> under stress conditions by promoting genomic instability and mutation, and although it is a transient solution, the short-lived aneuploid intermediate may also serve as a capacitator of evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Yona1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Sheltzer1">[14]</xref>. In the human pathogenic fungi <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, aneuploidy can confer resistance to commonly used antifungal drugs such as fluconazole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Selmecki1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-KwonChung1">[18]</xref>. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, haploids can even arise from concerted chromosome loss from diploid progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Hickman1">[19]</xref>. In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, an isochromosome 5 can arise in response to fluconazole treatment and confers drug resistance because the left arm of Chr 5 encodes Erg11 (lanosterol 14α demethylase), the target of fluconazole, and Tac1, a transcription factor that activates expression of drug export pumps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Selmecki1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Selmecki2">[17]</xref>. Similarly in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, Chr 1 disomy confers azole resistance because this chromosome harbors <italic>ERG11</italic> and <italic>AFR1</italic> (which encodes the major azole efflux pump) and aneuploidy can also influence the virulence of this pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Sionov1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Hu1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Hu2">[21]</xref>. Interestingly, a similar drug-resistance phenotype has been observed in the protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania</italic>, in which resistance to front line antimonial-based drugs similarly emerges via aneuploidy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Ubeda1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Leprohon1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>C. neoformans</italic> is a globally distributed human fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Heitman1">[24]</xref>. <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> predominantly infects individuals with compromised immunity, such as HIV/AIDS patients. The United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has reported that <italic>C. neoformans</italic> causes more than one million cases of cryptococcosis annually with more than 620,000 attributable mortalities, resulting in approximately one-third of all AIDS-associated deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Park1">[25]</xref>. This fungal pathogen has now surpassed tuberculosis as a common cause of death in Africa.</p>
<p><italic>C. neoformans</italic> is a basidiomycetous fungus that usually grows in the environment as a haploid, budding yeast. This species has a bipolar mating system with two mating types: <bold>a</bold> and α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-McClelland1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Hull1">[28]</xref>. In response to a variety of environmental conditions, <bold>a</bold> and α cells secrete lipid-modified pheromones that induce cell–cell fusion, and the resulting dikaryon undergoes a dimorphic transition to hyphal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Hull1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Xue1">[31]</xref>. Ultimately, the hyphal tips form basidia fruiting bodies wherein nuclear fusion and meiosis occur, and multiple rounds of mitosis and budding result in the production of four long chains of infectious spores decorating each basidium. These spores are readily aerosolized and cause infections in humans and animals when inhaled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Giles1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>While <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has a defined <bold>a</bold>-α opposite sexual cycle, &gt;99% of natural isolates are of the α mating type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-KwonChung3">[33]</xref>. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> var. <italic>neoformans</italic> (serotype D) α cells can undergo α-α unisexual reproduction to generate spores under laboratory conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin1">[34]</xref>. Recent population genetic studies provide evidence that multiple pathogenic lineages of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> var. <italic>grubii</italic> (serotype A) and the sibling species responsible for the Vancouver outbreak <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> (serotype B and C) undergo α-α sexual reproduction in nature, but this remains to be documented under laboratory culture conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Nielsen1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Wickes1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Bui1">[41]</xref>. Under nutrient-limiting conditions α haploid cells form a diploid or a haploid monokaryotic hyphae. The haploid hyphae grow to form basidia where a late diploidization event occurs. In the diploid hyphae diploidization of the nuclear content may be induced early and results in a diploid monokaryon that initiates hyphal growth and the formation of apical basidia. Early diploidization may occur through endoreplication or cell–cell fusion. Cell fusion, followed by nuclear fusion, may be induced in ménage à trois matings where <bold>a</bold> cells serve as pheromone donors to stimulate α-α fusion between genetically different or clonal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin1">[34]</xref>. Endoreplication may occur in cells that undergo DNA replication without cell division or they may undergo nuclear division and then fusion. In all cases, the resulting diploid nucleus undergoes meiosis and multiple rounds of mitosis generate the meiotic progeny, the basidiospores. In previous studies, we found that the key meiotic regulators, the endonuclease Spo11 and the meiotic recombinase Dmc1, are required for spore production and germination during unisexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Feretzaki1">[42]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>SPO11</italic> or <italic>DMC1</italic> severely impairs sporulation and the fewer meiotic progeny generated are largely inviable, providing further evidence that unisexual reproduction is a meiotic process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Feretzaki1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>Remarkably, unisexual reproduction has been recently discovered to occur in another common systemic human fungal pathogen, <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Alby1">[43]</xref>. <italic>C. albicans</italic> is known to undergo a parasexual cycle involving heterothallic fusion of α and <bold>a</bold> mating type cells followed by stochastic, concerted loss of chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Forche1">[44]</xref>. Similarly, fusion of α-α and <bold>a</bold>-<bold>a</bold> cell unions via homothallic parasexual reproduction occurs when a pheromone-degrading protease (Bar1) is inactivated or in ménage à trois matings, in which a third mating partner serves only as the pheromone donor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Alby1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>Sex is costly, and thus the question arises as to why <italic>C. neoformans</italic> or <italic>C. albicans</italic> would undergo inbreeding/selfing unisexual reproduction, which would limit the amount of genetic diversity inherited from the parents, as opposed to <bold>a</bold>-α sexual reproduction, which promotes outcrossing and genetic exchange. We hypothesize that unisexual reproduction is a hypermutagenic process that generates genetic diversity <italic>de novo</italic> and that the resulting progeny can thereby more rapidly adapt to changing environments than cells produced asexually by mitosis.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we isolated progeny generated via selfing α-α unisexual reproduction and subjected them to phenotypic and genotypic analyses. Remarkably, we found that α-α unisexual reproduction generates frequent phenotypic diversity, including temperature sensitivity, fluconazole resistance or sensitivity, and increased melanin production among other novel traits. Further comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis revealed that the majority of phenotypically diverse progeny are aneuploid. Phenotypic diversity is caused by this aneuploidy, as loss of the aneuploid chromosomes restored both euploidy and the wild-type parental phenotype. Aneuploidy and phenotypic variation was also found to occur at a similar rate following <bold>a</bold>-α bisexual reproduction but not as a result of mitotic asexual vegetative growth. Our findings show that sex can generate phenotypic and genotypic diversity <italic>de novo</italic> in the pathogenic yeast <italic>C. neoformans</italic> with implications for other eukaryotic microbes and pathogens, including other fungi and parasites that are common pathogens of humans.</p>

<title>Genomic Comparison of Parental Strain JEC21 and Its Hyperunisexual Selfing Progeny XL280</title>
<p>To investigate whether phenotypic and genotypic changes are generated by selfing unisexual reproduction, we analyzed the meiotic progeny produced via this process. To this end, we solo cultured the promiscuous, hypersexual haploid strain XL280α under conditions that support robust α-α unisexual reproduction (V8 media or FA (filament agar) for ∼2 weeks) and isolated spores by microdissection. The hyperfilamentous haploid strain XL280α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin4">[45]</xref> generates abundant hyphae, homozygous diploid intermediates, and haploid meiotic spores when grown on mating-inducing media all by itself.</p>
<p>Xl280 is a haploid F1 progeny descended from a cross between two exceptionally well-validated haploid sibling parental strains, whose genomes have been both sequenced, B3501α and JEC20<bold>a</bold> (which is isogenic to the sequenced strain JEC21α, with the exception of the mating-type locus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin4">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Heitman2">[47]</xref>. Thus, while XL280α shares markers with both parents, it only has one copy of each chromosome (it is haploid) and is not heterozygous anywhere in its genome. When it undergoes unisexual reproduction with itself, it forms a transient homozygous diploid (generated through either α-α cell fusion between mother and daughter cell or via endoreplication) that is identical throughout the diploid, euploid genome, in which each gene is present in two identical copies.</p>

<p>Hyphae produced by unisexual reproduction grow to form terminal basidia wherein the diploid nucleus undergoes meiosis to generate abundant recombinant progeny. That this is a meiotic process has been established in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Feretzaki1">[42]</xref> that showed both key meiotic genes <italic>SPO11</italic> and <italic>DMC1</italic> are required for spore production and viability. The parental strains B3501α and JEC20<bold>a</bold> share ∼50% genetic identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Loftus1">[46]</xref>; thus, their F1 progeny (XL280) would be expected to share ∼75% genetic identity with both B3501α and JEC21α, whose genomes have been sequenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Loftus1">[46]</xref>. Therefore, we used the available JEC21 genomic sequence and genome microarray slides as a foundation to study the genome of XL280 and its α-α unisexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Schein1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Kraus1">[49]</xref>.</p>

In total, 47,891,302 sequences (paired-end reads) of 75 bp in length were generated, providing 160-fold coverage of the XL280 genomic sequence, which was then analyzed using the known JEC21 genome as the reference for the sequence assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s016">Table S1</xref>). All but 4,535,426 sequence reads (∼10%) were used in the genome assembly, and of these remaining reads, the majority were of low quality (90%). We assembled the Illumina reads using a combination of <italic>de novo</italic> assembly (Velvet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Zerbino1">[51]</xref>) and reference genome assembly (BWA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Li1">[52]</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for detailed procedure).</p>
<p>XL280 shares 100% identity with JEC21 over 81% of the overall genome and is 99.88% identical at the sequence level overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Among the SNPs and small indels identified, 9,021 were located in exonic regions, 10,254 in intergenic regions, nine in tRNA genes, and 3,849 in intronic regions (31 of which differed in the 5′ splice-site and 23 in the 3′ splice-site) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s017">Table S2</xref>). Among the exonic SNPs and indels, 107 SNPs resulted in the introduction or deletion of stop codons, 68 indels resulted in a frame shift, 14 indels resulted in the loss of amino acids without a frame shift, and 3,943 SNPs resulted in nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in 960 ORFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s017">Table S2</xref>). Further analysis of the modified ORFs will enable the elucidation of the phenotypic differences between XL280 and JEC21, for example with respect to the hypersexual phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin4">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>CGH was performed using a 70-mer oligonucleotide microarray covering all predicted ORFs of the JEC21 genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Kraus1">[49]</xref> to detect chromosome copy number alterations. Based on CGH, the genomes of XL280 and JEC21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) are quite similar and span 14 conserved, linear chromosomes. This enabled use of JEC21-based microarray slides for CGH analysis of XL280 unisexual progeny. Because this microarray covers only ORFs, no differences could be detected in centromeric or telomeric regions. There is an ∼28 kb region absent in XL280; in JEC21 this sequence lies near the right end of Chr 5 and is conserved in many <italic>C. neoformans</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Kavanaugh1">[53]</xref>. In addition, XL280 is missing one copy of the left end of either Chr 8 or 12, which is a 63-kb duplicated region located on both Chr 8 and 12 of JEC21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Fraser1">[54]</xref>.

<p>The chromosome content of strain XL280 was compared to JEC21 by clamped homogenous electric field (CHEF) gel electrophoresis to detect any chromosomal translocations. Chr 5 and Chr 8/9 of XL280 are smaller than those of JEC21, while Chr 13 of XL280 is larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). To ascertain where the sequence similarity of these chromosomes lies, we excised each chromosomal band and performed band array analysis. The configurations of Chr 9 and 12 differed between XL280 and JEC21 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Chr 9 of XL280 hybridized to Chr 8 and Chr 12 of JEC21; Chr 12 of XL280 hybridized to Chr 8 of JEC21. These findings were confirmed by Southern hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Previous studies reported that this chromosomal translocation and duplication occurred during generation of the JEC21α/JEC20<bold>a</bold> congenic strain pair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Fraser1">[54]</xref>. During the cross of strains B3501α×B3502<bold>a</bold>, Chr 9 and Chr 12 formed a dicentric chromosome via telomere–telomere fusion and then broke to form new versions of Chr 12 and Chr 8 in strains JEC21/JEC20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Fraser1">[54]</xref>. Our results indicate that Chr 9 and Chr 12 of XL280 are more similar to those of the B3501α parent, whereas other chromosomes are more similar to the JEC20<bold>a</bold> parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). This comprehensive analysis of the XL280 genome reveals how its genome is derived from two well-validated parental reference strains and allowed detailed molecular analyses of unisexual progeny.</p>

<title>Frequent Phenotypic and Genotypic Changes Following <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Unisexual Reproduction</title>
<p>Solo culture of strain XL280 on V8 sexual reproduction-inducing media resulted in robust production of F1 meiotic spore progeny via selfing α-α unisexual reproduction. This process involves ploidy changes (1n→2n→1n) via self cell–cell fusion or endoreplication, meiosis, and sporulation to produce haploid meiotic progeny. In total, 90 α-α unisexual reproduction meiotic progeny were isolated by spore micromanipulation and germination and were examined in a battery of phenotypic analyses. We assessed major virulence factors of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (growth at 37°C and melanin production on niger seed (NS) or L-DOPA media), sensitivity to the antifungal drugs fluconazole (FLC) or FK506, and unisexual reproduction (self-filamentous growth) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In these analyses, six of 90 F1 progeny (∼7%) showed a distinct phenotype compared to the haploid parental strain XL280 and the remaining 84 progeny showed no phenotypic differences from the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The six isolated variant F1 progeny strains all exhibited temperature-sensitive (TS) growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Two progeny (MN77 and MN89) were sensitive to the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 and produced more melanin, indicating they may have similar genetic changes. MN35 was FLC-sensitive, while the other four progeny (MN27, MN55, MN77, and MN89) were relatively FLC-resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). On V8 mating-inducing media (V8 agar), MN27 underwent more robust unisexual development, while MN35, MN55, MN77, and MN89 generated fewer hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Although the two genomes of cells undergoing α-α unisexual reproduction are identical, phenotypic changes to these and other conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s004">Figure S4</xref>) are clearly evident in even a relatively small sample of progeny produced by this process, which indicates that α-α unisexual reproduction generates phenotypic plasticity <italic>de novo</italic> since there is no preexisting genetic diversity to admix.</p>

<title>Unisexual reproduction generates phenotypic diversity.</title>
<p>(A) Progeny produced by α-α unisexual reproduction of strain XL280 in solo cultures were grown in 10-fold serial dilution assays and under the following conditions: YPD at 30°C for 2 d; YPD at 37°C for 2 d; YPD plus 1 µg/mL FK506 at 30°C for 2 d; YPD plus 8 µg/mL fluconazole (FLC) at 30°C for 6 d; NS (melanin-inducing media) at 30°C for 3 d; and V8 pH = 7 (mating-inducing media) at room temperature for 11 d. (B) Diploid progeny were generated infrequently following unisexual reproduction. Flow cytometry profiles of cells stained with the fluorescent dye propidium iodide. JEC21 (1n, haploid control); XL143 (2n, diploid control); XL280 (1n); MN27 (2n, the only diploid strain identified among the 90 XL280 α-α unisexual reproduction progeny (1.1%). All other XL280 α-α unisexual progeny were haploid (or aneuploid) (e.g., MN55). Nuclear DNA content is indicated by 1n (haploid) and 2n (diploid).

This complementation test shows that the TS phenotype of MN7 is attributable to the recessive <italic>hsc20-1</italic> mutation.</p>

<p>We next tested if standard mitotic growth might also lead to phenotypic changes like meiotic unisexual reproduction. A similar set of 96 isolates derived from XL280 by mitotic asexual growth exhibited no phenotypic variation from wild-type in the same battery of phenotypic tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s005">Figure S5</xref>) in which phenotypic variation was readily detected in meiotic unisexual reproduction. Thus, we conclude that phenotypic variation occurs following meiotic unisex but not standard mitotic asexual growth.</p>
<p>Phenotypic variation is often attributable to genetic changes. To establish the molecular basis of phenotypic variation of the unisexual progeny, we examined changes in ploidy, whole-chromosome aneuploidy, chromosomal translocations, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by FACS, CGH, CHEF, and Illumina NGS, respectively. FACS analysis revealed that the hypersexual progeny MN27 was diploid, in accord with previous findings that diploid strains are (1) intermediates or products of unisexual reproduction and (2) hyperfilamentous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin1">[34]</xref>. None of the other 90 F1 α-α unisexually produced progeny were diploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and unpublished data).</p>
<p>Three progeny (MN7, MN55, and MN89) were analyzed by Illumina NGS to examine the presence of SNPs. In total, only three SNPs were identified in the ∼20 Mb genomes of the three isolates based on 48,644,802 sequences of 75 bp generated for MN7, 46,089,962 for MN55, and 44,650,780 for MN89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). One SNP located at position 878,429 on Chr 7 of MN55 resulted in an L318P coding substitution in the hypothetical protein CNJ03170. A second SNP was located at position 491,632 on Chr 8 in both MN7 and MN55, resulting in a cytosine to thymine change in the 5′ UTR of the CNH02880 gene. The third SNP was located at position 704,393 on Chr 9 of MN7 and resulted in an H66A amino-acid substitution in the co-chaperone Hsc20 (CNI02610), a heat shock protein that functions in iron–sulfur cluster assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Uhrigshardt1">[55]</xref>. To examine whether this SNP is responsible for the TS phenotype of isolate MN7, we performed a complementation test by introducing the WT allele of <italic>HSC20</italic> into the MN7 TS strain. We first documented that the <italic>hsc20-1</italic> mutant allele is recessive based on analysis of an <italic>hsc20-1</italic>/<italic>HSC20</italic> diploid fusion product of MN7 and XL280α. While the MN7 strain is TS, the MN7×XL280α diploid fusion product was temperature resistant, similar to the XL280α parent. The WT allele of <italic>HSC20</italic> was cloned in a plasmid under control of its native promoter and terminator and introduced into strain MN7 by biolistic transformation. In multiple independent transformants, we found that a single copy of the WT <italic>HSC20</italic> allele complemented the TS phenotype of MN7 and restored WT growth similar to the XL280α parent at higher temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Based on these findings we conclude that the TS phenotype of progeny MN7 is attributable to the H66A amino-acid substitution in the co-chaperone Hsc20.</p>
<p>Based on CHEF analysis of the chromosomal karyotype, chromosome size differences were detected in the α-α unisexual F1 progeny MN27, MN55, and MN89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). For MN27 and MN55, an extra chromosomal band was present and migrated more rapidly than Chr 8/9. For MN89, an extra chromosomal band was observed to migrate more rapidly than Chr 6/7. To further analyze these anomalous chromosomes, we excised the novel chromosomal bands from the CHEF gel and extracted and fluorescently labeled the DNA to generate probes. Band CGH analysis revealed that the excised chromosomal bands covered all ORF regions (the JEC21 expression array covers ORF and not centromeric or telomeric regions) of Chr 9, Chr 9, or Chr 7 in isolates MN27, MN55, or MN89, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) (XL280 Chr 9 hybridizes to Chr 8 and 12 on the JEC21 array). Because all ORFs were recognized despite a shortened chromosomal length, we hypothesized that centromeric or telomeric regions (not represented on the array) may have suffered significant deletions in the respective strains. To test this hypothesis, we chose MN89 as an example and designed specific probes that hybridize to the centromeric and telomeric regions of Chr 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Restriction enzyme digestion of whole chromosomes and CHEF electrophoresis followed by Southern hybridization revealed that Chr 7 of MN89 has the same telomere lengths as those of XL280, but a shortened centromeric region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Further whole genome sequencing determined that the size of the deleted centromeric region is 10,257 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<title>α-α Unisexual Reproduction Frequently Generates Aneuploidy</title>
<p>CGH analysis of the phenotypically variant progeny revealed that four out of six isolates (66.7%) were aneuploid.

<title>Aneuploidy is generated at a high rate by unisexual reproduction.</title>
<p>(A) CGH array data for four progeny with novel phenotypes. Progeny strains MN35, MN55, MN77, and MN89 contain an extra copy of Chr 13, Chr 9, Chr 10, and Chr 10, respectively.

<p>As a complementary approach to CGH, we developed a facile multiplex PCR-based method to detect aneuploidy. In this approach, 14 primer pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s018">Table S3</xref>) were combined into a single PCR reaction such that each primer pair represents a separate chromosome and amplifies a specific region of different sizes to generate a ladder of 100 to 1400 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). PCR products of greater intensity reflect the presence of extra chromosomes (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Bioanalyzer analysis further confirmed a ∼2-fold increase in PCR product yield from the additional aneuploid chromosomes present in 1n+1 isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Using multiplex PCR we screened all of the XL280 meiotic (90) and mitotic (96) progeny and we did not detect any additional aneuploid strains from the meiotic progeny and none from the mitotic progeny (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s007">Figure S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, strains aneuploid for different chromosomes all share several common phenotypes, including temperature sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Torres1">[8]</xref>. Therefore, we determined whether aneuploid strains of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> exhibit a similar phenotype.

<p>Aneuploidy can compromise growth unless it provides a fitness benefit under stress or other distinct conditions. We found that aneuploid strains exhibit a variety of phenotypes potentially associated with virulence, including antifungal drug resistance. To test if the progeny have a competitive advantage relative to the parental strain, we co-incubated an aneuploid progeny (MN55, MN77, or MN89) with the wild-type parent XL280α (marked with the NAT drug resistance marker) in the presence of fluconazole. As expected, the fluconazole-resistant aneuploid progeny exhibited an increased competitive fitness and outgrew the parental strain in competitive growth assays by a ratio of ∼4∶1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) XL280 meiotic progeny were grown in YPD, diluted 10-fold in water, spotted, and incubated under the following conditions: YPD at 30°C for 2 d, YPD at 37°C for 2 d, and YPD plus 8 µg/mL fluconazole (FLC) at 30°C for 6 d. (B) Three aneuploid strains exhibited increased competitive fitness in competition assays. An XL280 strain marked with a <italic>NAT</italic> resistance marker integrated in the <italic>SPO11</italic> genetic locus was mixed together at equal abundance with XL280, MN55 (n+1<sup>9</sup>), MN77 (n+1<sup>10</sup>), or MN89 (n+1<sup>10</sup>).

However, in the presence of fluconazole the growth rate of the aneuploid strains was significantly higher than the wild-type.</p>

<p>Moreover, to investigate the fitness of these aneuploid unisexual progeny, we tested their ability to infect and cause disease in a murine inhalation model. Mice were infected with the aneuploid strains via intranasal instillation and monitored for signs of pulmonary cryptococcosis or meningoencephalitis. In contrast to the view that aneuploidy is deleterious, the aneuploid unisexually generated isolates MN35 (n+1<sup>13</sup>) and MN55 (n+1<sup>9</sup>) were as virulent as the euploid wild-type parent, despite their modest TS growth at 37°C on YPD rich media <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Previous studies have shown that in the clinically important sibling species <italic>C. neoformans</italic> var. <italic>grubii</italic> (serotype A) strains that are disomic for chromosome 13 exhibit a melanin defect and impaired virulence in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Hu2">[21]</xref>. However, we found that disomy 13 in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> var. <italic>neoformans</italic> (serotype D) did not affect melanin production and the MN35 strain was equally virulent as the wild-type. Thus, the specific consequences of aneuploidy may differ between even closely related lineages. Two other aneuploid strains (MN77 and MN89) were both attenuated compared to wild-type and, interestingly, both are aneuploid for chromosome 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Cells isolated from lungs of infected animals exhibited relatively stable aneuploid phenotypes and were found to retain their aneuploid chromosome in 70–80% of isolates based on multiplex PCR [20 isolates were analyzed from each strain, 15 were aneuploid for MN35 (75%), 16 for MN55 (80%), 14 for MN77 (70%), and 15 for MN89 (75%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s009">Figure S9</xref>)]. Thus, under the stressful gauntlet of the host, several aneuploid progeny appeared as fit as the euploid parent whereas others were attenuated.</p>

<p>To examine whether the observed phenotypic changes are a consequence of aneuploidy, we compared the phenotype of aneuploid strains and euploid derivatives obtained following loss of the extra chromosome. Aneuploid strains are relatively unstable and frequently lose the 1n+1 extra chromosomal copy to return to the 1n haploid euploid state. Here, we analyzed isolate MN77, which contains an extra copy of Chr 10 and produces increased amounts of melanin, a readily scorable phenotype. We grew MN77 at 37°C to promote loss of the extra chromosome and isolated 22 randomly selected colonies for phenotypic and genotypic testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Of these 22 isolates, 14 lost the extra copy of Chr 10 based on multiplex PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), and in all cases concomitantly lost the enhanced melanin production phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), therefore suggesting that Chr 10 disomy is responsible for the higher level of melanin produced. The remaining eight isolates that retained the Chr 10 aneuploidy all continued to produce higher levels of melanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). To test whether Chr 10 disomy is also correlated with other phenotypes, we performed growth dilution assays with fluconazole (at 30°C), FK506 (at 30°C), and for growth at 37°C. Similar to the melanin phenotype, all isolates that had lost the extra copy of Chr 10 exhibited WT phenotypes similar to the XL280 parent, and all isolates that retained the extra copy of Chr 10 exhibited the variant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Similar experiments were performed for isolates MN35 (n+1<sup>13</sup>) and MN55 (n+1<sup>9</sup>), and we found that loss of the extra chromosome was linked with loss of the variant phenotypes (fluconazole sensitivity and fluconazole resistance, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s010">Figure S10</xref>). These results indicate that aneuploidy causes the phenotypic changes observed in disomic strains.</p>

<p>To test whether the generation of aneuploidy is specific to α-α unisexual reproduction, we isolated progeny from asexual mitotic reproduction and <bold>a</bold>-α opposite-sexual reproduction. We isolated 96 single colonies from yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) media following asexual mitotic reproduction and from spores produced on V8 agar following <bold>a</bold>-α sexual reproduction.

<p>To test <bold>a</bold>-α sexual reproduction, we first investigated 88 F1 progeny from the cross between strains XL280α and JEC20<bold>a</bold>.

As these strains are ∼81% congenic, but not isogenic, they exhibit different phenotypes under various conditions, and their progeny (88 were examined) showed a range of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Among 11 strains that had the most overt phenotypic changes, four were aneuploid and no other aneuploids were detected in the larger progeny set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001653-g009">Figure 9A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While sexual reproduction serves to admix genetic diversity from two distinct parents to produce progeny with a diverse genetic repertoire, sex also comes with a series of costs. Such costs include: (1) metabolic energy that must be devoted to mating and meiosis; (2) energy and time expended locating a mating partner; (3) that only 50% of parental genes are transmitted to any given progeny or that two individuals are required to produce one progeny (resulting in the so-called 2-fold cost of sex); and (4) the fact that two genomes that have run the gauntlet of adaptive selection are shuffled during the process, breaking apart well-adapted genomic configurations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Otto1">[57]</xref>. A central question then is: Why would an organism engage in unisexual reproduction? In some examples, unisex involves two genetically distinct α mating partners, and this leads to genetic exchange and the production of recombinant progeny, similar to <bold>a</bold>-α sexual reproduction. Also, α-α mating lowers the barrier to finding a rare mate in a predominantly α population, enabling outcrossing even if no <bold>a</bold> partners are available. But in other cases, an α isolate undergoes unisexual reproduction all by itself (via cell–cell fusion or endoreplication), and in these cases <italic>there is no pre-existing genetic diversity to admix</italic>. If there is no heterozygosity of the diploid undergoing meiosis, why undergo sex if the genome is homozygous everywhere?</p>
<p>As shown here, our studies provide direct experimental support for the hypothesis that unisexual reproduction can generate phenotypic and genotypic diversity <italic>de novo</italic>. Why might this be of selective and adaptive benefit? In the context of considering the costs of sexual reproduction, unisexual reproduction is one strategy by which several of the costs normally associated with sex can be lessened or mitigated entirely. First, the cost of finding a mating partner is considerably decreased in the case of mother–daughter cell mating in which the two cells are physically juxtaposed or eliminated entirely, such as in endoreplication, in which a single cell transitions from haploid to diploid as a prelude to meiosis. Second, during selfing unisexual reproduction, ∼100% of the parental genes are directly transmitted to the F1 progeny, thus reducing the 2-fold cost of sex. Further, if one considers aneuploidy, &gt;100% of the parental genes are transmitted to progeny. Third, unisexual reproduction eliminates the cost of sex associated with breaking apart well-adapted genomic configurations. Instead, unisexual reproduction preserves well-adapted genotypes by allowing mating between genetically identical cells (i.e., mother and daughter cells) and adding a limited amount of genetic diversity (including aneuploidy, chromosomal size polymorphisms/deletions, and SNPs) to a well-adapted genotype. In essence, unisexual reproduction provides a mechanism by which a well-adapted genotype can be changed much more subtly than standard sexual outcrossing, and in the case of well-adapted genotypes has the capacity to provide a more parsimonious route to progeny that are enhanced in competitive fitness in response to subtle changes in environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Organisms that reproduce sexually have an advantage over organisms that reproduce asexually, as preexisting genetic diversity will generate novel combinations in the population. Meiosis, through homologous recombination, will generate distinct genetic compositions that may have a selective advantage over the parents in a new hostile environment. Unisexual reproduction is a sexual cycle that can occur between genetically identical cells and, as we observed here, allows the introduction of limited <italic>de novo</italic> genetic diversity through meiosis. As in most species, meiosis in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> is a highly regulated process. Comparative genomics reveals that <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species contain the meiotic genes involved in homologous recombination and synaptonemal complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Loftus1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-DSouza1">[58]</xref>. The genes that support the presence of a meiotic pathway (termed the meiotic toolkit genes: <italic>DMC1</italic>, <italic>MND1</italic>, <italic>MSH4</italic>, <italic>MSH5</italic>, <italic>SPO11</italic>, <italic>HOP1</italic>, <italic>HOP2</italic>, and <italic>REC8</italic>) are highly conserved in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, and two of these (<italic>SPO11</italic> and <italic>DMC1</italic>) have been found to be critical for sporulation and spore germination during unisexual reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Lin1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Feretzaki1">[42]</xref>.</p>
<p>Sex-induced phenotypic and genotypic variation in a clonal population is not restricted to the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> genus. <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> is a filamentous ascomycete that, along with its well-established sexual cycle, also has a parasexual cycle wherein haploid mycelia fuse and then their nuclei fuse to form diploid nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Pontecorvo1">[59]</xref>. In the parasexual cycle, the diploid mycelium undergoes a transient aneuploid state by repeated loss of whole chromosomes to ultimately regenerate haploid progeny. A recent study has shown that the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> parasexual cycle can drive adaptive evolution. Hoekstra and colleagues generated homozygous diploid strains that were isogenic with their haploid progenitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Schoustra1">[60]</xref>. In a laboratory setting, faster growing variants frequently arose from the homozygous diploid strains but not from their haploid parents. Remarkably, all of the faster growing variants derived from a diploid parent were found to be haploids that arose through the parasexual cycle. As few as 3,000 generations were sufficient for the emergence of more rapid growth. Through genetic analysis, this study supported a model wherein the diploid serves as a capacitator for evolution. This enables recessive mutations to arise sequentially in the sheltered state of the diploid where they are complemented, and these mutations do not survive in the haploid because they are individually deleterious and swept from the population before a second mutation can arise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Schoustra1">[60]</xref>. The parasexual state assorts and releases these mutations into the haploid state, where they exhibit reverse epistasis and only when in combination confer a benefit (i.e., faster growth), whereas individually each recessive mutation was deleterious. If parasexual cycles can function as capacitators to generate, store, and then release genotypic and phenotypic diversity <italic>de novo</italic>, we propose that sexual cycles, including unisexual reproduction, might also serve such a role in which meiosis rather than parasexual chromosome loss is involved.</p>
<p>A similar unisexual selfing mechanism has been observed in the human fungal pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Alby et al. found that <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> cells of <italic>C. albicans</italic> lacking the Bar1 protease that destroys the α-factor mating pheromone undergo <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold>-<bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> unisexual mating, yielding tetraploids that can undergo concerted chromosome loss to complete a parasexual cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Alby1">[43]</xref>. In addition, the parasexual cycle is induced between two <bold>a</bold>/<bold>a</bold> mating partners when mixed in ménage a trois matings with a limited number of α/α cells that serve as pheromone donors to trigger unisexual <bold>a</bold>-<bold>a</bold> reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Alby1">[43]</xref>. However, the parasexual progeny of <italic>C. albicans</italic> are characterized by high rates of aneuploidy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Forche1">[44]</xref>. Although this chromosomal assortment process is imprecise, it may be retained due to a selective pressure that favors aneuploid strains under certain environmental conditions, such as in patients receiving fluconazole, a situation in which an isochromosome 5 derivative that confers drug resistance often arises <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Selmecki1">[15]</xref>. Aneuploidy has been linked to phenotypic changes, including resistance to antifungal drugs in both <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, which could provide a selective advantage during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Selmecki1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Selmecki2">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The positive impact of aneuploidy on evolution and genetic diversification extends beyond the fungal kingdom to other unicellular eukaryotes. The parasitic protozoan <italic>Leishmania</italic> is the etiological agent behind one of the most common neglected diseases, leishmaniasis, a global cause of morbidity and mortality. No vaccine is available, and treatment relies heavily on pentavalent antimonial compounds with diminishing efficacy due to emerging drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Rojas1">[61]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that aneuploidy is widespread in natural and clinical populations, with variation in the ploidy state (monosomic, disomic, or trisomic) for different chromosomes even within the same isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Sterkers1">[62]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Mannaert1">[63]</xref>. Mosaic aneuploidy in <italic>Leishmania</italic> generates dynamic genome plasticity, is well tolerated, and can confer drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Ubeda1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001653-Sterkers1">[62]</xref>, analogous to fungal azole resistance conferred by aneuploidy.</p>
<p>Given the finding that aneuploidy can underlie and drive adaptive evolution in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, and <italic>Leishmania</italic>, it seems likely that beneficial impacts of aneuploidy may be even more ubiquitous and remain to be discovered in other saprobic and pathogenic eukaryotic microbes.</p>

<title>Genomic Sequence Assembly Protocol</title>
<p>The Illumina-Solexa data were assembled using a combination of <italic>de novo</italic> assembly (Velvet) and reference genome assembly (BWA) to assemble the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> genomic sequence. We used BWA and SAMtools to determine the depth of sequence coverage and identify polymorphisms, particularly SNPs and indels. In addition to the use of BWA for reference genome assembly, we checked the completeness of the assemblies by extracting all sequence reads that BWA was unable to align to the reference genome and assembled these reads using Velvet. The resulting contigs were compared back to the genome sequence and also used to search GenBank using Blast. This method allows identification of regions with multiple polymorphisms that cannot be identified by BWA due to the inability of the short reads to be aligned to the reference sequence. In addition, these contigs typically originate from highly repetitive sequence, such as the rDNA and telomeres. With this <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> dataset, more than 90% of the unaligned reads were low-quality sequence reads. Overall, the assembly was an iterative process. After polymorphisms were identified in an initial round of sequence assembly with BWA and Velvet, a new consensus sequence was generated, and the assembly was repeated. In the second and subsequent rounds of assembly, polymorphisms were identified in regions where there were multiple polymorphisms. After several rounds, no additional polymorphisms were identified, and the assembly was considered complete (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001653.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

The cells of the inoculum were diluted and plated onto YPD medium to determine CFU and viability. Mice were monitored twice daily, and moribund individuals were euthanized with CO<sub>2</sub>. The survival rates were plotted against time using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, generated with Prism 4.0 (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The <italic>p</italic> values were evaluated by a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. A <italic>p</italic> value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. The lungs and brains of the euthanized animals were removed, weighed, and homogenized in 2 ml sterile PBS. The samples were serial diluted and plated on YPD media to count CFUs. Twenty random isolates were colony purified and subjected to multiplex PCR to detect aneuploidy.</p>

<title>Competitive Fitness and Growth Curve Assays</title>
<p>XL280, MN55, MN77, MN89 (all NAT sensitive), and XL280 marked with the NAT resistance marker integrated at the <italic>SPO11</italic> genetic locus (XL280 <italic>NAT</italic>) were used to measure the competitive fitness of the aneuploid strains in the presence of fluconazole. Strains were grown overnight in liquid cultures in YPD, washed with sterile water, and diluted to a density of 1×10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. The following strains were mixed in equal ratios: XL280 with XL280 <italic>NAT</italic>, MN55 with XL280 <italic>NAT</italic>, MN77 with XL280 <italic>NAT</italic>, and MN89 with XL280 <italic>NAT</italic>. The mixtures were spotted on YPD and YPD plus 8 µg/mL fluconazole (FLC) and incubated for 3 d at 30°C. Then, the cells were recovered from the plates, washed with sterile water, and plated on YPD to count CFUs. Following 2 d incubation at 30°C, 300 isolates were replica plated onto NAT selective media and survival rates were calculated. The experiments were conducted in triplicate. For the growth curve assays, the strains were grown overnight in liquid cultures, washed with sterile water, and diluted into 4×10<sup>4</sup> cells in 200 µl of YPD and YPD plus 2 µg/mL fluconazole (fluconazole concentration was determined experimentally). The cells were incubated at room temperature in 96-well plates, and OD<sub>600</sub> was measured every 2 h for 48 h using a Tecan-Sunrise microplate reader. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>

<p><bold>NGS data analysis pipeline.</bold> Approximately 48 million 75 bp reads were aligned to the reference genome (JEC21) representing ∼160× coverage. By performing BWA and SAM tools analysis, we detected SNPs and small indels. Unaligned reads were assembled <italic>de novo</italic> by Velvet analysis and blasted against the reference genome. The new genome was assembled by replacing SNPs. The reads were again aligned to newly assembled genome assemblies to further detect any SNPs that escaped the previous round of analysis. The whole cycle was repeated 30 times to assemble the XL280 genome.</p>
