<p>This study identifies an unusual sulfur-based chemical as a novel and specific inhibitor of the tyrosine phosphatase STEP and shows that it can improve the cognitive function of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>STEP (STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase) is a neuron-specific phosphatase that regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) trafficking, as well as ERK1/2, p38, Fyn, and Pyk2 activity. STEP is overactive in several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The increase in STEP activity likely disrupts synaptic function and contributes to the cognitive deficits in AD. AD mice lacking STEP have restored levels of glutamate receptors on synaptosomal membranes and improved cognitive function, results that suggest STEP as a novel therapeutic target for AD. Here we describe the first large-scale effort to identify and characterize small-molecule STEP inhibitors. We identified the benzopentathiepin 8-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,4,5-benzopentathiepin-6-amine hydrochloride (known as TC-2153) as an inhibitor of STEP with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 24.6 nM. TC-2153 represents a novel class of PTP inhibitors based upon a cyclic polysulfide pharmacophore that forms a reversible covalent bond with the catalytic cysteine in STEP. In cell-based secondary assays, TC-2153 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STEP substrates ERK1/2, Pyk2, and GluN2B, and exhibited no toxicity in cortical cultures. Validation and specificity experiments performed in wild-type (WT) and STEP knockout (KO) cortical cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> in WT and STEP KO mice suggest specificity of inhibitors towards STEP compared to highly homologous tyrosine phosphatases. Furthermore, TC-2153 improved cognitive function in several cognitive tasks in 6- and 12-mo-old triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice, with no change in beta amyloid and phospho-tau levels.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>A series of recent studies have found that the levels of the enzyme striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) are raised in several different neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, fragile X syndrome, and schizophrenia. STEP normally opposes the development of synaptic strengthening, and these abnormally high levels of active STEP disrupt synaptic function by removing phosphate groups from a number of proteins, including several glutamate receptors and kinases. Dephosphorylation results in internalization of the glutamate receptors and inactivation of the kinases—events that disrupt the consolidation of memories. Here we identify the benzopentathiepin 8-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,4,5-benzopentathiepin-6-amine hydrochloride (known as TC-2153) as a novel inhibitor of STEP. We show that the mechanism of action involves the formation of a reversible covalent bond between the inhibitor and the catalytic cysteine residue of STEP, and we demonstrate the activity of TC-2153 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. TC-2153 shows specificity towards STEP compared to several other tyrosine phosphatases and shows no toxicity to cultured neurons. Importantly, the compound reversed cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease in a way that did not involve changes in the usual pathological signs (p-tau and beta-amyloid).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP) (<italic>PTPN5</italic>) is a brain-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) targeted in part to postsynaptic terminals of excitatory glutamatergic synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Lombroso1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Oyama1">[4]</xref>. Recent studies indicate that STEP is overactive in Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia, and fragile X syndrome (FXS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Chin1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-GoebelGoody1">[9]</xref>. The emergent model based on these findings suggests that the increase in STEP activity interferes with synaptic strengthening and contributes to the characteristic cognitive and behavioral deficits present in these disorders.</p>
<p>Elevated levels of STEP activity disrupt synaptic function by dephosphorylation of STEP substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-GoebelGoody2">[10]</xref>. These include mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members ERK1/2 and p38 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Munoz1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Paul1">[12]</xref>, the tyrosine kinases Fyn and Pyk2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Nguyen1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Xu1">[14]</xref>, the glutamate receptor GluN2B subunit of NMDARs (formerly termed NR2B) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Snyder1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Xu2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Zhang1">[16]</xref>, and the GluA2 subunit of AMPAR (formerly termed GluR2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Zhang1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Zhang2">[18]</xref>. STEP dephosphorylates the kinases at regulatory tyrosine residues within their activation loop and thereby inactivates them. Dephosphorylation of GluN2B promotes internalization of GluN1/GluN2B receptors, whereas dephosphorylation of GluA2 promotes internalization of GluA1/GluA2 receptors.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis that the observed overexpression of STEP disrupts synaptic strengthening in AD, we crossed STEP KO mice with the 3xTg-AD and Tg2576 AD mouse models. Six-month-old progeny null for STEP displayed significant decreases in biochemical and cognitive deficits, despite continued elevated levels of Aβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Zhang1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Davidson1">[19]</xref>. These data validated STEP as a target for drug discovery. Herein we describe the search for small-molecule STEP inhibitors. We performed a high throughput screen that culminated in the identification of the benzopentathiepin 8-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,4,5-benzopentathiepin-6-amine hydrochloride (known as TC-2153) as a novel STEP inhibitor. TC-2153 exhibited specificity for STEP <italic>in vitro</italic>, in cell-based assays, and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and also reversed cognitive deficits in 6- and 12-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice.</p>

<title>Initial High Throughput Screening for STEP Inhibitors</title>
<p>We initially screened ∼150,000 compounds from the Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration library using <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as the target substrate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001923.s015">Text S1</xref> for more information on assay development and secondary screens). Eight compounds were selected for further characterization based on chemical structure and IC<sub>50</sub> values, which ranged between 1 µM and 9.7 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001923.s012">Table S1</xref>), and studies of these molecules indicated potent inhibition of STEP activity in neuronal cultures and cortical tissue after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections in WT mice. However, following resynthesis of several of the lead compounds, we found that they all exhibited essentially no inhibitory activity towards STEP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001923.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We therefore tested the possibility that a “contaminant” in the commercial preparations of the lead compounds was inhibiting STEP activity. To address this issue, we performed preparative HPLC on Compound <bold>3</bold> and tested eluted fractions for activity against STEP in the pNPP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Compound <bold>3</bold> appeared as a major peak (fraction 7) on the reverse-phase HPLC preparation and had no inhibitory activity against STEP compared to a second peak that appeared as a late minor peak (fraction 32) that was a potent inhibitor of STEP. Given the high apparent lipophilicity of the unknown, the supplied material was extracted with hexane and recrystallized from methanol. Small pale yellow needle-shaped crystals (0.5–1 cm in length) were obtained in approximately 1% yield. The isolated crystalline material displayed the same HPLC retention, UV absorbance, and STEP inhibitory properties as the initially collected late-eluting peak. The crystalline compound was characterized by X-ray crystallography and found to be sulfur (S<sub>8</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Commercially purchased Compound <bold>3</bold> was dissolved in methanol at 10 mg/mL, and 300 µL portions were injected onto a Zorbax (Agilent) 5 µm 300SB-C18 column (0.94×25 cm, 3 mL/min 75% methanol/25% pH 4.0 0.1 M ammonium acetate). Thirty-five fractions (3 mL each) were collected, evaporated, and reconstituted in 100 µL of DMSO. Fractions were tested with pNPP assays to determine inhibition of STEP activity by using 0.1 µL of each fraction and 100 nM of STEP protein in 96-well plates. DMSO alone was used as a control.

<p>S<sub>8</sub> is poorly soluble in aqueous solution and cannot easily be modified to improve physicochemical properties, redox activity, binding affinity, and selectivity. We therefore sought to identify more conventional inhibitor structures that would improve solubility and enable further refinement through analog preparation and evaluation. We identified the benzopentathiepin core structure present in a number of natural products as the most promising for further investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Natural products incorporating the benzopentathiepin core motif have been reported to have antifungal and antibacterial activity in cell culture as well as cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Davidson1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Kulikov1">[20]</xref>. Moreover, amino-substituted derivatives such as varacin and TC-2153 have reasonable solubility in aqueous solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Kulikov2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Konstantinova1">[22]</xref>. TC-2153 reportedly has a low level of acute toxicity (LD<sub>50</sub>&gt;1,000 mg/kg) and was proposed to cross the blood brain barrier as evidenced by anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Khomenko1">[23]</xref>. We therefore chose to evaluate the STEP inhibitory activity of TC-2153. We first compared the inhibitory activities of S<sub>8</sub> and TC-2153 against recombinant STEP using pNPP assays at several concentrations of the inhibitors. Both S<sub>8</sub> and TC-2153 inhibited STEP potently, with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 17.2±0.4 nM and 24.6±0.8 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g001">Figure 1C–D</xref>).</p>

<title>STEP Inhibition Increases the Tyr Phosphorylation of STEP Substrates in Cortical Neurons and <italic>in Vivo</italic></title>
<p>We treated cortical neurons for 1 h with S<sub>8</sub> or TC-2153 and determined the Tyr phosphorylation of residues that STEP dephosphorylates on GluN2B (Y<sup>1472</sup>), Pyk2 (Y<sup>402</sup>), and ERK1/2 (Y<sup>204/187</sup>). For S<sub>8</sub>, there was a significant increase in the Tyr phosphorylation of all three STEP substrates at doses above 0.05 µM, with 1 µM showing maximum inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001923.s002">Figure S2A</xref> for representative blots) (1 µM dose, pGluN2B, 1.33±0.08, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; pPyk2, 1.49±0.12, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; pERK1/2, 1.67±0.14, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). For TC-2153, there was also a significant increase in the Tyr phosphorylation at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001923.s002">Figure S2B</xref> for representative blots) (1 µM dose, pGluN2B, 2.07±0.15, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; pPyk2, 1.81±0.21, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; pERK1/2, 2.39±0.18, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). The decrease in Tyr phosphorylation in the presence of the highest dose of TC-2153 (10 µM) may be due to off-target effects on positive regulatory PTPs.

<title>Specificity of TC-2153 Against Other PTPs <italic>in Vitro</italic></title>
<p>In an attempt to evaluate possible selectivity of TC-2153, we performed activity assays using the catalytic domain of STEP, and the catalytic domains of two highly related PTPs: He-PTP and PTP-SL. TC-2153 showed no apparent selectivity among these PTPs.

Thus, we repeated our assays using several full-length PTPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001923-t001">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, we found TC-2153 was more potent against the two major isoforms of STEP, STEP<sub>61</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 93.3±1.1 nM) and STEP<sub>46</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 57.3±1.1 nM), compared to HePTP (IC<sub>50</sub> = 363.5±1.2 nM) and PTP-SL (IC<sub>50</sub> = 220.6±1.3 nM).

<p>Cortical cells were incubated with TC-2153 (1, 10, and 100 µM) for 1 h along with positive controls: glutamate (100 µM), SDS (0.02%), and Triton-X-100 (0.15%) (A), and at multiple time points (1 h, 3 h, 24 h, and 48 h) (B). Bovine LDH was used as a LDH-positive control. The media was collected and analyzed for LDH. The assay quantitatively measures LDH, a stable cytosolic enzyme that is released upon cell lysis. Released LDH in culture supernatants is measured with a 30-min coupled enzymatic assay, which results in the conversion of a tetrazolium salt (INT) into a red formazan product. The amount of color formed is proportional to the number of lysed cells.</p>

<title>Mechanism of STEP Inhibition by TC-2153</title>
<p>We next examined the mechanism by which TC-2153 inhibited STEP. Because the catalytic cysteine in PTPs is prone to sulfhydration, nitrosylation, and oxidative modifications that cause inhibition of phosphatase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Groen1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Yang1">[32]</xref>, we first examined the effect of a reducing agent on STEP inhibition by TC-2153.

<p>To evaluate the mode of inhibition, we incubated STEP with TC-2153, subjected the sample to dialysis to remove excess inhibitor, and monitored enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). After 24 h of dialysis, STEP remained inhibited, suggesting that TC-2153 acts as an irreversible inhibitor under the conditions used. Using the progress curve method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Bieth1">[29]</xref>, inhibition was also found to be irreversible and the second order rate of inactivation was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). A <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> was determined for pNPP in the presence of varying initial inhibitor concentrations (<italic>n</italic>≥4).

However, STEP activity could be recovered following incubation with GSH or DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Aliquots of STEP were incubated with DMSO control or TC-2153 and were then added to assay buffer containing 1 mM GSH, 1 mM DTT, or water control and allowed to incubate for up to 1 h prior to testing for enzymatic activity. STEP activity was rapidly recovered by both reductants, with DTT showing a greater recovery of activity (75% recovery after 1 h, where DMSO control represents 100% activity) compared to GSH (29% recovery after 1 h).</p>
<p>We then performed LCMS analysis to determine the intact protein mass of STEP and STEP+TC-2153. Our intact protein analyses suggest a covalent adduct to STEP. Although we were able to obtain the accurate mass for STEP, we were unable to mass spectrally resolve the heterogeneous mixture of intact STEP+TC-2153 and its covalent adducts with sufficient accuracy to fully interpret the results. Therefore, we next used high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry to focus upon whether TC-2153 might modify the active site cysteine of STEP. For these experiments, we used WT STEP as well as a STEP mutant in which the catalytic cysteine was changed to serine. Greater than 90% of the primary amino acid sequences were identified by LC-MS/MS for WT STEP or for the STEP mutant, following in-gel tryptic digestion of STEP from nondenaturing (native) preparations. We initially analyzed the catalytic cysteine at position 472 of STEP in the absence of TC-2153 and found a disulfide bridge between Cys<sup>465</sup> and Cys<sup>472</sup> that presumably forms following tryptic digestion given the positions of Cys<sup>465</sup> and Cys<sup>472</sup> in the three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of STEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Eswaran1">[30]</xref>. This modification was not observed when the catalytic site cysteine (Cys<sup>472</sup>) was mutated to serine. Incubation of WT STEP with TC-2153 resulted in the presence of a <italic>de novo</italic> trisulfide within the Cys<sup>465</sup>/Cys<sup>472</sup> bridge, which was not observed for WT STEP alone or when the catalytic site cysteine (Cys<sup>472</sup>) was mutated to serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g005">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001923.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The precursor monoisotopic mass of the trisulfide-containing peptide had a mass error of 4 ppm (∼0.011 Da) based on theoretical mass calculation, which is within the 5 ppm external mass calibration expected for MS/MS data collected by the linear ion trap instrument used. These results indicate that the active site cysteine is likely modified by TC-2153 and suggest that following tryptic digestion a sulfur from the benzopentathiepin core is retained, giving rise to the trisulfide identified by mass spectrometry.</p>

Mice received an acute injection of vehicle or TC-2153 (10 mg/kg) 3 h prior to the training phase. Twenty-four h later, mice were subjected to the test phase. Discrimination indexes (DIs) were compared for group differences in object memory. The main effect of genotype [<italic>F</italic>(1, 23) = 4.342, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05], treatment [<italic>F</italic>(1, 23) = 5.895, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01], and Genotype × Treatment interaction was significant [<italic>F</italic>(1, 23) = 4.362, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05]. Post hoc analysis indicated that the DI in the AD-TC group was significantly higher than those of the AD-Veh group (TC-treated, 0.354±0.094 versus vehicle-treated, −0.259±0.104, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). In the WT groups, the DI in the TC-2153–treated mice did not differ from the Veh-treated mice (vehicle-treated, 0.166±0.057; TC-treated, 0.304±0.095, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>We then tested the effects of TC-2153 in the reference memory version of the Morris water maze (MWM). A three-way ANOVA analysis revealed a significant Genotype × Treatment × Training Day interaction (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Daily injection of TC-2153 3 h prior to training reversed memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice on days 5 and 6 of the acquisition phase (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The longer escape latency of 3xTg-AD mice injected with vehicle was not attributed to slower swimming speed, as no significant differences were found between groups (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05; two-way ANOVA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). To confirm memory status, the number of entries in a circular zone located around the previous platform location (target zone) and in the opposite quadrants was evaluated during the probe trial 24 h after the last acquisition day. A three-way ANOVA analysis revealed a significant Genotype × Treatment × Quadrant interaction (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.004). The 3xTg-AD mice treated with TC-2153 spent as much time as WT mice in the target zone, whereas AD mice injected with vehicle showed no preference for the target zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001923-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). All groups had similar escape latencies during the cued trial when the platform was visible, indicating the absence of sensorimotor or motivational deficits to escape from water (WT-Veh, 15.1±1.7 s; WT-TC, 15.6±1.7 s; AD-Veh, 15.3±3.0 s; AD-TC, 16.0±2.3 s; mean ± s.e.m.; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05; two-way ANOVA). There were no differences in thigmotaxic swimming patterns between any of the tested groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001923.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TC-2153 significantly improved cognitive functioning in 6-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice.</p>
<p>We next determined whether inhibition of STEP in 12-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice affected beta amyloid or phospho-tau levels. We first needed to confirm that TC-2153 was effective in attenuating cognitive deficits at 12 mo, as these mice have more robust increases in phospho-tau and Aβ levels. We tested the mice with the NOR task and once again found a significant improvement of memory in AD mice treated with TC-2153 during the choice phase (10 mg/kg, i.p.; TC-2153-AD, familiar versus novel, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). TC-2153 did not affect cognitive function in WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001923.s008">Figure S8A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>STEP function is disrupted in several neurological disorders in addition to AD, including FXS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-GoebelGoody1">[9]</xref>, Parkinson's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Kurup2">[31]</xref>, and schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Carty1">[8]</xref>. The increase in STEP expression in these illnesses is due to either an increase in its translation (in FXS) or a decrease in its degradation (in AD, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia). In contrast, STEP levels or activity are lower in several other disorders, including stress-related conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Yang1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Dabrowska1">[33]</xref>, excessive EtOH consumption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Darcq1">[34]</xref>, and cerebral ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Deb1">[35]</xref>. Thus, the current model is that STEP activity must be within an optimal range and that either high or low levels of STEP disrupt synaptic plasticity. Disruption in STEP function has also been implicated in seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Briggs1">[36]</xref>, ethanol abuse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Hicklin1">[37]</xref>, amphetamamine-induced stereotypies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Tashev1">[38]</xref>, and Huntington's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Saavedra1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Gladding1">[40]</xref>, although the basis for these changes remain to be determined.</p>
<p>In terms of STEP dysfunction, most is known about its role in AD. Aβ binding to the α7 nicotinic receptor leads to calcium influx and calcineurin activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Snyder1">[6]</xref>. Calcineurin activates protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates a regulatory serine residue within the STEP substrate-binding domain, enabling STEP to interact with and dephosphorylate its substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Valjent1">[41]</xref>. In addition, STEP is normally ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome after NMDAR stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Xu2">[15]</xref>, and Aβ inhibition of the proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Almeida1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Tseng1">[43]</xref> results in a build-up of active STEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Kurup1">[7]</xref>. Based on these results, STEP was genetically lowered by crossing STEP KO mice with triple transgenic mice to produce progeny that still had the AD mutations, but were null for STEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. These progeny had improved cognitive function and led to the current study to discover STEP inhibitors.</p>
<p>We initially developed an HTS assay for STEP using the generic phosphatase substrate pNPP and screened ∼150,000 compounds to identify STEP inhibitors. However, when lead compounds were resynthesized, they had significantly lower activity against STEP, suggesting that an impurity in the commercial substances was likely inhibiting STEP activity. We isolated and identified this “contaminating” compound as elemental sulfur in the form of octasulfur (S<sub>8</sub>), which led in turn to the identification of the lead compound TC-2153. It should be noted that we did not include the reductant DTT in the initial library screen, in contrast to many screens for PTP inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Tautz1">[44]</xref>. This allowed us to discover S<sub>8</sub> and identify TC-2153 as a potent inhibitor of STEP and the mechanism of action by which TC-2153 inhibits STEP.</p>
<p>The specificity of TC-2153 in <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as cell and animal models, was explored. Interestingly, TC-2153 was more selective in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays against full-length STEP, but showed little specificity when tested against the truncated phosphatase domains of the PTPs. Although the exact mechanisms need to be clarified, these results are consistent with other recent findings with PTP inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Lund1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Zhang3">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>TC-2153 treatment of neuronal cultures and WT mice increased the Tyr phosphorylation of STEP substrates. These results are consistent with previous studies of STEP KO mice that showed that a loss of STEP results in an increase in the Tyr phosphorylation of all STEP substrates identified to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-GoebelGoody2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Paul1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Xu1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Venkitaramani1">[28]</xref>. The Tyr phosphorylation of the three STEP substrates tested was not significantly changed by TC-2153 in STEP KO neuronal cultures, but was increased by the general PTP inhibitor sodium orthovanadate, indicating that a ceiling effect did not explain the results.</p>
<p>Similarly, administration of TC-2153 to WT mice led to an increase in the Tyr phosphorylation of the STEP substrates ERK1/2 and Pyk2 in the hippocampus and frontal cortex (where STEP is present). However, treatment of WT mice with TC-2153 did not increase the Tyr phosphorylation of these two substrates in regions with no STEP expression (i.e., the cerebellum and organs outside of the CNS). An important finding was that treatment of STEP KO mice did not increase the Tyr phosphorylation of these substrates over baseline levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The Tyr phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Pyk2 did not alter in the cerebellum or in organs outside of the CNS (regions were STEP is not expressed). These results suggest a significant degree of <italic>in vivo</italic> specificity for inhibition of STEP by TC-2153, although additional studies are needed to expand on these initial findings.</p>
<p>These results are consistent with an emerging body of research that suggests that oxidative regulation of the catalytic cysteine residue of PTPs is an important regulatory mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic> that links tyrosine phosphorylation signaling and the redox status of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Boivin1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-denHertog1">[48]</xref>. PTPs contain a catalytic cysteine with an SH-group that exists in a thiolate state (S<sup>–</sup>) and facilitates removal of phosphate groups from substrates. The pKa values of these cysteine residues are in the range of 4–6, making these sites more likely to be oxidized compared to other cysteines that typically have pKa values in the range of 8–9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Ostman1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Winterbourn1">[50]</xref>. Thus, a high reducing environment in cells, either through reduced production of reactive oxygen species or elevated activity of reactive oxygen scavengers, is proposed to decrease PTP oxidation and increase PTP activity. In contrast, a high oxidizing environment would increase PTP oxidation, reduce PTP activity, and increase tyrosine kinase signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Ostman1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Meng1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Woo1">[52]</xref>. Although all PTPases are likely to modulate qualitatively in a similar fashion by cell redox status, several studies have shown that PTPs can be differentially inhibited by oxidation. For example, stimulation of T-cell receptors results in a selective oxidation of SHP2, but not SHP1, whereas both PTPs show similar sensitivity to oxidation <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, SHP1 is more prone to oxidation than SHP2 after treatment of EOL-1 cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Weibrecht1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Whether STEP is regulated in cells by a similar balance of reactive oxygen species and oxygen scavengers, and whether this might explain the sensitivity of STEP to TC-2153, is under investigation. In the initial studies presented here, we explored the mechanism for STEP inhibition. Irreversible inhibition in the absence of reducing conditions was suggested for TC-2153, as dialysis did not restore activity. However, enzyme activity could be recovered by incubation with DTT or GSH, consistent with enzyme inactivation by oxidative modification of the active site cysteine. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of TC-2153 was considerably reduced by addition of DTT or GSH to the assay buffer. The oxidative mechanism for inactivation observed for TC-2153 is in agreement with established oxidative mechanisms for regulating PTP activity <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Krishnan1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Tonks1">[55]</xref>. In support of this, mass spectroscopy analysis indicated that the catalytic Cys residue (Cys<sup>472</sup>) was modified by a trisulfide bridge that included Cys<sup>465</sup>, but only in the presence of TC-2153.</p>
<p>In summary, we have discovered that the pentathiepin TC-2153 potently inhibits STEP activity. Although the results from the STEP KOs and the biochemistry are suggestive of a direct action of TC-2153 on the STEP active site, we cannot exclude an indirect mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic>. An important finding is that the new platform represented by TC-2153 reverses cognitive deficits in 6- and 12-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice, a reflection of the suggested role of STEP in the initial synaptopathology of AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Snyder1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Zhang1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Venkitaramani2">[56]</xref>. The administration of TC-2351 did not affect the Aβ and tau brain pathology of the mice, although the question of the efficacy of TC-2153 at advanced stages of pathology remains open. Longitudinal studies with TC-2153 as well as administration of TC-2153 to other AD models will help address this question. Longitudinal studies will also address the long-term preventive effects of STEP inhibition on cognitive decline. Finally, it is important to determine whether TC-2153 is effective in other animal models of neuropsychiatric diseases in which STEP activity is elevated and these studies have begun.</p>

Aliquots of STEP were added to each well to initiate the assay. The final concentration of STEP was 10 nM. Hydrolysis of pNPP was monitored spectrophotometrically for 30 min at an absorbance wavelength of 405 nm. To determine the inhibition parameters, time points for which the control ([I] = 0) was linear were used. A <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> was calculated for each inhibitor concentration via a nonlinear regression of the data according to the equation P  =  (<italic>v</italic><sub>i</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>)(1-exp(-<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub><italic>t</italic>)) (where P, product formation; <italic>v</italic><sub>i</sub>, initial rate; <italic>t</italic>, time) using Prism 5 (GraphPad). Because <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> varied hyperbolically with [I], nonlinear regression was performed to determine the second-order rate constant, <italic>k</italic><sub>inact</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub>, using the equation <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>  =  <italic>k</italic><sub>inact</sub>[I]/([I] + <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> (1 + [S]/ K<sub>m</sub>)). Assays were done in quadruplicate on two separate occasions. The average and standard deviation of the assays is reported.</p>

<title>Mass Spectrometry</title>
<p>To explore the protein modification(s) of STEP upon TC-2153 inhibition, reduced and nonreduced gel-purified STEP (WT or C472S mutant) proteins were analyzed by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Briefly, purified STEP WT or C-S mutant proteins (10 µg each) were incubated with vehicle (1% DMSO) or TC-2153 (10 µM in 1% DMSO) in assay buffer (50 mM imidazole, pH 7.0) at room temperature (25°C) for 30 min. Samples were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE or nondenaturing PAGE, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Gel bands were excised and kept at −80°C until use. Excised gel bands corresponding to the mutant and WT STEP with and without TC-2153 were in-gel trypsin digested under native conditions (w/o reducing agent) overnight. Peptides were extracted from the digested samples with 80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and then dried under SpeedVac. Samples were then reconstituted in minimum solution containing 0.1% TFA, and loaded onto a RP C18 nanoACQUITY UPLC column (1.7 µm BEH130 C18, 75 µm×250 mm, with a 5 µm Symmetry C18 2G-V/M Trap [180 µm×20 mm]). Eluted peptides were directly infused into an Orbitrap Elite LC MS/MS system running data-dependent acquisition. Acquired data were processed utilizing Progenesis LCMS software (Nonlinear Dynamics) and MASCOT Search engine with user-defined possible modification(s) search criteria.</p>

<title>Behavioral Analysis</title>
<p>A previous study showed that genetic reduction of STEP significantly reversed cognitive deficits in 6-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. Here we were interested in testing whether pharmacologic inhibition of STEP with TC-2153 had a similar beneficial effect in this AD mouse model. We also wanted to test whether TC-2153 had any effects on cognition in WT mice. Mice completed all tests in the following order: Y-maze alternation, NOR, and MWM. For all behavioral tests, WT or 3xTg-AD mice were randomly allocated to treatment with either vehicle or TC-2153.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4o">
<title>Open Field Activity</title>
<p>To assess locomotor activity and exploratory behavior, mice were placed in a square box (60×60×60 cm) and habituated for 5 min. Mice were treated with vehicle or TC-2153 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 3 h prior to the exploration phase of the experiment. A video camera mounted directly above the box recorded the trials and ANY-maze software analyzed the distance traveled and time spent in the center of the box.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4p">
<title>Y-Maze Alternation Task</title>
<p>A crossover design was used in the Y-maze and NOR tasks, such that mice initially treated with vehicle (or TC-2153) were retested following a 15-d drug-free period and received TC-2153 (or vehicle). The Y-maze apparatus consisted of three dark gray arms (42×4.8×20 cm). Each mouse was treated with vehicle or TC-2153 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 3 h prior to the experiment, after which they were placed at the end of one arm (the designated “start arm”) and allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. The total number of arm entries was recorded, as was the number of entries representing alternation behavior (i.e., sequential entry into all three arms). All four paws of the mouse had to enter an arm for it to count as an arm entry. Percentage spontaneous alternation  =  (number of alternations)/(total arm entries – 2). A crossover design was used after a drug-free period of 15 d, with groups previously treated with vehicle then receiving TC-2153 and vice versa. A total number of 20 WT and 11 AD mice were used in the Y-maze task.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4q">
<title>NOR Task</title>
<p>Mice were first habituated to the task by allowing them to explore an empty white open field box (60 cm×60 cm) for 5 min. Twenty-four hours later, mice were treated with vehicle or TC-2153 (10 mg/kg i.p.) 3 h prior to the sample phase. After the elapsed time, the mice completed the sample phase in which they were placed into the open field box with two identical objects located in the right and left corners. Mice were allowed to freely explore until they had accumulated a total of 30 s of object exploration (i.e., contact with the object with the nose and/or front paws), at which point the trial ended. The time spent with each object was recorded. Mice that were unable to complete the 30 s exploration within 20 min during the sample phase were excluded from the study (WT = 1 and AD = 3). Twenty-four hours later, mice completed the choice phase that was conducted in an identical manner to the sample phase except that one of the objects was substituted by a novel object and trial duration was set at 5 min. No drug treatments were given during the choice phase. Fifteen WT mice from the initial cohort were used to optimize the novel object conditions (to identify object pairings of inherent equal interest). Location of the novel object (left or right side) was counterbalanced to minimize possible bias. A crossover design was used, with a different set of objects after a 15-d drug-free period. DI was used to evaluate the effects of the TC-2153 compound on object memory in 6-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice. The DI was calculated for each subject by using the following formula: DI  =  (time spent exploring novel object – time spent exploring familiar object)/(total time spent exploring both objects). A DI of 0 is indicative of chance performance (i.e., no preference for one object compared to another), whereas a positive index (ranging from 0 to 1) indicates preference for novel object compared to familiar. In order to achieve greater statistical power, a second cohort of AD mice (<italic>n</italic> = 7) was run in the novel object test using a crossover design. Any value lower or higher than two times standard deviation away from the mean was considered an outlier and was excluded from the study (AD = 1). A total number of 9 WT and 16 AD mice were used in the NOR task.</p>

<title>MWM</title>
<p>The reference memory version of the MWM task was performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001923-Brouillette1">[61]</xref>. A crossover design was not used in the MWM task, as the mice were randomly assigned to each treatment condition and can be exposed to the task only once. Briefly, animals were trained to swim in a 1.4 m diameter pool to find a submerged platform (14 cm in diameter) located 1 cm below the surface of water (24°C), rendered opaque by the addition of nontoxic white paint. Animals were pseudo-randomly started from a different position at each trial and used distal visual-spatial cues to find the hidden escape platform that remained in the center of the same quadrant throughout all training days. Training measures included escape latency to reach the platform, swim speed, and thigmotaxis. When animals failed to find the platform, they were guided to it and remained there for 10 s before removal. At 24 h after the acquisition phase, the platform was removed and a probe trial of 90 s was given to evaluate the number of entries in a circular zone (three times the platform diameter) positioned around the previous platform location (target zone) and in the opposite quadrants. To assess visual deficits and motivation to escape from water, the probe test was followed by a cued task (60 s; three trials per animal) during which the platform was visible. The visible platform was moved to different locations between each trial. After each trial, animals were immediately placed under a warming lamp to dry to prevent hypothermia. The experimenter was blind to mouse genotype when administering TC-2153 or vehicle to AD mice (AD-TC, <italic>n</italic> = 7; AD-Veh, <italic>n</italic> = 6) or WT mice (WT-TC, <italic>n</italic> = 13; WT-Veh, <italic>n</italic> = 12). Behavioral data from training, probe, and cued trials were acquired and analyzed using the ANY-maze automated tracking system (Stoelting, IL, USA).</p>
</sec><sec id="s4s">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with genotype as the between-subject factor and treatment as the within subject factor was used for the Y-maze and object recognition tasks. Percent alternation (Y-maze) and DI (object recognition) were the dependent measures. Post hoc analyses were carried out using Bonferroni's multiple comparison tests as appropriate (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA). In an older (12 mo) cohort of WT and 3xTg-AD mice, the exploration time (NOR task) did not meet the assumption of normality and equal variance, and raw data (seconds) were converted using square-root transformation followed by <italic>t</italic> test. For the MWM training and probe sessions, a three-way repeated measures ANOVA with two between-subject (Genotype, Treatment) and one within-subject (training day or quadrant) factor was used. Escape latency (training) and number of entries (probe) were the dependent measures (StatView, Cary, NC). Swim speed and escape latency during the probe and cued trials, respectively, were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with genotype and treatment as the between-subject factors. Post hoc analyses were conducted on significant results. For cell-based assays, one-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni test was used to determine statistical significance. All data were expressed as mean ± s.e.m.</p>
