<abstract>
<p>Yeasts can form multicellular patterns as they expand on agar plates, a phenotype that requires a functional copy of the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene. Although the biochemical and molecular requirements for such patterns have been examined, the mechanisms underlying their formation are not entirely clear. Here we develop quantitative methods to accurately characterize the size, shape, and surface patterns of yeast colonies for various combinations of agar and sugar concentrations. We combine these measurements with mathematical and physical models and find that <italic>FLO11</italic> gene constrains cells to grow near the agar surface, causing the formation of larger and more irregular colonies that undergo hierarchical wrinkling. Head-to-head competition assays on agar plates indicate that two-dimensional constraint on the expansion of <italic>FLO11 wild type</italic> (<italic>FLO11</italic>) cells confers a fitness advantage over <italic>FLO11 knockout</italic> (<italic>flo11</italic>Δ) cells on the agar surface.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Microbial biofilms are commonly found in nature and are highly relevant to public health. Biofilms can impose high risks to drinking water distribution by stable adherence to the interior of water pipes, and to food industry by contamination of food processing systems. Biofilm adherence to indwelling medical devices causes high rates of clinical infections that are difficult to eliminate as biofilm microbes resist treatment with antibiotics and biocides. These microbial abilities are related to the spatial composition and overall morphology of the biofilm. While the mechanisms underlying biofilm structure and morphology have been examined for bacteria, much less is known about eukaryotic biofilms. Here we find that the size, shape and patterning of budding yeast colonies can arise from constraining colony expansion to the surface of agar plates. Through computational analysis and mathematical modeling, we find that rapid colony expansion, colony shape irregularity and hierarchical wrinkling of the yeast colony surface can result from two-dimensionality of expansion imposed by the adhesin <italic>FLO11</italic>. Finally, we find that two-dimensional expansion conveys competitive advantage during head-to-head competition with the mutant cells lacking <italic>FLO11</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells often live in large multi-cellular communities. Members of such communities can reproduce and interact with their physicochemical environment, giving rise to complex patterns at spatial scales that greatly exceed the size of individual cells. For example, in embryonic development, complex spatio-temporal patterning results from the interplay of cellular growth, inter-cellular and cell-environmental interactions involving mechanical forces and biochemical signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Forgcs1">[1]</xref>. Elucidating the mechanisms of such biological pattern formation is a formidable challenge, which could be aided by understanding pattern formation of simple organisms in well-controlled environments.</p>
<p>Microbial biofilm expansion is among the most important pattern-forming processes. Biofilms are not only ubiquitous in nature, but also occur in hospitals, as the predominant form of contamination on medical devices, such as prostheses and vascular catheters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Richards1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Kojic1">[5]</xref>. Some of these life-threatening infections are difficult to eliminate because biofilms prevent drug access to the constituent microbes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Costerton1">[6]</xref>. Patterns can develop on biofilm surfaces, as signatures of structures aiding material transport and oxygenation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Kempes1">[7]</xref>. While the biophysical processes involved in bacterial biofilm formation have been examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-HallStoodley1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-deBeer1">[10]</xref>, and their evolutionary relevance has been assessed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Xavier1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Kim1">[13]</xref>, much less is known about eukaryotic cell communities, despite their relevance to fungal infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Chandra1">[14]</xref> and possible implications for cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Lambert1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-BenJacob1">[16]</xref>. For example, a recent study has implicated localized cell death-mediated buckling in pattern formation during <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> biofilm expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Asally1">[17]</xref>, but the generality of these findings across organisms, including eukaryotes, remains to be tested.</p>
<p>The budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, has emerged as a model organism for studying fungal biofilm formation on solid surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Reynolds1">[18]</xref> or air-liquid interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Zara1">[19]</xref>. Common laboratory yeasts have been selected for easy genetic manipulation and handling, and rarely form biofilms. In contrast, many undomesticated or non-standard <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> variants form highly-patterned biofilms when grown on semisolid agar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Reynolds1">[18]</xref>. The patterns are composed of a central hub region with irregular wrinkles, from which thick wrinkle bundles (spokes) emanate radially towards the peripheral rim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Reynolds1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Reynolds2">[20]</xref>. Pattern formation seems to require expression of the surface adhesin <italic>FLO11</italic>, which is under complex environmental regulation, mediated by several transcription factors binding to the largest known yeast promoter, <italic>P<sub>FLO11</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Octavio1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Taylor1">[24]</xref>. In addition, Flo11 protein expression and activity are under post-transcriptional and post-translational control, being targeted to specific subcellular locations, and secreted after cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Bumgarner1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Lo2">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we seek a unifying mechanism to explain various characteristics of colony expansion that distinguish pattern-forming yeast cells with a functional <italic>FLO11</italic> gene from cells lacking the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene. We accomplish this by comparing quantitative analyses of yeast colony expansion data in well-defined conditions with mathematical and physical models. We find that constrained, two-dimensional colony expansion explains the differences between the two cell types. Moreover, we find that the identified mechanism confers selective advantage during head-to-head competition on agar plates when the two cell types are mixed.</p>

<title>The influence of the environment and <italic>FLO11</italic> on colony size</title>
<p>We first asked how the presence of a functional <italic>FLO11</italic> gene influenced colony expansion under various nutrient conditions, as previously done in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Fujikawa1">[31]</xref>. To address this question, we applied automated image segmentation followed by pixel counting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-GildePrado1">[32]</xref> to obtain the area of <italic>FLO11</italic> and <italic>flo11</italic>Δ colonies that expanded under nine different combinations of agar (1.5%, 3.0%, 6.0%) and glucose (0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%) concentrations on Yeast Extract-Peptone-Dextrose (YPD) agar plates. We found that <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1A, C</xref>) expanded faster than <italic>flo11</italic>Δ colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1B, C</xref>) and reached larger maximum size in all of these conditions, in agreement with previous observations in soft agar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Reynolds1">[18]</xref>. The maximum colony area increased with glucose concentration, but had an inverse dependence on agar density, regardless of <italic>FLO11</italic> status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s001">S1A, B Figure</xref>). The time that colonies took to reach their maximum area increased with agar density, with no obvious dependence on glucose concentration, regardless of <italic>FLO11</italic> status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s001">S1E, F Figure</xref>). Time derivative of the experimentally measured <italic>FLO11</italic> colony area indicated that the colony expansion curve convexity increased with glucose concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s002">S2 Figure</xref>). These trends of colony expansion were independent of the sugar type, as suggested by similar trends obtained for agar with galactose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s003">S3 Figure</xref>).</p>

<p>We tested whether faster <italic>FLO11</italic> colony expansion could be related to faster growth rate and/or larger cell size of <italic>FLO11</italic> versus <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells. <italic>FLO11</italic> and <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells grew at comparable rates in liquid cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s004">S4A Figure</xref>), and the early expansion rates of <italic>FLO11</italic> and <italic>flo11</italic>Δ microcolonies were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s015">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s016">S2 Movies</xref>), arguing against a significant difference in their growth rates. Moreover, <italic>FLO11</italic> and <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells had similar cell size distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s004">S4A Figure</xref>). Therefore, some other mechanisms must underlie the faster expansion of <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies compared to <italic>flo11</italic>Δ colonies in the same agar and sugar conditions.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>The influence of the environment and <italic>FLO11</italic> on colony shape</title>
<p>The second colony characteristic that we investigated was the colony shape, quantified by analyzing the irregularity of the colony rim (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>). We used two different methods to quantify rim irregularity, both of which describe the deviation of colony shape from a circle. First, we used the dimensionless P2A ratio, defined as <italic>P</italic><sup>2</sup>/4π<italic>A</italic>, where <italic>P</italic> is the perimeter, and <italic>A</italic> is the area of the segmented object. The P2A ratio takes its minimal value of 1 for a perfect circle, and increases as the object becomes more irregular. Second, we calculated the boundary fluctuation (BF) defined as the amplitude of colony edge fluctuations in polar coordinates by using the centroid of the colony as the origin of the new coordinate system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s005">S5 Figure</xref>). The P2A method is more sensitive to small fluctuations at the colony rim, whereas BF senses coarser irregularities of colony shape, such as petals and asymmetries. The combination of the two methods quantitatively and comprehensively described the non-circularity at the colony rim.</p>
<p>At each combination of glucose and agar concentrations, both the P2A and BF methods indicated more pronounced colony rim fluctuations in <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies compared to <italic>flo11</italic>Δ colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s005">S5 Figure</xref>). The irregularity at the rim of <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies increased over time for all colonies, suggesting a role for gradual nutrient depletion as described previously for bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Fujikawa1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Matsushita1">[33]</xref>. The maximum irregularity reached at the end of the time course decreased with both agar and glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s005">S5 Figure</xref>). The irregularity of the colonies saturated at a much earlier time than the area of the colonies and reached the maximum among all conditions tested, regardless of <italic>FLO11</italic> status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s001">S1 Figure</xref>). These trends were consistent between trials and independent of the sugar source.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>A mathematical model captures the effect of sugar concentration on colony expansion</title>
<p>The above measurements indicated that <italic>flo11</italic>Δ colonies tend to be smaller, more circular, with smoother edges compared to <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s005">S5 Figure</xref>). Such expansion patterns commonly occur in microorganisms that spread through cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Cooper1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Palumbo1">[35]</xref>. Although cells may be non-motile in such colonies, they must move as they divide due to volume limitations. This movement can take place either through spreading on the agar surface or through vertical growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Su1">[36]</xref>. As long as nutrients are available, and the initial conditions have circular symmetry, a circular colony will grow.</p>
<p>Considering that <italic>FLO11</italic> mediates the adhesion of cells to abiotic surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Reynolds1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Reynolds2">[20]</xref>, we hypothesized that this causes the cells to stay closer to the agar surface rather than expanding vertically into the third dimension. Therefore, we developed a phenomenological model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>) for <italic>FLO11</italic> cells spreading through a diffusive process in two dimensions corresponding to the surface of the agar, similar to earlier studies of colony growth in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Cooper1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Palumbo1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Mimura1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Golding1">[38]</xref>. The model's purpose was to identify mechanisms explaining colony size and shape differences, without intending to reproduce exact biological values. Therefore, we applied rescaling to obtain dimensionless variables, such as time and cell density. Cell growth and colony expansion were assumed to be dependent on glucose availability and glucose could diffuse in two dimensions. Using this model, we plotted the time-courses of colony area and irregularity (P2A) for different initial levels of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The calculated dependence of maximal colony area on environmental parameters (sugar concentration) resembled what was observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s001">S1 Figure</xref>). According to the model, the calculated colony area approached its maximum once depleting the available glucose. Furthermore, increasing initial glucose levels in the model lad to larger maximum colony area as in the experiments. Finally, the model also produced a concave curve of colony area versus time at low glucose levels, and a convex curve at high glucose, as in the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s002">S2 Supporting Figure</xref>). When we modified the model allowing cells to escape into the vertical direction, we obtained smaller colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s006">S6 Figure</xref>). Overall, the mathematical models supported the hypothesis that <italic>FLO11</italic> yeast colonies tend to grow along the agar surface, which limits their degrees of freedom, leading to larger colony sizes and more irregular colony shapes compared to <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells that are free to expand vertically.</p>

The dimensionless “colony area ratio” was the ratio of colony area to the area of simulation box, and glucose concentration corresponded to the initial value of glucose in the simulation, and was chosen as a constant over space. Time is a rescaled variable measured in arbitrary units. <italic>(G–I)</italic> Simulated colony irregularity (P2A) plotted as a function of time. Similar to experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), in our model P2A is initially at a basal level and then increases abruptly to a large value. This increase in P2A corresponds to petal formation and occurs as a result of competition over glucose among cells that make up the colony rim. Interestingly, the maximum value of P2A decreases with increasing glucose levels. This result is likely due to decreased intercellular competition over nutrients in the early stages of expansion and is compatible with experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, where colonies exhibit less structure as glucose levels increase.</p>

<title>Environment- and <italic>FLO11</italic>- dependent hierarchical wrinkling</title>
<p>The third characteristic we investigated was pattern formation on colony surfaces during expansion. Initial patterns on <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies typically appeared as irregular wrinkles developing into a “hub”, a thickening mass of cells in the colony center. After a few days, as the colony expanded beyond the wrinkled hub, and radial wrinkles emerged, some bundled into thicker spoke-like structures. As the colony area increased, radial spokes appeared <italic>de novo</italic> between two existing spokes or by branching (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s017">S3 Movie</xref>), with apparently quasi-regular spacing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s017">S3 Movie</xref>). In contrast, <italic>flo11</italic>Δ colonies appeared smooth, without any obvious surface patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

<p>To determine whether the distances between wrinkles and spokes were regular, and had a dependence on agar and glucose concentrations, we investigated the surface patterns of individual colonies by manual measurements of inter-wrinkle distances. The narrow distributions of inter-wrinkle and inter-spoke distances suggested regular spacing of these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s008">S8 Figure</xref>). Moreover, the number of wrinkles and spokes increased towards the colony edge, indicating that pattern formation tended to preserve inter-wrinkle and inter-spoke arc-lengths rather than arc-angles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s017">S3 Movie</xref>). Therefore, the quasi-regular spacing between these structures suggested preference of specific inter-wrinkle and inter-spoke distances. The preferred distance between consecutive spokes decreased with the agar concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s008">S8 Figure</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of the wavelengths of the colony surface patterns.</title>
<p><italic>(A)</italic> The wavelength of spokes (<sub>2</sub>) measured manually and by Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) decreased with increasing agar density, while the wavelength of primary wrinkles (<sub>1</sub>) from manual measurements were less sensitive to the change of agar density. Since the automated FFT measurement was sensitive to noise in the image, FFT did not detect the small-wavelength primary wrinkles as significant. The wavelength of the wrinkles was shorter than that of the spokes at all agar levels tested. The experimentally measured geometric mean wavelength of spokes matched best the ESVS thick substrate model, while the geometric mean wavelength of primary wrinkles matched the ESVS thin substrate model. The inserted image shows the primary and secondary wrinkles measured at the outer radii, indicated by red and green lines, respectively. <italic>(B)</italic> The Fourier wavelengths plotted as a function of section radius, independent of time for <italic>FLO11</italic> colony at 0.5% glucose and 0.9% agar. <italic>(C)</italic> Same as <italic>(B)</italic>, but for a <italic>flo11Δ</italic> colony at 0.5% glucose and 0.9% agar.

<p>Next we investigated the mechanisms underlying wrinkle formation. Considering recent evidence for non-uniform cell death underlying bacterial colony wrinkling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Asally1">[17]</xref>, we tested whether it played a role in the formation of yeast colony surface patterns. We monitored yeast colony expansion on media with SYTOX Green Nucleic Acid Stain, which marks dead cells by green fluorescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Asally1">[17]</xref>. In contrast to bacteria, we observed low levels and uniform distribution of cell death starting from inoculation throughout colony maturation (<italic>see Supporting <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref></italic>), arguing against the role of cell death in pattern formation by yeast colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s009">S9 Figure</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s018">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s019">S5 Movies</xref>). This suggests that an alternative mechanism is responsible for the wrinkling observed in yeast colonies.</p>
<p>A striking observation is the existence of two different spatial scales (i.e., wrinkles and spokes) in the surface patterns of the <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies. This is similar to hierarchical wrinkling in a related mechanical system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>): a thin elastic film on top of a viscoelastic substrate that shrinks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Efimenko1">[39]</xref>. The shrinkage of the substrate relative to the film should cause similar mechanical strain as the stretching of the growing yeast colony (biofilm) relative to the agar substrate. In fact, similar distance-preserving radial wrinkles appear on surfaces where diffusion originating from point-like sources creates instability in a stiff skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Vandeparre1">[40]</xref>. Since the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene mediates surface attachment, <italic>FLO11</italic> cells should be constrained to grow two-dimensionally, forming an elastic skin made of cells and extracellular matrix attached to the viscoelastic agar substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Vachova1">[41]</xref>. In contrast, cells without <italic>FLO11</italic> should expand in three dimensions without any constraints.</p>
<p>Theories of elastic skin-viscoelastic substrate (ESVS) sandwich systems can capture two limiting cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Cerda1">[42]</xref>. First, when the substrate is thick relative to the elastic skin then primary wrinkles of wavelength <italic>λ</italic> = <italic>h</italic>(<italic>E<sub>y</sub></italic>/<italic>E<sub>a</sub></italic>)<sup>1/3</sup> should form, where <italic>h</italic> is the thickness of the elastic skin, and <italic>E<sub>y</sub></italic> and <italic>E<sub>a</sub></italic> are the Young's Moduli of the skin and the substrate, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Efimenko1">[39]</xref>. Second, if the thicknesses of the skin and substrate are comparable then the wavelength also depends on <italic>H</italic>, the substrate thickness: <italic>λ</italic> = (<italic>hH</italic>)<sup>1/2</sup>(<italic>E<sub>y</sub></italic>/<italic>E<sub>a</sub></italic>)<sup>1/6</sup>. If the stress continues to increase, the amplitude of primary wrinkles increases until saturation, after which secondary wrinkles (spokes) start forming according to the same formula, except that the skin thickness is replaced by the primary wrinkles' saturation amplitude. This process of hierarchical wrinkling can continue until wrinkles appear at several length scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Efimenko1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>If the theory for hierarchical wrinkling in ESVS sandwich systems applies to <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies, the spatial frequencies should follow formulas as describe above. Indeed, fitting these models indicated that inter-spoke spacing had an inverse dependence on the agar density as expected from the physical ESVS theory of wrinkling when the substrate is thick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). In contrast, only the thin substrate ESVS model could fit the spacing of primary wrinkles, which was less agar density-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s010">S10 Figure</xref>). These findings suggest that primary wrinkle formation involves directly not the agar, but another, thin substrate that sits below the top layer of cells. The density and thereby the elasticity of this substrate could nonetheless correlate with the density of agar, which must enforce the water content and thereby the stiffness of the colony. Indeed, confocal microscopy previously suggested the existence of at least 4 layers (agar, yeast attached to agar, extracellular matrix, and yeast exposed to air) in yeast colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Vachova1">[41]</xref>. Therefore, a likely candidate for the thin substrate is the extracellular matrix squeezed between two cell layers. The spacing of both the spokes and primary wrinkles was independent of glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s008">S8 Figure</xref>), as expected from the ESVS model.</p>
<p>To further confirm the regularity of patterns on colony surfaces detected by automated image processing, we applied Fast-Fourier Transformations to horizontal sections of the images transformed into polar coordinates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s011">S11 Figure</xref>). We noticed that the wavelengths corresponding to dominant frequencies had a tendency to stabilize around specific values towards the outer radii of <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g004">Fig. 4B, C</xref>). These wavelengths were the most significant and tightly peaked within Fourier spectra for a wide range of agar concentrations (0.6–1.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g004">Fig. 4A, D</xref>). Except for the lowest agar concentration (agar = 0.3%), wavelengths obtained for <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies were consistently more significant than for those obtained for <italic>flo11</italic>Δ colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Finally, the dominant wavelengths (even if sometimes non-significant) tended to decrease with the agar concentration, resembling the agar-dependence of inter-spoke arc-lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), and were only moderately affected by the glucose concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>FLO11</italic> conveys head-to-head competitive advantage during colony expansion</title>
<p>Considering that <italic>FLO11</italic> colonies expanded faster in all sugar-agar combinations than their <italic>flo11</italic>Δ counterparts when grown separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), we tested whether the two-dimensional constraint on <italic>FLO11</italic> colony growth would also convey a competitive advantage over <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells during expansion of mixed colonies. In particular, we wanted to know if interactions between these cell types could mitigate the growth advantage of pattern-forming <italic>FLO11</italic> cells.</p>
<p>Previously, Korolev and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Korolev1">[43]</xref> showed that two differently labeled <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cell types should segregate into single-colored sectors as initial spatial non-homogeneities amplify through a “founder effect” during colony expansion. The boundaries of such single-colored sectors should reveal any competitive advantage between the two cell types (or lack thereof). Specifically, straight sector boundaries indicate that sectors occupy approximately the same arc-angle <italic>θ</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) around the colony's periphery over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), meaning that neither cell type has competitive advantage over the other. However, if the sector boundaries occupied by unlabeled cells curve outwards then their arc-angle <italic>θ</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) increases at the expense of the arc-angle occupied by the mCherry-labeled cells, meaning that the unlabeled cells have a competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). The opposite is true if the unlabeled sector boundaries curve inward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>We used these theoretical results to judge whether pattern formation in our experimental system was associated with an advantage during head-to-head competition. To examine competition in mixed colonies, we labeled either <italic>FLO11</italic> cells or <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells, placing a chromosomally integrated mCherry reporter under the control of an extra copy of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter into each cell type (<italic>see </italic><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>We found that well-mixed liquid cultures (1∶1 ratio) of red-labeled and unlabeled cells inoculated onto agar plates resulted in distinct red and unlabeled sectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Examining the sectors that formed when mCherry-labeled <italic>FLO11</italic> cells were mixed with unlabeled <italic>FLO11</italic> cells (or when mCherry-labeled and unlabeled <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells were mixed), indicated minimal competitive advantage, except for a small fitness cost associated with mCherry expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5D–G</xref>). Importantly, the mixtures of labeled and unlabeled <italic>FLO11</italic> cells preserved the colony expansion and pattern formation characteristics of <italic>FLO11</italic> cells grown alone under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s012">S12 Figure</xref>).</p>
<p>When a mixture of <italic>flo11</italic>Δ (labeled) and <italic>FLO11</italic> (unlabeled) cells were inoculated onto a plate, <italic>FLO11</italic> sectors not only preserved the surface patterning (visualized in bright field), but also displayed a strong outward curvature at the expense of <italic>flo11</italic>Δ sectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5H, I</xref>). The arc-angle θ of the <italic>flo11</italic>Δ colony (mCherry labeled) decreased more with the radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5I</xref>) compared to the control mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5D–G</xref>). Interestingly, however, mCherry-labeled <italic>FLO11</italic> cells seemed to gain competitive advantage against <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells only after colonies grew for a substantial time, indicating that a sufficiently large sector of these cells had to be established, or the sugar levels on the plate had to drop before they could outcompete <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells. Once that happened, not only did the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene convey a competitive advantage, but the <italic>FLO11</italic> cells eventually enveloped the <italic>flo11</italic>Δ sector (visualized by mCherry in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5I</xref>) by coalescing with the adjacent <italic>FLO11</italic> sector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5H</xref>). This halted the spread of the <italic>flo11</italic>Δ colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). We observed similar behavior with reverse labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g005">Fig. 5J, K</xref>) and in repeat experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s013">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s014">S14 Figures</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s020">S6 Movie</xref>), once again confirming that <italic>FLO11</italic> cells gain advantage after an initial delay. Varying the percentage of <italic>flo11</italic>Δ versus <italic>FLO11</italic> cells did not alter these results, as long as pattern formation appeared in the <italic>FLO11</italic> sector. These data, taken together with the similarity of <italic>FLO11</italic> and <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cell sizes and growth rates in liquid cultures (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s004">S4 Figure</xref>), and microcolony expansion rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s015">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s016">S2 Movies</xref>), indicate that the two-dimensionally constrained expansion mode of <italic>FLO11</italic> cells gives them advantage over <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells when they form mixed colonies on agar plates.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that <italic>FLO11</italic>-enforced two-dimensional colony expansion conveyed head-to-head competitive advantage against <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Microbial pattern formation has received considerable attention over the last century and even before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Pontecorvo1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Lindner1">[45]</xref>. In the 1990s there was a surge of interest in quantitative characterization of microbial colony patterns as physicists forged connections to non-equilibrium growth phenomena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-BenJacob2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-BenJacob3">[47]</xref>. Recently, interest in microbial patterns has reemerged again, as advanced genetic and imaging methods permitted screening of mutations responsible for macroscopic pattern formation while observing single cells in developing colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Asally1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Vachova1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Berk1">[48]</xref>. Although many recent studies describe phenomenological associations of various molecular and physical processes with pattern formation, it is unclear if a unifying theme underlies these observations. We propose here that constraining the dimensionality of colony expansion could be such a unifying theme.</p>
<p>Deeper understanding of colony development requires automated image processing methods to extract quantitative data from images <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Asally1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-GildePrado1">[32]</xref> and develop mathematical or physical models to establish connections with related processes in physical systems. This work represents a step in this direction by systematically extracting and quantifying features in expanding yeast colonies.</p>
<p>We studied, by quantitative methods, three salient features of yeast colonies during their expansion on agar plates: colony size, rim irregularity and the pattern emerging on the colony surface. By comparing <italic>FLO11</italic> cells to otherwise isogenic <italic>flo11</italic>Δ cells, we observed that the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene increases the rate of colony expansion, enhances rim irregularity, and is required for pattern formation in all the sugar and agar concentrations tested. These trends were consistent among three different trials with glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003979-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), as well as a trial with galactose, indicating the robustness of colony expansion features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003979.s003">S3 Figure</xref>). Seeking a unifying explanation for these experimental observations, we proposed a simple mathematical model to capture these differences. Our model qualitatively reproduces colony expansion curves under different growth conditions. In addition, it suggests a possible explanation for the formation of petals on the <italic>FLO11</italic> colony boundary, which can occur due to the competition among cells for common nutrients. Random advantage of some cells over others can result from any fluctuating factor (spatial inhomogeneities in cell density, nutrients or agar concentration), which is then amplified as petals grow, consuming and depleting nutrients from their vicinity. Depletion of nutrients between petals prevents the growth of cells, and leads to branch-like structures, somewhat similar to what has been observed in bacterial colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Fujikawa1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Matsushita1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-BenJacob4">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>Moreover, we propose that the patterns observed on the colony surface arise by hierarchical wrinkling similar to sandwich systems consisting of an elastic skin on top of a viscoelastic substrate. Microbial biofilms typically contain an extracellular matrix that cells secrete, creating a connective medium across the colony that acts as an elastic skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Trejo1">[50]</xref>. The expansion of the colony attached to the agar can cause strain, which generates hierarchical wrinkling. However, the yeast-colony-agar system is more complex than bilayer ESVS systems that current theories can capture. Therefore, investigating patterns on microbial colony surfaces could inspire the development of new physical theories of wrinkling in multi-layered systems.</p>
<p>Overall, we propose the 2D agar-attached mode of colony expansion as the common underlying cause of the observed phenomena (faster colony expansion, rim irregularity, and pattern formation) in <italic>FLO11</italic> cells. In addition, we find that two-dimensional expansion provides competitive advantage during head-to-head competition with <italic>flo11</italic>Δ colonies that expand in an unconstrained manner. Indeed, the unifying theme of two-dimensional expansion is intuitive for at least three reasons. First, for the same number of cells to fit in a 2D sheet compared to a 3D hump, the shape must expand over a wider area. Second, 2D expansion with agar attachment should be sensitive to local impurities and form petals, while 3D expansion can “overpass” such roadblocks in the 3<sup>rd</sup> (vertical) dimension. Finally, 2D agar-attached cell expansion creates a system equivalent to an elastic film spread on top of a shrinking viscoelastic substrate, causing hierarchical wrinkling, which is not true for unconstrained 3D expansion.</p>
<p>Biofilm wrinkling in other organisms has been shown to perform specific biological functions. For example, wrinkling could be induced under anoxic environment, increasing the oxygenation in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Dietrich1">[51]</xref>. The channels underneath wrinkles were suggested to transport liquid within <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> biofilms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Wilking1">[52]</xref>. Moreover, enforcing two-dimensional expansion may reduce the evolutionary conflict among cells as they compete for resources located below (nutrients) and above the colony (oxygen) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Xavier1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003979-Xavier2">[12]</xref>. Yet, identifying the function of biofilm features necessitates knowing the mechanisms underlying their formation, such as we propose for yeast colonies. Without a physical sciences perspective, molecular and cell biological considerations will be insufficient to understand the intricacies of biofilm formation. Overall, this work is an example for how the restriction of dimensionality during expansion can create complex patterns and provide a competitive advantage that would not exist for dimensionally unconstrained growth.</p>

The same procedure was repeated for preparing Yeast Extract Peptone Galactose (YPGal) plates, except using galactose instead of glucose. YPD 6-well plates (BD Falcon, Cat#: 353046) were prepared with substrate containing various agar and glucose concentrations for cryosectioning and manual measurement and FFT analysis on the wavelengths of wrinkles and spokes.

<title>Image processing</title>
<p>To analyze colony images, we detected the plate in each image by thresholding the image and searching for a circular object. This was done by defining a cost for deviation from circularity, and choosing the threshold that minimized it.

This value was determined from the image intensity histogram by separating the peaks corresponding to image background and foreground.</p>

<title>Analysis on colony expansion time course and the non-circularity of colony rim</title>
<p>To determine colony irregularities, we applied two different methods. Both methods are scale-invariant and increase as irregularities at the boundary increase, relying on the deviations of the shape from a circle. First, we defined P2A as the inverse of “isoperimetric quotient”:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003979.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003979.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>P</italic> is the perimeter of the colony calculated by counting 8-connected pixels on colony boundary, and <italic>A</italic> is the area of the colony calculated by counting the total number of pixels in the colony.
