      <abstract>
        <p>Genomic and proteomic methods yield networks of biological regulatory interactions but do not provide direct insight into how those interactions are organized into functional modules, or how information flows from one module to another. In this work we introduce an approach that provides this complementary information and apply it to the bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, a paradigm for cell-cycle control. Operationally, we use an inducible promoter to express the essential transcriptional regulatory gene <italic>ctrA</italic> in a periodic, pulsed fashion. This chemical perturbation causes the population of cells to divide synchronously, and we use the resulting advance or delay of the division times of single cells to construct a phase resetting curve. We find that delay is strongly favored over advance. This finding is surprising since it does not follow from the temporal expression profile of CtrA and, in turn, simulations of existing network models. We propose a phenomenological model that suggests that the cell-cycle network comprises two distinct functional modules that oscillate autonomously and couple in a highly asymmetric fashion. These features collectively provide a new mechanism for tight temporal control of the cell cycle in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>. We discuss how the procedure can serve as the basis for a general approach for probing network dynamics, which we term chemical perturbation spectroscopy (CPS).</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>During the cell cycle, the cell progresses through a series of stages that are associated with various cell cycle events such as replication of genetic materials. Genetic and molecular dissections have revealed that the cell cycle is regulated by a network of interacting molecules that produces oscillatory dynamics. The major cell cycle regulators have been identified previously in different species and the activity of these regulators oscillates. However, the question of how cell cycle regulators coordinate different cell cycle events during the cell cycle remains controversial. Here, we investigate this question in a model bacterial system for cell cycle, <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>. We perturb the expression of the master cell cycle regulator <italic>ctrA</italic> in a pulsatile fashion and quantify the response of the cell cycle to such perturbations. The measured response is contradictory to the existing mechanism of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cell cycle control, which views the cell cycle progression as a sequential activation/inhibition process. We propose a new model that involves coupling of multiple oscillators and show the quantitative agreement between this new model and our measurements. We expect this procedure to be generalized and applied to a broad range of systems to obtain information that complements that obtained from other methods.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The regulatory network that coordinates oscillating periods of growth, chromosome replication, and division is among the most important in a cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Morgan1">[1]</xref>. It is emerging that the cell cycle network, like others, is organized into functional modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Morgan1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Jonas1">[5]</xref>. Each module is sequentially activated or inhibited by key cell cycle regulatory proteins, whose concentrations oscillate with the same period to ensure irreversibility and a “once-per-cell-cycle” occurrence of each process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Morgan1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-McAdams1">[2]</xref>. However, in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes there is increasing evidence that internal regulatory modules (i.e., a set of chemical reactions associated with a key sub-function of the overall cell cycle) can run autonomously. For example, in the bacterium <italic>C. crescentus</italic> several rounds of chromosome replication can occur under conditions where activity of the master cell cycle regulator CtrA is largely suppressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Quon1">[6]</xref>, and certain <italic>C. crescentus</italic> mutants can undergo multiple cell constrictions within one cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Din1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Poggio1">[9]</xref>. In budding yeast, cell cycle modules such as budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Haase1">[10]</xref>, transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Orlando1">[11]</xref>, centrosome replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Balczon1">[12]</xref>, and Cdc14 localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Lu1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Manzoni1">[13]</xref> can run independently of Cdk activity. This raises the question of how individual modules interact to generate robust sequences of events.</p>
      <p>The interactions defining the connectivity of a regulatory network, such as that controlling the cell cycle, can be dissected in a traditional manner by functional reconstitution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Hartwell1">[14]</xref>. However, this does not provide information about the integrated dynamics of the interacting network as a whole. Alternatively, by applying appropriate perturbations to an intact network, one can determine the dynamics of the response of one or more measureable parameters and infer global properties of the network that underlie a given process. We refer to this as probing the topology of the functional relations of the network. Such an approach is analogous to circuit analysis in electrical engineering and time-resolved spectroscopies employed in chemistry and physics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Nelles1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Mukamel1">[16]</xref>. Here we report a periodic perturbation approach that provides insight into the systems-level control features of a bacterial cell cycle.</p>
      <p>Specifically, we study <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> because its cell cycle regulatory network has been well-characterized both genetically and biochemically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Laub1">[17]</xref> and quantitative models have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Shen1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Lin1">[20]</xref>. The life cycle of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> begins as a non-reproductive motile swarmer cell, with chromosome replication inhibited by the cell cycle master regulator CtrA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Laub2">[21]</xref> binding to the replication origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Quon1">[6]</xref>. The <italic>C. crescentus</italic> swarmer cell then differentiates into a reproductive sessile stalked cell (i.e., the mother); this cell differentiation event is concomitant with proteolytic clearing of CtrA from the cell. The stalked cell then commences DNA replication, cell growth, FtsZ ring formation, and membrane fission to yield a daughter swarmer cell and regenerate the mother stalked cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Brown1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref> left). While swarmer progeny remain in a gap-like phase prior to differentiation, the stalked progeny can continue to reproduce for tens of generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Lin1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-SiegalGaskins1">[23]</xref>. Thus the stalked cell behaves as a self-sustained oscillator. The CtrA concentration profile during the stalked cell cycle, shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>, is low in the early stalked cell, reaches a maximum at the late-predivisional stage, then decreases rapidly in the stalked compartment (post-constriction) prior to initiation of a successive round of reproduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Laub1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Domian1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Jacobs1">[25]</xref></p>

          <title>Schematic for phase locking the stalked <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cell division cycle by periodically perturbing <italic>ctrA</italic> expression.</title>
          <p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>C. crescentus</italic> stalked cell cycle is driven by oscillating concentration of the master regulator protein, CtrA. The cell cycle begins with low CtrA concentration, allowing initiation of chromosome replication. CtrA levels then rise gradually, accompanied by cell growth and division. Cytoplasmic compartmentalization at the pre-divisional stage triggers the rapid proteolysis of CtrA, initiating another round of stalked cell division. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of phase locking. (Left) The expression of exogenous <italic>ctrA</italic> (in a mutant lacking endogenous <italic>ctrA</italic>) is controlled by a periodic inducer pulse train which oscillates between two discrete levels (Low and High), which then phase locks the dividing stalked cells on the surface of a microfludic flow channel (lower micrograph) as schematized on the right.</p>

      <p>The design of our experiment is as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). In contrast to knockout experiments that completely eliminate an element of a regulatory network, we seek to quantitatively perturb the expression of a molecule and analyze the resulting change in system dynamics. To this end, we engineer a mutant strain that lacks <italic>ctrA</italic> and then introduce a xylose-inducible <italic>ctrA</italic> on a plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Marks1">[26]</xref>. It is important to note that this strain (with the plasmid) grows and divides in an essentially normal fashion in the presence of constant xylose concentration (≥0.9×10<sup>−4</sup>%, w/v; Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref>). This is made possible by the fact that the active form of CtrA is the phosphorylated protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Domian1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Jacobs1">[25]</xref>, which can still oscillate even though the gene is transcribed at a constant rate. We then use a microfluidic device to toggle between low and high levels of xylose. Although the inducer concentrations are such that the protein should always be present at levels that permit division, the periodic pulses of expression must indirectly increase the amount of phosphorylated protein because they cause division to synchronize. We measure division times of single cells and use them to determine the advance or delay of the cell cycle as a function of its phase when a pulse arrives. This response defines the phase resetting curve (PRC), which informs a mathematical analysis that reveals two important insights into the cell-cycle network: (i) it comprises functional modules that oscillate autonomously and (ii) the coupling between these units is highly asymmetric such that CtrA acts to brake rather than drive the cell cycle. We validate this model by quantitative comparison with independent experimental data. We discuss molecular mechanisms for realizing the elucidated functional features and their potential biological advantages.</p>

        <title>Validation of the experimental construct</title>
        <p>As discussed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>, we examine the quantitative change in division times in response to pulses in CtrA in a <italic>C. crescentus ctrA</italic> mutant strain with a xylose-inducible copy of <italic>ctrA</italic>. Unless otherwise indicated, we switch between xylose levels of 0.9×10<sup>−4</sup>% (w/v) and 0.03%. To ensure that CtrA was not limiting, we first measured inter-division times for <italic>fixed</italic> xylose levels. The strain is viable for xylose concentrations ≥0.9×10<sup>−4</sup>%. The mean inter-division time at 0.9×10<sup>−4</sup>% xylose is 68.1±15.6 min (N = 5160 cell division events; temperature = 32.0°C), which is comparable to the wild-type, although it should be noted that the noise (standard deviation/mean) is larger (<bold>Figure S1</bold> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>In the periodic experiment, we stimulate a population of surface attached stalked cells cultured in a Y-shaped microfluidic device <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Lin1">[20]</xref> with a pulse train that alternates between low and high xylose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref> left, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>). We explored a range of external pulse periods that was centered about the mean intrinsic cell-cycle time (i.e., 68.1 min). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> shows the results obtained with pulses of 15 min high xylose (0.03%) and 50 min low xylose concentration (0.9×10<sup>−4</sup>%) (i.e., external oscillator period is 65 min). The entrainment of the cell cycle to this external periodic pulse train can be readily visualized in the growth curve that is constructed from the measured single cell divisions, only counting progeny of the original stalked cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref> upper panel; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><bold>Methods</bold></xref>). The linear growth of the initial portion of the curve is due to asynchronous division, and the subsequent stepwise growth corresponds to synchronous division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Campbell1">[27]</xref>. Similar synchronization was recently realized for synthetic genetic oscillators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-MondragonPalomino1">[28]</xref>. Here, the synchronization confirms that the pulses in (initially non-phosphorylated and thus inactive) CtrA are sufficient to perturb the cell cycle and serve as the basis for phase resetting. This observation is consistent with the idea that the active form of CtrA follows the overall CtrA protein level closely owing to rapid phosphorylation during the stalked cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Domian1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Jacobs1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Jacobs2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Chen1">[30]</xref>.</p>

The dispersion from a line for divisions at negative time in this reference frame (i.e., reading to the left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>) shows the intrinsic noise in the cell cycle.

        <title>The cell cycle is more readily delayed than advanced</title>
        <p>Consistent with the frequency response above, our experimental PRCs demonstrate that the cell cycle response to CtrA pulsation exhibits greater delay than advance. This asymmetry is our main experimental result. Our finding is surprising considering the measured CtrA temporal concentration profile, which has a slow rise and a rapid fall (∼70 min and ∼10 min, respectively, under conditions with a stalked cell period of ∼80 min) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Holtzendorff1">[33]</xref>. Perturbation pulses that occur during the rise will tend to advance the CtrA oscillation, while pulses applied during the fall will tend to delay the CtrA oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>). The slow rise and rapid fall should thus favor advance over delay. A mathematical model that is based on current molecular knowledge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Li1">[19]</xref> also exhibits a much more pronounced advance than delay, regardless of the choice of parameters (<bold>Figure S9</bold> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref>). The behavior of the molecular model can be understood as follows. CtrA accumulates during the stalked phase and peaks at the pre-divisional stage. This accumulation positively feeds to a proteolytic system that rapidly turns over CtrA within a short time. In this way, the different modules function like gears in a machine—there is no clutch to allow variable coupling between the “engine” and “transmission”, and cell division is locked to CtrA oscillation.</p>
        <p>The CtrA-dependent PRCs that we obtained from our measurements are inconsistent with an explicit gear-like mechanism (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). Corroborating this idea, the strict concentration dependence of a gear-like mechanism would predict that a decreased amplitude of the regulatory signal should either block or delay cell cycle events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Lu1">[4]</xref>. Indeed, in the above mathematical model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Li1">[19]</xref>, a reduced <italic>ctrA</italic> induction level leads to a reduced amplitude of its oscillation and a longer period. However, we showed that <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells yield similar reproduction cycle time distributions for a wide range of constant inducer concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Lin1">[20]</xref> (<bold>Figure S1</bold> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref>). Furthermore, the fact that the functional modules of the regulatory network need not all move forward at the same pace and can even run independent of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Quon1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Poggio1">[9]</xref> suggests that coupling of multiple (autonomous) oscillators is a fundamental feature of the system.</p>

        <p>We test the model and the elucidated coupling function by using it, without further modification, to compute the measured PRC obtained with 10-min pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g004"><bold>Figure 4C–D</bold></xref>). This is a non-trivial test since the 10-min-pulse PRC is not a simple scalar multiple of the 15-min-pulse PRC. We see that the agreement is excellent. Crucially, the model captures the fact that the asymmetry between delay and advance is less pronounced for 10-min pulses. An additional prediction of this coupled oscillator model is that the cell cycle will become more gear-like with stronger coupling and less gear-like with weaker coupling. Indeed, weakening the coupling by lowering the amplitude of the first oscillator by decreasing the <italic>ctrA</italic> induction level reduces the coherence of the second oscillator output due to the presence of increased noise (i.e., the ratio of standard deviation of the cell inter-division time distribution over mean inter-division time increases, <bold>Figure S1</bold> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref>).

        <p>The present study is an important step beyond the recent work using simple synthetic biological oscillators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-MondragonPalomino1">[28]</xref> because we can exploit the dynamics to learn about the natural organization of the cell cycle and its design principles. Our findings are congruent with the recent observation that DnaA activity, which controls DNA replication, oscillates independently of CtrA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Jonas1">[5]</xref>, and, more generally, the “phase-locking” model proposed by Lu and Cross for budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Lu1">[4]</xref>.

Corroborating this picture, periodic <italic>CLN3</italic> expression indicates that certain checkpoints in the yeast cell cycle can be abolished <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Charvin1">[38]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Given that the coupled-oscillator topology appears in the cell cycle control of multiple organisms, it is important to consider its implications and functional advantages. While the CtrA module is often viewed as the “engine” of the cell cycle, our results show that it cannot significantly accelerate division; rather, it appears to function more like a brake, slowing downstream events. This could be important for ensuring coordination of the many processes that contribute to the cell cycle. The asymmetric, diode-like, coupling function in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref> will also affect the propagation of noise from the upstream module to the downstream one. To show this, we added white noise terms to both oscillators in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002778.e002"><bold>Eq. (1)</bold></xref>. The upstream (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) noise propagates to the downstream (observed) phase through asymmetric coupling, giving rise to a skewed distribution in the (unperturbed) division times (<bold>Figure S12</bold> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref>). To reproduce the experimental distribution, the upstream noise needs to be ∼10-fold greater than the downstream noise (<bold>Figure S12</bold> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1a</xref>nd <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref>). Thus, the coupled-oscillator topology filters perturbations/fluctuations that advance the CtrA oscillator phase. This reduction in noise, in turn, would prevent premature division. In addition, it would be also interesting to investigate the robustness and stability of this coupled-oscillator model through systematic non-equilibrium theoretical frameworks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Wang1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Dickson1">[41]</xref>.</p>

Colonies were grown overnight without kanamycin selection to allow recombination, counter-selected on a sucrose containing plate, and then tested on a kanamycin plate to ensure the loss of kanamycin resistance. The successful recombinant was screened by the adhesion phenotype with the 96-well crystal violet assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Marks1">[26]</xref>, and confirmed by PCR amplification (MEN-SNP-70 primers, <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TCCCGGTCCAGTTTCAGC</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAGTACGCGGTGGCTTCG</named-content>) and restriction enzyme digestion with AvaI and BstNI.

        <p>Y-shaped microfluidic channels with rectangular cross-section (150 µm width×50 µm height) were fabricated by rapid phototyping in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Duffy1">[52]</xref>. The PDMS and a microscope coverslip (No. 1.5) were plasma cleaned and then pressed and sealed to form Y channels with inlet and outlet ports in the PDMS. Each device contains multiple channels allowing simultaneous measurements under different conditions. Teflon tubing connectors (constructed with i.d. 0.028″/o.d. 0.048″ tubing and i.d. 0.045″/o.d. 0.062″ tubing) plugged with i.d. 0.012″/o.d. 0.030″ tubing were connected to ports and used for solution exchange. Before loading the bacterial cell culture, the channel was sequentially rinsed with NaOH (2M), ethanol, and autoclaved H<sub>2</sub>O. After thermal equilibration inside the heated microscope enclosure and incubator, the channel was loaded with the bacterial cell culture. Generally, ∼1 hr incubation for FC1006 or ∼30 min incubation for FC1071 is necessary for a sufficient number of single cells to become attached onto the glass surface of the channel. Two computer-controlled syringe pumps (PHD2000, Harvard Apparatus) that are also inside the heated (thermostated) microscope incubator were used to pump two thermally equilibrated PYE media with low and high xylose concentrations through the channel at a constant flow rate (10 µL/min) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Lin1">[20]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Time-lapse microscopy</title>
        <p>Time-lapse single-cell measurements were performed on an automated inverted microscope (Olympus X70) equipped with a motorized sample stage, an objective motor driver and a controller (BioPrecision stage and MAC5000 controller, Ludl Electronics). DIC microscopy was done with an Olympus UPLSAPO 100× oil objective and a light-emitting diode (LED) light source which is pulse-modulated (LEDC19 LED and LEDD1 driver, Thorlabs). The control pulse for the LED was generated from a PCI-DAQ card (PCI-6052E, National Instrument) through a BNC adaptor interface (BNC-2090, National Instrument). The image was collected on a charge-coupled digital camera (CCD, LCL-902C, Watec) with total magnification of 100×. To ensure thermal stability, most of the microscope (except for the observation ports) as well as the syringe pumps were enclosed by a home-made acrylic microscope enclosure (28″×25″×18″) heated with a heater fan (HGL419, Omega), and the temperature was maintained at 32°C by a proportional integral derivative temperature controller (the “incubator” mentioned above; CSC32J, Omega). A uniform temperature profile inside the incubator is achieved by active air flow from two small-profile heaters inside the enclosure.</p>
        <p>DIC images of multiple fields-of-view were recorded at 2 frames/min and the focus was adjusted automatically by a total-internal-reflection (TIR) based autofocusing control loop. The back-reflected beam of a TIR-aligned 633 nm laser (LHRP-0081, Research Electro-Optics) impinges on a quadrant photodiode detector. The amplified difference signal is the error signal that is used as a feedback for adjustment of the objective (motor) position. A Virtual Instrument routine (LabView 7.0, National Instrument) was used to control all the components (i.e., sample stage, autofocus, pumps, CCD, and LED) and run the experiment for extended (&gt;20 hrs) periods of time.</p>

        <title>Data analysis and construction of population growth curves</title>
        <p>The stack of acquired DIC images was loaded into ImageJ (NIH) and the division events of individual cells were tracked manually and recorded by a home-made plug-in. Cells that grew into long filaments or stopped reproduction were excluded from the analysis. The division event data was imported into Matlab (MathWorks) and processed. A typical periodic perturbation data set contained &gt;200 cells.

        <p>Growth curves were constructed from the division event data for individual cells. Each observed division contributes to a unit increase in the population size. Since we only followed continuous reproduction of the initial population of stalked cells on the glass surface, the total number of cells generated by this population of cells can be represented by the differential equation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of total number of cells as a function of time, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the division time of cells.

        <title>Construction of phase difference distribution and characterization of synchrony</title>
        <p>The phase difference is defined as the temporal difference between the time of each cell division event (i.e., each dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>) and the start time of the subsequent high inducer pulse (depicted in <bold>Figure S3a</bold> inset in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref>). Without dispersion in the population, a single phase difference is present for a phase locking condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Winfree1">[32]</xref>. However, the existence of noise leads to a distribution of phases for the population under phase locking. To construct this distribution, we included division events between the start times of two successive high inducer pulses for periodic perturbations with an external period longer than 65 min; and for external periods shorter or equal to 65 min, we included division events between the end times of two successive high inducer pulses.</p>
        <p>The synchronization index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Tass1">[31]</xref> is calculated based on the phase difference distribution, which is based on the Shannon Entropy: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the probability at each state and <italic>N</italic> is the number of bins. <italic>SI</italic> ranges from 0 (uniform phase distribution) to 1 (singular phase occupation).

        <title>Construction of experimental phase response curves from cell division times</title>
        <p>With the assumption that phase responses of individual cell cycle oscillators are independent of the pulse number (which is validated in the <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref></bold>), we constructed the phase response curve from the data of all pulses in each constant pulse period experiment. The scattered data (<bold>Figure S3B</bold> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref>) within a chosen bin range (i.e., 2 min as represented by the gray bar) were used to construct perturbed cell cycle time distributions (insets). For the distributions which are obviously truncated due to data sampling limitations, we used the center of the fitted Gaussian as the perturbed cell cycle time; while for other distributions, the arithmetic mean values are used instead as the reset cell cycle time.</p>
        <p>By this approach, we obtained a set of phase response data (i.e. phase vs. perturbed cell cycle time) for each <italic>t<sub>H</sub></italic>. The results for <italic>t<sub>H</sub></italic> = 10 min and 15 min are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002778-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref> <bold>and Figure S2</bold> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002778.s001">Text S1</xref>, where the perturbed cell cycle time is converted to phase advance or delay and the phase difference in minutes is scaled to be between 0 to 1 by the mean native cell cycle time at low inducer concentration (68.1 min). The missing data points for phase approaching unity are due to the finite width of high inducer concentration pulse. The phase response data at the minimum phase (i.e., phase = 0.011) are duplicated to indicate the periodic nature of phase response curves (i.e., these data are duplicated at phase = 1.011). These data are then fit with a trigonometric polynomial of degree three to ensure periodicity:<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> The fit parameters (a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c) for phase response curves at <italic>t<sub>H</sub></italic> = 10 and 15 min are (5.58725, 1.05375, −0.03266, 1.585, 1.29886, 0.69753, 0.72275) and (8.41916, 1.60012, −0.32122, 1.7194, 2.57242, 1.06958, −0.87352), respectively.</p>

We estimate the sensitivity function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the gene regulatory network of the CtrA module <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Lin1">[20]</xref>; more precisely, in numerical practice, we approximate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as constant over the duration of the pulse, with its value given by the published function at the phase when the pulse begins. The specific choice of the model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002778-Lin1">[20]</xref> does not significantly affect the result. In determining the coupling function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as described in the Results and Discussion, we first analyze the steady-state solution in the case when there is a single pulse by assuming that: (1) <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are equal to each other and (2) the effect of a pulse on the first oscillator is equally distributed throughout its duration. If the response of the first oscillator to the pulse is small and the steady-state is stable, the second oscillator will maintain the initial phase difference <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If the response of the first oscillator to the pulse is large, the second oscillator can be displaced to a new stable solution <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The criterion for a solution to be stable is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Because we do not observe discontinuous responses in the experiments, we conclude that the response of the first oscillator is not strong enough to allow solutions other than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002778.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.
